-- boy with stutter stops talking for ten years before going on to become one of the most revered voices in cinema history
it is a script @entity7 would have been proud to pen
but there was no need as this is the story of @entity11 , arguably the most well - known voice in modern cinema
the voice behind @entity16 's mask in the " @entity18 " trilogy told @entity0 's @entity19 that from the ages of five to 14 he barely spoke a word
" i stuttered so badly i gave up talking , " @entity11 said
he remembers the misery his condition caused him and says he is indebted to an @entity25 teacher who helped give him the confidence to start speaking again
" we were reading great literature , and the idea of being able to say those words really inspired me
i never expected to be able to write things like that , but i did want to enjoy saying them
" although his father was an actor the idea of acting had not occurred to the teenage @entity11 he says
" but the @entity25 teacher encouraged me saying : ' if you like the words you 've got to be able to say them '
that 's what started it
" despite voicing one of the most famous villains in film history , @entity11 kept quiet about his contribution until @entity16 was killed in " @entity47 " -- the final installment of the original " @entity18 " trilogy
he says it was fun to keep everyone guessing
" it became a big mystery -- ' who was that inside the mask ? ' " he said
" they used to say it sounds like @entity58 [ the @entity59 actor who famously starred in the 1973 @entity61 film " @entity62 " ]
and i would say yes it does
@entity58 has a slight @entity59 accent
it was more fun denying it than it was admitting it until the episode where @entity16 dies
then i accepted credit for it
" @entity11 has starred or voiced in more than 100 films as well as being the voice of the @entity0 network but he is currently enjoying a highly successful return to the stage
the @entity76 - winning actor has been playing the role of @entity78 in @entity80 classic drama " @entity78 " since 2008
the show ran on @entity83 's @entity82 for nealy two years before transferring to the @entity84 in @entity86 's @entity85 in november last year .
