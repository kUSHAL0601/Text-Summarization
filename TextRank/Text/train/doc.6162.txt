a @entity2 etching that was anonymously donated to @entity3 fetched $ 21,005 in an online auction , the nonprofit said tuesday
the money will fund 12 scholarships to provide job training to people with disabilities and disadvantages , said @entity11 , spokeswoman for @entity3 in @entity12 , @entity13
the buyer , identified only as an @entity16 man by @entity3 , said that he and his wife are interested in @entity2 's work
" we saw the @entity2 on the news and thought it would be a great way to add to our collection while supporting a great cause , " he said in a statement
" we donate to goodwill all the time and are very happy that our purchase is helping those in need
" earlier this month , an anonymous donor dropped off the framed @entity2 piece at the @entity3 facility in @entity32 , @entity13
the work by the master surrealist is a colored etching , and the framed piece even features the familiar @entity2 motif of a melting watch placed on the wrist of a pointing hand
its title is " reflection " or " reflections , " from " @entity46 , " and the art is signed by @entity2 and numbered " 126/150
" the work is also labeled as an " etching and photolithography from collage
" @entity3 auctioned the art on its website , and bidding ended monday night
@entity3 does n't know who the donor is
he or she managed to sneak away during a busy time at the drop - off facility , the organization said
but the donor kept intact the back of the frame , which contained an envelope with a certificate of authenticity and registration number from a defunct gallery in @entity67 , @entity68
an appraiser retained by @entity3 also confirmed the authenticity of the @entity2 , and the charitable organization also ensured the art had not been stolen , @entity11 said
the nonprofit provides employment and training programs to people with disabilities and disadvantages , and the group sells donated goods in more than 2,600 stores
goodwill held on to the @entity2 for a week in case someone claimed it had been donated accidentally , @entity11 said
" we do n't know the background of what the circumstances were , " @entity11 said of the donation
" it 's a steady stream of people coming in
it 's not necessarily documented what every person comes in with
" about 74 million people in the @entity96 and @entity97 donate annually to @entity3 , @entity11 said
most donated goods are sold at @entity98 , but prizes such as the @entity2 are auctioned online to maximize their value , said @entity101 , who works for @entity3 's online department in @entity32
the @entity2 was the highlight of @entity101 's past six years of working for the nonprofit , in addition to her two years of service in the 1970s , she said
but the @entity2 piece is not the most prized art auctioned by @entity3 : a @entity110 oil painting , dated 1924 and also donated anonymously , was sold online by @entity3 in 2006 for $ 165,002 .
