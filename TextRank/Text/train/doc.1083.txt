editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers
@entity19 ( @entity9 ) -- the @entity21 seaside town of @entity22 was once the no.1 holiday destination for working - class @entity25 families
in the 1960s it would attract 17 million of them a year , until cheap , all - inclusive holidays to @entity29 cut their business in half
they called it " the @entity38 of @entity39 " because of its bright lights and reputation for bawdy thrills
these days the town makes most of its money from old people and " stag and hen " nights -- drunken pre-nuptial parties with half - naked gangs of drunken lads and lasses falling in and out of strip clubs , sex shops , bars and brothels
they stumble past gift shops selling novelties concerned with sexual organs , like pens shaped like penises and coffee mugs with breasts on them
the town 's like a @entity25 version of @entity8 's @entity65 , with miles of rundown old buildings , tattered and torn and closed - down shops
the unpredictability of the @entity25 summer is never kind to @entity22 , and during winter months the place is a ghost town
the wind that blows in from the @entity73 is perishingly cold
the large amount of cheap bed - and - breakfast hotels in the town attracts a very transient population , a noticeable portion of whom are young men and women in the grips of addictions to heroin
other residents of @entity22 town center include students who work in the amusement arcades and bars , and there 's a sizeable proportion of aged pensioners who 've retired there
in january 2009 , i went up there with @entity96 , with whom i made " @entity97 , " and we spent a week with @entity96 's aunt and uncle in their b&b , getting to know the residents of @entity22 as much as we could
we met old ladies , adult entertainers , clowns , drug addicts , donkey ride operators , criminals and some of the people who run the town 's burgeoning sex shop trade
the other businesses that are doing well are the shops who sell the cut - price alcohol , which are putting @entity22 's pubs out of business
you could be forgiven for thinking this documentary -- set in january 2009 against the spectre of the bleakest economic climate the western world has had in living memory -- is one of the most depressing you could ever watch , but there 's a magic about @entity22 that lies in the resilience of its inhabitants and how they 're clinging onto the traditional seaside values that once made them the " @entity131 " of @entity25 holiday - making
see the rest of @entity22 at @entity9
