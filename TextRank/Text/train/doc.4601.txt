-- " @entity9 's " @entity0 may have cleverly dodged authorities during his career as a drug kingpin , but his action figure has n't dodged the wrath of a @entity8 mother
@entity10 , a mother from @entity11 , launched a petition in early october to have @entity0 -- and other " @entity9 " action figures -- removed from @entity14
as of monday morning , the @entity16 request has received more than 2,000 signatures
in the petition , @entity10 -- who wrote the appeal under the name " @entity20 " -- gets right to the point
" @entity14 is well known around the world for their vast selection of toys for children of all ages , " she wrote
" however their decision to sell a @entity9 doll , complete with a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth , alongside children 's toys is a dangerous deviation from their family friendly values
" in an interview with @entity1 affiliate @entity39 , @entity10 expanded on her thoughts
" kids mimic their action figures , if you will , " she told the station
" do you want your child in an orange jumpsuit ? " signers to her petition agree
" it 's sick that a company would design kids toys that glorify the making of meth
it 's just as sick to sell them , " wrote @entity55
" while i support free enterprise and there may be a market for these figures , this is a children 's toy store , " said @entity58
" it should n't even be a question that this is inappropriate
not a smart move @entity14
" the action figures include @entity0 -- the chemistry teacher turned meth lord -- and his assistant , @entity72 , in hazmat suits , as well as @entity74 as his gun - toting alter ego , @entity77
it 's not " @entity9 " itself , @entity10 hastens to add
she says she was a fan of the show
" i thought the show was great , " she said
" but she draws the line at seeing the characters in @entity14
her goal ? " just to get those taken off the shelf and put them in an appropriate store
" " @entity9 " star @entity90 , who played @entity0 , responded jokingly to @entity10 's movement
" ' @entity8 mom petitions against @entity14 over breaking bad action figures
' i 'm so mad , i 'm burning my @entity8 @entity95 action figure in protest , " he tweeted
@entity14 has yet to respond to a @entity1 query
in a statement to @entity100 , the toy giant said , " the products you reference are carried in very limited quantities and the product packaging clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up
items from this tv series are located in the adult action figure area of our stores
