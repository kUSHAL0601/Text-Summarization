@entity0 -- a @entity3 chapter of the @entity4 has applied to " adopt " a stretch of highway in @entity8 , @entity3 , according to paperwork obtained by @entity1 on monday
the application , which would allow the white supremacy group to receive state recognition for cleaning up a one - mile portion of a highway , was filed by the @entity14 on may 21
if the @entity15 accepts the application , the @entity4 would be responsible for cleaning litter on a part of @entity19 in the @entity20 near the @entity22 border
" all we want to do is adopt a highway , " said @entity23 , the chapter 's secretary
" we 're not doing it for publicity
we 're doing it to keep the mountains beautiful
people throwing trash out on the side of the road ... that ai n't right
" @entity36 , a @entity3 @entity37 spokeswoman , confirmed the application but said , " the department is deferring comment beyond that , however , until a resolution is determined
" reader feels dirty for agreeing with @entity4 @entity37 officials will discuss the matter monday with representatives from the state attorney general 's office , she said
@entity23 told @entity1 she did n't know anything about that meeting but said the group is supposed to meet with the @entity37 at some point
state rep. @entity52 , @entity0 , has been working against the group 's adoption application , she said
" we 're not racists , " @entity23 said monday
" we just want to be with white people
if that 's a crime , then i do n't know
it 's all right to be black and @entity60 and proud , but you ca n't be white and proud
i do n't understand it
" a similar request in @entity64 set off a legal battle that stretched for years and went all the way to the @entity68 @entity67
a @entity4 chapter sought to adopt a portion of @entity71
a federal appeals court ruled the state could not bar the @entity4 from participating in the program , and the high court declined to review the case , letting that ruling stand
however , the @entity79 eventually kicked the @entity4 out of the program because members were not picking up trash as agreed , spokesman @entity78 said monday
the state also named the stretch of @entity71 after civil rights activist @entity85 , according to the @entity86
@entity3 has been participating in the @entity87 for more than 20 years
the program provides advertising for sponsors who agree to clean a stretch of road on a sign posted along the stretch
" any civic - minded organization , business , individual , family , city , county , state , or federal agency is welcome to volunteer in the @entity105 , " the @entity37 website says
there is no charge to sponsors , @entity36 said
" we provide the safety vest and materials to collect the trash
we provide what 's needed to do the program ... their contribution is the labor
" @entity23 said the group is more than 100 strong
" we have a lot of support , " she said
" i do n't see why we ca n't ( adopt the stretch of highway ) , " she said
" would it be any different if it was the @entity124 or something ? someone always has some kind of race card
" on its website , the @entity14 says it is " fed up with the @entity131 tyranny and oppression of @entity133 , and the time was ripe for @entity135
" the @entity136 , which monitors hate groups , lists the @entity4 as " the most infamous -- and oldest -- of @entity68 hate groups
" " over the years since it was formed in december 1865 , the @entity4 has typically seen itself as a @entity142 organization , although in modern times klan groups are motivated by a variety of theological and political ideologies , " the law center 's website says
" we 're not a hate group , " @entity23 insisted monday
" we do n't hate anybody
we 're just white people that want to stick with white people
the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) wants to stick with black people
just because i 'm white , i ca n't stick with my own group ? " @entity1 's @entity156 and @entity157 contributed to this report .
