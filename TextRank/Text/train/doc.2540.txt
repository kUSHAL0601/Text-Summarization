-- it sounds far too good to be true : a salary of more than $ 100,000 , a free home on a palm - fringed island and all the snorkeling you can be bothered with
the successful applicant will have plenty of time to explore the @entity9
however , it is true and a very clever marketing ploy to boot
@entity13 's @entity12 has garnered worldwide media coverage by advertising the " best job in the world " -- the post of caretaker on @entity19 in the @entity9
the six - month contract , according to @entity12 , comes with flexible working hours and the successful applicant 's " key responsibilities " include exploring the area to discover what is on offer and to report back weekly via blogs , photo diaries , video updates and media interviews
sounds taxing does n't it ? the group said other responsibilities would include cleaning the pool , which comes with your free home , feeding the fish and collecting the mail ( this would be done by joining the aerial postal service for a day or two to get a good view of the neighboring islands )
you might also take time out from your busy schedule to check out the turtles and passing whales
on top of the six - figure salary you 'll get return airfares from your nearest capital city , transport on the island , travel insurance , computer and camera gear and travel to other islands in the @entity9
no academic qualifications are required but you must be a good swimmer and enjoy snorkeling , be adventurous and have good communication skills
where do i sign up i hear you ask ? @entity12 is asking for a 60 - second video explanation of why you 'd be great for the job and that you fill out their online application form at @entity70 applications close on february 22 , by which time you may be able to get on the web site -- unsurprisingly it is proving very hard to load at the moment ( not that i 'm trying ... that often )
