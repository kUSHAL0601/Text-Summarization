-- @entity1 may have warranted a reputation for playing through the pain barrier but surely not appendicitis
the world number two has apparently been struggling with the condition in the build - up to this week 's @entity8
but whereas mere mortals might seek out their sick bed , @entity1 has somewhat surprisingly instead opted to take to the court
the @entity12 did at least attend a hospital in the @entity15 city on sunday after complaining of stomach problems and was treated with a course of antibiotics
but with just two days of rest , he returned to action against countryman @entity21 wednesday and was unsurprisingly below par -- losing the match in straight sets 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 despite a spirited second - set fightback despite his ailment
" for sure i do n't feel perfect , " said @entity1 following the defeat , only his third to @entity21 in 11 years
" it 's the same way i felt before , a little bit dizzy now but that 's it
nothing that i have to worry about
" when you lose a match , it 's not the moment to talk about obvious things
i lost , @entity21 played better than me
" @entity1 could be forgiven for feeling cursed
the previous tournament in @entity38 last week had been his first since @entity39 because of an on - going wrist injury
having missed much of the season , the 14 - time grand slam winner insisted he had no plans to cut short his season to deal with his latest setback
" my thoughts are to continue with @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49
it 's true that the past few months i did not have the best of luck
i did n't have the best of luck since @entity39
" i was playing a good year , very positive year
after that i was unlucky with the wrist , what 's going on now
but there remains three more tournaments for me
" @entity1 will consult with his doctor on his return to @entity62 to ascertain when he might require surgery on his appendix , doctors in @entity66 having told him " sooner or later i have to take it out
" while @entity1 is struggling through his latest setback , world number one @entity68 is at the top of his form and won his 50th match of the @entity75 season world no. 1 @entity68 clinched his 50th win of the season wednesday as he beat rising star @entity79 , 6 - 3 6 - 4
the @entity80 extended his unbeaten run in @entity15 to 26 matches
he is the defending champion in @entity66 and won last week 's tournament in @entity38
@entity84 , beaten by @entity68 in the semifinals in the @entity15 capital , also advanced as he saw off @entity87 of @entity88 7 - 5 6 - 2
but @entity90 's @entity89 exited to @entity92 hopeful @entity91 , the @entity93 winner going down 7 - 6 6 - 4 in their second round match
@entity97 @entity96 , like @entity84 and @entity89 hoping to seal a place in the end of season @entity100 in @entity49 , also went out to @entity102 @entity101 in straight sets , beaten 7 - 5 6 - 3
in the final match on court wednesday , @entity104 narrowly avoided going the same way , taken to a third set tiebreak by @entity110 's @entity109
the third seeded @entity112 maestro saved five match points -- the first two coming at 4 - 5 in the third set , the other three in the tiebreak before -- before completing a 7 - 5 3 - 6 7 - 6 victory in two hours 42 minutes
@entity104 once saved seven match points in a match against @entity119 in 2003 before going on to win and after his latest escape has reached the third round where he will face @entity122 .
