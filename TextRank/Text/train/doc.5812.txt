it 's one of the most eagerly awaited days of the football calendar with one former legend calling it for be made a public holiday -- but why is this year 's transfer deadline day turning into a damp squib ? transfer deadline day marks the end of the period in which clubs are allowed to sign players -- meaning that once the window ' slams shut ' at 11pm gmt , no further business can be done
there are two windows in each year -- one beginning on july 1 and ending on august 31 and the other starting on january 1 and finishing on the final day of the month unless that day falls on the weekend as it does on this occasion
while most of the business is done during the month long period , the frenetic nature of deadline day means some clubs are left waiting until the final minutes to get their deals done -- leading to masses of excitement , cynicism and often disappointment from fans across social media
supporters stay up late in front of the television awaiting the very latest news from their respective clubs with hopes for a last minute superstar signing becoming increasingly desperate
but this year 's deadline day has been one of the quietest in recent years
last season 's january transfer window was noticeable for several big deals including @entity47 's $ 56million move from @entity48 to @entity49
@entity48 spent $ 32million on midfielder @entity50 on top of bringing in @entity52 and @entity53
but heading into the final day of the transfer window period , the gross spending of the 20 @entity56 clubs stood at £ 80m ( $ 120m )
@entity59 's signing of @entity60 from @entity61 for a fee reported to be in the region of $ 38 million is the biggest of the transfer window in @entity65 so far
@entity66 spent around $ 17m on @entity67 , the @entity68 defender from @entity69 , while @entity70 coughed up $ 13.5m for @entity71 forward @entity72
" while the summer window saw a record level of transfer spending , so far we have seen spending in january being slightly more reserved , " said @entity73 , partner in the @entity74 at @entity75
" however , 2014/15 is still a record season for @entity56 spending , with clubs having spent over £ 900m , significantly ahead of the previous record of £ 760m
" this level of spending has been made possible in large part through the broadcast revenue @entity56 clubs enjoy
with all 20 @entity56 clubs now ranked in the top 40 globally by revenue , we continue to see them use their increased resources to invest in playing talent in the january window
" in @entity65 , the clubs facing relegation from the world 's richest league have been reluctant to throw money at the problem in a bid to ensure survival
there have been a number of loan deals completed but actual transfers are in scarce supply
" i think the surprising thing is that it 's quiet at the lower end of the table , " @entity105 , former @entity106 chief executive and @entity108 football scout , told @entity1
" it 's so tight down there and it 's the last opportunity to do something which can make a great difference
there 's a lot of money and prestige at stake
" for the top clubs it 's trickier because you do n't want to buy players who ca n't play in @entity125
" for @entity126 , i do n't think players currently playing in the @entity125 would come and play for them at the moment
" the window will also close hours before february 3 in @entity131 , @entity132 and the @entity133
in @entity135 , where the window closed on friday , clubs spent $ 79.5 million during the transfer window up from $ 53.7 million at the same time last year
@entity139 's signing of @entity68 midfielder @entity140 from @entity141 for a fee believed to be in the region of $ 14.5 million and @entity108 wonderkid @entity144 took the headlines .
