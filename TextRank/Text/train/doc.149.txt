health screenings to help prevent the spread of @entity2 began saturday for some travelers to @entity5 's @entity4 but an official with the @entity7 warned that nothing can " get the risk to zero
" four other airports will add the screenings thursday , according to the @entity7
this wo n't be a mass event , with long lines of travelers waiting for screening
only about 150 travelers a day will receive the screenings , @entity7 officials said
" no matter how many of these procedures are put into place , we ca n't get the risk to zero , " dr. @entity19 , director of the @entity7 's @entity20 , told reporters saturday
" that will not be the case but this additional layer should add a measure of security to the @entity31 public
this entry screening procedure , for example , would not necessarily have caught the patient in @entity35
" @entity19 was referring to the only case of @entity2 so far diagnosed on @entity31 soil -- that of @entity38 , who did n't have symptoms at the time he arrived in the @entity31
under the program , passengers originating from @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 will be subject to the additional screening
@entity47 corpsmen and eventually medical workers under contract will take the passengers ' temperature and @entity53 staffers will ask questions about their health and possible exposure to @entity2
those suspected of possible @entity2 exposure will be referred to a @entity7 public health officer for additional screening
after the initial run saturday at @entity4 , the testing will expand thursday to @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity65 's @entity64 and @entity66 in @entity67
the five airports , @entity4 included , receive 94 % of air travelers who come from the afflicted countries , according to the @entity7
" the expanded screening measures provide this layer of protection to the already established protocols to minimize the risk of another case of @entity2 here in the @entity31 , " said @entity71 , commissioner of @entity53
@entity71 said travelers with fever or other symptoms or who may have been exposed to @entity2 will be referred to the @entity7 to determine whether they can travel or should be taken to a hospital
in addition , @entity85 agents will monitor travelers for signs of illness
@entity19 said all travelers leaving the affected countries are already being screened with questionnaires about possible exposure and symptoms and having their temperatures checked
" more than 36,000 passengers have been screened with this tool the last two months and not a single @entity2 case has been detected , " he said
reporter 's notebook : why we have n't stopped @entity2 will it help ? some critics of the @entity31 approach say the screenings wo n't do much from a public health perspective
" i think they offer some margin of , i do n't know , peace of mind for the public , " said @entity107 , a senior fellow for global health at the @entity109 and author of " the coming plague
" but she stressed the screenings would not have detected @entity38 's case
" so i see this more as something to calm the nerves of the @entity31 people , the @entity121 people , the @entity122 people , " she said
@entity123 , a former inspector general for the @entity31 @entity124 , said the effort is n't " entirely window dressing , because we have to do something
" " but , " she said , " there 's much more that has to be done to keep people safe
" she says she worries about planes carrying ill passengers who may not be detected until after they get off the flight
by then , the plane may have already been prepared for another flight
health officials have warned the screenings will likely catch some people with fevers , but not @entity2 , and could miss some with @entity2 as symptoms can take up to 21 days to appear
" no exit or entry screening will supplant the need for state and local health departments , for clinicians and for individuals to be aware and to think @entity2 , " @entity19 said
