@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 does n't want to be judged by the clothes she wears , by the religion she follows or , least of all , by where she grew up
but @entity7 , raised by immigrants from @entity9 in the @entity11 suburb of @entity12 , says it 's as if her neighborhood is stamped across her forehead
" it 's hard to dream when everyone says the place you come from only spawns ' jihadists , terrorists and delinquents , ' " the 21 - year - old says
" you end up feeling completely isolated
" @entity12 is just one of the many banlieues -- heavily immigrant , working class suburbs -- dotted around the periphery of the @entity2 capital
but its close proximity to @entity1 has made the neighborhood synonymous with violence and failure
@entity1 is the hometown of @entity34 , who killed a policewoman as well as four hostages at a kosher supermarket in @entity11 two weeks ago
his associates said and @entity39 slaughtered 12 more at the office of the satirical magazine @entity41
together they are the worst terror attacks in @entity2 in decades
@entity7 's concerns were exacerbated this week when @entity2 prime minister @entity44 declared that there was a " geographic , social and ethnic apartheid " that had developed in @entity2
she believes the use of provocative language only further alienates the people living in the banlieues
@entity7 says that the past two weeks have attracted a relentless and unwelcome media spotlight on @entity12 , with journalists descending en masse and filming from their cars for fear of being assaulted or having their equipment stolen
the negative press has dredged up many prejudices and cultural stereotypes that @entity7 has spent most of her young life fighting to dispel -- ever since the 2005 riots that left thousands of cars burnt in the @entity11 region , thousands arrested and millions more traumatized across @entity2
" yes , we need better education and , yes , delinquency exists in these towns , but the government tarnishes us all with the same brush
you stop feeling like an individual and begin to think you 're reduced to a crime - ridden town , " @entity7 says
@entity7 believes the media perpetuates certain cliches about towns like hers -- especially the one about how banlieues are full of " bad apples
" it 's a sentiment shared by @entity34 's sister , @entity82 -- now a successful dancer -- who reflected on the 2005 riots in a 2009 interview with the @entity85
" when you are in the projects , they want you to shut your mouth , to stay here , to grow up complacent
for me , the way that people in the projects are portrayed so negatively in the media really hurt me a lot , " @entity82 told the paper
but @entity96 , the mayor of @entity1 , is trying to shatter this image of banlieues as crime - wracked ghettos
@entity100 grew up in the concrete maze that is the @entity102 -- the same housing project as @entity34
@entity100 says it 's easy to overlook the success stories of the banlieues in favor of tales of homegrown terrorists , but that not everyone from his town is a criminal
" @entity1 was home to a professional football player , an actress , even a patisserie chef who now works in @entity115 , " he says
" these are all very successful people
" in the same breath , the mayor admits that his town faces grave economic problems
forty percent of @entity102 residents aged 16 - 25 are unemployed
the average net annual income in @entity1 is 9,600 euros , according to @entity100 -- the lowest in the @entity11 region
these factors make it very difficult for those who live in the area to feel like they 're part of society , the mayor says
@entity100 has been waging a campaign to get a fully staffed police station for the town 's 30,000 inhabitants
but the @entity135 has yet to grant his wish
the mayor also believes that better education will help bridge the gap between the banlieues and the state , the " us and them " mentality
@entity145 , a schoolteacher in the eastern @entity11 suburb of @entity147 , has a class largely made up of second and third generation immigrant children
a man with a calm demeanor , he believes opening a dialogue with his students on the theme of identity in @entity2 is crucial to helping his students find their place within the state
his main worry is what happens when they leave school and begin job hunting
" because they struggle to find a job , they feel disinherited , stigmatized , and suddenly these young adults ca n't find their role in the workplace and therefore they create their own communities , " he says
@entity171 was @entity34 's social worker
his small office in @entity102 is littered with photos of smiling children that he has helped guide into adulthood
@entity171 believes one of the reasons @entity34 might have formed a relationship with hardened criminals when he was in jail was because he did n't fit into life outside the prison walls , despite desperately wanting to be part of a community
" [ @entity34 ] had a big problem with identity , he was lost
and prison offered him some bad examples to follow , " @entity171 says
@entity34 's cousin @entity190 agrees
" he befriended a bunch of idiots and became himself an idiot , " @entity190 told @entity2 radio @entity191
" he did not hate @entity196 , @entity197 , it 's the state he hated
" connecting the disaffected youth to the state through job creation is what @entity202 has dedicated the last 6 years to
the business he founded , the @entity204 in @entity205 , strives to " reveal the untapped potential of doing business with undeserved entrepreneurs in marginalized neighborhoods
" @entity202 says the negative publicity surrounding the banlieues means companies shy away from recruiting there -- and in turn , this further antagonizes the people of these towns
" we feel like we 're alone , and when we talk about the banlieues we only talk about its problems and never about the opportunity the banlieues represent today , " @entity202 says
" that is crucial to bringing everyone together
" in the meantime , @entity0 is hoping opportunity will come knocking as she pursues an internship this summer
her dream is a career in journalism , but she knows that ambition alone may not be enough
" to have a future you need to believe in yourself , but you also need others to believe in you , " she says .
