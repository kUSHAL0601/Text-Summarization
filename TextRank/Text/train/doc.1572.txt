-- the next time you see a motorist obliviously straddling two lanes , do n't fault bad driving , but genetics
in a study published recently in the journal @entity9 , researcher @entity6 found that people with a certain gene variant performed more than 30 percent worse on a driving test than people without it
the study by @entity6 , a neurology professor at the @entity16 , might also help explain why there are so many bad drivers on @entity20 highways : about 30 percent of @entity20 have the variant
ordinarily , when a person performs a task , a protein called brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( @entity26 ) is secreted to the area of the brain that is associated with that activity
the protein helps facilitate communication among brain cells and helps retain memory
however in people who have the gene variation that @entity6 studied , @entity26 secretion is limited
" these people make more errors from the get - go , and they forget more of what they learned after time away , " @entity6 said in a statement
@entity6 and his team of researchers set out to find how the variant affected driving
they recruited 29 people to drive 15 laps on a simulated course with difficult curves and turns
twenty - two of the participants did not have the gene variant ; seven did
the researchers wanted to see how effectively the participants learned to navigate the twists and turns in each subsequent lap. four days later , they repeated the test
the participants with the variant did worse both times
they also retained less the second go - round
" i 'd be curious to know the genetics of people who get into car crashes , " @entity6 said
" i wonder if the accident rate is higher for drivers with the variant
" unfortunately , a test to determine whether someone has the gene variant is not commercially available .
