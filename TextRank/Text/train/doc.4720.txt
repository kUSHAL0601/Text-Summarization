@entity0 -- 't is the season to publish those year - end predictions
forecasting in any form -- from a sideshow psychic to the @entity6 -- is usually a foolish enterprise
so this is not a crystal ball gaze at the newsmakers that will make the headlines next year
these are the individuals i will be watching from @entity1 's @entity0 newsroom and in the field in 2014
the june 4 protester june 4 , 2014 will be the 25th anniversary of the @entity18 crackdown
in 2013 , tens of thousands of @entity0 residents braved a rainstorm to hold a vigil in the city 's @entity22 to honor the victims and express anger at @entity26
though such protests are banned in mainland @entity29 , the vigil is an annual event in @entity0 , a self - administered region under @entity29 sovereignty
twenty - five years after the crackdown , how many more in @entity0 will observe this major anniversary ? and how will @entity26 respond ? 2
the @entity35 leaker ok , this is a cheat
i 'm not closely following @entity38 himself
honestly , i do n't care about where he 's pushing a shopping cart in @entity43
what i do care about are the yet - to - be - released leaks that will further reveal the size and scope of surveillance efforts by the @entity35
incredibly , @entity50 editor @entity49 says they have published just 1 % of the files leaked by @entity38
in the year ahead , i 'll be looking out for the revelations yielded by the rest of the damning data dump
@entity57 's new hire @entity58 made headlines in august when he ditched @entity60 for @entity57
the big hire was a big moment for the @entity29 smartphone maker , raising expectations that the so - called " @entity67 of @entity29 " would greatly expand its market reach beyond its domestic market
since then , @entity57 has announced plans to launch next year in @entity69
with @entity58 on board , can @entity57 's inexpensive and highly customized @entity71 smartphones find as much favor abroad as at home ? 4
the marshal @entity77 's young leader , @entity76 , remains as perplexing as ever
why did he execute his former trusted mentor and uncle @entity78 ? why did he release @entity81 veteran @entity80 ? and why the soft spot for former @entity84 star @entity83 ? after a year of puzzling and provocative moves -- including missile and nuclear tests -- the marshal has forced the world 's attention on him , raising concerns of more brinksmanship to come
the typhoon survivor in the immediate aftermath of @entity97 , a @entity1 crew encountered @entity98 on the devastated streets of @entity100 -- the capital of the @entity103 province of @entity104
she was crouched among the rubble of what was her home , where she last saw her husband and six children alive
in 2014 , we must remember the victims of @entity112 because after the emergency relief , comes the long task of recovery and rebuilding
we must remember @entity98 and the scores of survivors like her .
