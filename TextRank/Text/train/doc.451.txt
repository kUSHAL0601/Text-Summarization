-- @entity1 is one of @entity3 's @entity2
that 's no surprise to most people : the actress won an @entity7 for " @entity8 " this year and has been popping up on " best dressed " and " most beautiful " lists ever since
@entity9 : a cinderella for everybody nevertheless , she tells the magazine that the attention she 's received has been overwhelming
" right now i 'm still adjusting
i guess i feel catapulted into a different place ; i have a little whiplash , " she said
" i did have a dream to be an actress , but i did n't think about being famous
and i have n't yet figured out how to be a celebrity ; that 's something i 'm learning , and i wish there were a course on how to handle it
" she could n't even imagine what winning the @entity7 would be like , she observed
" i do n't think i will ever be able to really articulate how bizarre it was to hear my name at the @entity7
i 'd watched in my pajamas the year before ! " she said
" i felt numb -- dazed and confused
i remember feeling light -- weightless
more like limbo than cloud nine
" the @entity7 has helped launch her career into the stratosphere
@entity31 has big things ahead , including next year 's " @entity34 " movie
but the actress , who was born in @entity36 of @entity38 parents , mentions that it was n't always so
for her , @entity40 was n't just a role model but a " reference point , " and seeing @entity40 and @entity43 in " @entity44 " was key to her belief that she could become successful
she hopes she can have the same effect on people who see her
" i 've heard people talk about images in popular culture changing , and that makes me feel great , because it means that the little girl i was , once upon a time , has an image to instill in her that she is beautiful , that she is worthy , " she said
" until i saw people who looked like me , doing the things i wanted to , i was n't so sure it was a possibility
