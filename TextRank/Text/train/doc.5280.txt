the win also marked a fifth individual @entity5 title for @entity6 playmaker @entity14 , equaling a record set by retired @entity1 player @entity16 who ran on to the court to congratulate the guard at the end of the game " this was the hardest one by far
" @entity14 , who finished with 23 points but only 6 out of 24 on shooting , told the official @entity1 website
" i wanted it so bad and sometimes when you want it so bad , it slips away from you
my guys picked me up
" the @entity1 had to come behind from to take game seven , after the @entity2 built up an early 13 point lead
however , the @entity33 side edged ahead in the final quarter , thanks to two free throws from @entity37 which were enough to seal a win and for the side to take the series 4 - 3
but it was veteran player @entity43 who added 20 points to the @entity1 overall score and @entity47 forward @entity46 , with 19 points and 17 rebounds , who were the key to the @entity52 victory
" i ca n't say enough about ' @entity47 '
that guy 's unbelievable , a hell of a player - we would n't have won it without him , " @entity14 said
and @entity1 coach @entity58 who now has 11 titles to his name , was full of praise for 30 - year - old @entity43
" he was the most valuable player tonight
he brought life to our team , he brought life to the crowd , " @entity58 told his team 's official website
the last time the two rival sides met in the finals was in 2008 , when the @entity2 beat the @entity1 4 - 2
but @entity2 could not repeat their performance that saw them win a record - breaking 17th championship crown two years ago , despite high scoring from @entity76 on 18 and @entity77 on 17
the team were undoubtedly let down by a poor shooting night from star player @entity80 who finished with just 14 , and the absence of @entity83 , who was injured in game 6
" well there 's a lot of crying in our locker room , a lot of people who care
i do n't think there was a dry eye
a lot of hugs , a lot of people feeling awful , " @entity2 coach @entity96 , whose team had two chances to win the series after leading going into game 6 , told the official @entity5 website
" it was the craziest , most emotional group i 've ever coached in my life
they made me reach to places that i never thought i needed to go so that 's what makes this loss tough
" the teams had met in 11 previous finals , but it is only the third time that the @entity1 have beat the @entity2 to take the @entity5 title .
