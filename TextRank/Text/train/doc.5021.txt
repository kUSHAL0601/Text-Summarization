-- @entity1 posted online show tanks in @entity4 streets , scrambling crowds and the menacing sounds of sniper fire
on the other side of the world , @entity4 - @entity8 say they are watching in anguish , haunted by what they see and hear
" you hear people screaming for help , and you can identify the accent , " said @entity13 , a 35 - year - old attorney in @entity14 who was raised in @entity4 's capital , @entity16
" it 's been very traumatizing for me and my family to see all these things , " he said
" to see all of that , and to know that you can do very little about it from outside @entity4 , is a very demoralizing and frustrating position to be in
" word of a brutal crackdown by government security forces began to trickle out soon after anti-government protests began in mid-march
since then , human rights groups say more than 775 people have been killed
@entity0 has not been granted access into @entity4 and is unable to independently verify those claims , videos posted online or witness accounts
@entity4 - @entity8 say they also struggle to find out what 's happening , frantically searching for news online and calling family and friends in @entity4
" they 're too scared
... they do n't say anything on the phone
everything 's monitored , " said @entity46 , an @entity8 of @entity4 descent who lives in the @entity14 area
he asked that his last name not be used , fearing his extended family in @entity53 , @entity4 's second largest city , could face repercussions
" there 's a sense of helplessness
we try to bring the attention of the international community to what 's going on
that 's the only thing @entity4 - @entity8 can do to deal with the problem , " said @entity62
the 35 - year - old mayor of @entity66 , @entity67 , wrote an op - ed in his local newspaper , criticizing the " violent repression " of @entity4 president @entity71 's regime
in @entity4 , he wrote , people ca n't speak out at government meetings or write letters to the editor
" the only thing they can do now is protest peacefully
that protest is being documented via social media for the world to see the atrocities of the @entity4 forces , " he wrote
@entity62 said the news has sharply divided the large @entity85 community in the area where he lives , and many people are still struggling to understand the situation
" people do n't know whether to go with or against ( the government ) , and they do n't know what the future might hold , " he said
the members of the @entity94 in @entity95 are also split , according to @entity96 , the social club 's president
" i 've seen people on either side , and i 've seen people in the middle
the majority of people are right in the middle , praying for the conflict to end , " said @entity96 , 57
friends and family he 's spoken with in @entity4 also have divergent opinions , he said
" frankly , they do n't know what to believe anymore
... the people i talk to , they believe that there is propaganda and lying coming from both sides , " he said
for weeks , it seemed the world 's attention was focused elsewhere , said @entity119 , 47 , of @entity120
when he could n't find enough information about the situation in news reports , the small - business owner said he turned to online social networks
now @entity119 is glued to @entity126 , searching for updates and posting videos of the violence that he receives from acquaintances in @entity4
even from thousands of miles away , deciding to speak out about the situation was difficult , he said
" it took me a while before i made up my mind
then i realized , if i do n't do this and the next guy wo n't do this , nobody 's going to say anything , " he said
" somebody has to say something
me and my family , we 're not better than the people that are getting killed in the streets
