@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 scored with 13 minutes left to earn @entity3 a 1 - 1 home draw with @entity6 leaders @entity7 on sunday
@entity8 is mobbed by team - mates after giving @entity7 the lead in their 1 - 1 draw at @entity3
@entity2 picked up a headed knock - down from substitute @entity13 before seeing his shot deflect off defender @entity15 to leave goalkeeper @entity16 helpless
@entity7 took a first - half lead when @entity18 striker @entity8 broke @entity3 's offside trap and latched onto @entity20 midfielder @entity16 's through ball before firing past @entity22
the result means @entity7 retain their unbeaten record this season , despite injury problems that saw the likes of @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 ruled out
the defending champions are now two points clear of @entity34 at the top of the table , with @entity37 a point further behind and @entity3 in fourth place
earlier in the day , @entity37 missed out on the chance to close the gap on @entity7 when a late collapse saw them throw away a two - goal lead to draw 2 - 2 at @entity44
first half goals from @entity47 winger @entity46 and @entity48 had put the visiting @entity49 in charge and for more than an hour they looked set to cruise to victory
but with 23 minutes remaining @entity53 reduced the deficit and @entity55 snatched an injury time equaliser to deny @entity59 's injury - depleted team
@entity60 snatched a share of the spoils from @entity63 in a 2 - 2 draw as @entity65 scored in the last minute while @entity66 needed an injury time goal from striker @entity69 to deny rock - bottom @entity70 their first win of the season , forcing them to settle for a 1 - 1 draw in the south
