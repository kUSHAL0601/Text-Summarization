-- leading figures from @entity2 to the @entity3 have been paying tribute to @entity5 , the anti-nazi resistance fighter and @entity7 supporter who died friday
@entity5 was one of the leaders of the @entity9 in @entity10 @entity5 was one of the leaders of the @entity9 , " the largest , symbolically most important @entity13 uprising " against the @entity14 during @entity10 , according to the @entity11
@entity2 president @entity15 and prime minister @entity16 both issued statements mourning @entity5
@entity16 called him an " exceptional man , " saying " his bravery was a testament to the courage of the fighters of the @entity23 , " as the largest jewish resistance movement in the ghetto was known
the prime minister also praised him for standing up against the @entity2 communist government 's anti-semitic campaign of 1968 , and hailed him as an example for free , democratic @entity2
the @entity29 saluted " his life dedicated to the defense of human dignity and freedom
the @entity3 stands with @entity2 as it mourns the loss of a great man
" @entity5 is thought to have been the last surviving commander of the uprising , in which @entity13 fought @entity40 efforts to send them to concentration camps
armed with pistols , some rifles and automatic weapons , and hand - made grenades , the resistance fighters attacked the @entity47 and their allies when they tried to liquidate the @entity49 in april 1943
the @entity14 had planned to round up all the ghetto 's @entity13 in three days , but in the end it took them more than a month -- longer than some countries held out against @entity55 's armies
the @entity14 reduced the ghetto to rubble in the process of flushing resistance fighters out of their bunkers
@entity5 was in one of the last groups to hold out in the headquarters of the @entity23 at 18 @entity64
in the final days of the uprising he was able to sneak out of the ghetto by way of the city 's sewers , he wrote after the war
he went on to fight in the @entity71 , a two - month battle against the @entity14 in 1944 , undertaken primarily by @entity73
after the war , @entity5 became a cardiologist
in the late 1940s , he published a short history of the @entity9 in @entity2 , @entity77 , and @entity78 , called " @entity79
" in it , he described the creation of the ghetto by the @entity14
" in november 1940 , the @entity47 finally established the @entity49
the @entity13 population still living outside the ' @entity84 ' ( ' @entity85 ' ) was brought inside the special area
poles living within the designated ghetto boundaries were ordered to move out , " he wrote
" beginning with november 15 , no @entity13 was allowed to leave the @entity13 precincts
all houses vacated by @entity13 were immediately locked by the @entity47 and then , with all their contents , gratuitously given to @entity2 merchants and hucksters ...
the walls and barbed wire surrounding the ghetto grew higher every day until , on november 15 , they completely cut off the @entity13 from the outside world
" hunger and disease were rife in the ghetto , he wrote
" people began to die of hunger in the streets
every morning , about 4 - 5 a.m. , funeral carts collected a dozen or more corpses on the streets that had been covered with a sheet of paper and weighted down with a few rocks
some simply fell in the streets and remained there , " @entity5 remembered
jews organized a local government and socialist unions , but conditions became progressively worse in the ghetto , with the @entity14 summarily executing people
nazis then began deporting @entity13 to concentration camps -- sometimes with the help of @entity13 collaborators in the ghetto -- @entity5 wrote
by that time , many in the ghetto knew the @entity14 were systematically murdering @entity13 in the camps , he recalled
he describes in detail the spring 1943 uprising , a street - by - street battle that ended with the ghetto in ruins
@entity5 's history finishes simply , listing the handful of survivors of the hundreds who fought back
" those who had gone over to the ' aryan side ' continued the partisan fight in the woods
the small group that was still alive at the time took an active part in the 1944 @entity144 as the ' @entity145
' at present the following of our comrades are still among the living : @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , and @entity5
" during the early 1980s @entity5 was active with @entity7 , the @entity2 trade union movement that opposed the @entity156 government
@entity158 foreign minister @entity157 awarded him the legion of honor in 2008 , on a visit to @entity2 marking the 65th anniversary of the @entity9
@entity5 was born in 1921 , according to @entity162 , @entity165 's @entity164 museum
he was buried in @entity49 's @entity13 cemetery on friday , the @entity166 reported
