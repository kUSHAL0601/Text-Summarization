-- a hard - line @entity2 lawmaker has mockingly suggested that @entity2 president @entity3 open up a nightclub , according to @entity2 's @entity5
lawmaker @entity6 took the sarcastic poke at @entity3 during a speech to parliament where he said the president 's soft stance on @entity2 's @entity13 dress code was to blame for an increase in young @entity2 women wearing sexually provocative clothing , @entity5 reported
@entity6 has long been a fierce critic of @entity3
" the state of the dress code today has created addictions in society , so @entity3 should think about starting a nightclub or a cabaret , " @entity5 quoted @entity6 as saying
@entity2 's dress code requires women to cover their hair and bodies , but many push the envelope with tight clothes and head scarves that barely cover their hair
often , the result is a cat - and - mouse game between young , defiant women who want to wear what they choose and @entity2 's morality police , who patrol the streets on foot and marked cars to enforce the code
@entity3 's hard - line political opponents started attacking the president about his views on the dress code in 2010 after he criticized morality police for taking excessive measures against alleged offenders
