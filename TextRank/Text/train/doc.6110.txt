@entity0 -- one person died and more than 300 were injured friday when clashes broke out in @entity0 as protests against the country 's military government turned violent , state media reported
video from the scene showed some protesters throwing rocks at security forces , and the security forces spraying water cannons at the demonstrators , who were protesting near the country 's @entity16
the protests erupted amid a backdrop of frustration about the pace of reform since @entity23 was ousted as president last year and over concern that @entity27 's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule
one person was killed and 373 were injured in the clashes in the @entity32 area , said @entity33 , director of @entity0 's emergency medical services
@entity27 's ruling @entity35 said a curfew will be enforced in @entity37 and streets leading to it from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. " those involved in ( the ) @entity42 clashes and inciting them will be dealt with according to the law , " the @entity35 said
@entity27 's state - run @entity45 showed at least two members of the military police suffering injuries and being carried away from the front line of the clashes
thousands of people descended on downtown @entity0 on friday after several parties urged supporters to voice their outrage about deadly clashes this week and demand the resignation of @entity27 's interim military government
at least 11 people were killed and scores injured wednesday in violence in @entity32 , where a sit - in protest has been going on for a week outside the @entity16
as the latest clashes gathered steam , @entity64 , a human rights lawyer , reported seeing warning shots fired in the air by security forces , as well as military helicopters hovering over the scene
some military officers have been injured by rocks thrown by protesters , he said
@entity73 , @entity35 spokesman , said officials warned protesters that the @entity16 was " a red line " that should n't be crossed
" they threw rocks first at the military police soldiers , insulted them and pushed through barbed wire , " the spokesman said
the rock - throwing injured several soldiers
" no live ammunition of any kind was used except for standard protocol for dealing with riots , " he said
the @entity89 's political wing , the @entity90 , was among those taking part in another protest in @entity94 , the heart of @entity27 's protest movement , under the banner of " stopping the bloodshed
" at least three stages had been set up in the square , where a mostly @entity102 crowd planned to demonstrate , according to @entity45
many are supporters of @entity102 candidate @entity104 , who is among a number of candidates disqualified from the may 23 presidential election
@entity108 , founder of the liberal april 6 movement , which was among those to join the protests in @entity32 , said it was urging its supporters to pull back
" we are withdrawing from @entity32 to avoid and limit bloodshed
some of our field medics will remain behind to assist only , " he said
the april 6 movement wants accountability from the @entity35 for the @entity121 for the deaths of protesters in the @entity32 clashes wednesday
the @entity125 earlier dispatched 70 ambulances to the @entity32 protests , dubbed the " @entity129 " march
and the @entity130 set up two makeshift clinics
the @entity133 party has boycotted the @entity32 protest
the @entity35 said on its @entity136 page thursday that the clashes in @entity32 were aimed at delaying the presidential elections and stalling the formation of a constituent assembly
the @entity35 also said that certain " unnamed " groups have used verses from the @entity142 calling for jihad , or holy war , to try to draw the military into an armed conflict
the military had tried to persuade the protesters to move from their position near the @entity150 to @entity94 , but they refused , the @entity136 statement said
controversy about the approaching presidential elections has been growing
the @entity89 's preferred candidate , @entity153 , who was disqualified from running last month , was referred to the country 's general prosecutor friday for insulting the election commission
@entity104 was also referred to the general prosecutor for alleged forgery
he was disqualified from standing because of evidence that his late mother had @entity163 citizenship , an assertion he has denied
on thursday , three other presidential candidates also were referred for alleged violations of election campaign law
the three candidates -- leading independent @entity169 ; @entity170 of the @entity171 ; and @entity172 -- were accused of breaking the law by holding meetings on college campuses
" these infringements by the presidential candidates will be taken very seriously , and they will be questioned as soon as possible
they could be fined , " @entity178 , the official spokesman for the general prosecutor , told @entity1 on thursday
the election commission has disqualified about 10 of the 23 presidential contenders , its chief has said
the disqualifications have prompted widespread anger
international powers urged all sides to exercise restraint after the clashes wednesday
assailants targeted the protesters in @entity0 early wednesday , medical sources said
at least 150 people were injured , dr. @entity194 , a physician working in a field hospital near where the clashes took place , said thursday
it was unclear who the attackers were , but they were not wearing uniforms , witnesses said
the @entity90 blamed the @entity35 for the deaths and injuries in the @entity32 clashes , and it said that the council , not the protesters , wants to delay the transition of power
a government official denied reports that the military was involved in wednesday 's violence
clashes have erupted in @entity27 since an uprising led to the toppling of @entity23 in february of last year , with protesters demanding the military leaders who took over hand over power to a civilian administration
