@entity0 -- @entity3 troops are pursuing suspected @entity6 militants from @entity7 across the border into @entity9 , @entity3 government spokesman @entity2 told @entity1 sunday
the move marks a dramatic shift in security tactics for the east @entity14 powerhouse , which is evoking the @entity16 charter allowing military action in self - defense against its largely lawless neighbor
" if you are attacked by an enemy , you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try hit wherever that enemy is , " said defense minister @entity20 in a news conference aired on @entity1 affiliate @entity22
@entity20 said repeatedly that the @entity3 military was ready to pursue " terrorists " inside the war - torn country
" if a country is provoked and its territorial boundary is violated , a country has all the right to deal with the crisis wherever it is , " said @entity32 , the minister for @entity33
@entity7 , which is linked to @entity40 and has been designated a terrorist organization by the @entity42 , is fighting to impose its own interpretation of @entity6 law , or sharia , on @entity9
recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in @entity3 have heightened tensions
on september 11 , armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where @entity53 @entity52 and @entity54 , both in their 50s , were staying
@entity54 was shot dead while trying to resist the attack
his wife was grabbed and spirited away onboard the pirates ' speedboat
she is believed to have been taken into @entity9
and on october 1 , pirates made another cross-border raid , this time snatching a @entity63 woman in her 60s from the holiday home on @entity66 where she lived for part of the year
last week , gunmen abducted two @entity70 workers for the medical charity @entity71 ( @entity71 ) from the @entity73 refugee complex , about 80 kilometers from the @entity9 border
@entity3 announced its new tactics less than a week after @entity77 forces claimed a victory against @entity7 in @entity79 , the @entity9 capital
they took the remaining @entity7 strongholds in the far northeast of @entity79 , the military said monday
" it has been a big achievement to remove @entity7 from the city , and put an end to the fighting that disrupted so many lives , " @entity83 ( @entity83 ) spokesman lt. col. @entity82 said
" the challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week , as they attempt to rebuild their lives , " he said
he was referring to a suicide truck bombing in the heart of @entity79 that left dozens dead
other @entity7 attacks that week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians
@entity102 and @entity77 forces in the impoverished and chaotic nation have battled the group for years
many analysts believe @entity83 's military push against @entity7 has severely affected the group , along with targeted strikes against its members and the weakening of @entity40
@entity7 said in august that it was withdrawing from @entity79 , and @entity9 's @entity113 , backed by @entity77 peacekeepers , now controls most districts of the capital city , the @entity16 office said
forces have pushed @entity7 outside most of @entity79 , but the group is still a major threat , @entity82 said earlier .
