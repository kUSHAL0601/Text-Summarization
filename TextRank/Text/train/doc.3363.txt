@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity1 soldier fatally shot two @entity4 soldiers and wounded three others on saturday , the @entity4 military said
a man lies in a hospital after a roadside bombing near @entity11 on saturday
the shooter was killed when @entity4 soldiers returned fire , maj. @entity12 told @entity2
the incident took place at a combat outpost just south of the northern @entity1 city of @entity20 , where there has been a strong presence of anti- @entity4 militants , and it underscored the dangers for @entity4 troops and @entity1 security forces in that city
a second gunman also fired on other @entity4 soldiers at the outpost and fled , said @entity12 , a spokesman for the @entity4 - led @entity30
@entity1 's @entity31 said the gunman was a soldier in training who was standing close to @entity4 soldiers when he aimed his firearm at them and began shooting
there have been similar incidents of men in @entity1 security force uniforms in the @entity20 area opening fire on @entity4 troops
in february , insurgents dressed as @entity1 police officers killed a @entity4 soldier and an interpreter in the city
asked whether there seems to be a rise in such attacks , @entity12 replied , " we still view these as isolated incidents either by individuals posing as @entity52 or members acting out on their own
" " these events do not represent the overall relationship or partnership @entity4 forces have with our @entity1 counterparts
" overall , violence and attacks are down in @entity1 , but despite improvements in the big picture , the @entity4 military is concerned with hot spots such as @entity20
maj. gen. @entity65 , @entity66 spokesman , told reporters on friday that the city remains a danger
he said the @entity4 military is studying whether @entity4 combat troops scheduled to withdraw from urban centers in @entity1 by june 30 should actually remain in the diverse metropolis -- populated by @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and others
@entity65 said @entity78 in @entity1 ( @entity79 ) militants " are transitioning and becoming more and more concentrated ... mainly in @entity20 and in @entity0
" " what we have always said with regards to @entity78 is that strategically for @entity79 to win they have to win @entity0 and for them to survive they have to hold on to @entity20 and you can see that by how they are conducting their attacks
" in the last couple of weeks , he said , militants have focused their activity on @entity0 , and attacks in @entity20 have dropped somewhat
" but there is still a lot activity
this is probably the main area we are looking at that could possibly result in @entity4 forces being there , " he said of @entity20
" probably more so than any other place
" " of all the places in @entity1 , it is the area that you would most likely possibly see a very similar @entity4 presence to what you see now
but only if @entity1 want that
" @entity4 troop fatalities in @entity1 last month reached 18 , the highest of the year
however , the number of monthly @entity1 troop deaths have plummeted since earlier in the war
also on saturday , @entity116 forces targeting @entity114 rebels shelled a village in @entity1 , an official from @entity1 's @entity114 region said
forces used helicopters to attack the village and shelled it with artillery
the village is just over the @entity116 border in @entity1 's @entity127 province -- a @entity114 region
@entity116 and @entity130 long have targeted @entity114 separatist rebels operating in northern @entity1
meanwhile in @entity134 , in northern @entity1 , three civilians were killed and three others were wounded when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle on saturday , police said
it is not known who the bomb might have been targeting , but the incident reflects the hostilities in the oil - rich and ethnically diverse city .
