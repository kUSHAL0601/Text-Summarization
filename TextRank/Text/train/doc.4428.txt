-- a leading international children 's charity has warned that @entity4 's desire to adopt a 14 - month - old baby boy could lead to more children being abandoned
@entity4 kisses baby @entity7 during his visit to the orphanage in @entity10 on saturday
the singer , 62 , made the announcement during a visit with his partner , 46 - year - old @entity14 , to an orphanage for @entity17 - affected children in @entity10 on saturday
" @entity14 always wanted to adopt and i always said no because i am 62 and i think because of the traveling i do and the life i have , maybe it would n't be fair for the child , " he told reporters
" but having seen @entity7 today , i would love to adopt him
i do n't know how we do that but he has stolen my heart
and he has stolen @entity14 's heart and it would be wonderful if we can have a home
i 've changed my mind today
" while @entity31 praised the @entity33 musician for helping raise awareness of children affected by @entity36 , it said international adoption is sending out the wrong message
@entity39 , @entity40 , told @entity0 : " @entity41 conducted in the @entity10 in 2007 which showed high - profile celebrity adoptions and news around foreigners coming into the country and adopting children generally was actually encouraging vulnerable young mothers to abandon their children into homes hoping their child would be adopted by a rich foreigner and have a better life
" so it 's quite well documented that these high - profile adoptions could actually be increasing the number of children in institutions
" do you think celebrity adoptions are a good thing ? according to research by the charity 's web site , 95 percent of the children in @entity10 's institutions are not orphans , with babies born to @entity17 + mothers facing particular discrimination
they are separated from their mothers and often end up in children 's homes and institutions segregated from children not affected by @entity17
it argues that governments such as @entity10 need to be encouraged to put more emphasis on keeping families together rather than placing them in outdated @entity80 - era children 's homes
" after a great deal of campaigning by charities such as ours , the @entity10 government introduced a new ' gate - keeping ' system which means the authorities will have to consider all available options before a child is placed in an institution , " @entity39 said
" so when a child is taken into care or abandoned , they will have look at whether a child has other family or can be fostered by another family for example
this is a huge step forward and one that needs support
" we will definitely be speaking to @entity4 and his representatives about this
" @entity4 is the latest high - profile figure to be linked with a case of this kind
earlier this year , @entity108 won a court appeal to adopt a second child from @entity111
critics of the pop - star accused the pop superstar of taking advantage of " archaic adoption laws " in a bid to adopt three - year - old @entity118
@entity108 's initial attempt was denied because she did not meet a residency law that requires applicants to have lived in the country for some time before adoption
this condition was waived when @entity108 -- and then husband @entity125 -- adopted her first @entity111 child , @entity126
the judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighed the issue of residency
meanwhile , the @entity133 said around 4,000 children need to be adopted in @entity33 each year , with many facing a considerable wait
@entity133 chief executive @entity136 told @entity0 : " while @entity4 may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the @entity33 , there are many children , particularly older children , sibling groups , children with disabilities , and children from black minority groups , all waiting for a family
" we 'll certainly be reinforcing this message during @entity148 in @entity33 later this year
