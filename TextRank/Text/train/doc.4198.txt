@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 returned thursday to a setting with which he is all - too - acquainted : a @entity1 courtroom

" " he was let down , " @entity3 's aunt @entity64 told @entity2
" he was neglected by the schools , the police and his immediate family
he did n't have a normal life , he had an alcoholic mom and her boyfriends
" read the aunt 's letter to the court according to @entity64 , her sister drank heavily and regularly broke @entity3 's toys as a form of punishment while he was growing up

she yells and screams at me
" @entity3 's mother , @entity84 , did not respond to @entity2 's calls , emails and a letter asking for comment on the allegations
a homemade placard placed on the driveway to the broken down trailer where she lives and where @entity3 grew up warned visitors , " if you go past this sign you will be shot
" " she never abused @entity3 , " said @entity97 , @entity84 's entertainment attorney who is fielding offers for books and movies based on @entity3 's alleged escapades
" there is a much richer story here
" many disappointments but in a handwritten letter in @entity3 's court file , @entity84 wrote , " this boy has had many disappointments all his life
his step father died and our dog and this had severe effects on @entity116 and @entity117 " " he does things , " @entity84 's letter continues
" without thinking of the end results
" according to court records , @entity84 said @entity3 's father left when he was " four to five years old
" @entity3 was " attached to " her next husband , @entity84 said in court records , but he was " a heroin addict " who died of undetermined causes when @entity3 was 10 years old

in a may 2003 incident , court records say that @entity3 , then 12 , called 911 after his father allegedly pushed him to the ground and gripped his hand around the boy 's throat
when police arrived , according to the records , @entity3 's father @entity147 " ran into the woods ... but they soon caught him
he was arrested and taken to jail
" soon after , court records detail , @entity147 cut off contact with the family
@entity2 was unable to reach him for comment about the incident
according to court records , @entity84 blamed her son for the incident
" his mom was drunk and screaming at him , ' @entity0 court records said
" she stumbled around asking , ' what are you going to do now ? they have taken your father away
' " six months later , @entity3 was arrested with three other boys for breaking into the middle school he attended
@entity3 later pleaded guilty to using a butane torch lighter to burn a hole into a school window and then take a laptop and blank @entity169 he was sentenced to six months of supervision and 56 hours of community service
tumultuous relationship in a 2004 report , @entity3 's probation officer wrote , " @entity3 and his mother share a tumultuous relationship
@entity3 's mother reported to me how he is violent at home on a near daily basis
he recently broke the telephone in order to prevent her from calling the police
she then showed me a mark on her forearm of how ( sic ) he had bit her " and " reported a recent incident where @entity3 went after her with a boat oar
" the same report continued , " his mother reported how @entity3 is now medicated and is complying with taking his medications and his behavior has not been as hostile toward her
" in 2007 as her son faced sentencing on burglary charges , @entity3 's mother wrote the court , saying " @entity116 has had mental problems since about age 2
i have tried for years to get help for him
" " @entity3 tended to beat his head on the wall when he was toddler
" @entity84 stated , according to court records
in the 2007 psychological evaluation that is part of @entity3 's court file , dr. @entity210 writes " @entity3 has a long - term history of psychiatric and behavioral difficulties
he also has been prescribed a wide range of psychiatric medications including anti-depressants , stimulant medications , mood stabilizers , and even an anti-psychotic medication
" read the full psychological evaluation @entity3 's then - attorney @entity222 said she ordered the psychological review to show that he " was n't dangerous , was n't violent
all the charges against him were basically property crimes , " she said
@entity222 remembered @entity3 as being " very on the ball " and " courteous
" " @entity227 is incredibly bright , " @entity222 told @entity2
" but he did n't have much schooling and he wanted to fly
he was n't going to be able to go into the @entity229 so i think [ allegedly stealing airplanes ] was the only avenue for him to do what he wanted
" with @entity3 facing 23 charges , @entity222 negotiated a deal where @entity3 plead guilty to three charges of burglary and was sentenced to three years in a juvenile detention home " i love that boy like one of my own kids , " @entity3 's aunt @entity64 wrote , the judge in the case
she offered to let him live on her farm with " horses dogs , cats , chickens that he shows a big interest in
i think he got mixed in with the wrong crowd and got himself in to ( sic ) far
" but in april 2008 , @entity3 allegedly snuck out of the group home for juvenile offenders , beginning the chase with authorities that concluded two years later in the @entity256 with the teenage fugitive newly famous and in chains
@entity64 said @entity3 's story could have turned out differently had he gone to live on her farm
instead , @entity64 said , she would receive phone calls from @entity3 every month or so to let her know he was doing ok and still running
@entity64 said she pleaded with the young fugitive to turn himself in
his reply was always the same , " he was n't ready to stop yet , " she said .
