-- tropical cyclones in the @entity2 do not worry some @entity4 residents because direct hits historically have been so rare on the islands
@entity4 is a small target in a large ocean
but the state finds itself prepping ahead of what could be a pair of back - to - back smacks from @entity13 and @entity14
even if these two storms weaken or do n't make landfall -- as is usually the case around @entity4 -- they can still cause damage , including flooding and debris , experts warn
try telling that to @entity23 , who has lived in @entity24 , on @entity4 's @entity26 island , for more than 60 years
" people are not really nervous , but honestly just hoping for some good surf , " said @entity23 , who owns the @entity27
" surfers get excited when hurricane season starts
the people here are really nonchalant and are used to rain , which is the main thing we are expecting
" there are no lines at the supermarket or stocking of supplies , even though @entity13 is on a forecast track to hit the islands on thursday
" i 'm not worried about this storm , " @entity23 said
history appears to back him up
a 2002 report by the @entity46 states that " actual hurricane strikes on the @entity48 are relatively rare in the modern record
" " more commonly , near - misses that generate large swell and moderately high winds causing varying degrees of damage are the hallmark of hurricanes passing close to the islands , " according to the report
a primer on @entity59 in @entity4 by the @entity60 says just as much : " hurricanes are relatively rare events in the @entity48
" however , even if @entity13 and @entity14 change course and miss the islands , it does not mean that dangers are averted
flying debris poses a risk , and back - to - back storms over an area that is already saturated makes for a flooding risk
officials at the state and local level are not taking the risks that @entity13 and @entity14 pose lightly
" we are actually monitoring very closely
we 've had several tropical systems since june 1 , " said @entity75 of the @entity76
" the ground is very saturated
we are very hopeful it will weaken
however , it still is likely to present tropical storm force winds at 74 mph , high surf at 10 to 15 feet , and heavy rain
" as of tuesday , @entity13 was a category 3 hurricane but was expected to weaken as it neared @entity4 , according to the @entity86
@entity14 , on the other hand , could strengthen to hurricane force by the time it reaches the islands
" we are very concerned with the flooding that will be possible from having two major storms so close together , " @entity92 spokesman chief petty officer @entity92 said
the @entity96 's priority is keeping the @entity97 open , where 90 % of the state 's goods and services pass through , he said
the agency is asking residents to stock up on supplies for at least seven days , as power outages are expected
honolulu mayor @entity105 has issued a similar warning
" yes , it is a concern if both storms hit back to back because the ground will be saturated with water , increasing the odds of flooding , " he said
many @entity4 residents spread the news of the coming storms via social media , but not all were worried about what they could bring
" ca n't wait for the storm to hit , i 'm ready for some rain , " one @entity120 user in @entity4 wrote
another wrote : " is it bad that my family is doing literally nothing to prepare for the hurricane ? " @entity4 's primary elections are slated for saturday
local media reported that many turned up for early voting in anticipation of severe weather on election day
others are concerned that voting turnout could be affected
some shelters will be set up in the same buildings where voting is to be held , the governor 's office said .
