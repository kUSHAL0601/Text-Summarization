@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is an attractive , talented and ambitious professional from @entity4 , @entity5
she runs her own internet business , selling on online auction site @entity7 and advising others how to navigate the site to gain maximum profits
@entity12 says working online means she can spend more time with her daughter @entity14
@entity3 , 36 , is also a full - time mother who home - schools her kids
but @entity3 is one of an increasing number of stay - at - home moms who are using the @entity21 to have it all
@entity3 was a high - tech @entity22 marketing executive when , in 1999 , she gave up work to look after her baby boy
she had her second child in 2002 , and it was then that she discovered @entity7
" i had bought a stroller for $ 15 and a couple of months later realized it was n't fitting my needs , so i decided to sell it on @entity7 , " she told @entity2
" i made over $ 100 ! i was hooked
" @entity3 , a self - confessed bargain - hunter , quickly realized that she could use the @entity21 to plump up her family 's finances
" we could n't survive on my husband 's income , so it was necessary for me to contribute somehow , " she said
" i just could n't bring myself to leave my children -- and i knew i had skills that would allow me to freelance or create my own business
" @entity3 began to sell regularly on @entity7 , specializing in children 's items
after a while , it struck her that her experience could be valuable to others , and so she set up @entity47 , a web site that offers advice to other @entity7 sellers specializing in children 's goods
@entity3 's subscription newsletters , downloadable e-books , auction templates and online mentoring now help her add to the family 's budget
@entity60 mother - of - two @entity58 says the @entity21 offers a sense of community
@entity3 's not alone as a stay - at - home mom and internet entrepreneur
@entity58 , a 35 - year - old @entity60 mother of two , runs @entity65 , a site with resources for parents who run their own @entity21 businesses
she told @entity2 that the @entity21 offers stay - at - home parents the chance to earn an income from home
" whether it 's extra spending money or to build a fully - fledged business , it 's up to them , " she said
and @entity76 sees the internet as offering valuable support to mothers who can sometimes start to feel isolated
" the internet makes it easier to connect with other moms while the kids are asleep , or when mom gets a free moment , " she told @entity2
" they 're all in the same boat , so theirs is an instant understanding and connection
" while many of the people @entity76 has met online do n't live close to her geographically , she says the @entity21 can offer an enormous sense of community and support
" i 've seen moms on the brink of leaving their husbands receive the most incredible advice that makes them turn things around , " she confided
" i 'm definitely not saying the @entity21 saves marriages , but without that connection and support , a stay - at - home mom may have made a completely different decision
" @entity76 says the @entity21 can give moms a big boost in confidence
in a family where the husband is the main breadwinner , working from home can increase a wife 's self - worth -- both psychologically and literally
@entity115 told @entity2 , " in addition to the monetary gain , [ mothers ] can feel a sense of accomplishment and eliminate some of the guilt of not contributing to the family finances
" she continued , " of course , there 's no shame in ' just being a stay - at - home mom
' it 's one of the most important jobs in the world , but moms can feel guilty about it
" the benefits that mothers can bring to their own businesses are starting to be appreciated by workplaces , too
@entity12 , 29 , is a @entity136 - based witty , dynamic @entity21 early adopter
she 's been surfing , chatting and blogging for some years , so when she and her husband @entity139 had daughter @entity14 in 2004 , it seemed natural to her to seek work online
@entity12 was snapped up by @entity141 , a @entity143 - based blogging site owned by internet company @entity144
she works full - time supervising their volunteer - run support center , which gives @entity141 users technical help and advice
@entity12 told @entity2 , " i clock about seven to eight hours a day
this is intertwined with @entity14 's needs
i 'm lucky that she 's mostly independent with an active imagination and is content to play by herself for periods of time
" @entity12 's job is flexible enough to fit around the interruptions that motherhood brings
she says , " last week i was in the middle of a serious business discussion that i had to place on hold for two minutes so i could ' fly over ' to where @entity14 was playing @entity166 in the laundry basket and ' feed ' her
" and @entity12 's work colleagues do n't mind her dual status as mother and co-worker
she says , " they think it 's cute
i 'm glad i have such a flexible workplace and a supervisor who understands that i 'll get everything done at the end of the day although my work concentration might get broken up from time to time with cleaning up spilled cereal , reading a story that she just has to hear , and cuddling if she has a gloomy day
" @entity12 's supervisor , @entity184 , believes home workers can bring companies great benefits
she told @entity2 , " it 's a great combination for both the employees and the company
the staff gets the flexibility necessary to run their home lives and their work lives at the same time , and the company gets employees who are more committed to a company that 's willing to allow that sort of flexibility
" @entity184 , whose department is composed entirely of home workers , also believes that working from home is n't just an advantage for her team
" we as a company benefit considerably from flex time and other setups that benefit caregivers working from home , because of the international and 24/7 nature of our business , " she told @entity2
" by having staff who are looking for flexibility in their schedules , we expand our times of coverage considerably
" and she feels that it gives her a larger pool of prospective employees to choose from when recruiting
" by allowing for remote telecommuting , we 're not limited simply to candidates based around our offices , " she said
" we can find the absolute right candidate , whether that person is living in @entity231 or @entity232
" @entity12 admits that working from home is n't without its challenges
she told @entity2 that at times she feels a little isolated from her colleagues
" sometimes i feel a bit left out of those spontaneous meetings , the ones coworkers can have easily in an office when they 're passing by each others ' desks , " she said
and teleconferencing is n't always ideal : as she explained , " if i 'm on a conference call , it 's often hard to get a word in edgewise -- everyone else can see each other but they ca n't see my non-verbal cues that i have something to say
" @entity12 adds that sometimes it 's hard to walk away from work at the end of the day
she said , " sometimes work is a bit too convenient , especially because i 'm used to work and family being so intertwined anyway
since my office is my dining room table , it 's always right there
" @entity3 backs this up
she told @entity2 , " it 's important to me to have set times when i 'm working and set times when i 'm not
if i do n't do this , i could work all day
" and it cuts both ways : family can distract from work , too
@entity3 says , " the distractions of home provide the biggest downside
there are dishes to be done , dinner to prepare , homework to help with -- and children who just want to play
" but the benefits of working from home -- flexibility , more family time , support and independence -- outweigh the downsides
@entity3 says , " being successful with my home business has allowed me to dream bigger
i could easily do this full - time -- but i do it because i want to be home with my kids
i am able to homeschool and participate in my children 's lives in ways i could n't if i had to go to a @entity292 i 'm reminded of this every time they interrupt me while i 'm working on my laptop in the family room while they play
" @entity12 also values the opportunity she has to combine work and time with her daughter
she told @entity2 , " i really feel like i have the best of both worlds in this situation
if @entity14 went to child care every day , i 'd miss the chance to play games with her and read to her
" " we can take lunch breaks at the park or walk to a nearby coffee shop for sandwiches if it 's a nice day , " she continued
" if i were working at an office , this would n't be possible
