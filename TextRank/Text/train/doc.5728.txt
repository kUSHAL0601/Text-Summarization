-- @entity1 has had a 2013 to forget but chose a lucrative exhibition match with @entity3 in @entity4 to give promise of a return to his stellar best at season 's end
the pair fought it out monday in the " match at @entity12 " on @entity13 and it was @entity15 's @entity1 who edged it by one shot after 18 holes
the 24 - year - old carded a six - under 67 against 68 for @entity3 - repeating his win of 2012 in the corresponding event
" i would like to play all my tournaments in @entity4 where i can beat @entity23 , " @entity1 joked after his narrow win
" it 's been great to come back to this wonderful golf course where i still have such great memories from playing here two years ago in the @entity28 , " he told @entity24
@entity29 won the @entity28 in 2011 with @entity30 at the same venue and will be hoping his improved form can be carried over to next week 's @entity33 in @entity34
he needs a solid finish to get into the top 60 and qualify for the @entity37 's race to @entity38 , an event @entity1 won last year to round off a superlative season
he is currently languishing in 62nd place in the rankings , a far cry from his triumphs of 2012 as he rose to @entity45
" i still have four tournaments left to the end of the season and still would love to finish 2013 strongly and get some momentum into next season , " he said
" i 'm hitting the ball well and from tee - to - green the game is very solid and if i can get the putter working , i maybe can contend and get a win or two
" by contrast , @entity3 has won five @entity57 events this year , but has missed out on adding to his major tally of 14
he battled a virus and a long trip from the @entity62 to push @entity63 close , the issue decided when he bogeyed the 17th to fall a shot behind
both men birdied the last , but it was @entity1 who took the honors , building on his strong second place finish in the @entity71 eight days ago
organizers have not revealed the fees both men received , but reports said they had shared $ 3 million to play in the exhibition
@entity3 is skipping the @entity77 - champions to play in a tournament in @entity79
in other golf action monday , @entity80 beat @entity82 in a playoff to win the @entity84 in @entity85 , an event sanctioned by the @entity57
the @entity62 pair were tied on 14 - under par after four rounds at the @entity90 and @entity91 , but had to come back the next day after the light ran out
@entity80 birdied the first extra hole to claim the $ 1.26 million top prize and a two - year @entity57 exemption
the tournament , which was blighted by storms and rain delays , attracted a strong field , which included major winners @entity100 , @entity102 and @entity103 as the star attractions , but they did not feature in the battle for the top prize .
