-- it 's the issue within @entity3 sport which simply refuses go away -- concussion and the potential danger it poses to professional athletes playing contact sports
earlier this year the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) reached a settlement with thousands of former football players to pay $ 765 million to fund medical exams , concussion - related compensation , medical research for the retired players and their families , and litigation expenses
now the @entity17 is facing a class - action lawsuit brought by 10 former @entity17 players
the lawsuit says the league has n't done enough to protect players from concussions in a sport where physical contact is common and often spills over into heated argument
the players ' legal action drew a swift response from the @entity17
" while the subject matter is very serious , we are completely satisfied with the responsible manner in which the @entity8 and the @entity33 have managed player safety over time , including with respect to head injuries and concussions , " said the @entity17 statement
" we intend to defend the case vigorously and have no further comment at this time
" former @entity17 all - star @entity40 is one of the 10 players to have taken the action against the league and its board of governors
opinion : @entity8 settlement raises questions " unbeknownst to plaintiffs , scientific evidence has linked brain injuries to long - term neurological problems for decades , " read the lawsuit , filed in a @entity50 court
" while every blow to the head is dangerous , plaintiffs did not know , and were not told by the @entity17 , how dangerous this repeated brain trauma is
" the @entity17 has known or should have known of this growing body of scientific evidence and its compelling conclusion that hockey players who sustain repetitive concussive events , sub-concussive events and / or brain injuries are at significantly greater risk of neuro - cognitive illness and disabilities both during their hockey careers and later in life
" the players claim a series of updates to the rules made in 2004 , while creating a more exciting , marketable game , increased the number of violent in - game collisions
" hopefully this lawsuit will shine a light on the problem and the players can get the help they deserve , " @entity77 , a former @entity78 player and one of 10 players who have launched the lawsuit , said in a statement
the lawsuit also accuses the @entity17 of waiting until 2010 to prohibit targeting a player 's head during a challenge , while also failing to outlaw body - checking
" we have , on our own , a long history , going back to 1997 , of taking concussions very seriously , " @entity17 commissioner @entity93 said earlier this year
" we spend a lot of time , money and effort working with the players ' association on player safety
" the @entity8 agreement , which involves more than 4,500 plaintiffs , still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case
meanwhile it was announced tuesday that @entity108 has paid a record - breaking $ 5.2 billion for the rights to broadcast the @entity17 in @entity110
the deal , which also includes multimedia rights , will last 12 years and is the largest in @entity17 history
