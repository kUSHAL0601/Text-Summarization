-- to play the bubbly , optimistic redhead at the center of " @entity4 , " 11 - year - old @entity1 does n't have to reach far
fresh off the announcement today that @entity6 will be headlining the @entity8 revival of the classic musical ( due in fall 2012 ) , @entity0 caught up with the bright , buoyant young star before she tackles the iconic role as @entity8 's favorite orphan
@entity0 : where were you when you found out you got the part ? @entity1 : well , my manager called up and said that we had to be at the agent 's office to do a video audition , and so we came over and he said it was going to be an interview [ about ] dogs
it was just going to be questions about dogs , so he started asking me a couple of questions about them , and then he finally said , " how does it feel to be ' @entity4 ' on @entity8 ? " and i was like , " what ? what the -- ? " and he said , " you 're going to be ' @entity4 ' on @entity8 ! " and i was like , " really ! ? " that 's what happened
when i found out , oh my gosh , my heart just stopped
i was so amazed and i was so excited to start
@entity0 : were your parents there with you ? @entity6 : my mom was there ! @entity44 was my sister , and all of the agents
they were really excited as well
everyone that i could tell was there
i was supposed to keep it a secret , so i did n't call up anyone , but i wished that i could ! @entity0 : what was the audition process like ? @entity6 : well , when i found out that they were doing a revival of " @entity4 , " i decided to audition just for fun and see how it turned out
so i auditioned and i got a callback , after callback , after callback
and i just wanted to be a part of the show ; i did n't care what role
but i got about five or six callbacks until the last callback , then i got it
@entity0 : were you ever in a production of " @entity4 " growing up ? @entity6 : yes , i was in another production of " @entity4
" it was an all - kids production and it was in a little community theater
i think i was about 8 or 9 , and i actually played @entity73 , so it 's kind of funny
@entity0 : were you a big fan of the movie ? @entity6 : yes
i 've seen the movie before , and i 've actually seen the show , so yeah , i really did like that show a lot before i became a part of it
@entity0 : what part of being in the show are you most looking forward to ? @entity6 : now that i get to be in it , i 'm really looking forward to everything , but mostly i 'm really looking forward to working with the dogs , and everyone else ! i do like dogs a lot
@entity0 : if you could meet any @entity8 star , who would you pick ? @entity6 : to meet anyone on @entity8 ? i do like @entity97 and @entity98 a lot , so it would be really fun to like , go to lunch with the two of them
it sounds crazy but ... maybe it 'll happen ! i do n't know ! but i do also like @entity105 and @entity106
those are really good ones , too
@entity0 : how do you think the message of " @entity4 " will translate for other kids growing up today who might see the show ? @entity6 : in the depression especially , i think you learn to face problems and not run away from them
[ you have to ] always have hope for tomorrow and the sun will come out tomorrow ! and if you have a bad day , just always think that it 'll be a new one and a good one the next day
