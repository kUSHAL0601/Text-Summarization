-- i must have met @entity2 , as we called @entity4 , way before i remember
we often attended readings , but the first time she absolutely caught my attention was at @entity9 in @entity10
it was n't all that cold , but @entity4 and others had fur coats on
my mother , who was a big fan of the @entity16 colleges , had come with me
we both had on cloth coats
@entity2 , as we all know , was 6 feet or taller
mommy was 4 - foot - 11 , and i am 5 - foot - 2
not only were we shorter , we felt smaller
i looked at that group and made a silent vow to never allow my mother to be with this group again without a fur coat
we purchased one soon after
when @entity18 died , i shared that story with @entity24 @entity4 laughed
" we had no idea , " she said
mommy owes @entity24 opinion : @entity4 : the definition of a phenomenal woman when @entity2 moved to @entity30 , @entity31 , she was not far from me in @entity33 , so i got to see a lot of her
if i had any inkling she was frying chicken , i 'd go down and spend the night
when @entity39 sent her a case of wonderfully expensive champagne , those days i had to spend the night ! everyone came to @entity2 's place , which was great fun
you 'd wake up in the morning not knowing who would be down to breakfast
the superstars ; the wonderfully funny ; old friends from another country ; a congressman
and @entity2 treated them all the same
@entity4 remembered by those she inspired her ability to speak to everyone in the same voice was what made her the force she was
our only disagreements were about food
she was a great cook , and i think of myself as a good one
we were arguing about rack of lamb , one of my specialties
my recipe comes from the late , great country cook @entity67
i went home after my visit and decided i should not just talk the talk but also walk the walk
i called my good friend @entity72 from @entity73 to have her come with me to @entity2 's to cook
@entity74 is a great cook , too
we got on @entity2 's calendar , packed all our ingredients and spices and boogied on down
@entity2 sat at the head of the table , where she could see everything going on in the kitchen
she inspected the lamb , checked the veggies , tasted everything and praised @entity72
i think she loved me a little bit because she , like my only living aunt , always felt free to make minor corrections
" i think the lamb is a bit overdone , " she offered
" well @entity67 is in heaven , and i checked with her before i put this on the table , " i responded
i know if the lamb was not done properly , she would have eaten it and not said a word
i wanted to fry chicken for her , too , but time just ran out
our mutual friend , the late author @entity103 , always said , " find the good and praise it
" @entity4 took it to heart
she would always seek the good in any situation , or she avoided the question
opinion : how @entity4 gave me life in all my years of knowing her , i only heard her once speak ill of someone and that was well deserved
like everyone , i have read and reread " @entity115
" and like that caged bird , @entity4 sought an inner freedom
we only have to look at her life to see that she took every ounce of joy life had to offer
i will remember her as a courageous woman who always wanted to love , and wish her a rightful place in literature
some of @entity4 's most powerful speeches the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity128 .
