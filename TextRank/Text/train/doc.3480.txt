-- " shh ... shh get back , " the man with the walkie - talkie said
" @entity4 , one of @entity6 's @entity5 , draws visitors with beautiful beaches and excellent snorkeling
we had stumbled onto the set of a " survivor " - like television show
but i 'm getting ahead of myself
first let me tell you how we stumbled onto the @entity5 in @entity6 , and then i 'll tell you how we came upon the @entity15 on the island of @entity17
every year , my husband and i take my niece on a summer vacation
this year , we decided to go to @entity6
besides the canal , @entity6 has a lot to offer : there are mountains , beaches , colonial cities and rain forests
after we found a $ 158 round trip flight from @entity30 , @entity31 , the decision was made
my only fear was the weather ; it was rainy season in @entity36
after weeks of research , i was torn
we had enough time to visit one set of islands , and there were two island chains that i was having a hard time choosing between
the @entity44 are off the northeast coast of @entity6 in the @entity46
they 're also known as @entity48 and are home to the @entity50
it would be a chance to see the @entity53 up close , living as they have for centuries in grass huts along the water 's edge
the other option was the @entity5
the @entity5 , less well - known than the @entity44 , is off the southern @entity60 coast of @entity6
after an agonizing week of self - debate , i decided that our summer vacation would include a trip to the @entity5
the flight was only 20 minutes from @entity67 , but more importantly , i was told it did n't rain as much on the @entity60 side
the sales pitch to my niece : " we are going to where the 2003 edition of ' @entity71 ' and ' survivor : @entity74 ' were filmed
" i was referring to the popular @entity76 reality tv show , and i did n't realize that dozens of other countries had their own versions
i admit my destination choice was not as educational as a few days with the @entity50 , but i thought it would be better than being rained in with a bored teenager
after a short flight from @entity67 in a puddle jumper , we were on the island of @entity4 , one of hundreds that make up the @entity5 and one of three that can be reached by commercial flight
it 's a tiny island with a handful of places to stay and even fewer places to get a meal
golf carts , the primary mode of transportation , can be rented upon arrival
all of @entity4 's entertainment is provided by the sea
it 's a beach bum 's paradise
if you are a beach bum and a reality tv fan , you can sit on the sand and watch props being built for the contestants ' challenges
it 's probably the best set shop in the world , or at least the one with the nicest view
but the @entity5 offer more than just an exotic tv set
for $ 30 an hour , you can go snorkeling and island hopping in a small but comfortable wooden fishing boat
we found @entity116 , our boat captain and guide , on @entity118 , the beach in front of the @entity120
we did some of the best snorkeling i 've ever done anywhere in the world
after a morning of fantastic snorkeling , i asked @entity116 where " @entity71 " was filmed
i will take you there , " he said
@entity116 took us to @entity131 , one of many uninhabited islands just off the shore of @entity4
as the island 's white sandy beaches came into sight , we noticed a clearing where people were putting finishing touches on what looked like a game for contestants
our boat captain told us it was for " @entity145 " ( " challenge " ) , a @entity148 version of the popular reality show
the word on @entity4 was that a few countries ( @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 , to name a few ) were either finishing filming " @entity71 " - type shows or starting new seasons
a representative for the @entity158 told me the government had limited information on the filming and could not confirm the word on the street
we jumped out of the boat , waded through the clear , warm blue water and onto @entity17 , unacknowledged as work continued on the wooden set
noticing a well - worn path , we decided to check out the rest of the island
we thought we were alone when we reached the beach on the other side
but as we walked down what we thought was a deserted beach , we spotted an orange flag in the sand
we knew the @entity76 " survivor " was filmed on this island , but we did not expect to be standing in front of contestants in orange buffs , sitting on a log in the shade
this is when the man with the walkie - talkie shushed us because they were filming
the locals talk about the shows and the many countries they hail from , but they do n't seem to capitalize on the " @entity71 " fame
@entity4 locals certainly make money off the film staff , medics and contestants , but evidently they have n't printed the t - shirts yet
the only shirts we saw were on the backs of others that identified them as " @entity202
" perhaps a true fan could purchase a shirt directly off someone 's back
the island is only so big , and you are bound to run into a crew from some country
one night , we were the only non-reality show customers in @entity212 's restaurant , a popular place for beer and pizza
after our innocent but failed attempt at a guest appearance on " @entity145 , " we returned to the basic comforts on @entity4
that night , as we relaxed in a restaurant -- cold drinks in hand , a warm hearty meal just ordered -- darkness fell
the rain , as it often does in the tropics , started coming down in sheets
i leaned back and thought to myself , " if i was a contestant , tonight i would vote myself off of @entity131
