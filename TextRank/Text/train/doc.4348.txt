-- when growing up , @entity1 wanted to go into space , but as the first female ceo of a @entity5 team she 's arguably reached greater heights
breaking into the male dominated sport was n't the 40 - year old 's first ambition then , but the trained lawyer has embraced her trail - blazing position
" it feels good and i 'm a bit proud about that , " said @entity1
" but again it 's not my doing , it just so happened that i 've done a lot to be in the position
" as a young girl @entity1 moved from her native @entity20 to @entity21 with her parents
taking @entity21 citizenship and studying law , @entity1 first became involved with motor racing in 1998 when she joined the @entity26 , a shareholder of the @entity29 @entity28
she went from looking after the team 's legal and corporate affairs , to taking a place on the @entity34 's management board in 2001
in 2010 , she took over the business operations of the whole team
" certainly it 's not easy , " she said of working in a hugely competitive industry and being the sport 's most high - profile and influential woman
@entity1 has been adjusting to her role during perhaps the team 's most difficult period
after four years @entity44 pulled out of @entity5 in 2009 , leaving a large amount of uncertainty surrounding the development of @entity34 's racing cars and among personnel
" the biggest risk you have here is ... people do n't see the future in the team and then they want to leave and if you start losing your key people at that time , the whole process comes to a standstill
it 's only later that you 'll realize that insecurity amongst your personnel has a strong influence on the development of the car , " she said
" we had to make sure that we could keep the company going , secure funding
" with two young drivers , @entity70 and rookie @entity71 , @entity34 have had a number of points - scoring results this season and currently lie seventh in @entity5 's constructors ' world championship table
in helping to steer the team to safety , as a team and business , @entity1 has also been involved in moving forwards the attitude to women in the sport
" i think people , not the teams but others especially media , they do n't ask a woman a question relating to performance , " she said
" the questions i get are normally very strategic questions about the company , the team , where @entity5 is going but never how the race was and what i feel about the drivers
but that 's changing now
it 's interesting to see how people take a while to get used to these kinds of questions to women
" when she set another first last year -- the first woman to attend an @entity110 press conference -- many men from other teams told her they were embarrassed that it had taken so long
realizing the gender gap needed to be closed the sport 's governing body , @entity110 , set up the @entity117 last year , in which @entity1 is taking a leading role
" we are realizing that to a certain age there a lot of young girls driving in car series and then suddenly , when it gets into the next category , it drops off
a lot of that is to do with the whole social set up they have , " she said
@entity132 , the head of @entity5 , has said a woman could be his successor , but @entity1 intends to be with @entity34 for a long time to come , improving the team 's performance
it 's also possible a woman could be behind the wheel of an @entity5 car in the not - too - distant future
" from the physical side of it , i do n't see why a woman can not be in @entity5 , " she said .
