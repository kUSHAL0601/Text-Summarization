-- there 's no need to worry about another @entity3
the name has now been retired from the official list of names for @entity9 tropical storms , the @entity4 said friday
officials decided @entity3 caused so much death and destruction when it hit the @entity13 and the @entity15 @entity14 in october last year that the name should be removed from the rotating list , according to organization spokeswoman @entity18
starting in 2018 , the next year that @entity3 was due on the list again as the " s " name in the annual alphabetical rundown of storm names , the name will be replaced with @entity24 , @entity18 said
the @entity4 is a @entity25 agency that maintains the list of @entity9 tropical storms and decides which names to retire
names are removed from the list " if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity , " according to the @entity15 @entity37
other names on the retired list include @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48
@entity3 developed last october and moved through @entity49 and @entity50 before hitting @entity51 , where it left 51 people dead
the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm but strengthened again to a category 2 hurricane as it crept up the @entity15 @entity14
@entity3 was a huge storm , with winds extending 175 miles from its eye , making it much larger than most storms of its type
much of the damage it caused was while the storm was still out at sea
by the time @entity3 did make landfall again -- as a post-tropical cyclone , on the southern coast of @entity73 -- it had become known as @entity3 for the combination of weather events and disasters that it brought about
the storm killed at least 113 people in the @entity15 and 18 in @entity81 and is one of the costliest tropical cyclones on record
@entity0 's @entity85 contributed to this report .
