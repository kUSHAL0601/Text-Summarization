-- @entity1 , a real estate management secretary living in the @entity2 , has already decided upon her final resting place
like many , she wants to be buried in a cemetery with her loved ones
her loved ones just happen to be her four cats and one dog
@entity8 , 65 , never thought she would be able to be buried in a pet cemetery but a new regulation enacted by the @entity12 @entity11 officially permits pet cemeteries to inter the cremated remains , or " cremains , " of pet owners along with their pets
" a sizable segment of the @entity12 community articulated a desire to be able to have their cremains buried with their pet remains , " stated the formal " notice of adoption " published in the official @entity26 register wednesday
" no evidence suggests that permitting this practice will harm cemeteries for human remains
" under the regulation , effective august 2 , pet cemeteries can accept human cremains for burial but can not charge a separate fee for those remains or advertise their human - remains burial services
the state set those rules to make it clear pet cemeteries were not engaging in " the operation of a cemetery for human remains
" @entity12 is one of a handful of states that has made formal regulations regarding human remains in pet cemeteries
" most states have not addressed this specifically
it 's very much a state of flux right now , " said @entity52 , an attorney and funeral director based in @entity54 , @entity55
@entity52 also is a consultant for the @entity57 and the @entity58
@entity59 currently is proposing a similar regulation allowing pet cemeteries to be added to existing human cemeteries
additionally , @entity63 is one of few states that allow human bodies to be buried on pet cemeteries without having to be cremated , according to @entity52
the effort to formally allow human remains to be buried in @entity12 pet cemeteries began in 2011 after @entity72 officer @entity71 wanted to be buried with his deceased dogs in @entity74 in upstate @entity74 , @entity12
the pet cemetery , established in 1896 , had been allowing human - remains interment for decades
" our records indicate it was being done since early 1920s , " @entity78 , the cemetery 's director , said of the practice
" we were doing it all along
a couple of years ago , the @entity12 [ state ] @entity85 asked us to cease the procedure to take a closer look
" eventually the state decided in favor of people who wanted to rest eternally with their mascots
and it was the growing demand of owners wanting to be buried with their pets that sparked government attention , said @entity52
" it 's been going on for so many years and no one has ever said anything , " said @entity52
" it 's going to happen , so why not allow it to happen and regulate it
it 's just a matter of time before states start regulating this more and more
" the decision covers all pet cemeteries in @entity26
once @entity8 found out about the new regulation , her mind was made up
" my decision was set in stone right then , that i knew i would be cremated and i would be buried with my pets , my babies , " she said
for decades , @entity8 enjoyed their company
her dog , @entity120 , and three of her cats , @entity123 , @entity124 , and @entity125 are all buried at @entity74
she and another cat , @entity127 , will join them one day
" they 're my children , they 're my babies , i love them , " she said
" when they live with you , when you raise them , they 're your family
" @entity12 ferret fans find foothold as city reconsiders ban
