@entity1 police shot a homeless man in the back and killed him , and it was all caught on gruesome detail in a police video
it is just one more in a long line of police killings that has the city 's @entity9 on the verge of federal oversight
@entity13 , a mentally disturbed man who friends say was attempting to camp out in the foothills above @entity1 one night in march because city homeless shelters had closed , was holding two small camping knives
officers negotiated with him for five hours , eventually winning agreement from @entity13 to leave the makeshift -- and illegal -- campsite
then a police stun grenade went off , @entity13 , 38 , turned his back and three shots were fired
police video shows @entity13 on his stomach on the ground , wheezing for breath as officers sic a dog on his legs and fire bean bag rounds at him
he was already mortally wounded
an autopsy on @entity13 found he was shot in the back
the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide
the horrific encounter , routinely recorded as part of police protocol , is now a key part of an ongoing drama in @entity43 's largest city -- a series of protests against the police and city officials
federal officials are close to a deal that would have them supervising the @entity51
records show that 26 people have been killed by city police in @entity1 since 2010 , a per capita rate of officer - involved deaths higher than @entity58 and @entity59
forty people have been wounded by police over the same period of time
so far , the city has paid out $ 30 million in settlements and officials acknowledge that amount will grow
in a report written before @entity13 's shooting , the @entity68 @entity67 blamed the @entity9 for poor training and said " we find that the department engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force during the course of arrests and other detentions in violation of the @entity80
" @entity13 's death has been added to the list of questionable killings
in april 2011 , a young @entity1 man -- whose parents had contacted police because he had mental health issues -- was killed in his own backyard by two plainclothes police
the officers had come to the home of @entity92 on an arrest warrant issued the month before
they said he was armed and shot him in the back as they wrestled on the ground
@entity92 ' parents , @entity98 and @entity99 , say he was holding a broomstick , which he laid down when police approached
they sued police , and a judge awarded them $ 6 million in a civil judgment , saying the police testimony was " not credible
" the @entity1 district attorney , @entity107 , cleared the two officers in the @entity92 killing
she has cleared every other police officer involved in a killing during her last 13 years in office
police chief @entity113 has been on the job for only about three months
initially , he called @entity13 's shooting " justified " but tells @entity116 that he spoke " prematurely , and i should n't have
" @entity113 says he is " holding people to a higher degree of culpability , " but he is also facing @entity67 oversight
report : @entity1 police have ' pattern ' of excessive , deadly force
