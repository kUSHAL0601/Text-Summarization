-- less than a month after suffering serious burns in a propane grill accident , sports broadcasting pioneer @entity1 returned to tv tuesday , hosting @entity7 's historic @entity6
storm , host of @entity10 's morning " @entity11 , " was using a propane gas grill outside her @entity14 home three weeks ago when it exploded , @entity17 said , causing her first - and second - degree burns
storm lost her eyebrows , eyelashes and much of her hair , according to the network
" ca n't begin to thank you all enough for your kindness and support , " storm tweeted tuesday before the parade
on monday she tweeted , " especially thankful this @entity28 's ! " the only on - camera evidence of her accident was @entity8 's bandaged left hand , which was visible at the beginning of the parade broadcast
" the healing process has begun , and you look as good as ever , " said her co-host , @entity34 , @entity8 's former partner at @entity10
" the best medicine is being with you , " she said
in an interview with @entity17 's @entity40 , @entity8 described the accident
she checked on the propane grill on a chilly night and discovered the flame had been blown out
" the cover of the grill was open so i assumed ... that there would n't be any gas in the air
well , propane is actually heavier than air and especially in cold weather it tends to sit on top of the grill , pool inside , " she said
" so the second i relit the flame -- after i turned the gas off ... it was a wall of fire , a huge explosion
so much force that it blew the doors of the grill completely off
" a neighbor clear across the street had thought a tree had fallen through his roof , that 's how loud the explosion was , and it happened in a split second , " she said
" and immediately i was on fire , so my hair was on fire , my chest and the whole top of my shirt was on fire
i did n't know what to do other than -- i 'm left handed -- reach and just get the shirt off of me as quickly as possible
" i yelled inside to my 15 - year - old daughter who was in the kitchen , ' @entity80 's on fire ! you have to call 911 ! ' " @entity8 said , becoming choked up
before tuesday 's @entity6 broadcast , she spent an hour in the makeup room and wore false eyelashes and hair extensions , she said
at one point during the parade broadcast , @entity8 added a personal note as a float honoring the parade 's president -- a nurse -- passed by
" thanks to all the great nurses at @entity96 " who have " been to my house every day for the last couple of weeks helping me be here today , " storm said
celebrating its 124th year , the parade has made @entity101 famous with its magnificent , colorful floats decorated with rose and other flower petals , stems and leaves
the parade 's theme this year was " oh , the places you 'll go , " a tip of the hat to children 's author dr. @entity112
related : @entity115 and @entity116 marching bands unite for @entity6 an @entity118 native and @entity120 alum , @entity8 pioneered her way into the world of sports journalism
she began her career in the early ' 80s , when the tv sports industry hired few women
" i literally could n't get anyone to hire me , " she told @entity127 in 2009
" having a woman do sports was seen as too risky
" her persistence led to on - air sports jobs at @entity0 and @entity133 -- where she covered high - profile events including the @entity135 , baseball 's @entity136 and the @entity139 tennis championship
later , @entity8 hosted @entity141 ' " @entity140 , " where she transcended sports and interviewed newsmakers such as @entity144 and @entity145
storm , who was born with a port wine - stain birthmark underneath her left eye , founded a charitable organization that helps children with debilitating and disfiguring vascular birthmarks
@entity0 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .
