stop letting yourself be " pimped
" and for heaven 's sake , stop licking sledgehammers , @entity5
that 's the advice from @entity8 singer @entity7 , who 's penned a motherly , if expletive - laden open letter to former @entity11 star @entity5 in the wake of a controversial video music awards show performance and the video for her latest single , " @entity9
" " nothing but harm will come in the long run , from allowing yourself to be exploited , and it is absolutely not in any way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women , for you to send across the message that you are to be valued ( even by you ) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent , " the 46 - year - old singer says in the letter posted on her official website
confessions of pop 's wildest child @entity5 , 20 , was the subject of widespread scorn in august , when she danced provocatively in a skimpy outfit during @entity39 's @entity38 show
soon after , she released the video for her latest single , in which she rides a wrecking ball while nude and suggestively licks a sledgehammer
gauging reaction to @entity7 's open letter to @entity5 " i am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led you to believe , or encouraged you in your own belief , that it is in any way ' cool ' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos , " @entity7 wrote
" it is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped , whether it 's the music business or yourself doing the pimping
" in a @entity59 article , @entity5 compared her look in the " @entity9 " video to @entity7 's style in her iconic 1990 video for " nothing compares 2 @entity65 " but @entity7 said she chose the shaved - head look in direct defiance of music industry executives who wanted her to present a sexier appearance
@entity5 and @entity72 's engagement is off she said the music industry does n't care much about @entity5
" they will prostitute you for all you are worth , and cleverly make you think it 's what you wanted , " she said
' @entity5 : @entity78 ' : five takeaways while @entity5 has n't directly commented on the letter , she appeared to respond thursday with a pair of tweets
one made apparent references to @entity7 's previous struggles with mental illness , and the other showed a picture of @entity7 tearing up a picture of @entity91 in 1992
@entity7 was in the news in 2011 , when her online efforts to find a " sweet sex - starved man " went viral
@entity95 on his daughter : ' that 's still my @entity5 '
