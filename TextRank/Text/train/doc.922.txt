@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is to offer its @entity5 users the chance to use a web browser other than its own
the agreement with the @entity9 ends a long - running dispute over the @entity13 software giant 's dominant market position
earlier this year @entity5 regulators said the inclusion of a browser with its @entity18 operating system was a likely violation of @entity5 antitrust law , despite the fact it had done so for over a decade
given @entity3 's dominance of the @entity24 operating system market -- with 100 million @entity5 users of @entity18 according to the @entity26 -- the @entity9 argued on its web site that bundling the two products together deprives consumers of choice and results in fewer innovative products on the market
as of monday users will be able to select an alternative browser from a pop - up menu or opt to stick with internet explorer
according to @entity3 , this " browser choice screen " will present users with a list of leading browsers -- including @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity44 's @entity43 -- presented in random order , in keeping with its agreement with the @entity9
the pop - up screen provides three options : 1
click on " install " to install one of the listed browsers
click on " tell me more " to get more information about any of the browsers -- these links are provided by each browser provider
click on " @entity62 " to review the choice screen the next time you log onto your computer
@entity3 says the screen will be offered as an automatic download through @entity65 for @entity66 , @entity67 and its latest operating system , @entity18 7
the software update will be installed automatically , or will prompt users to download or install it , depending on which operating system is running and the settings for @entity65 .
