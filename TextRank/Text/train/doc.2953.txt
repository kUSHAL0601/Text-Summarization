-- @entity2 intelligence officials would not rule out the possibility on tuesday that admitted @entity5 leaker @entity4 has been meeting secretly with @entity7 authorities , who have given him asylum from @entity2 prosecution
the subject of @entity7 dominated a @entity13 hearing , featuring testimony from the director of national intelligence , as well as the heads of the @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19
@entity21 @entity20 told lawmakers it was " certainly a possibility " @entity7 intelligence services have spoken with @entity4 , the former @entity5 contractor whose disclosure of sensitive surveillance methods has caused a political uproar
" i would find it incredulous if they did n't , " said @entity20 , about any efforts to influence @entity4 by the @entity30 , @entity7 's state security organization
at least a half - dozen lawmakers raised broader concerns about @entity7 's global influence in areas like : -- the civil war in @entity38 , where @entity7 has long supported the regime of president @entity40
-- support of @entity43 's current leadership , whose policies have prompted massive citizen demonstrations in the capital @entity48 in recent weeks
-- the @entity49 , which begin later this week in the @entity51 resort of @entity52
@entity2 officials have raised concerns about what they call a lack of security cooperation to ensure the safety of @entity2 athletes and interests
" i do think that this is somewhat reflective of current leadership in @entity7 , " said @entity20
" i think there is clearly a desire to return to great global power status
and i think that colors the behavior of the @entity7 government in the pursuit of their interests in which they are competitive with us
" @entity13 chairman @entity73 pressed fbi director @entity74 about whether journalists or news organizations could be held accountable for publishing sensitive material @entity4 might still have in his possession
documents he has admitted taking from secure @entity5 databases were exposed last summer , revealing the existence of vast @entity2 surveillance of electronic metadata relating to phone records and e-mail
" so if i 'm a newspaper reporter for , fill - in - the - blank , and i sell stolen material , is that legal because i 'm a newspaper reporter ? " @entity73 , a @entity88 @entity87 , asked
" right , if you 're a newspaper reporter and you 're hocking stolen jewelry , it 's still a crime , " @entity74 replied
@entity73 then asked : " and if i 'm hocking stolen classified material that i 'm not legally in possession of , for personal gain and profit , is that not a crime ? " @entity74 responded : " i think that 's a harder question , because it involves a newsgathering function
it could have @entity102 implications
" he would not talk specifics , calling the @entity4 leaks an " active investigation
" @entity20 later said less than 10 percent of the documents @entity4 allegedly took with him overseas has to do with " domestic surveillance
" he also had a personal message for @entity4 , who has been charged in federal court with espionage
" @entity4 , for his part , claims that he 's won and that his mission is accomplished , " said @entity20
" if that 's so , i call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to @entity2 security
" @entity120 , director of the @entity121 , highlighted concern over the @entity49 , and whether @entity124 fundamentalists in disputed regions of @entity7 -- or other groups -- could launch deadly attacks on selected targets
@entity7 security forces have cracked down on suspected militants in the restive @entity132 republic of @entity133 and elsewhere in recent weeks , after twin suicide bombings in the city of @entity136 in december
" the primary threat , from a terrorism perspective , comes from @entity139 , probably the most prominent terrorist group in @entity7
it 's made its intent clear to seek to carry out attacks in the run - up to the games , " said @entity141
" we think the greater danger from a terrorist perspective is in potential for attacks to occur outside of the actual venues for the games themselves in the area surrounding @entity52 or outside of @entity52 in the region
" against that backdrop , was the announcement on tuesday that @entity2 ambassador to @entity7 @entity160 would leave his post later this month
he cited a desire to return to his family in @entity165
@entity160 has been a controversial figure in @entity7 , with some state - run media viewing him with suspicion for his outspoken support of pro-democracy groups
one @entity2 senator had tough words for @entity7 , while praising @entity160 for his efforts to implement president @entity174 's " reset " policy to improve relations with @entity176
" i have been deeply disturbed by the campaign of harassment the @entity7 government initiated and supported against @entity182 throughout his admirable service in @entity176 , " said sen. @entity177 , an @entity178 @entity87
" in my view , such conduct by the @entity7 government warrants concern for other @entity2 officials working in the country
