-- when i was a teenager in @entity2 , i would spend time with my father watching tennis on television
this is how we bonded
we were n't a sporty family but tennis was a sport my dad loved to watch
it was through my dad 's enthusiasm that i started to recognize the players he would paint as personalities , not just athletes
and there was always one that stood out for my dad : @entity21
on the court , @entity21 was a quiet but immense force , a counterpoint to @entity24 and @entity25 , the all - american tennis heroes
growing up in communist @entity27 he appeared to be the opposite of these talented but at times histrionic players
so different in demeanor and background that that it lead @entity32 in 1987 to describe him as " the champion that nobody cares about
" @entity21 was happy for @entity24 and @entity25 to take the spotlight choosing instead to let his game do the talking
my father would point this out and say " look at him always keeping his cool , that 's what makes him great
" for this man from @entity45 , a city near the @entity48 - @entity47 border , focusing on the game was all he knew
both his parents were successful players ; his mother was ranked 2nd in the country , his father 15th
" i just hung around the older kids and snuck onto the court and that 's how i got into it , " he told me
" there was not much hope in @entity27 growing up without doing great at sports so i think that was a motivation for a lot of the tennis players at the time
" when he was 21 he moved to the @entity65 and just three years later he won his first @entity67 title at the @entity68 where he defeated @entity24 in five sets
" i do n't remember much of it , " he said during our interview
" i was very tired
i just know that throughout the fifth set i felt i should take advantage of it because with @entity24 you could never underestimate him because of his strength
" and that was just the beginning
in his career , @entity21 would go on to win 94 career singles titles including 8 @entity67 tournaments , and would spend 270 weeks as @entity85
only @entity86 and @entity87 have beaten that record
today the 53 - year - old is best known for being the coach of the current @entity91 , @entity92
the main thing he imparts to the @entity96 player is preparation
win or lose , if you 're prepared and you do your best no one can take that away from you
" you just train and through training and repetition you hit the shot and execute it so many times that all of a sudden you can do it under pressure and that 's where the confidence comes from , " he said
i asked him if a champion or greatness is something that can be taught
he said it all just comes down to " a lot of work , a lot of talent , a lot of luck
" before winning the @entity121 and @entity123 title last year many had questioned @entity92 's self - confidence
but @entity21 believes that while mental strength is key , so are stamina and physical strength
" these days if the top guys do n't play their best in the early rounds they can lose , " he said
away from the tennis court and coaching , this father of five spends time with his other love : golf
believe it or not when it comes to competing @entity21 says he still feels nervous
" it 's because i care
if you do n't get nervous , you do n't care about how you do , " he said
two of his daughters also play golf -- choosing it over tennis partly because of the pressure of having to live up to the @entity21 name
his advice to them is the same advice his gives @entity92 : " when it 's going good take it and be humble and when it 's not going good , accept it as well and just keep training
stay level - headed either way
do n't get too high or too low
" similar words my father often told me
@entity154 became more than an interview
it was an opportunity to bring to life a man my father always loved watching and in doing so reliving a time i treasure today .
