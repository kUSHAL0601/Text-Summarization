-- nearly 800 people have died in a recent malaria outbreak in northern @entity3 , one described by public health officials as " a severe and sudden epidemic
" doctors treating more than 12,000 victims of the disease say those who died in the past three weeks were mostly young children and pregnant women
heavy rains have flooded the region around @entity12 , giving mosquitoes ideal breeding conditions
" this is a severe and sudden epidemic
i see no end in sight , " dr. @entity16 , a malaria specialist treating more than 2,000 victims in @entity12 , told @entity0
wednesday , a panel of @entity3 journalists on state radio criticized the government for not spreading the news about the outbreak and not requesting international aid
according to the @entity29 , more than 12,000 people are seriously ill and have been admitted to hospitals
but there are fewer than 10 treatment centers are available to help those who 've contracted the mosquito - borne illness , and thousands of children and women are forced to sleep in the open or in overcrowded rooms without mosquito nets
" three of my children have died here
here is my wife lying helplessly with drips tied to this tree , " @entity43 told @entity0 , pointing out the conditions at the overcrowded @entity12 regional hospital
" only a few qualified physicians are available in the regional government hospital to handle malaria cases
this can not yield a favorable result , " @entity16 warned
the @entity55 -- a body governing the medical core in the @entity59 nation -- estimates a ratio of one doctor to every 40,000 patients
less than 1,000 physicians currently work in the country , the council says , and toil under poor conditions and low wages
" this is really a mess to the @entity74 government , " @entity68 , a newspaper publisher in @entity70 , told @entity0 by phone
the government footed the bill to transport thousands of voters to parliamentary and municipal elections earlier this month , he said , but is not transporting dying patients to other areas with less - crowded hospitals
observers have criticized president @entity83 of ignoring the mounting malaria death toll as he focuses on lavish preparations to celebrate his 31 years in the presidency november 6
" even the propaganda state radio @entity89 is talking against this , " said political analyst @entity87
health experts blame the upsurge of malaria cases on the poor use of malaria nets that were distributed free of charge among nearly 9 million @entity3 in 2010
but a dwindling economy and the scarcity of food has forced some families to use the nets for other purposes
" there is no reason for me to sleep under this net while my children need food to eat , " @entity104 , a local fisherman , told @entity0 as he demonstrated how he could use the nets to catch fish for his family
climate change researcher @entity112 said recent heavy rains and flooding in @entity74 have transformed villages into mosquito breeding grounds
@entity118 continues to spill water over its banks and no levee has been created to stop the flood , @entity112 said
" this should be taken seriously , " he added
public health experts are now targeting the heads of families in a daily campaign to stave off the malaria epidemic in @entity12
" sleep under the mosquito bed net
do not use them as fishing nets , " one campaign banner read
but state public health officials are raising fears that the death toll could reach the thousands in the next few weeks if international support is not received soon
more than 660,000 people around the world died from malaria in 2010 , according to the @entity140 .
