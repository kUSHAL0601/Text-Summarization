@entity2 models have @entity9 passing close to @entity4 's @entity15 on thursday night , the @entity13 said in an 8 p.m. wednesday forecast
" only a small westward deviation of the track to the west would bring the core of the hurricane to the coast , " it said
the center extended hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings northward through @entity7 on wednesday evening and said the storm 's track has shifted slightly to the west , closer to @entity4 's @entity30
mandatory evacuation orders were issued for @entity32 , on @entity4 's @entity15 , and @entity33 , as well as @entity34
@entity9 had been downgraded to a category 3 hurricane earlier wednesday but was judged to be a category 4 in the @entity13 's forecast on wednesday at 5 p.m. @entity9 's maximum sustained winds have increased to near 135 mph and the storm is growing , the @entity13 said
tropical storm force winds are expected to reach parts of the @entity4 coast by thursday afternoon , with hurricane force winds arriving by late thursday , the center said
@entity0 meteorologist @entity45 said @entity9 is expected to make its closest pass to @entity30 around 2 a.m. friday as a category 3 storm , with hurricane force winds of up to 75 mph expected on the @entity15
large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet are possible along the coast , with possible storm surge of 2 to 4 feet , along with 3 to 4 inches of rainfall , @entity45 said
isolated tornadoes and waterspouts are possible
tropical storm force winds are expected to reach the coast from @entity57 to @entity58 by early friday
@entity45 said that @entity9 will make its closest pass to @entity58 on friday afternoon as a category 2 hurricane
the long duration of tropical storm force winds threaten widespread power outages in parts of the @entity66 and the @entity67 , he said
tropical storm force winds will arrive on @entity7 ' @entity68 by friday afternoon
@entity45 said that hurricane force winds are possible there later on friday , with @entity9 making its closest pass to @entity68 on friday evening as a category 1 hurricane
forecasters have issued a hurricane warning for the area from @entity77 , @entity4 , northeast to the @entity4 - @entity57 border , including @entity79 and @entity80 sounds
on wednesday evening a tropical storm warning for the area between @entity83 , @entity4 , and @entity77 , was extended from the @entity4 - @entity57 border to @entity84 , @entity58
a hurricane watch stretched from the @entity4 - @entity57 line up to @entity87 , @entity5 , while another hurricane watch covered a chunk of the @entity7 coast , from @entity92 's hole to @entity93 , and includes @entity94 and @entity95
a tropical storm watch extends from @entity84 , @entity58 to @entity97 , @entity7 , encompassing @entity98 and @entity99
a tropical storm watch also covers the area from north of @entity93 , @entity7 , to the mouth of the @entity103
because of @entity9 's size , effects of the storm are expected to be widely felt
@entity2 - force winds extend outward up to 90 miles ( 150 kilometers ) from the center , and tropical storm - force winds up to 200 miles ( 325 kilometers )
as of 8 p.m. wednesday , @entity9 was centered about 565 miles ( 910 kilometers ) south - southeast of @entity30 , @entity4 , the @entity13 said
it was moving northwest at about 18 mph ( 30 kph )
overnight tuesday , a @entity111 buoy recorded a wave with a 50 - foot peak associated with @entity9 , @entity13 director @entity110 told reporters
" the buoy survived it just fine and it 's still reporting , " he said
on friday , @entity9 is forecast to move away from the @entity15 and northward , @entity0 meteorologist @entity118 said
it is not expected to make a direct hit on the coast from @entity57 to @entity58 , but heavy rain , high surf and gusty winds are likely
friday night , @entity9 will make its closest pass to @entity68 , @entity7 , and the outlying islands of @entity95 and @entity94
again , no direct hit is forecast , but any deviation could bring @entity9 's center over the area , @entity118 said
@entity9 is expected to make a direct landfall over southern @entity133 , @entity134 , on saturday morning as a strong category 1 hurricane
@entity137 administrator @entity136 said wednesday he had briefed president @entity138 on what the agency is doing in preparation for the storm
teams are in place or on standby to assist each state along the @entity12 , he said , and supplies were being moved into two incident support bases to be available if they are needed
several airlines said wednesday that fliers to and from cities along the eastern seaboard , from @entity152 , @entity153 , to @entity154 , @entity155 , could reschedule travel in coming days without penalty
though they have not announced cancellations , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 said they would waive reschedule fees for such travelers
on @entity32 -- a long sliver of land reachable only by ferry -- not everyone was planning to flee as @entity9 approached
" a lot of times when [ residents ] evacuate , it 's hard to get back on the island , " said @entity169 , who tends bar at @entity171 on @entity32
" it 's simpler to just stay here and kind of ride it out
" " none of my neighbors are leaving , " one man on @entity32 told @entity0 affiliate @entity181
" we 're just going to hang in and ride her out
" some tourists did n't seem deterred either
" they 'll throw us off the island , " one woman told @entity181
" that 's all right
we 'll just camp somewhere else
" however , @entity191 , who co-owns the @entity193 restaurant on @entity32 with her husband , @entity194 , said she has made plans to go to @entity196 , @entity4 , where her mother is
the couple are natives of @entity200 , @entity201 , who moved to @entity32 10 years ago
their restaurant specializes in creole cuisine
some of @entity207 's relatives in @entity200 who lived through @entity209 are urging them to evacuate , she said
" they 're probably more nervous than we are , " she said
" it wakes you up a little bit to the fact that it can be " dangerous
once the wind gets to 50 mph , she said , the ferries stop running and " you 're stuck
" officials are " running the ferries as fast as they can , " she said , but some visitors are dragging their feet -- understandably , since it means cutting their vacation short
@entity9 is also dealing the couple an economic blow , they said , as it 's considered the last big week of business for the summer tourism season
the restaurant was busy tuesday night , @entity191 said , but closed on wednesday once the evacuation order was issued
@entity207 said he will leave if @entity9 becomes a category 4 storm , and said he is " a little bit nervous
... a 4 would be devastating
" " we are concerned about the storm , and it is important that people are n't here who do n't understand the [ potential ] flooding issues , " said @entity233 , the owner of @entity234 and tackle on @entity32
but for regular residents , he said , the threat of hurricanes is " just part of living here
" staff members of @entity33 in @entity4 also ordered an evacuation tuesday , according to park superintendent @entity249
the park will be closed to all visitors beginning at 5 p.m. wednesday , until further notice
@entity9 is approaching the @entity253 just ahead of @entity254 , a holiday weekend that many families spend at the beach
" unfortunately , they 're just getting started with their vacation and now they have to turn around and go , " bartender @entity169 said
" however , i think most people do understand why
" rip currents and dangerous surf will threaten beachgoers all along the @entity12 , @entity118 said
the hurricane already dealt a glancing blow to @entity153 and the @entity267 , downing trees and knocking out power lines
the hurricane center said @entity9 's center is set to pass east and northeast of the @entity273 on wednesday and wednesday night
a tropical storm warning for @entity275 in the central @entity273 was discontinued wednesday afternoon
sixty - six members of the @entity277 have been told to report wednesday night for storm response duty
they will report to facilities in eastern @entity4 , but away from the coast , said spokesman maj. @entity282
after the storm has moved away , they will assess damage and formulate a response , he said
@entity137 has urged those living in the region to prepare for the storm , stock up on supplies and have a plan in case it becomes necessary
besides @entity137 's @entity296 website , people can use @entity137 's mobile application , which links to the @entity13 , to stay up to date on information
tips include developing a family communications plan , putting together a kit with food and water for 72 hours , and staying informed of risks in the area
meanwhile , @entity2 9 was upgraded to @entity307 on wednesday night , with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph , the center said
the storm is located in the far eastern @entity310 approximately 1,635 miles east - southeast of the @entity312 's @entity311
the depression had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph ( 55 kph ) and was heading west at 15 mph ( 24 kph )
it is likely the depression will become @entity307 within 48 hours , forecasters said
and @entity317 was moving out into the open @entity310 on wednesday , and the center discontinued all watches and warnings related to the storm
@entity0 's @entity322 and @entity323 contributed to this report .
