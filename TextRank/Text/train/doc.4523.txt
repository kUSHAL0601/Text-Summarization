@entity0 , @entity1 -- international backing for @entity5 forces battling @entity7 militants in @entity1 gathered momentum tuesday , as @entity10 military aircraft flew @entity5 troops and supplies into the @entity14 nation and @entity16 's lawmakers voted to lend support
the @entity10 mission began monday with two flights and is expected to continue for several days , @entity19 spokesman @entity18 told @entity2 from @entity22
@entity10 c - 17 planes are taking off from southern @entity5 loaded with @entity5 cargo and dropping it off in the @entity1 capital , @entity27 , he said
the @entity10 support is at the request of the @entity5 , who intervened in @entity1 11 days ago after a plea for help from its government
the @entity5 are involved in the fight because @entity1 once was under the country 's control , and because islamists have been threatening to turn the once - peaceful democracy into a haven for international terrorists
@entity16 's lower house of parliament approved sending 15 to 24 military instructors who will work alongside the @entity44 in training @entity1 forces
it also agreed to provide logistical support to include at least two cargo planes
the time frame for @entity16 to provide the assistance is not yet decided
leaders from several other countries have already offered troops or logistical support
@entity54 and @entity55 are deploying military transport aircraft , while @entity57 is set to deploy soldiers as part of the @entity61 - mandated @entity14 force to fight the insurgents
meanwhile , the battle continues to push back rebel forces on the ground
on the road between @entity68 and @entity27 on tuesday , a @entity2 crew saw a large column of @entity5 mechanized infantry barreling toward northern @entity1
dozens of armored fighting vehicles packed with supplies appeared headed for the front line of the battle against @entity7 fighters
on monday , @entity1 forces recaptured the central town of @entity79 , as well as the town of @entity81 , to the northeast , from @entity84 - linked rebels
a spokesman for the @entity1 military told @entity2 it had won control of the latter without the aid of @entity5 air support
in his address to the @entity61 tuesday , @entity91 ban ki - moon said " political , security and humanitarian efforts " are needed to meet the challenges faced by @entity1
" working with @entity14 and international partners , we must do our part to help fully restore @entity1 's constitutional order and territorial integrity , " he said
" meanwhile , we continue to work toward an integrated strategy for the @entity102 that would address the mix of extremism , poverty , drought and governance challenges that is causing such profound misery and dangerous insecurity
" @entity102 is the area along the southern edge of the @entity112
monday 's military gains for @entity1 forces came as the government extended the country 's state of emergency for another three months
" this advance by the @entity1 army toward the cities held by their enemies constitutes a certain military success for the @entity27 government and for @entity5 forces , who have intervened in support of these operations , " @entity5 defense minister @entity117 said
he stated his " total confidence " in @entity5 forces in a mission that " aims to restore sovereignty to @entity1 on its territory and to prevent the risk of the constitution of a terrorist sanctuary in the heart of @entity14
" @entity5 currently has 2,150 soldiers on @entity1 soil , with another 1,000 troops supporting the operation from elsewhere , the defense ministry said
between 700 and 800 @entity14 troops from @entity143 , @entity57 , @entity144 and @entity145 have arrived in @entity1 , according to @entity147 spokeswoman @entity146
@entity149 troops and up to 2,000 from @entity150 are on the way , she said
journalists are still barred from traveling into northern @entity1 , which has been under the control of militant islamists for several months
but the @entity2 crew was able to enter @entity79 on monday , where it was told by @entity1 and @entity5 forces that @entity159 left after they were hit directly in one of their makeshift camps by the @entity5 and @entity1
the scene after one battle included burned - out armored vehicles and a truck that at one point belonged to the @entity159
a @entity1 officer , col. @entity167 , told @entity2 that the @entity159 were using sophisticated weapons like he had never seen before
he believes they originated in @entity169
as the news crew drove into town , the dusty streets in the extremely poor area were mostly empty except for military vehicles and @entity5 and @entity1 troops
whatever trucks had belonged to the @entity7 rebels were bombed and burned out
destroyed high - caliber weapons were seen in the vehicles
a @entity5 colonel , exhausted from fighting and who wished not to be named , told @entity2 that foreign fighters -- including some who are @entity185 -- had been pushed out of the area
@entity167 told @entity2 the fight against the rebels was very hard , but he is focused on " preserving the national integrity " of @entity1
@entity5 president @entity190 has said that if his country had not intervened , @entity1 " probably would have fallen into the hands of terrorists
" @entity5 involvement began the day after militants said january 10 that they had seized the city of @entity197 , east of @entity79 in central @entity1 , and were poised to advance south toward @entity27
ethnic @entity198 who had returned to @entity1 well - armed from fighting for late @entity169 leader @entity199 staged a military coup last year against the @entity1 government
@entity159 extremists capitalized on the chaos , carved out a large haven in @entity1 's north and imposed a strict interpretation of @entity208 law
the @entity159 banned music , smoking , drinking and watching sports on television
they also destroyed historic tombs and shrines
those events stoked fear among global security experts that @entity1 could become a new hub for terrorism
meanwhile , the @entity221 warned that the humanitarian crisis in @entity1 is worsening
because @entity185 has closed its borders , people in the north are increasingly heading to the desert , where they will face harsh conditions and struggles over food and water with limited humanitarian assistance , the group said
" they can not stay where they are due to the grave insecurity caused by the conflict , " said @entity233 , head of the center 's @entity14 and @entity234
" yet the meager resources and the diminished coping abilities of the government and humanitarian actors means that they are faced with limited options
" many are fleeing on foot because they ca n't afford boats or buses , @entity233 said , and even if they do make it , they get there only to find the roads blocked
the violence could soon displace up to 700,000 in the country and around the region , said @entity257 , a spokeswoman for the @entity61 ' refugee agency
@entity2 's @entity259 and @entity260 reported from @entity1 and @entity261 from @entity262 ; @entity263 wrote and reported in @entity264
@entity265 contributed from @entity266 .
