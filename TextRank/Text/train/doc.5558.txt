-- a @entity5 " hate crime " that targeted an openly gay woman and that triggered responses from candlelight vigils locally to @entity11 postings of support nationwide was staged by the alleged victim , authorities said tuesday as they charged the woman with lying to police
@entity14 -- a former basketball player for the @entity15 who identifies herself as lesbian -- told police that three masked men entered her home on july 22 , stripped her , tied her down , and carved homophobic slurs into her body before attempting to set her and the house on fire
but the @entity27 said tuesday that " the physical evidence conflicted with @entity14 ' version of events " and that " extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies
" previously on @entity0 : woman speaks out after alleged hate crime @entity14 was arrested tuesday , police said
her attorney , @entity36 , told @entity0 tuesday night that @entity14 had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in , in exchange for a personal recognizance bond
" she did not have to post any money " to be released , @entity36 said , adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police
" she maintains her innocence
this has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to turn around and be charged , " @entity36 said
in a news release , police cited dna and pathologists ' examinations that did not substantiate @entity14 ' original statements , and changes in her story during the investigation
" these were serious allegations that garnered national attention and spread fear among local citizens , " the police statement said
" a great deal of time and resources were spent investigating @entity14 ' claims in hopes of identifying and arresting the three suspects in this case
" @entity78 , president of @entity79 based in @entity80 , organized a vigil that attracted over 1,000 people in the aftermath of the reported attack
for her , the news that it may have been a hoax is " a pretty big blow
" " i do n't feel betrayed as much as i feel sad for how , if this is really true ... there is a lot of things going on with her , " @entity78 said
" it leads to a bigger problem in our society that someone would do this
" @entity78 said she hopes people would not turn their backs on @entity14 now
the vigil she put together in @entity80 raised more than $ 1,800 , all of which was deposited in an account for @entity14
" we 'd like to get the funds returned to us so we can establish our own fund to support victims of anti-gay violence
@entity36 , @entity14 ' attorney , said he " knows nothing " about the fund or how much money might be in it
he said it was in place before he became @entity14 ' lawyer
according to the @entity27 complaint , @entity14 , 33 , provided information " she knew to be false " with the intent to " instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter
" @entity14 reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved " derogatory words " into her arms and abdomen and " a cross " in her chest
she told police she was then rolled onto her stomach where more cuts were made
but according to a deposition from @entity27 police investigator @entity138 filed as part of the complaint , @entity14 bedspread was " evenly placed on the bed and no apparent sign of a struggle
" a dna lab test found no evidence of blood on the bedspread
@entity145 also described a pair of white gloves found at the scene that @entity14 had said were not hers
" ms. @entity151 dna profile was the major contributor to the dna located on the inside of the gloves , " @entity145 said
furthermore , the deposition said , the @entity154 sent photos of @entity14 ' cuts to a forensic pathologist , who believed the wounds to be self - inflicted
" this opinion is based partially on the fact that the cuts appeared superficial and symmetrical , avoided sensitive areas of the body , ... are accessible to the victim and follow the victim 's frame of reference for reading and writing , " the deposition said
rumors had been circulating in recent weeks in @entity27 and on the internet due to the fact that police had yet to pinpoint any suspects
the urge to respond to rumors prompted @entity14 to give her one and only interview
" for people to think this does n't happen here , it does , " @entity14 told @entity0 affiliate @entity179 on july 27
" she refused to discuss the incident itself during that interview
@entity14 ' attorney at the time , @entity189 , told @entity0 her client was ready for a full interview early last week , but canceled saying " things have changed
" @entity189 said tuesday that she is no longer @entity14 ' attorney
according to neighbor @entity194 , @entity14 ' showed up on her doorstep bloodied in the early morning hours immediately following the alleged attack last month
" i was in shock , " @entity194 said soon after the incident
" she was naked , her hands were tied with zip ties
all i could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down
" @entity194 said she took the sobbing @entity14 inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911 .
