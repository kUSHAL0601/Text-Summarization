nobody is being charged in a drunken brawl that involved a white limousine full of members of @entity7 's family , police in @entity1 said thursday
but it sure sounds like things got out of hand , with the host of the september house party where it all happened saying the @entity14 got into a fight they " ended up losing
" the @entity16 released a report that includes more than two pages of details about the brawl , which happened after the former @entity23 vice presidential nominee 's family and friends showed up at another friend 's party
it details accusations that @entity29 punched the host in the face repeatedly , that @entity32 tried to start a fight with his father and more
here are some of the details -- wildly different , depending on who 's offering the information -- that officer @entity38 submitted in his official report : 1
when he arrived , a shirtless , " heavily intoxicated " and " belligerent at first " @entity32 , @entity7 's adult son , was about to step into a white limousine with his parents , @entity43 and @entity44
they 'd all been at the party at @entity48 's house
track told the officer some guys were " talking rudely " to his sisters and making them cry
so he stuck up for them
when one of his friends , identified only as @entity58 , got punched by one of the allegedly rude guys , the fight started
@entity44 said that 's when " everything escalated and it was a situation they could n't walk away from
@entity29 ended up on the ground during the fight
the @entity7 family said that 's because @entity48 knocked her down
@entity48 offered a different version of the story
he told the officer he wanted to press charges against @entity29 , who he said had told him " he does n't own this place and that she will kick his a- -
" after he tried to stop her from fighting
then , @entity48 said , @entity29 hit him
he said she could " hit him again if it makes her feel better and she does
" after six or so " pretty hard " punches , he said he grabbed her fist and @entity29 fell down
" at that time , " the officer reported , " he said several guys from the party stepped in to help him and a fight broke out and the @entity14 ended up losing
@entity29 " appeared heavily intoxicated and upset , " and explained that @entity48 " had drug her across the lawn by her legs and was calling her a [ expletive deleted ] and a slut
" she explained that another girl at the party had hit one of her sisters , @entity97 , and said that 's how things got started
track left the fight with a bloody mouth and injuries under his left eye and on his left elbow
@entity29 had some dirt on her knees
@entity48 " stated his face felt swollen , " but there were n't any " obvious injuries
" the @entity7 family would n't comment thursday on the report and the decision not to charge any of the brawl 's participants
but @entity7 did defend her daughter @entity29 in a sept. 19 @entity122 post
" i love my @entity29 ! " she wrote
" my straight - shooter is one of the strongest young women you 'll ever meet
i have to say this as a proud mama : right up there with their work ethic and heart for those less fortunate , my kids ' defense of family makes my heart soar ! " as you can imagine , they and my extended family have experienced so many things ( liberal media - driven ) that may have crushed others without a strong foundation of faith , and i 'm thankful for our friends ' prayer shield that surrounds them , allowing faith to remain their anchor
