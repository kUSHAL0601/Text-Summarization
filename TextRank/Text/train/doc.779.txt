@entity0 -- @entity3 house guest @entity2 appeared before a judge wednesday but stopped short of accepting a plea deal to settle drug and vandalism charges that stemmed from the january search of @entity3 's mansion
a prosecutor agreed to reduce a felony vandalism charge -- which was filed after the rapper allegedly pulled a jail phone off of a wall -- to a misdemeanor , but his lawyer asked for more time before entering a plea
the case was reset for april 30
@entity20 's investigators were looking for evidence that @entity3 , 20 , attacked a neighbor 's home with eggs in january when they arrested @entity3 's house guest for possession of suspected illegal drugs
a felony vandalism charge was added after @entity2 -- whose real name is @entity30 -- allegedly pulled a phone out of the wall in a jail holding area while waiting to be bailed out
lab tests confirmed one of the drugs in the 20 - year - old rapper 's possession was @entity40 , also known as @entity40 or @entity40 , a sheriff 's detective said
the prosecutor acknowledged in court wednesday that the phone damage did not meet the threshold for a felony vandalism charge
@entity30 was represented in court by lawyer @entity49 , who is also @entity3 's attorney
the @entity51 district attorney has yet to decide if @entity3 will be charged with vandalism for the egg attack
the prosecutor could decide to make it a felony case , since investigators said it caused an estimated $ 20,000 in damage to a @entity61 , @entity62 , mansion
it could also be prosecuted as just a misdemeanor because of the nature of the incident
@entity68 's detectives asked for a felony charge against @entity3 , but his lawyers argue that the egging was a childish prank
@entity3 egging ' a silly prank , ' not a felony , lawyers argue
