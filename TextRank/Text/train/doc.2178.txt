@entity0 -- emerging from a closed meeting with the heads of foreign militaries , president @entity2 told reporters the effort to dismantle the terror group @entity8 " is going to be a long - term campaign
" " there will be days of progress and there are going to be periods of setback , " he said , adding that an influx of fighters from outside the region joining @entity8 makes it a threat beyond the @entity15 and into the @entity16 defense chiefs from 22 nations fighting @entity8 met all day at a secure facility to discuss the current military operations and " the way ahead ' according to a senior @entity16 military official
the full coalition will be needed , according to @entity2
" we are going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer and we are going to have to continue on delivering the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected
" the meeting tuesday was chaired by general @entity37 , @entity16 chairman of the @entity38 , along with general @entity39 , commanding general of the @entity41 which is largely running the operations in both @entity43 and @entity44
president @entity2 attended for a portion near the end of the day at @entity48 just outside @entity0 , @entity0 @entity43 military officials were expected to attend
@entity44 opposition members were not invited because the meeting is for " sovereign nations " only , the official said
classified discussions are expected to take place on the current operations
there was expected , however , to be some discussion of arming and training moderate @entity44 opposition forces
@entity8 militants march on despite airstrikes , international outrage it was not expected that the coalition defense chiefs would discuss some significant change in strategy , the official said before the meetings got underway
" this meeting is to share our vision , discuss coordination and our common understanding of the way ahead
" the defense chiefs are not policymakers , so any significant changes in the mission would require a decision by governments on a political level
this is the fourth such meeting of coalition partners , but the largest gathering to date
similar meetings have been held in recent months in @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88
the military operation against @entity8 now does have a name but the @entity92 is not expected to reveal it until later this week , a @entity16 military official confirms to @entity1
the name will not be made public until a formal ' execution order ' covering the entire mission against @entity8 is published by the @entity92 's @entity38 perhaps as soon as wednesday
naming the operation is a fairly bureaucratic matter , but it is typically done in large scale or significant military operations as a means of providing a mechanism for everything from budgeting of funds to awarding of medals
the execution order will spell out these details , as well as potential command arrangements , and a formal military definition of the mission
