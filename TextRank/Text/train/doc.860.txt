-- @entity1 compiled his first double century after @entity3 again fell short of the landmark as @entity5 continued to punish @entity7 's bowlers on day two of the first cricket test in @entity9
@entity1 was unbeaten on 253 when the tourists declared on 558 - 6 in the final session on sunday , then @entity7 safely reached stumps at 25 - 0 in a clash between the top two teams in the five - day format
it is the highest score made by a @entity18 no. 3 batsman , and the highest by any from his country against @entity7
@entity1 extended his third - wicket partnership with @entity3 to a @entity18 record of 340 before his senior partner fell for 173 , having added just 14 to his overnight tally in a subdued second part of his innings
it was the first time any pair have put on a triple century in any matches between the two nations
@entity3 edged a delivery from off - spinner @entity32 onto his pads , and @entity35 took the catch at short leg to end a 351 - ball knock that put the all - rounder into third equal on the all - time test century - scoring list with 34
@entity1 then added another 108 with @entity41 , who made a brisk 53 off 88 deliveries , and rode his luck as he was dropped twice on 149 , as they broke @entity5 's record for the fourth wicket in matches between the two teams
@entity41 fell to part - time bowler @entity49 and then @entity32 removed @entity50 for just nine to have the @entity51 476 - 5 , but then @entity52 contributed 39 to a stand of 78 with @entity1 before becoming @entity55 's third victim , and captain @entity56 called the innings to a close with 40 minutes left in the day
@entity7 openers @entity59 and @entity49 survived four overs from pace bowlers @entity62 and @entity63 with some positive batting , and will start monday 's play on 12 and nine respectively as they seek to make inroads into a massive first - innings deficit
they will do well to take the lead of @entity1 , who was steady throughout his 473 - ball innings , hitting 22 boundaries and scoring 55 , 45 and 38 in saturday 's three sessions
while @entity7 relied heavily on @entity32 and @entity73 , who on a helpful pitch bowled only six maidens between them in 99 overs for combined figures 2 - 306 , @entity56 has only one specialist spinner in @entity80 plus all - rounder @entity50 , with the medium pace of @entity3 backing up @entity62 , @entity63 and rookie fast bowler @entity83
meanwhile , @entity84 crushed the @entity85 by 113 runs in the opening match of their one - day series in @entity89 on sunday
batting first , the hosts reached 256 - 8 in their 50 overs as opener @entity92 top - scored with 56 in his 100th match , while captain @entity95 made 49
all - rounder @entity96 took 3 - 45 for the @entity85 , while seamer @entity97 claimed 2 - 43
the tourists then slumped to 143 all out in just 34.2 overs as opening bowler @entity100 and spinner @entity101 claimed three wickets each
@entity103 also snared two early victims , including the key scalp of big - hitting captain @entity106 , as the @entity85 were left reeling on 12 - 3
@entity96 , signed for $ 750,000 in the @entity108 auctions last month , top - scored with 31 from 35 deliveries .
