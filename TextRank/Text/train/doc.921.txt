-- the row over same - sex marriage could see thousands of @entity3 flocking to @entity4 on wednesday , while same - sex couples will turn up at the fast - food chain friday for public displays of affection
both events are intended as mass shows of support by people on both sides of the marriage issue and mark the latest round in a longstanding beef that gay and lesbian rights groups have with @entity4 's leadership , which has openly espoused biblical values , not only in its operating principles but in its conservative definition of family as well
the controversy came to a boil after an interview with the fast food restaurant chain 's president and coo @entity29 appeared in @entity30 on july 16 and he weighed in with his views on family
" we are very much supportive of the family -- the biblical definition of the family unit , " @entity33 said
" we are a family - owned business , a family - led business , and we are married to our first wives
we give @entity42 thanks for that
" proponents of same - sex marriage spread @entity33 's comments , eventually creating a firestorm of criticism on social media , including assertions that his comments and position were bigoted and hateful
a handful of politicians joined in denouncing or backing @entity33 's remarks
opinion : religious liberty under threat former @entity62 presidential candidates @entity63 and @entity64 encouraged people to show their support for @entity4 by buying food there wednesday
@entity63 dubbed the day " @entity69 " and touted in his tv and radio shows and online
over 550,000 visitors to @entity63 's event page on @entity75 have responded that they will participate
the action enjoys the support of the rev. @entity78
proponents of same - sex marriage have organized a simple counterprotest for wednesday , asking people to donate the approximate cost of a @entity4 meal , about $ 6.50 , to gay and lesbian rights groups , according to the @entity86 ( @entity86 )
friday 's protest promises to be the more visible , as @entity86 is backing a " @entity88 " to be held at @entity4 restaurants nationwide and encourages participants to take and post photos to the @entity92
the organization says on @entity75 that this particular protest is not a response to @entity63 's call to demonstration and that it was announced july 19 -- three days after the interview with @entity4 's president
@entity86 encourages supporters not to go in groups and to keep the kisses on the conservative side
currently , same - sex marriage is legal in six states : @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , along with the @entity112
@entity112 and @entity113 voted this year to allow same - sex marriages , but the laws have not taken effect
another five states -- @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 -- allow civil unions , providing state - level spousal rights to same - sex couples
opinion : the right way and the wrong way to protest @entity4 president @entity129 , who previously opposed same - sex marriage , said in june he now supports it
at least four @entity133 officials in three major northern @entity135 cities spoke against @entity33 's views , some essentially telling the @entity139 - based restaurant chain not to try to expand in their cities
@entity142 mayor @entity141 told the @entity143 last week he does n't want @entity4 in his city
the company is considering opening a location there
" @entity4 does n't belong in @entity142
you ca n't have a business in the city of @entity142 that discriminates against a population , " he said
@entity141 also wrote to the company , urging @entity4 officials to " back out of your plans to locate in @entity142
" @entity158 councilman @entity157 sent a letter to @entity33 , telling him to " take a hike and take your intolerance with you " and vowing to introduce a resolution at the next council meeting condemning the company
and @entity166 mayor @entity165 said " @entity4 's values are not @entity166 values
" this drew perturbed reactions from conservatives
" i have been incensed at the vitriolic assaults on the @entity4 company because the ceo , @entity29 , made comments recently in which he affirmed his view that the @entity181 view of marriage should be upheld , " @entity63 writes on the @entity75 page calling for the protest to support the sandwich company
opinion : @entity4 and free speech he went on to accuse " the left " of too often taking a stand on " same sex marriage , abortion , or profanity " and of labeling @entity3 as " homophobic , fundamentalists , hate - mongers , and intolerant , " if they " affirm traditional values
" although @entity4 's business stands to both benefit and suffer this week , the company has announced the appreciation day was not its idea
earlier it said it planned to stay out of the marriage debate
" going forward , our intent is to leave the policy debate over same - sex marriage to the government and political arena , " the company announced in another statement
are there demonstrations near you , or are you participating ? let us know on @entity210
