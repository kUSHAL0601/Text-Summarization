-- a man was charged saturday in @entity2 with the murder and abduction of a 5 - year - old girl , @entity6 , who has been missing since monday
@entity6 has also been charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice , prosecutor @entity8 said
meanwhile , the police search for april continues in and around the town of @entity13 , in a remote corner of rural mid-wales
@entity16 , 46 , was arrested on suspicion of murder friday
he had been in police custody since being arrested on suspicion of abduction tuesday
he will appear before magistrates in @entity21 on monday morning , @entity8 said
" i realize that this is an incredibly difficult time for april 's family , friends and the community , " he added
superintendent @entity26 , of @entity27 , said that the force remained " totally focused and committed " to finding april
specialist police search teams have been scouring building in and around @entity13 , as well as the surrounding mountainous and wooded countryside and a nearby flooded river
hundreds of local volunteers who had been helping police in the hunt were asked to leave the search to the professionals as it became apparent that it was now a murder inquiry
april 's mother made an emotional appeal earlier this week for information leading to her daughter
she was taken from a street near her home as she played on her bicycle with a friend
chief constable @entity46 said the investigation had been " one of the most complex and fast moving " in the history of the police force
she also paid tribute to the efforts of local residents who had rallied round to try to help the little girl
prime minister @entity56 earlier this week said the abduction was " every parent 's nightmare
" @entity0 's @entity60 contributed to this report .
