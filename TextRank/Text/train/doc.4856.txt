@entity0 -- @entity3 - based satellite channel @entity2 have sacked their top soccer pundit after he made sexist remarks about a female match official while working on a broadcast of an @entity9 game
@entity10 , a former @entity11 and @entity12 striker , made the comments about assistant referee @entity14 prior to a match between @entity16 and @entity17 on saturday , not realizing his microphone was being recorded
@entity10 , 55 , said " women do n't understand the offside rule , " while his colleague , presenter @entity21 , said the game had " gone mad
" the pair were suspended by @entity2 on monday , but on tuesday it was confirmed @entity10 had been axed after new evidence of sexist behavior relating to an incident in december was released by the channel
a statement read : " @entity2 today terminated its contract with @entity10
the decision , which is effective immediately , was made in response to new evidence of unacceptable and offensive behavior
" the new evidence , relating to an off - air incident that took place in december 2010 , came to light after @entity10 had already been subjected to disciplinary action for his comments of 22 january 2011
" @entity38 , managing director of @entity2 , said : " @entity10 's contract has been terminated for unacceptable behavior
after issuing a warning yesterday , we have no hesitation in taking this action after becoming aware of new information today
" @entity2 reporter @entity44 , who joked to @entity10 that @entity45 was " a bit of a looker " prior to the match has also been suspended

the 25 - year - old was due to officiate an @entity60 third division match on tuesday night but was withdrawn by the @entity61

" @entity14 only wants to be notable for her performance as an assistant referee and is keen for things to get back to normal so she can return to officiating as soon as possible
" prior to saturday 's game , @entity45 has been an assistant referee at international matches -- the highest level of the sport -- since 2009 , world soccer 's governing body @entity72 says
@entity60 's @entity78 ( @entity78 ) said it was " proud to have some of the world 's best match officials , both male and female
