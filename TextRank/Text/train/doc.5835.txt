-- with cups of tea and cucumber sandwiches at the ready , the @entity1 has launched itself into the international sporting arena -- with the formation of the new @entity7
organizers hope the team will take on challengers from the @entity11 and other faiths , while inspiring legions of believers and cricket fans around the world
the refreshments were the backdrop to tuesday 's announcement of the club 's formation by the @entity22 , with a little help from @entity24
@entity25 , @entity24 's ambassador to the @entity1 , has been a driving force behind bringing a game that he acknowledges is baffling to many to the @entity1
" they were wondering what this ' cricket ' is , as to whether it 's a game , or an insect or both , " he joked in an interview for @entity34
" but can i say that there was fairly ready recognition of the fact that there is a very prominent position by this sport in the @entity44 ... ( and ) in the @entity46 - speaking world , and that there are many priests and seminarians in @entity50 who have played cricket and want to play cricket
many in @entity50 would like to see their newly fledged team play the @entity11 , @entity25 said
he anticipates discussions soon aimed at arranging a match between the two sides in @entity46 -- a game that could prompt a rivalry not seen since the @entity11 split from the @entity60 nearly 500 years ago
fans will no doubt hope that game is played at @entity63 in @entity64 , known as the home of cricket
members of the new club are expected to play in the yellow and white @entity1 colors , with the keys of @entity7 as their emblem
and both sides may end up praying for divine intervention if the umpire does n't call in their favor
@entity25 also sees the @entity1 club as having a wider reach
" cricket as a sport is something that covers many , many religions and ethnic groups ... the @entity1 could play the @entity86 , they could play the @entity87 , they could play the @entity88 , " he told @entity34
" internationally one would have a team that represented the @entity1 , the @entity1 , that was drawn from @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity24 , @entity46 , @entity96 , @entity97 and the @entity98 -- what an international team that would be
" and it would obviously generate a lot of interest with the faithful who are both faithful to the church and faithful to cricket in various areas of the world
" some students have already been warming up with a series of matches in @entity50 , @entity25 said
but the wider program is not expected to come into play until next year , when the club hopes to have a team ready for international sporting events
and it 's not just the priests who can get in on the sporting action
the organizers are also looking for nuns who may have wielded a cricket bat in the past to join a women 's xi , or team
" they are looking for @entity125 , @entity93 and @entity94 sisters who have played cricket , and if they are found , they certainly will be invited to join the cricket club , " said @entity25
" there 's certainly no intention not to have a women 's cricket team at the @entity1
" @entity0 's @entity132 contributed to this report .
