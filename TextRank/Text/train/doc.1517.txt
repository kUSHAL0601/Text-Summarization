@entity0 -- many have tried , especially in @entity3 , but few have managed to successfully oust a @entity6 governor through a recall election
@entity9 gov. @entity8 faces that possibility tuesday , due to @entity12 outrage over steps last year by @entity8 and his @entity15 colleagues in the state legislature to weaken public unions
if @entity9 voters toss out @entity8 in favor of @entity22 's @entity12 mayor , @entity21 , it will be only the third such electoral ousting of a governor in @entity6 history
@entity25 kicked out gov. @entity26 in 1921 , and @entity3 got rid of gov. @entity27 in 2003 , according to the center on the @entity6 governor at @entity31 's @entity30
gubernatorial recall efforts seem to be a state pastime in @entity3
every governor elected since 1968 , including @entity37 , were targeted by recall attempts , the center 's website says
in total , 19 states permit recall elections for governors and other state officials , including @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity25 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity0 and , of course , @entity9 and @entity3 , the center says on its website
the @entity0 also permits recall elections , and @entity62 allows recall by trial , according to the center
in tuesday 's balloting , @entity9 voters also will decide whether to recall @entity8 's lieutenant governor and four @entity15 state senators
what 's at stake in @entity9 ? @entity8 's fate in @entity9 comes down to ground game dollars roll in from far beyond @entity9 for recall does @entity74 's absence portend outcome of @entity9 recall vote ?
