very few confidants and former aides were frenzied when @entity2 came under fire for questions about her age , health and wealth
their view , for the most part , was @entity10 is obviously healthy - look at the schedule she keeps - and wealth wo n't be a problem because they can be countered by her proposed policies and actions to help the middle class and poor
" they ( @entity21 ) are just throwing stuff against the wall to see what will stick , " said a @entity10 friend and former aide
" this will not stick
this is not the way to attack her
" however , some @entity10 associates -- all of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly -- have quietly expressed concern that one of the most effective critiques could be that her presidency , should she run and be elected , would be nothing more than president @entity39 's third term
the @entity10 friend and former aide told @entity41 last week that the best way to go after @entity10 is to use this against her : " if you like @entity39 , you will love @entity2
" " she was in his government , she was at his side , " said the source
" that is , the way to go after her is four more years of the same old thing
the question they should ask her is ' tell me 10 things that you disagree with him on
' " others in @entity10 's current and former orbit see the " third - term @entity39 " question as a possible issue
but they were quick to note that @entity21 have more pressing problems
" it is a valid question , " said a longtime @entity10 aide
" but the other side of the aisle has got plenty of their own problems
they may have a deep bench , but they certainly have no starter
" another longtime @entity74 who worked for former vice president @entity75 in 2000 said @entity21 will no doubt try to tack any @entity77 nominee to @entity39 , if they see it could work for them
@entity75 , @entity10 's no. 2 for eight years , struggled to overcome " @entity10 fatigue " in his 2000 presidential campaign that fell just short
@entity21 are , in fact , already trying to bind @entity10 to @entity39
most recently , rep. @entity83 , the @entity21 vice presidential nominee in 2012 , said @entity10 " will be very formidable " but " beatable
" " i think she is beatable because the record is not very good , " @entity83 said in an interview with @entity85
" i do n't think people are going to want to have an @entity39 third term and no matter how she tries to shake that label , she wo n't be able to
" while those questions are n't getting as much attention as those aimed at @entity10 's wealth and speaking fees , @entity83 is not the first @entity21 to already go after her this way
in june , shortly after @entity10 's memoir " @entity102 " hit bookshelves , the @entity100 released a video casting the @entity39 presidency as a " team effort " that included @entity10 as @entity108 's top diplomat for four years
the web ad flashes a simple message : " @entity2 , @entity39 's @entity111
" their goal is simple : @entity21 want voters to think @entity39 and a third term , not the third term of @entity10 , who left office scandal - plagued but is more popular now
he would become first spouse if his wife were elected in 2016
highlighting the candidate following a flawed incumbent is a well - worn path
again , think back to @entity75 and then , more recently , to sen. @entity123 , who was the @entity21 nominee after @entity124 , a wartime president who left the job deeply unpopular
the last time a single party controlled the @entity127 for more than eight consecutive years -- and the only time in the past 60 years -- was from 1981 - 93 when @entity128 served two terms and his vice president , @entity130 , succeeded him for one
@entity124 rode @entity128 's coattails to victory , pushing an agenda of four more years
@entity10 would not have that luxury , if she ran
while @entity39 remains popular with the @entity77 base , his overall approval rating has hovered in the low 40s for the past few months
does that matter ? @entity141 , a @entity41 contributor and @entity75 's 2000 campaign manager , said whether or not @entity10 needs to break with @entity39 " all depends on the political climate and environment in mid 2015 to 2016
" " in 2000 , i had to answer this question , " she said
" and the answer is always the same
each year is different and every candidate must make his or her case to the voter of why they represent some else
" @entity10 tried to create some distance between herself and @entity39 earlier this month on foreign policy during an interview with the @entity156
" great nations need organizing principles , and ' do n't do stupid stuff ' is not an organizing principle , " @entity10 told the @entity156 's @entity157 , knocking @entity39 's mantra on avoiding overseas pitfalls
the split and the subsequent beltway kerfuffle shows how difficult it is for one party to hold the @entity127 for more than eight years
what 's more , any future split between @entity10 and @entity39 fits nicely into the storyline from their contentious 2008 primary race , making it an easy story for media to seize on
not all @entity10 defenders agree with the idea that @entity83 's attack line is effective , especially those at @entity179 , a @entity181 communication and rapid response group
" as a leading voice in the @entity21 ' do nothing ' @entity187 , @entity83 is the last person who should be dishing out political advice , " said @entity183 , the group 's spokeswoman
" @entity2 is one of the most admired and trusted public figures in @entity108 and should she run for president , she will run on her own record and implement her own vision for moving our country forward
