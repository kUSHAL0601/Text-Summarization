@entity0 -- former @entity0 mayor @entity2 has been dead for more than four months , but a mistake on his tombstone likely would have amused him
@entity2 was born december 12 , 1924 , but his tombstone at @entity6 in @entity7 made him appear 18 years younger than he was -- december 12 , 1942 , was set in stone
the company responsible for the etchings on the marker became aware of the mistake monday
the transposed numbers were fixed tuesday morning using composite granite , according to @entity15 , @entity2 's former press secretary as mayor and his spokesman until his death
the birth and death dates were added within the past 10 days , according to an etching company representative
@entity2 hired an inscriber after he purchased his tombstone in 2007
he was able to see the engravings were etched as he wished ; however , there were no dates at the time , according to @entity15
" @entity2 would have loved this attention and called the situation ' ridiculous ! ' " @entity15 told @entity1 on tuesday
@entity2 was a @entity30 congressman from 1968 until he ran for @entity0 mayor in 1977
he served three terms as the city 's 105th mayor , from january 1978 to december 1989
@entity2 died of congestive heart failure on february 1
he was 88 -- despite what his tombstone temporarily calculated .
