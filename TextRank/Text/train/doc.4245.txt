-- some might call it the plain truth -- others , the plane truth
@entity6 boss @entity5 , who once received what 's widely considered the world 's best complaint letter , is sharing another one with his 3 million @entity11 followers
fortunately for him , it was sent to another airline
the sarcastic open letter to @entity15 first appeared in the @entity16 , a newspaper in the @entity17 , in april , but caught @entity5 's attention last week
" how to write a complaint letter -- read this hilarious note from a frustrated airline passenger , " @entity5 tweeted
in the letter , the writer @entity22 comes out swinging
" may i say how considerate it is of you to enable your passengers such an in - depth and thorough tour of the @entity29 , " @entity22 begins
" most other airlines i have travelled on would simply wish to take me from point a to b in rather a hurry
i was intrigued that we were allowed to stop at not a lowly one or two but a magnificent six airports yesterday
" " and who wants to fly on the same airplane the entire time ? we got to change and refuel every step of the way ! " @entity22 goes on to say how much he enjoyed sampling the security scanners at each airport and the pat downs too
" i feel as if i 've been hugged by most of the @entity29 already , " he writes
the letter closes with a curt : " @entity44 the bag
i never liked it anyway
" @entity5 does drag after losing bet disgruntled customers regularly say @entity15 stands for @entity50 , @entity48
@entity5 found himself on the receiving end of a similar stinging e-mail in 2008 in which a customer said his flight from @entity56 , @entity57 , to @entity58 was " the culinary journey of hell , " and one that resembled a crime scene -- " a crime @entity61
" @entity5 , who posted the letter to @entity15 to his blog , said it 's a reminder that companies need to focus on what 's important
" ( m ) aking customer service key to your company will keep your employees motivated and your customers happy
this in turn ensures enduring loyalty , business success and a better experience for everyone
