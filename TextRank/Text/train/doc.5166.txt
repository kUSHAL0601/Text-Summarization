@entity3 , who topped last year 's list , moved down to 10th
the report shows that hackers use pop culture trends to spread viruses and malicious software , said @entity45 , a research analyst at @entity15
@entity7 is " very , very popular right now , so it says to me that the cyber criminals really do know who 's hot and who 's not , " @entity45 said

it ranked celebrities based on the percentage of search results that were found to be damaging and on how harmful those sites turned out to be
