the sale of the old house , the purchase of the new house , the packing , the good - bye parties
it was all so overwhelming for me
i ca n't imagine what it was like for my toddler , leaving the only home , neighborhood and sitter she had ever known in the city where she was born
fortunately , i got a little bit of help from the @entity18 to give my daughter some answers
in that classic tale " @entity26 , " @entity21 asked the questions about moving that my daughter asked : " what about my toys ? " " and what about my friends ? " she 'd carry that book around like a teddy bear
the answer for the toys was easy : " we 'll take them along , of course
" @entity36 to hear : " you 'll be leaving your friends behind
" " but you can keep in touch with them
you can write , even visit perhaps
and besides , you can make lots of new friends
" it 's no wonder that i could find a @entity46 book for almost any new or difficult situation
when co-author @entity46 died last month , she had written more than 330 " @entity18 " books , first with her husband , @entity50 ( who died in 2005 ) , and later with her son , @entity51
more than 260 million copies have been sold over the past 50 years , making it one of the best - selling children 's book series in history , @entity52 said
mirroring all types of families growing up in a house filled with books , i turned to children 's literature to explore and learn about worlds beyond my experience
now , i turn to the classics of children 's literature for assistance in parenting my way through the basic struggles in our lives , such as feelings , friendships , sharing , courtesy , differences and loss , among others
if the @entity18 did n't have the answers , maybe dr. @entity78 , " @entity79 , " " @entity80 " or " @entity81 " could do the trick
the classics explained essential subjects to a young mind better than i ever could , and they reassured me , too
still , some of the classics did n't represent our experience or the lives of many of the families we know and love
my child has two moms
her neighborhood friend has one mom who adopted her
her friend across the street has a mom and dad
" as families have changed over the past decades , that means that there 's opportunity for books to serve families who may not be made up of @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , " said @entity102 , children 's reviews editor for @entity104
" there 's certainly a need for books that portray , mirror and show the value in all kinds of families : same - sex families , mixed - race families , stepfamilies , families with grandparents as guardians
" just as interesting are the children 's books that include a diversity of families not as the point of the story but as a reflection of the reality of our world
" that sort of subtle , offhand inclusion and portrayal of a diversity of families in picture books -- as well as books for older readers -- is , in my view , as valuable , if not more so , as having an increased number of message - focused books out there on those topics , though there will always be a place and a need for those , too , " says @entity102
here are some of my family 's modern favorites
it 's ok to be different the bright visuals of writer and illustrator @entity161 's books jumped out at my daughter before we ever guessed the subject matter
in @entity161 's world , there are different types of mommies , families and feelings -- all of them valuable and filled with love -- without getting hit over the head by the message
" @entity179 " shows all the families on my block and beyond , and portrays them as different in appearance but equal and loving and kind
" @entity193 " teaches my kid that mommies come in all shapes and sizes ; some work outside the home , and some work inside the home ; some cook , and others order pizza ; and some camp , and some shop
a visual learner and slow reader , @entity161 remembers having trouble learning when schools did n't know how to help him
" when i started writing books , i based them on my own struggles as a kid and feeling like an outsider , " said @entity161 , whose favorite books as child included classics such as @entity203 's " @entity202 , " dr. @entity78 's " @entity204 " and " @entity205 " from @entity206
" i wanted them to be silly and fun and simple but yet be something strong that could help kids feel good about themselves
i wanted it to be matter of fact that everyone is important and special and different
" why not let your child drive the bus ? after i became a parent in @entity224 , my daughter and i loved that we could identify the locations that @entity228 featured in " @entity229 : a @entity230
" yes , we lived across the street from the actual @entity232 featured in the book
for a city kid , the idea of sitting on a stoop , @entity232 across the street and parks within walking distance made sense in the whimsical pictures drawn by the former @entity206 writer
" do n't let the @entity243 " and " do n't let the @entity244 " play with the neverending asking that a child does for what she wants , with increasingly sophisticated reasons why we parents should give in
it 's daytime in @entity252 ? really ? but children are not trying to drive us nuts , @entity253 gently reminds the reader
adults forget how hard it can be to be a child , where nothing is built to your size and grownups demand that you learn new things every single day
why not throw a tantrum over not getting to drive a bus or go to bed whenever you want ? " i do n't see my books as ends but as beginnings , " said @entity253 , who as a child loved the work of @entity276 illustrator @entity275 and " sneetches on the @entity278 " by dr. @entity78
" i put as much air in as possible so kids can put in their own ideas
draw my characters and put as few words and background as possible so kids can create them themselves
" while @entity253 is grateful that children identify with his work , he says he writes to understand things he does n't understand , such as friendship , love and jealousy
( " the @entity295 gets a cookie ! ? " which comes out in april , turns jealousy on its head
) " i 'll write a book and take it very seriously for a year or two , " he said
in " goldilocks and the @entity305 , " out this fall , " i find my past self telling my present self how to deal with some present relationships in my life
" you do n't have a mommy and a daddy ? " @entity310 " author and poet @entity312 started writing children 's books featuring families with two mommies or two daddies after a friend stopped her on the street and demanded that she write books featuring families like hers
my daughter had never heard a story with two mommies
she grabbed at the picture book " @entity329 , " and memorized all the words
( the companion , " @entity332 " works for the two - daddy family
) she gravitated to " @entity334 has two mommies " as she got older
although her books have been attacked as political , @entity312 says she does n't write with an agenda or mission
" i write to tell a story , " said @entity312 , who remembers reading dr. @entity78 , @entity339 , @entity340 the elephant and " @entity342 " as favorites
" i write to find out what i do n't know
if pressed , i 'd say my goal would be to produce a children 's book that would help any child reading that book to feel good about herself
" we 're all connected a sweet summer day in the life of an interracial family is the setting for @entity356 's picture book " @entity361 , " featuring the art of @entity358 ( who received a @entity359 for this book )
the book is about global connectivity , showing families and partners of all ages and races
as she started writing for children , @entity356 noticed themes of nature and community emerging in her work
" i also really think about a child 's perspective : how would they envision friendship ? what would they notice about places or parties or food or trees ? " said @entity356 , whose favorite books growing up were " @entity377 , " " @entity295 " and " @entity378
" " kids are relatively disempowered
they 're just not the big people in charge
so i really try to think about how children 's books can give some of the power back to them , just by granting importance to their perspective
" read about @entity395 staffers ' favorite children 's books .
