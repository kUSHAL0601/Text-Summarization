@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 members representing @entity6 cabin crew announced friday they will hold two separate strikes this month in a dispute over working conditions
the first strike will last three days from march 20 , and the next will last four days from march 27 , said @entity12 , the assistant general secretary of the @entity14 union
there will be no strikes over the @entity18 period , he said
further strikes could be called if needed , he said
will a @entity6 strike impact you ? " regrettably , management turned down a remarkable offer , " @entity12 said
@entity6 , which lost hundreds of million dollars last year , responded by saying it is " extremely disappointed " with the union 's decision
" we are very sorry for the stress and disruption @entity14 's decision will cause , " the airline said in a statement
" we are currently considering our response to this strike threat and what action we will need to take to minimize disruption
" the industrial action is over planned changes to cabin crew conditions , which @entity6 says will save the carrier more than 60 million pounds ( $ 91 million ) a year
@entity14 has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew levels to be cut , changes that it has said will damage customer service and the @entity6 brand
the two sides have been holding talks to avoid strikes
@entity6 management submitted a formal offer to the union thursday , @entity14 said , but added that the offer fails to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery
that prompted @entity14 officials to announce the strike dates
there is still a chance the strikes could be averted
@entity14 said union members will be able to vote on @entity6 's offer on the first day of the planned strikes , and if they vote to approve it , the strikes will be canceled
@entity6 declined to share details of its offer with @entity2
" @entity14 's action has no shred of justification , " the airline said
" @entity6 ' crew are rightly renowned for their professionalism and skills
our entire package for crew recognizes that and is reasonable and fair
" @entity6 said all union proposals so far would save the airline " significantly " less money than @entity6 's own planned changes
" in addition , @entity14 's plans would cut crew pay and allowances , " @entity6 said
" the reductions required to generate sufficient savings would leave each crew member between 1,000 and 2,700 pounds ( $ 1,516 and $ 4,095 ) a year worse off
these proposals lack credibility , and @entity14 did not inform crew of them when it asked them to vote for a strike
" in december , a judge blocked a planned 12 - day strike by @entity14 over the same issues that would have started just before @entity98 .
