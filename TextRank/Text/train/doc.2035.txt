in an interview with @entity21 in 2010 , @entity18 spoke about how she once sold cans for scrap metal and hawked music records at her family 's stand at a @entity28 flea market

she then had two more children -- @entity34 and @entity35 -- with her then - husband , @entity36
@entity18 spoke about how @entity36 physically abused her because while she wanted to attend college , he wanted her to quit school and be at home " cooking and cleaning
" she said she grew up with four brothers so she knew how to fight back
they divorced in 1992 when @entity18 found out @entity36 molested their daughter , @entity32 , and @entity18 's younger sister , @entity46
@entity36 was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to 30 years in prison
