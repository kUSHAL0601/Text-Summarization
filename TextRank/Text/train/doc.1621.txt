@entity0 , @entity1 -- even if his daughter was fearless , @entity3 was not
he supported @entity6 's lifelong love of big cats , as well as her single - minded mission to work with them
yet despite her assurances , he worried
his nightmare came true wednesday , when a 350 - pound @entity13 lion killed @entity14 at @entity16 's @entity15 in @entity0 , @entity1 , where she was working as an intern
" i always had a premonition that someday i would get a call like this , " her father said thursday
" but i just thought it would be much further in the future than 24
" that 's how old the @entity26 native was when the lion opened the gate of a pen at the big cat sanctuary , then moved into a larger enclosure , according to the local coroner
@entity14 was cleaning the enclosure the two lions had been in not long before , @entity34 coroner dr. @entity33 said , citing investigators
somehow , one of those animals -- a 5 - year - old lion named @entity41 -- escaped and attacked her
watch video of the lion from 2012 " ( @entity3 ) died very quickly and did not suffer , " @entity33 said
a preliminary autopsy showed @entity3 died of a " broken neck and other neck injuries , " according to the coroner
the animal inflicted other injuries " post-mortem
" @entity3 , told @entity2 's @entity51 he had been told that his daughter was n't mauled , saying she had no blood , " no rips or gashes
" he and his family are grieving , taking comfort in the fact that @entity14 died doing what she loved -- taking care of big cats such as @entity41
looking back at photos @entity6 had posted on @entity63 over the past two months , when she 'd begun working at the expansive northern @entity1 facility , @entity3 said he and his wife agreed that this was the happiest they 'd ever seen her
" and that 's the only way i can bear this , " he said
" because this was her dream
she was living her dream
" death devastates those at big cat sanctuary when she was 6 or 7 , @entity14 was convinced she 'd someday go to @entity76 to study @entity78 snow tigers
her obsession with them and , eventually , other big cats never left her , according to her father
her first hands - on experience with such animals came while a student at @entity87 in @entity88 , where she helped take care of lions and tigers owned by a family there
the six - month internship at @entity15 was her big break -- her ticket , she hoped , to getting a full - time job at a zoo
@entity3 said that his daughter was impressed with everything about what she considered " a very safe , well - run place " where the animals got far more room to roam than at most zoos
" she was just really impressed with the way it was laid out and organized , " he said
" there was never any question of safety in her mind or any mismanagement
" @entity113 's founder , @entity112 , said the facility has been " incident - free " since it opened in 1998
and @entity14 quickly became part of the " family , " lightening the load and brightening the mood wherever she went , recalled the non-profit 's president , @entity119
she gave the animals songs -- for a jaguar named @entity123 it was " @entity124 , " to the tune of " @entity126 , " while another named @entity127 had " kissed by a @entity127
" " she made instant friendships with everybody up here , " @entity119 said
" they do n't -- at least now , at least publicly -- have an explanation as to what happened to her
the @entity135 said that when the lion attacked , another employee at the sanctuary tried to distract him away from @entity3 and move him into another enclosure
" but all attempts failed , " the office said
a sheriff 's deputy shot and killed the animal to reach @entity3 and give her medical assistance
however , it was too late
" our whole staff is ... it 's just , it 's devastating , " @entity112 said thursday , choking back tears
' they are wild animals , end of story ' the autopsy finding on @entity3 will be reviewed by a veterinarian at the @entity155 , which is conducting the necropsy on the lion
" @entity163 has trained our officers in @entity1 to recognize a lion kill due to our abundance of mountain lions , " @entity33 said , noting that the coordination between the two camps follows a protocol set up in case of a mountain lion attack
" we never in our wildest imagination thought it would be an @entity13 lion
" fatal lion maulings are rare in the @entity172 , though not unprecedented
twenty people , including five children , have been killed by big cats in the @entity172 in the past 21 years , according to figures kept by @entity177 , a nonprofit cat sanctuary in @entity179 , @entity180
another 246 people were mauled in the @entity172 during that same time period , 1990 to 2011 , the group said
@entity184 killed after mauling six in @entity185 the attacking lion , @entity41 , was one of @entity14 's favorites , according to her father
the lion was also a celebrity of sorts , having appeared on @entity194 ' television show when he was about 3 months old
that said , noted animal expert @entity196 said any big cat can be unpredictable in the way it reacts to what it sees or hears
" they are wild animals , end of story , " he said
" no matter what anyone says , they are wild animals
