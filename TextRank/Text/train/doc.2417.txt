-- @entity1 held off a last - round charge from @entity4 champion @entity3 to claim the @entity5 at @entity6 sunday
@entity1 , who like @entity3 hails from @entity7 , carded a final round 68 to beat his illustrious compatriot by two shots on 22 - under 266
@entity3 , looking for his first win since claiming his first major in such emphatic style at @entity13 , carded a seven - under 65 at the home of golf but came up just short as overnight leader @entity1 kept his nerve on the closing holes
@entity19 completed the domination of players from @entity7 by claiming joint third on 18 - under with @entity23 of @entity24 after a 69
@entity30 's @entity29 , playing his first tournament at @entity6 since his @entity27 @entity4 victory on the famous links in 2010 , was in a three - strong group a shot further back with @entity33 and joint halfway leader @entity34
@entity35 could not build on his nine - under third round 63 and finished in a tie for ninth as he bids to top the money list on the @entity41 and @entity42 tours
but it was @entity1 who eventually upstaged the big names , leading after his third successive 66 going into the final day and then maintaining his composure as @entity3 went to the turn in just 30 to mount his expected challenge
he came to the last with a one - shot lead over @entity3 and after a big drive needed just a deft chip and a putt to close with a birdie to seal his triumph
the 32 - year - old was claiming his second victory of the year after struggling for so long to break into the big time
" it has n't sunk in yet and it wo n't for a while , " @entity1 told the @entity60 website
" it 's taken a long time but i supposed in a weird way you enjoy it more because you have struggled through six goes at the qualifying school , " he added
@entity3 , who was seven - under for his first 11 holes on the final day , was disappointed to miss out on victory
" i 've been very consistent , which is a good thing , but i want to get wins and that 's the most important thing
" it 's good to be one , two , three and see all of us boys up there , i 'm just obviously disappointed that it was n't me lifting the trophy
" he will now head to play in @entity79 which starts thursday .
