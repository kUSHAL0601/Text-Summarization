@entity0 -- @entity2 will cut production of rare earths -- minerals vital for technology makers worldwide -- by 20 % , a move that threatens to inflame trade tensions between @entity9 and @entity10
rare earths are 17 minerals with magnetic and conductive properties that are used in most of today 's electronic devices , including flat - screen televisions , smart phones , hybrid cars and weapons
nearly all of the world 's supply of rare earths comes from @entity2
@entity2 changed production rules , which will close down one - third of the nation 's 23 mines and about half of 99 smelting companies , @entity28 , director of the ministry 's rare earths office , told @entity31 wednesday
@entity34 military 's rare earth concerns @entity2 implemented the rules to improve environmental conditions and help consolidate the industry , officials said
the new regulations boost the minimum annual output at mines to 20,000 metric tons and 2,000 tons per year for smelting operation -- a move which will weed out smaller operations
the @entity34 , @entity46 and the @entity47 have complained to the @entity48 that @entity2 's rare earths export restrictions violate trade rules
@entity48 case against @entity2 over rare earths announced by @entity54 the minerals include cerium , neodymium , dysprosium , tungsten and molybdenum
@entity62 , for example , is used in electronics , automotive , aerospace and medical technologies
@entity2 produces 91 % of the world 's tungsten
molybdenum is a metallic element used for filaments in light bulbs
@entity2 produces 36 % of the world 's molybdenum
rare earths are not actually " rare , " and can be found in other countries - including the @entity34 - but are difficult to mine safely
about a third of the world 's rare earth deposits are in @entity2 but the country controls more than 90 % of production , in part due to its lower labor costs and less stringent environmental regulations
