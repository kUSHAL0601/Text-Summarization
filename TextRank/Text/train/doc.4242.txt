@entity2 became more isolated tuesday than it has been at any time since the end of the @entity4 after new , hard - hitting sanctions were announced by the @entity6 and the @entity1 , @entity1 officials said
@entity1 president @entity7 said the measures would take an " even bigger bite " out of the stagnant @entity2 economy than sanctions @entity18 and the @entity6 had already implemented against @entity2 over its disputed annexation of @entity10 and its support of @entity13 rebels fighting the @entity15 government
" the major sanctions we 're announcing today will continue to ratchet up the pressure on @entity2 including the cronies and companies supporting @entity2 's illegal activities in the @entity15 , " he said from the @entity20
" in other words , today @entity2 is once again isolating itself from the international community , setting back decades of genuine progress
" he said the @entity6 sanctions showed to him a waning patience with @entity2 president @entity32 and the impact of the shoot - down of @entity35 17 , which had many @entity36 among the 298 people on board when it exploded over volatile eastern @entity15
some of the new @entity6 sanctions target eight " cronies " of @entity32 and three " entities " by limiting their access to @entity6 capital markets , an @entity6 official said on condition of anonymity
the people and entities will be named wednesday , the official said
three state - owned banks named tuesday by @entity18 means five of the top six financial institutions in @entity2 were on the sanctions list , according to a senior @entity7 administration official
four - fifths of their debt is in @entity1 dollars , the official said
new sanctions will also impact the future of @entity2 's important oil businesses with technology licensing restrictions , another senior administration official said
restrictions will affect @entity2 's ability to produce oil from deep - water wells and shale fields , sectors it is only beginning to explore
the sanctions , however , are not part of a new @entity4 , @entity7 said
" what it is , is a very specific issue related to @entity2 's unwillingness to recognize that @entity15 can chart its own path , " @entity7 said
the @entity6 sanctions also will block new arms contracts between @entity36 and @entity2 , prohibit the export of @entity36 goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes and limit the export of energy - related equipment , the @entity6 said in a written statement tuesday evening
the @entity6 had previously been reluctant to issue harsher sanctions against @entity2 because both regions rely on one another for about $ 500 billion in trade and investment each year , according to @entity90
" it is meant as a strong warning : illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country can not be accepted in 21st century @entity36 , " the @entity93 's statement reads
one of the senior administration officials said @entity2 has n't been this isolated " since the end of the @entity4
" @entity7 said @entity2 could choose a different path
" it did n't have to come to this
it does not have to be this way , " @entity7 said
" this is a choice that @entity2 and president @entity32 in particular has made
... the path for a peaceful resolution to this crisis involves recognizing the sovereignty , the territorial integrity and the independence of the @entity15 people
" investigators thwarted again meanwhile , international investigators and observers were prevented for the third straight day from reaching the @entity117 crash site
the @entity118 said its team was unable to leave the city of @entity121 because of violence
the 50 - strong team of @entity125 and @entity126 experts , accompanied by monitors from the @entity128 , was also forced to abandon its attempts to reach the site sunday and monday
@entity125 investigators have yet to lay eyes on the wreckage or the human remains believed still to be strewn across the huge debris field near the town of @entity137
@entity1 and @entity15 officials have said that a @entity2 - made missile system was used to shoot down @entity140 from rebel territory
@entity2 and the rebels have disputed the allegations and blamed @entity15 for the crash
@entity125 prime minister @entity146 asked @entity15 president @entity147 in a phone call tuesday morning to halt the fighting around the crash site so that investigators can access it , @entity146 spokesman @entity145 said
@entity15 @entity152 : the bitter lessons of @entity117 reports of ballistic missiles the @entity1 and others say @entity2 has provided arms to rebels in eastern @entity15 , including heavy weapons such as a missile system like the one believed used to down the @entity163 airliner 12 days ago
despite previous sanctions , the flow of weapons continues and on tuesday the fighting appeared to have entered a dangerous new phase
there were reports that @entity15 's government in the past 48 hours used short - range ballistic missiles against the rebels , three @entity1 officials told @entity173
the weapons have a range of about 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) and pack up to 1,000 - pound ( 454 - kilogram ) warheads
if the reports are accurate , they are the most deadly missiles used in the conflict to date
the @entity1 officials did not specify where the missiles hit or what damage they caused
one @entity1 official said there has been no reaction from @entity2 so far
another of the @entity1 officials said using the missiles is " an escalation , but @entity15 has a right to defend itself
" @entity15 foreign minister @entity186 acknowledged that his country 's military has short - range missiles , but denied that the military fired any
in a joint news conference with @entity186 , @entity1 secretary of state @entity191 praised @entity15 officials for proposing a peace plan that includes " serious and substantive dialogue with the @entity2 - backed separatists
" @entity2 : @entity197 came under fire @entity2 's @entity199 said in a statement on its website that a @entity2 checkpoint had come under fire from @entity15 forces
it says @entity15 officers used automatic weapons and grenades at the @entity209 customs checkpoint , causing damage
on tuesday , @entity186 , the @entity15 foreign minister , denied that @entity15 forces had fired into @entity2
the defense minister for the self - declared @entity213 , @entity214 , said that there had been " extremely severe " battles between his rebel forces and the @entity15 military in the area of @entity220 and @entity137
he said a number of injured rebel fighters , as well as some medical personnel , had been evacuated from @entity121 to @entity2
@entity224 has denied arming and supporting the rebels , but @entity214 's words indicate that @entity2 is serving as a kind of haven for the rebels
@entity214 also denied his fighters had the weapons system needed to shoot down an airliner
how rebels built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies interactive : is 2014 the deadliest year for flights ? to punish @entity2 , @entity36 must be prepared to suffer
