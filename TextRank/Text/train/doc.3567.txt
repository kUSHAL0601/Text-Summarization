the @entity2 administration will not make a formal determination as to whether the ouster of @entity6 president @entity5 by the military was a coup , a senior administration official told @entity10 's @entity9 on thursday
a coup determination would force the @entity12 to end military aid to @entity6
" the law does not require us to make a formal determination as to whether a coup took place and it is not in our national interest to make such a determination , " the official said on condition of anonymity
the administration sees continuing aid to @entity6 -- more than $ 1 billion annually -- to be " consistent with our law " and necessary to further @entity12 national security interests , the source said
the news , first reported by @entity30 , came as @entity6 braced for rival rallies set for friday by @entity5 's supporters and those who backed his ouster by the military
@entity5 , @entity6 's first democratically elected president , has not been seen publicly since he was pushed from office by the military on july 3 after mass protests over his leadership and suspended the constitution
dozens of people have reportedly been killed and thousands injured since @entity5 's ouster , some of them in confrontations with authorities and others in clashes with those on the other side of the political spectrum
gen. @entity52 , the head of @entity6 's military , has called for mass demonstrations friday to support the country 's armed forces
he is calling the protests a " mandate " for the military after weeks of violence that he has blamed on @entity5 's supporters , primarily the @entity63
the @entity63 and its political arm , the @entity65 , issued its own call for protests
the group has refused to recognize the ouster , saying @entity5 is the legitimate president
@entity52 warned that any violence " will be confronted with the resolve and strength " of the military
" we call upon various political faction to avoid any act of provocation , " he said in statement released thursday
there has been growing concern about among world leaders about the increase in violence since @entity5 's ouster
the country is considered a vital regional ally for the @entity12 , which signaled its displeasure with @entity5 's ouster on wednesday when the @entity90 said it was delaying the delivery of four @entity93 fighter jets
it 's not clear what conditions would be imposed before the aircraft would be cleared for shipment
the @entity90 said , however , that it was not suspending overall arms sales to @entity6 at this time .
