@entity0 , @entity1 -- a man who used to teach at a @entity8 religious order 's schools in @entity1 has been arrested in @entity4 on suspicion of sexually abusing children , police in @entity1 and @entity4 said tuesday
the suspect , @entity10 , was arrested in august 2009 in @entity4 , where he was teaching
he was held on suspicion of filming the abuse and possessing images of sexually abused boys , @entity11 , a @entity4 cybercrime unit police commander , told @entity2 partner station @entity2 + by telephone tuesday
@entity11 said that the suspected crime of possessing the illegal images occurred in @entity4 but that the alleged sexual abuse of the students and the filming of it apparently occurred in @entity1
@entity22 , who is in his early 50s , was a physical education teacher in @entity1 and allegedly placed hidden cameras in gyms and bathrooms to film sexual abuse of the students , @entity11 told @entity2 + , a 24 - hour @entity30 news channel based in @entity0
the allegations come against a backdrop of allegations of child abuse by priests in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39 in recent months
the suspect in the @entity1 case does not appear to have been a priest , but a layman teaching in schools run by a catholic order
" the alleged events happened here , in @entity1 , " a @entity47 spokesman in @entity0 told @entity2
the spokesman , who by custom is not identified , said that @entity47 investigators have been working on the case in recent months and that there has been more than one complaint from an alleged victim
but none of the alleged victims so far have been willing to go public about the events , which in some cases occurred years ago , the @entity47 spokesman said
the religious order for which @entity22 worked in @entity1 reacted with surprise and indignation tuesday
but spokesmen for the @entity64 congregation said neither they nor other members of the order were aware of the alleged abuse and had received no complaints
@entity69 , a spokesman for the @entity64 congregation in @entity0 , said , " it 's surprising and of concern
they knew nothing about this
if they knew about this situation , they would have raised the matter or taken all measures to avoid it
" the suspect taught at various @entity84 schools , including one in @entity0 and another in the town of @entity86 , in @entity1 's northern @entity88 region
" we are more than surprised
we are upset , and we want this to be solved as soon as possible , " said @entity90 , principal of the @entity91 in @entity86
" and we want it solved in the best way possible
" the principal said his congregation has " given all the facilities and help needed to all the members of the investigation team
" the @entity47 spokesman said the small number of complaints from alleged victims had gone to police , not necessarily to church officials
a woman who lives in @entity86 told @entity2 + there on tuesday , " this is outrageous
... so many times the @entity107 says so many things ... but the reality is that they hardly talk about it and condemn it
" the @entity1 newspaper @entity113 reported that @entity22 worked at various @entity84 order schools in @entity1 from 1979 through 2007 , and that in addition to physical education , he taught language
he later moved to @entity4 to teach at the @entity118 , in the capital city , @entity120 , @entity113 reported
the case is under investigation in a @entity0 court , @entity113 reported
@entity2 's @entity124 in @entity0 contributed to this report .
