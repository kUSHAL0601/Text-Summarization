@entity5 , who provided classified government documents to @entity7 detailing , among other things , @entity3 's undisclosed policies on torture , was found guilty of espionage on tuesday
the verdict comes on the 235th anniversary of the passage of @entity3 's first whistle - blower protection law , approved by the @entity14 after two @entity16 officers were arrested and harassed for having reported the torture of @entity19 prisoners
how have we gotten to the place where the revelation of torture is no longer laudable whistle - blowing , but now counts as espionage ? the answer is that government has not yet come to terms with the persistence and transparency of the digital age
information moves so fast and to so many places that controlling it is no longer an option
every datapoint , whether a perverted tweet by an aspiring mayor or a classified video of @entity38 news staffers being gunned down by an @entity40 helicopter , will somehow find the light of day
it 's enough to make any administration tremble , but it 's particularly traumatic for one with things to hide
that 's why they tried to throw the book , and then some , at @entity5
prosecutors cast simple @entity52 commands known to any halfway literate internet user ( or anyone who used the internet back in the early ' 90s ) as clandestine codes used only by hackers to steal data
that @entity59 could download these files off the @entity7 website ( along with millions of other people ) became justification for classifying the whistle - blowing as espionage , an act of war
and @entity5 is just one of a record seven @entity3 charged with violating the @entity68 in a single administration
but prosecuting those whose keyboards or usb sticks may have been technically responsible for the revelations is futile
the more networked we become and the more data we collect , the more likely something will eventually find its way out
after all , a security culture based on surveillance and big data cuts both ways
moreover , harsh reaction to digital whistle - blowers only increases the greater population 's suspicions that more information is being hidden
in this one leaking incident , @entity5 exposed allegations of torture , undisclosed civilian death tolls in @entity103 and @entity104 , official orders not to investigate torture by nations holding our prisoners , accusations of the torture of @entity112 prisoners at @entity113 , the " collateral murder " video of @entity38 journalists and @entity104 civilians as @entity3 soldiers cheered , @entity94 support of corporations opposing @entity97 minimum wage , training of @entity89 torturers by the @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity3 authorized stealing of @entity121 secretary general 's dna -- the list goes on
these are not launch codes for nuclear strikes , operational secrets or even plans for future military missions
rather , they are documentation of past activity and officially sanctioned military and state policy
these are not our secrets , but our ongoing actions and approaches
a thinking government -- a virtuous one , if we can still use such a word -- would treat this as a necessary intervention
things have gone too far
but ours is a government in " present shock " : an always - on , always - connected population puts the administration in a state of perpetual emergency interruption
it 's not the phone call at 2 a.m. for which a president has to be prepared , but the tweet at 3 , the @entity151 update at 4 , the @entity154 video at 5 , and on and on
in such a crisis - to - crisis landscape , there 's no time to implement or even articulate a " grand narrative
" a real - time , digital world offers no sense of mission or opportunity to tell a story
there 's no @entity165 to win
no moon shot to work toward
there are just emergent threats , one after the other after the other
things just exist in the present , one tweet - or , actually , many tweets - at a time
this makes it exceedingly difficult to frame our policies and strategies with language and purpose
it 's no longer a matter of walking the talk
without the talk , there 's only the walk
we have no way of judging the ethics and intentions of our government except by what it actually does
combine this with the transparency that comes with digital technology and our leaders simply have no choice but to do the right thing
it takes more energy to prevent exposure than simply to behave consistently with the values we want to project
just as corporations are learning that they can no longer maintain low prices through overseas slave labor without getting caught , a democratic government can no longer maintain security through torture and coercion without being exposed
betraying our respect for human dignity only makes us less resolved as a people , and less trusted as a nation
we are just beginning to learn what makes a free people secure in a digital age
the @entity165 was an era of paper records , locked vaults and state secrets , for which a cloak - and - dagger mindset may have been appropriate
in a digital environment , our security comes not from our ability to keep our secrets but rather our ability to live our truth
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .
