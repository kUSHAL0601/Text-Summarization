-- penguins did n't always come in black and white , paleontologists said thursday , citing the discovery of a 36 - million - year - old fossil of a bird that , in its day , waddled nearly 5 feet tall
a specimen found in @entity7 showed that at least some of the giant penguin 's feathers were reddish brown and gray , said a @entity13 paleontologist who was the lead author of a paper appearing in thursday 's online edition of the journal @entity17
the new species , " @entity20 , " or " water king , " was bigger than the emperor penguin , the largest living penguin now
" before this fossil , we had no evidence about the feathers , colors and flipper shapes of ancient penguins
we had questions and this was our first chance to start answering them , " paleontologist @entity30 said in a statement
the color pattern of living penguins is a more recent innovation , said scientists
the fossil shows the flipper and feather shapes that evolved early to make them such powerful swimmers
the fossil also has preserved evidence of scales and feathers
bird feathers get some of their colors from the size , shape and arrangement of nanoscale structures called melanosomes , the report said
modern penguins and the fossil differed in the formation of melanosomes
@entity20 was discovered in 2007 by @entity7 student @entity62 in @entity63 , researchers said
the @entity64 , which along with the @entity65 , provided funding for the research , said it 's not exactly clear why modern penguins come in black and white
perhaps it was a response to the rise of new penguin predators , such as seals , said @entity74 , according to @entity64
in a phenomenon called countershading , modern penguins ' white bellies camouflage the birds against the sky , at least from the vantage point of a swimming predator looking up
to a predator looking down , a penguin 's black back vaguely matches the dark depths below .
