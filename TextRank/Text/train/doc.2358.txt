as @entity0 read about the flood of private money that is going into the current presidential campaign , most ca n't help but shake their heads in disgust about how our democracy functions
with all the talk about changing @entity10 , voters are shrewd enough to understand that if contributors give this much money to the candidates in both parties , there is little chance that @entity10 will be much different in 2013
in depth : where money and politics collide @entity0 tend to be cynical that campaign finance reform will ever work
the conventional assumption is that politicians will never be willing to fix the system and they will circumvent any laws that come their way
trust in government continues to plummet
yet we must remember that there have been moments when positive change happened
the most important episode in the history of campaign finance reform took place in the aftermath of the @entity37 that brought down president @entity38
although @entity37 was about a break - in to @entity42 campaign headquarters and the coverup that followed , the congressional investigations revealed the ways in which interest groups donated campaign funds with the hope of shaping policy and how politicians , including @entity38 's advisers , circumvented existing laws
the scandal prompted @entity53 to finally tackle these bigger issues about campaigns
as then sen. @entity56 explained , " @entity37 is n't the question
@entity37 is merely a vehicle through which we can get through what we originally could not get through because the fellows on the other team are in a very compromising position as a consequence of it
" @entity53 passed legislation that established contribution and spending limits , public financing for presidential elections and an independent elections commission
during the next two decades , the system for funding presidential elections proved to be remarkably effective
the system provided partial funds during the primaries and full funding during the general election
to receive the taxpayer funds , candidates had to agree to abide by restrictions on how much they could spend and how much they could receive from private sources
candidates in both parties agreed to the system
though it was far from perfect , the reforms had a big impact in reducing the power of private money
former @entity42 power broker @entity91 and former secretary of defense and @entity94 congressman @entity93 concluded in 1986 : " public financing of presidential elections has clearly proved its worth in opening up the process , reducing the influence of individuals and groups , and virtually ending corruption in presidential election finance
" this was not the only reform that made a difference
disclosure laws enacted in the 1970s have produced a much more transparent process that allows voters and reporters to easily find out about where money is coming from and how much is being spent
the nation has come a far distance from the 1950s when there was virtually no data on the sources of campaign finance
over time , the system for publicly financed presidential elections did break down
during the 1980s and 1990s , donors found loopholes to move money into the campaigns
as fewer @entity0 checked the box on their tax returns to donate their money to the system , the amount of funds available seemed meager compared to what candidates could raise on the fundraising circuit
the lure of massive campaign funds proved to be too great
in 2000 , @entity135 candidate @entity135 did not take public money so that he could free himself from any restrictions
in 2004 , democrats @entity138 and @entity139 did not take public funds for their primary runs either
four years later , @entity142 and @entity143 did the same for the primaries , and @entity143 did so for the general election
although efforts to stop funding the public campaign budget have failed , president @entity143 and whoever runs for the @entity94 will continue the path set out in 2008
public funds are now irrelevant
the constraints that came with those funds are gone , and overall limits on private campaign fundraising have been weakened by court decisions
it is time for the parties to look again at the system that @entity53 put in place in 1974
while the system was far from perfect and eventually fell apart , it is notable that there was a substantial period of time when reforms reined in the power of money in politics
it turned out that , for a time , politicians -- with the promise of public funds to cover the cost of their campaigns -- were willing to abandon the toxic fundraising circuit that otherwise consumed most of their time
it is time for reform once again
the nation must remember the lessons from @entity37 -- not just what went wrong , but also how @entity53 was able to improve the way in which we govern in response to a scandal that rocked the nation
