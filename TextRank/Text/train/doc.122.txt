-- @entity2 's build - up to @entity3 suffered a setback saturday with a 5 - 3 defeat to @entity6 in @entity7
it was the first time the @entity9 , who did not qualify for this summer 's tournament , had beaten @entity2 in an international since 1956
@entity14 coach @entity13 fielded an understrength team as he rested eight @entity17 players who were involved in the @entity19 final defeat to @entity20 last weekend
but the performance of their understudies will do little to inspire confidence , with goalkeeper @entity25 having a forgettable error - strewn match as the @entity14 lost for the second time in a row
having gone through @entity30 qualifying unbeaten , they were beaten by @entity31 2 - 1 in their last friendly in february
@entity9 striker @entity34 , who plays in the @entity35 , scored a hat - trick and put his team 2 - 0 ahead with two first half goals in three minutes
both goals were laid on by strike partner @entity40 before defender @entity41 pulled one back for @entity2 just before halftime with a header from a @entity46 cross
but @entity34 made it 3 - 1 after 50 minutes , again from a @entity40 assist
@entity48 cut the lead to give @entity2 some hope before @entity51 made it 4 - 2 in the 67th minute
@entity52 added the third for the @entity14 five minutes later but @entity54 sealed victory for the @entity9 and made it 5 - 3 late on
" we did n't expect a result like this and we can not be satisfied by it , " @entity13 told @entity56
meanwhile , @entity61 warmed up for a defense of their @entity64 title with a 2 - 0 friendly win over @entity67 in a friendly played in @entity6
coach @entity68 was also forced to field a second string line - up with many of his players involved in friday 's @entity73 final between @entity74 and @entity75
@entity77 's @entity76 , a second half substitute , headed the 2010 @entity79 winners in front in the 64th minute
he was then pulled down by @entity67 captain @entity81 to earn a 75th minute penalty , converted by @entity83
@entity61 announce their 23 - man squad for @entity86 and the @entity87 sunday
@entity88 , captained by @entity89 , were held to a disappointing 0 - 0 draw by @entity91 in @entity92
their group rivals in the @entity30 finals , @entity95 , were beaten 3 - 1 by a young @entity97 side , who are preparing for the @entity99 , in a friendly in @entity101
@entity103 striker @entity102 scored twice with @entity95 's @entity104 turning an @entity106 cross into his own net for the other goal
@entity109 pulled a goal back for the well - beaten @entity111
the @entity112 also went down to a friendly defeat , losing 2 - 1 at home to @entity115
@entity117 's @entity116 gave the @entity118 a 45th minute lead but @entity115 , who did not make @entity3 , equalized four minutes into the second half with an @entity123 penalty after @entity125 had hand balled
@entity115 striker @entity126 grabbed a shock winner in the second minute of injury time as the home side pushed forward and were caught on the break .
