@entity0 -- @entity0 authorities said thursday that they had reached a deal with 23 gun show operators in the state after an investigation revealed weapons were sold without proper background checks
under the new agreement , authorities say it will be easier to track whether sellers are following the proper safety steps
" gun violence is everyone 's concern , " @entity0 attorney general @entity16 said in a statement , " and i 'm proud that we 've worked with gun show operators to create simple procedures to ensure that deadly weapons do n't make it into the hands of felons , terrorists , the dangerously mentally ill or anyone else who could not pass a background check
" the new measures , which authorities hope will be a model for other states , include a requirement that weapons sold by private sellers at gun shows be tagged so operators can be sure proper background checks were performed
the 23 gun show operators who signed on to the deal represent 80 % of the gun shows in the state , the attorney general 's office said
authorities hope all gun shows statewide will sign on to the deal by the end of the year
dozens of gun shows are held across @entity49 on any given weekend
gun shows open to consumers are big business , accounting for about 10 % of the industry 's $ 3.5 billion in annual sales , @entity54 analyst @entity53 said earlier this year
@entity0 is among the states that require background checks at gun shows , and the state 's gun laws are among the nation 's most stringent
in january , gov. @entity62 signed laws fortifying @entity0 's existing assault weapons ban , limiting the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthening rules that govern the mentally ill , which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior
gun rights advocates have pushed to repeal the laws , while some state lawmakers have pushed for stricter measures
on thursday , @entity77 @entity0 assemblywoman @entity76 of @entity78 introduced a bill that would ban children under age 12 from attending gun shows
@entity0 's gun show deal comes just a few days after a @entity85 committee approved legislation that would expand background checks covering all @entity49 firearms sales , part of a federal gun - control push prompted by december 's school massacre in @entity92
the background check proposal by sen. @entity94 , a @entity0 @entity95 , is expected to face tough opposition once the full @entity85 takes it up
@entity94 's bill would mandate background checks for all gun sales , including private transactions
the @entity100 has said increased checks are nothing more than an attempt to create a national gun registry , a move the group vehemently opposes
forty percent of all firearms purchased in the @entity49 are sold without background checks because the guns are n't bought from a federally licensed firearms dealer , @entity109 , an attorney with the @entity110 , said earlier this year
rather , those weapons are bought at gun shows , on street corners , over the @entity114 or from friends or neighbors , @entity109 said
@entity1 's @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 contributed to this report .
