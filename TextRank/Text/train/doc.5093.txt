-- @entity1 hold a slender 30 - run advantage over @entity3 after the second day of the second test in @entity5 , despite another dramatic batting collapse on friday
the visitors , who were skittled out for an embarrassing 47 on their way to losing the first test in @entity11 by eight wickets , began their innings brightly as an opening stand of 174 between @entity15 and @entity16 looked to have given them a sturdy foundation for a big score
but , in reply to the home side 's total of 266 , @entity1 collapsed once again , losing all 10 wickets for just 122 runs as they finished on 296 all out
@entity25 passes milestone but @entity1 in control pick of the @entity30 bowlers was paceman @entity31 -- who took four for 64 -- while leg - spinner @entity32 mopped up three wickets towards the end of the innings , his first in test cricket
both @entity15 and @entity16 scored 88 but , apart from an impressive 38 not out from @entity38 , not one other @entity39 scored above 20 , leaving the match finely poised going into the third day
bad light ended proceedings early , with @entity3 failing to score from the four balls they faced
" it did n't go our way this morning , so we had to reassess things and after that the bowlers came out and did a great job , " @entity31 told reporters
meanwhile , @entity53 players @entity54 and @entity55 will begin their appeals against their jail sentences for spot - fixing next wednesday
former captain @entity54 was imprisoned for 30 months and teenage pace bowler @entity55 was handed a six - month term for bowling deliberate no - balls against @entity61 in august 2010
a third player , @entity62 , was jailed for a year but has not appealed against his conviction .
