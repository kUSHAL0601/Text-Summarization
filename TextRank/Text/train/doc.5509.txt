-- a key provision of the health care reform law championed by president @entity3 came under harsh criticism from the conservative majority of the @entity6 on tuesday
the justices debated a hotly contested issue testing the limits of government - mandated contraception coverage , specifically involving for - profit corporations that object to it for religious reasons
the justices appeared divided along ideological lines in a 90 - minute oral argument , with the federal government offering a spirited defense of the @entity20
" how does a corporation exercise religion ? " asked justice @entity21 , summarizing perhaps the key constitutional question at hand
" this is a religious question , " said justice @entity26 , suggesting the businesses have such a right
" you want us to provide a definitive secular answer
" before the hearing began , hundreds of demonstrators representing both sides of the issue rallied in front of the courthouse on @entity39
the court is reviewing provisions of the @entity20 requiring for - profit employers of a certain size to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay
at issue is whether certain companies can refuse to do so on the sincere claim it would violate their owners ' long - established personal beliefs
two separate appeals are being heard together
the outcome was uncertain , but the court could cast preliminary votes later this week
a final written ruling is expected by late june
5 things to know about @entity20 and contraceptives the cases involve two appeals from @entity62
the companion legal challenge comes from @entity64 , an @entity66 - based arts and crafts retail giant
the @entity69 family owns @entity62 and the @entity71 family owns @entity64
both corporations emphasize their desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace
that includes their leaders ' publicly stated opposition to abortion
the cases present a complex mix of legal , regulatory , and constitutional concerns -- over such hot - button issues as faith , abortion , corporate power , executive agency discretion , and congressional intent
political stakes the political stakes are large , especially for the future effectiveness of @entity20 , which marks its fourth anniversary this week
the botched rollout of @entity97 , the federal site where consumers can sign up for insurance , has become another political flashpoint
@entity102 claim the law , approved by @entity104 without their support , is unworkable and are campaigning furiously against it in this year 's midterm elections
the church - state issue now in the spotlight involves three - pronged rules negotiated last year between the @entity3 administration and various outside groups
under the changes , churches and houses of worship are exempt from the contraception mandate
other nonprofit , religiously affiliated groups , such as church - run hospitals , parochial schools and charities like the @entity122 , must either offer coverage , or have a third - party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer 's direct involvement
lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts
for - profit businesses in spotlight the @entity64 and @entity62 claims are in yet another @entity20 category : for - profit corporations claiming a religion - based exemption
these suits follow the high court 's decision two years ago that narrowly upheld the key funding provision of the health care law , a blockbuster ruling affirming that most @entity144 would be required to purchase insurance or pay a financial penalty , the so - called individual mandate
the constitutional debate shifts to the separate employer mandates and whether corporations themselves enjoy the same first amendment rights as individuals
three federal appeals courts have struck down the contraception coverage rule , while two others have upheld it
that " circuit split " made the upcoming @entity6 review almost certain
a key issue for the bench will be interpreting a 1993 federal law known as the @entity162 , requiring the government to seek the " least burdensome " and narrowly tailored means for any law that interferes with religious convictions
can companies , churches , and universities be included , or do the protections apply only to " persons ? " " our family started @entity64 built on our faith and together as a family , " @entity172 , @entity64 co-owner , told @entity0 after the arguments
" we believe that @entity144 do n't lose their religious freedom when they open a family business
we were encouraged by today 's arguments
we are thankful that the @entity6 took our case and we prayerfully await the justice 's decision
" vocal backing for mandate in the arguments on tuesday , @entity3 's two appointees to the high court offered the most vocal backing of the mandate
" @entity104 has given a statutory entitlement and that entitlement is to women and includes contraceptive coverage , " said justice @entity190
" and when the employer says , no , i do n't want to give that , that woman is quite directly , quite tangibly harmed
" @entity21 asked the lawyer for the companies : " is your claim limited to sensitive materials like contraceptives or does it include items like blood transfusion , vaccines ? for some religions , products made of pork ? is any claim under your theory that has a religious basis , could an employer preclude the use of those items as well ? " solicitor general @entity215 , arguing for the administration , said the case was really not about the government or the corporate officers : " the rights of the third party employees are at center stage here
" " in the entire history of this country , there is not a single case in which a for - profit corporation was granted an exemption " on religious liberty grounds , when that would harm the rights of others , he added
tough questions justice @entity233 -- who may prove the decisive vote -- posed tough questions on both sides
" the government , through its healthcare plan -- under your view -- is allowing the employer to put the employee in a disadvantageous position , he said at one point to @entity245 , representing the @entity246 and @entity247
" the employee may not agree with these religious beliefs of the employer
do the religious beliefs just trump ? is that the way it works ? " @entity245 said there were other ways to ensure an employer did not have to violate her religious beliefs , while still giving workers the mandated coverage
" because you have a unique situation here , where their policy is about a government subsidy for a government - preferred health care item , and the question is who pays ? " said @entity245
" the government paying or a third - party insurer paying is a perfectly good least restrictive alternative
" chief justice @entity274 wondered whether government 's interest was really " compelling " as required , when the administration had already granted so many coverage exemptions -- including to houses of worship , religious non-profits , small companies , and grandfathered health plans
he suggested corporate rights extend into a wider range of areas , including allowing companies -- along with individuals -- to bring racial discrimination claims
" does the government have a position on whether corporations have a race ? " he asked @entity215
@entity233 later took issue with the government on another point
" under your view , a for - profit corporation could be forced in principle to pay for abortions , " which is currently not allowed under federal law
" no. i think , as you said , the law now is to the contrary , " replied @entity215 , who said most women taking iuds do not equate that with abortion
" but your reasoning would permit that , " said @entity233 , sharply
" you say profit corporations just do n't have any standing to vindicate the religious rights of their shareholders and owners
" " is n't that what we are talking about in terms of their religious beliefs ? " added @entity274
" one of the religious beliefs is that they have to pay for these four methods of contraception that they ( corporations ) believe provide abortions
" under the @entity20 , financial penalties of up to $ 100 per day per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage
@entity64 , which has about 13,000 workers , estimates the penalty could cost it $ 475 million a year
abortion rights groups urged the justices to again uphold a key tenet of @entity20
" what i think we saw today was the importance of having ( three ) women on the @entity6 , " said @entity337 , president , @entity338
" what 's at stake in this case is whether millions of women and their right to preventive care including birth control is trumped by a handful of @entity351 who have their own personal opinions about birth control
" the cases are @entity355 v. @entity356 ( 13 - 354 ) ; and @entity62 v. @entity355 ( 13 - 356 ) .
