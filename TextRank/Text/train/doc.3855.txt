@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 government is in talks with @entity1 rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition , a @entity1 opposition military spokesman in @entity0 said late thursday
the @entity4 government has not confirmed the claim , which follows an acknowledgement earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere
@entity15 , the spokesman for @entity0 's @entity16 , said that if the @entity4 agreed to help in @entity0 , @entity18 forces there would receive much needed supplies to fight against @entity1 leader @entity22 's forces
@entity0 is surrounded on three sides by @entity22 's forces , which are much better armed
the city 's only outlet is by sea
@entity22 has been under enormous international pressure to step down following a months - long uprising by rebels , emboldened by popular movements across the @entity32 , trying to bring an end to his 42 - year rule
the @entity36 approved a resolution in march authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians
@entity43 began bombing military targets a short time later
@entity1 state tv reported friday that @entity43 had attacked targets in the city of @entity48 , south of the capital , @entity50
it also reported that @entity53 forces had bombed an opposition building in @entity55 , in the far east of the country
@entity58 foreign minister @entity57 demanded an explanation from @entity60 thursday over its parachuting - in of arms to @entity1 rebels -- which was first revealed in a @entity4 media report wednesday -- @entity58 news agency @entity65 reported
@entity57 said that if confirmed , @entity4 's action was in violation of the @entity68
but speaking in @entity70 friday , @entity4 foreign minister @entity69 said his country 's @entity43 partners and the @entity36 had been told about @entity4 's decision to drop weapons for the @entity1 opposition
" we are exactly within the framework of resolutions 1970 and 1973 ... all means can be used to help civilian populations to protect themselves , " he said
" it 's within that framework that we reacted
we informed our @entity43 partners and the @entity36
" @entity4 @entity85 spokesman colonel @entity84 confirmed wednesday that its military had dropped food , medical products and light weaponry by parachute to @entity1 in @entity92
" it became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by @entity22 's forces , " he said
" the weapons were given for self defense because of the security situation
" speaking at a news conference thursday , @entity1 prime minister @entity100 said rebel forces were receiving arms from @entity4 but were not trained in their use
he said it was reckless of @entity4 to take such action , saying it went " against all of the proclaimed aims of @entity43 's intervention in @entity1
" @entity2 's @entity110 contributed to this report .
