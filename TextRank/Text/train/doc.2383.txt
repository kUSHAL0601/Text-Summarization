on a wet day in @entity2 's bustling capital , @entity3 , healthcare workers busily go about their daily tasks
a temperature is taken here , a patient is wheeled into an operation room there while hospital doctors shuffle along their rounds
@entity2 's population is over 74 million and growing
every citizen , whether young or old , will need medical care at some point in their lives
the need to upgrade and build new facilities to meet growing demand is hence very real -- a fact not lost on the country 's leaders
the @entity2 government initiated a health transformation program in 2003 financed by both private and public funds
there are currently 36 medical facilities under development with the giant @entity29 in @entity3 earmarked as the flagship project -- a site for science and knowledge
on completion , it will be one of the largest hospital complexes in the world , housing 1,300 doctors and double that number of nurses
@entity42 will also feature a hotel resort and conference area
hopes are high that the facility will cater for a large number of medical tourists as well
" this is the largest project of @entity2 ever under the republic era , " said @entity49 of @entity50 , the development company charged with taking @entity42 from the drawing board into construction
" it 's a historic moment for us
" so far , 86,000 iron rods and 900,000 tonnes of concrete have been used to build the 1.2 million square meter campus
of the 35 million tourists who visited @entity2 in 2013 , meanwhile , close to 200,000 came for surgical procedures from cancer treatments to hair transplants
@entity65 , the regional director for @entity66 , an architecture and engineering firm that specializes in healthcare projects , says part of the @entity71 strategy is to tap into this market
" we have seen plenty of patients coming from outside of @entity2 especially to the healthcare facilities in @entity78 , " @entity65 said
challenges remain in ensuring these well laid plans come to fruition , however
medical students at the nearby @entity82 will be key to the success of the transformation program
but graduate numbers still lag below the amount of staff needed
according to @entity2 health minister , @entity88 , the powers that be have a plan in place to address this issue
" at the moment we do n't have a high number of health professionals working in @entity2 , " @entity88 admits
" ( but ) we plan to recruit highly qualified health professionals , including doctors and nurses trained in the west , especially @entity101 and wider @entity102
" the government is pushing to implement its healthcare reforms by 2018
by then the @entity71 is expected to be serving 25,000 patients each day
it 's an ambitious timetable given the staffing and training obstacles that must be overcome
" we firmly believe that we will succeed ... based on our professional experience , based on our potential and the physical infrastructure we have been establishing , " @entity88 said
" by the end of 2017 we are planning to complete it by 70 % and by 2018 it 's going to be accomplished 100 %
