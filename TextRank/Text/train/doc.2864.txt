another beheading of a @entity4 captive by @entity5
and another family warned that its loved one may be next
for @entity10 's family , the nightmare has turned into reality
now @entity13 's family is hoping for a miracle
both @entity10 and @entity13 risked their lives to help strangers besieged by the @entity19 civil war
over the weekend , hundreds of people attended a service in @entity22 , @entity23 , to remember @entity10
and sunday night , @entity13 's parents issued another plea for their son
here are the stories of the aid workers snatched by militants bent on using them as political pawns : @entity10 : a ' national hero ' not even the calls of 200 mosques in @entity34 were enough to stop radical militants from decapitating @entity10 , a 47 - year - old taxi driver from near @entity22
" @entity10 was our local and national hero , " a joint statement from the mosques said
" we will remember him as a tireless and selfless volunteer aid worker whose only concern was to help people in need
" the mosques also slammed the terror group who took him
" the killing of @entity10 was a cowardly and criminal act of appalling brutality by a group who do not represent @entity52 at all and in fact are an insult to the @entity52 faith , " their statement said
@entity10 joined a group of volunteers who traveled to @entity19 in december 2013 to deliver food , water and medical supplies to people afflicted by the country 's devastating civil war
he was abducted by masked gunmen the day after @entity67 , other people in the aid convoy said
his wife , @entity68 , pleaded for her husband 's release , but to no avail
@entity5 released the video of @entity10 's decapitation on friday
it said the killing was a response to the @entity34 joining the @entity77 - led bombing campaign against the group in @entity79 and @entity19
some of @entity10 's fellow aid workers believe the @entity34 @entity82 's decision to authorize bombing @entity5 in @entity79 may have triggered their friend 's slaughter
" by joining the @entity77 airstrikes , we handed @entity10 , and many other @entity4 hostages , a death sentence , " aid worker dr. @entity85 said
but @entity34 prime minister @entity90 said the " abhorrent " killing of @entity10 means allies must continue trying to " do everything we can to defeat this organization
" and as it did in the beheading videos of @entity77 freelance journalists @entity97 and @entity99 and @entity34 aid worker @entity100 , @entity5 threatened to decapitate another westerner
it showed @entity77 aid worker @entity13 and said he would be next
@entity5 video similar to others , does n't run as long @entity13 : ' i am an idealist '
