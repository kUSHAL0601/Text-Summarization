-- they 're not just constant characters on a television screen , these candidates who every four years seek the presidency
they 're not present only to give us something to talk about for months on end
" what you feel like on certain days is a slow - moving target , " said @entity9 , reflecting on the unsuccessful campaign when he sought reelection to the @entity12
they grin and wave at crowds , asking for our votes while implying eternal sunniness
to reveal that they are vulnerable to hurt would seem to be an admission of weakness
" i did n't like it , " @entity24 said , speaking of being defeated when he ran on his own for president
but i never let my feelings be reflected publicly
i never let it out
it 's not my nature
" the candidates know that only one person can win a presidential election , and that the loser , no matter how accomplished , will forever be associated with the fact of his defeat
sometimes it is the incumbent ; sometimes it is a challenger
the feeling of emptiness is the same , although the men who have lived in the @entity12 and have then been denied a second term understand especially well just what it is they will be leaving behind
news : polling center -- down to the wire " i think when i lost the reelection campaign for the presidency , " @entity47 said , " i think i did my best , and although @entity50 was pretty -- well , bitter -- after the loss , i was not
i had to spend a long time assuaging her disappointment -- i 'm sure she would agree with this if she was here in the room right now -- and i said to her , ' @entity50 , we have a good life ahead of us
' " in my conversations over the decades with men who have served as president of the @entity66 and who have had to leave office before they wanted to , we have spent significant time talking about the emotions that accompany the leave - taking
these are men who have reached a pinnacle the rest of us will never come close to achieving
yet when they are turned away , their past accomplishments can not fully soothe the sting
on tuesday night , two men of considerable talent , soaring ambition and lifetimes full of triumphs will find out which one of them has been selected for a job they each covet , and which one has been rejected
either @entity84 or @entity85 is certain to be wounded to his core , even while the other man is celebrating to wild cheers
news : if @entity84 wins a second term ... very few people have known what it is like , on that highest of levels , to be seen as having failed
" if i had feelings , " @entity95 said , " i probably would n't have even survived
" his own final leave - taking , of course , was different from an election - night defeat
he had lost the presidency on a november night in 1960 , then won it on november nights in 1968 and 1972
he might well have assumed that the defeats of his life were all past tense
and then came the resignation at the height of the @entity108 crisis in august of 1974
he was defiant -- proudly so -- in not wanting to be seen as actively seeking sympathy
" i never wanted to be buddy - buddy , " he said
" not only with the press
i do n't believe in letting your hair down , confessing this and that and the other thing -- saying , ' @entity118 , i could n't sleep , because i was worrying about this or that
' i believe you should keep your troubles to yourself
news : if @entity85 wins ... " that 's just the way i am
some people think it 's good therapy to sit with a close friend and , you know , just spill your guts ... so perhaps the younger generation should go in every time they are asked how they feel about this or that , and they should reveal their inner psyche -- whether they were breast - fed , or bottle - fed. " not me
" the first president @entity9 , in talking about the pain of losing to @entity141 in 1992 , also bristled at the memory of being expected to reveal to the public his private feelings : " i did n't feel comfortable with all this ' @entity144 ' and @entity145 , " he said
he imitated the voice of a hard - bitten political adviser : " ' @entity150 has been on @entity145 , you got ta show ' em you can communicate with the youth
' i kept being told ... " he let his voice trail off
@entity47 , recalling his 1980 loss to @entity153 , told me : " so , yeah -- i think there is a lot of misapprehension about who a person is , even when he 's being looked at all the time
... a lot of the reporters who almost sort of condemned everything i 'd done and said , and they were insinuating that i did n't have any intelligence , i did n't have any judgment , i did n't have any moral convictions ... i mean , it was n't unanimous , but it was there
and even the reporters who were most negative about me , in my post-presidential years they have said , ' wow , this guy has finally listened to what i said about him as president , and he 's changed his ways now , he 's got a little bit of sense , a little bit of judgment
... ' " opinion : stand up for centrist candidates @entity47 laughed , with more than a hint of harshness
" i do n't think i 've changed , " he said
on tuesday night , the man who loses will have to assure his supporters that he and his family will be just fine
@entity188 told me that her husband , after his defeat , did his level best to give that impression
" he really did try to be very stoic in his face , " she said
" he told us that there always has to be a winner and there always has to be a loser , and that you should n't be in politics if you are n't aware of that
we did n't talk a lot about it , because there was no sense in dwelling on it
we both felt pretty terrible
but we could n't change it
" the real anguish tuesday night will take place behind closed doors
in the 1972 election , @entity214 , who died last month at the age of 90 , was wiped out by @entity95
@entity214 's press secretary , a novelist and former @entity220 reporter named @entity221 , later recalled what it was like to be in @entity214 's hotel room that evening as @entity214 was , line by line , editing his concession speech : " his eyes welled over and a tear fell that was so large it splashed when it struck the top of his hand
a terrible sound came from him that was like a giggle except that it was as much a sob as a giggle
he said : ' i do n't know why i do that when i 'm sad -- why i laugh
' he moved quickly toward the bathroom
[ @entity214 's wife ] @entity240 , beginning to cry again , said : ' @entity9 always does that
he always laughs when he feels most badly
... ' " they are not just names and moving images on millions upon millions of smart phone screens , these people who ask us to make them our president
and one of them , on one november night every four years , finds out what it is like to be told : sorry
we 've decided to go with someone else
opinion : @entity254 -- it 's the losing campaigns i remember most the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .
