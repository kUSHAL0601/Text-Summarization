@entity0 -- the last time @entity4 was in @entity5 , she was limping away from a disappointing third - place finish in the 2008 @entity5 caucuses
republicans would like that memory of @entity10 to stay
the @entity11 is starting a concerted effort friday to remind their supporters and reporters who will be covering @entity10 in @entity5 that the @entity5 has not always been friendly to the former secretary of state and first lady
" as we have seen with her nose dive in the polls , the more @entity4 turns to politics the less americans like her , " @entity11 spokesman @entity17 said in a statement
" it 's awkward considering she 's headed back to @entity5 , the scene of her most stinging defeat
" @entity10 will return to @entity5 on sunday for the politically important @entity29 , put on by longtime sen. @entity30
thousands of guests expect to listen to her speak , flip steaks and honor @entity30 , the liberal senator who is retiring after 2014
the event is the biggest foray @entity10 has made into politics since leaving the @entity37 in 2013
the steak fry is widely considered a must - stop for @entity40 considering a run at the presidency
organizers are expecting upward of 5,000 people and more than 150 journalists to attend
@entity4 to decide on 2016 run around end of year @entity10 supporters push back against the idea that there are bad memories for her in @entity5
" while @entity8 continue to bicker , @entity4 is focused on celebrating her good friend and former colleague , sen. @entity30 , and on helping candidates in @entity5 get elected in 2014 who share in the @entity40 ' vision for the future , " said @entity53 , spokeswoman for @entity54 , an outside communications group defending @entity10
but the @entity11 does n't want @entity10 to have a free weekend in @entity5
the group will be sending lawmakers and @entity11 surrogates a research document friday that lays out part of @entity10 's history in @entity5
titled " @entity68 , " the document focuses on @entity10 's 2008 @entity5 campaign
during that hard - fought presidential caucus , @entity10 finished a disappointing third behind then - sens. @entity72 and @entity74 , with 29 % of the vote
@entity72 won the caucus with 37.6 %
would @entity4 top @entity78 in @entity79 ? in addition to the talking points and research document , the @entity11 will release a web video on friday called " # @entity84
" " @entity4 is headed to @entity5 for the first time since 2008 , " reads the on - screen text atop clips of negative news coverage of the night @entity10 lost
" bad memories for @entity4
" despite @entity11 hopes , @entity10 's favorability in @entity5 has rebounded since 2008
a new @entity1 / @entity93 poll finds that 53 % of all registered @entity40 contacted in @entity5 said they would support @entity10 if the 2016 caucuses were held today
that number far outpaces vice president @entity97 's 15 %
sen. @entity98 of @entity99 got 7 % in the poll , and 5 % would pick sen. @entity100 , an independent from @entity101
@entity100 challenges @entity4 : ' is ( she ) going to say that ? '
