air pollution in @entity1 has gotten so bad lately that one environmentalist 's wacky idea for a solution does n't seem all that far - fetched : putting clean air in a can
last week , when a thick gray haze blanketed @entity9 and several other @entity1 cities , sending kids to the hospital , grounding planes and causing the government to order cars off the road , @entity7 took to the streets in @entity9 to hand out yellow and green cans of smog - free , non-carcinogenic air
open it and drink it and breathe it ! " the @entity22 quoted the multimillionaire and national celeb as saying
" it keeps you fresh the whole day ! " ego aside ( the bright cans feature an image of @entity7 's face and the words " @entity7 is a good man " on them ) , the clever political stunt is just the sort of thing that @entity1 needs these days
such creative and public protests should help push forward much - needed national reforms to combat air pollution in the country
a " @entity38 " for @entity1 is long overdue
and the recent " air - pocalypse , " as the suffocating air pollution that hung over several @entity1 cities in january has been termed , should be more than enough proof of that
the pollution during the 2013 @entity45 of @entity1 was so thick last month that it was visible from space ( from space ! )
breathing in @entity9 was " akin to living in a smoking lounge , " according to an analysis from @entity50
air quality readings literally were off the charts
an index reading below about 50 is considered healthy
readings for @entity9 in january hit 500 , the top of the index , and went higher than 700 , according to the @entity58 embassy
" the air has this kind of greenish - gray pallor to it
and it smells like you 're standing next to a chemical plant , really chlorine - y , " said @entity63 , a senior attorney at the @entity64 , an environmental group
" it 's an awesomely bad smell
" he was telling me about @entity9 air on a normal day
" i 'm standing outside my office building but am unable to see its top , " one @entity9 resident said , according to @entity1 's state news agency , @entity74
" the new normal in @entity9 is sending your kids to school wearing gas masks , " @entity78 wrote in @entity79
fixing @entity1 's air pollution is not just about the country 's image or economy , although those certainly suffer because of smog , too
it 's about the right of all humans to walk outside and breathe in air that wo n't choke them or make them sick
the @entity95 reports hospital visits for respiratory problems were up 20 % during the air - pocalypse
last year , small particle air pollution , called @entity100 , in four major @entity1 cities resulted in 8,572 premature deaths , according to a december study by @entity104 and @entity106 's @entity105
similar deaths can and should be prevented
and i 'm optimistic they will be
it was n't all that long ago , in 1952 , that the " @entity45 " covered @entity114 in gray , sooty pollution , resulting in an estimated 4,000 premature deaths
the government reacted by passing sweeping reforms
now @entity114 is known for its real fog , not smog
air pollution in @entity122 was handled in a similar fashion
after the city 's car culture created a smog problem , scientists started researching protective helmets to protect people
but , eventually the government took action to reduce the pollution
@entity135 led the way for the nation , and in 1963 , the @entity58 passed the @entity38
that law is credited with preventing 205,000 premature deaths , 843,000 asthma attacks and 18 million child respiratory illnesses in 1990 , based on the first 20 years of the law
and it 's unfortunate that things had to get bad before they could get better
but @entity1 , like others , is finally realizing that its air really is that bad
its own people are calling for the change and more vigorously than before
more than 200 students at a @entity9 high school school signed a petition asking the city to " amend air quality regulations and take specific emergency measures , " according to @entity156 from @entity157
and on @entity162 , @entity1 's version of @entity159 , @entity160 , a real estate magnate , called for the country to adopt its own @entity38
when he posed the idea to his 14 million @entity162 followers in an online poll , nearly all of the 50,000 - some people who responded said they supported that type of national legislation
maybe that 's just one man 's social media feed
but there 's a history of this kind of thing working in @entity1
in 2011 , @entity160 successfully used his online network to press @entity9 authorities to report more smog data , according to the @entity182 's @entity1 blog
it 's clear the government has taken notice this time as well
@entity9 implemented several emergency measures to curb smog
state media is talking about the pollution
after speaking with a few experts , it seems clear what needs to be done : @entity1 has to reduce its reliance on coal , increase renewable energy , regulate the amount of smog - causing sulfur that can go into its diesel fuel and increase vehicle efficiency
" it 's not rocket science , " said the @entity64 's @entity63
there will , of course , be costs and significant challenges
@entity1 burns " nearly as much coal as the rest of the world combined , " according to a recent report from the @entity207
@entity9 catches so much of the pollution from coal - burning power plants because it sits at the center of a ring of mountains , which help trap the smog
throw a bunch more cars into the mix , 13 million of them were sold in @entity1 last year , according to @entity222 and the problems start compounding
fixes may be expensive , but the @entity58 has made the compelling case that the costs of enforcing clean air regulations are offset by gains in health and worker productivity
@entity1 , which does have some air quality regulations , already seems to be realizing this
the country on wednesday announced stricter fuel standards that go into effect by the end of 2014 for diesel and 2017 for gas , according to the @entity240
an environmental official , @entity241 , also told state media this week that " @entity1 will formulate regulations , standards and policies to reduce air pollutants and control coal burning
" the energy industry estimates it will costs billions for @entity1 to meet tougher fuel standards
it may be up to people like artist @entity252 , who posed in a photo wearing a gas mask , and @entity7 , the man who 's peddling cans of clean air , to ensure that the public and the government see that clean air is worth the cost
" i want to tell mayors , county chiefs and heads of big companies : do n't just chase gdp growth , do n't chase the biggest profits at the expense of our children and grandchildren , and at the cost of sacrificing our ecological environment , " @entity7 told @entity267
if @entity1 leaders do n't want to drink air from a can , they should listen .
