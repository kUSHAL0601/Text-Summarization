@entity0 , @entity1 -- in december 2000 , @entity3 , a former @entity4 intelligence agent , was introduced by his second cousin to an international fugitive , the target of an international manhunt
then , spurred in part by the allure of a $ 5 million reward , @entity3 helped authorities capture the fugitive , former @entity14 spy master @entity13
@entity13 ' capture was considered a success -- he had been convicted of an illegal arms trade , embezzlement and abuse of power , among others -- and arguably could not have been accomplished without @entity3 's help
now , nearly 10 years later , @entity3 has not seen a penny of the reward money , and is increasingly unlikely to ever reap his reward
a @entity27 appeals court last week ruled that a lawsuit brought by @entity3 against @entity14 is invalid , dashing his attempt to recoup the money
the @entity31 on friday overturned a district court ruling that found @entity14 should cough up the cash
the @entity27 courts do not have jurisdiction over the case because @entity14 has sovereign immunity , the three - judge panel found , noting that the facts of the case " read like the latest spy thriller
" it all began in the second half of 2000 , as the government of then - @entity14 president @entity45 began to crumble
the autocratic leader had seen some cracks in his armor , but his government fell apart after videos of @entity13 , his powerful spy chief , were leaked , showing him bribing an opposition congressman
other incriminating videos also emerged
" @entity13 , seeing the writing on the wall , fled the country , first into @entity4 , then , it seemed , into thin air , " the judges wrote
in april 2001 , @entity14 's interim president issued an emergency decree that provided a $ 5 million reward for information leading to @entity13 ' capture
it was to be paid 24 hours after the arrest
but before there was a reward , @entity3 had a different relationship with @entity13 , as his protector in @entity4
initially , @entity71 's cousin introduced a man with bandages on his face as " @entity75 , " and asked @entity3 to give him a place to stay
according to the court document , it was shortly thereafter that @entity3 understood that his guest was @entity13 , who had undergone facial cosmetic surgery in an attempt to evade arrest
@entity3 agreed to take the guest in , as well as to provide security for him , the judges ' ruling states
" for his part , @entity13 used @entity3 as an intermediary to run personal errands and to arrange for the deposit of funds into @entity13 ' accounts in @entity27 banks , " the document says
one of his missions was to @entity96 to meet with banker @entity97 , who handled a @entity13 account at @entity99
@entity13 had requested a large transfer to another bank , which @entity97 declined
according to court documents , @entity13 responded by e-mail , threatening physical harm
he then sent @entity3 with instructions to the banker
they met at a @entity96 hotel , where @entity3 handed over a letter demanding that @entity97 hand over $ 700,000 in cash from @entity13 ' account and transfer $ 3 million to another bank
as he was leaving the hotel , @entity3 was detained by @entity115 agents
@entity97 had tipped off the feds
the @entity115 gave @entity3 a choice : " if he gave the @entity115 @entity13 ' address and telephone number in @entity121 , he would be released , the charges against him dropped , and he would recieve the $ 5 million reward , " the document states
with both the carrot and stick in front of him , @entity3 agreed to cooperate , and @entity13 was captured the following day
but @entity14 never paid him the reward that it indicated to the @entity115 it would
so @entity3 sued in the @entity27 , and came close to winning his claim
somewhere in there @entity97 tried unsuccessfully to insert himself in the suit
after all , he argued in court , if he had n't called the @entity115 , they would n't have gotten to @entity13 , and he wanted his share of the reward money
the district court ruled that @entity14 had broken it 's part of the bargain and , even if @entity3 was n't wearing a white hat during this episode , was owed the $ 5 million plus interest
by a thin 2 - 1 ruling in the @entity31 , @entity14 regained the upper hand .
