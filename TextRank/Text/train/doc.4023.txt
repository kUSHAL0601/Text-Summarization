@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 is set to press ahead with new taxes , public - sector job cuts and the sale of everything from airports to gaming licenses after @entity0 prime minister @entity9 narrowly survived a confidence vote early wednesday
@entity9 is planning to cut 150,000 government jobs , slash the salaries of those who keep their posts , and slap new taxes on property , yachts and swimming pools
he 's trying to win confidence from international lenders in order to get a second bailout package to keep the government from defaulting on debts
but the austerity package is very unpopular
weeks of protests forced @entity9 to shuffle his cabinet last week , leading to the confidence vote , which he won 155 - 143
@entity30 markets were slightly down wednesday morning , though it was not clear if that was in response to the @entity0 vote
international lenders have demanded @entity0 cut spending , lay off public workers , increase taxes and raise 50 billion euros ( $ 71 billion ) through selling off state - owned enterprises in exchange for another bailout deal for the cash - strapped nation
analysts warn that a @entity0 default could cripple the euro , the @entity47 's common currency , and send shock waves throughout the world economy
" if @entity0 were to default , i think the idea that you could contain that would be fanciful , " former @entity51 finance minister @entity50 told @entity2 wednesday
" it 's a bit like saying , ' let 's let @entity63 's go bust again and wait and see what happens , " he said , referring to the investment bank that collapsed in 2008 , adding fuel to the global recession
an acute crisis in @entity0 would lead to a chain effect that " probably would n't stop in @entity30 , " he warned
" it would have a feedback to @entity70 banks and so on
" @entity0 lawmakers are slated to vote on the privatization plan and further tax increases , pension cuts and layoffs on june 30 , and @entity78 president @entity77 warned @entity0 risks being abandoned by both @entity30 and the @entity79 if it fails to act
" there is no alternative to this program
let 's face it , " @entity77 told @entity2 on tuesday
" and that 's why it has to be clear
we need @entity0 to deliver , and if @entity0 wants this program of support , @entity30 is ready to support it
" @entity0 finance minister @entity90 said tuesday he was encouraged by support he received from main opposition leader @entity92 on the austerity plan , which @entity90 said he would take to @entity95 ministers july 3
harsh reforms designed to help reduce @entity0 's enormous budget deficit have so far led to tax hikes and public - sector job losses alongside already record - high unemployment
@entity9 faces opposition from within his own ruling socialists over the austerity measures
airports , highways and state - owned companies as well as banks , real estate and gaming licenses will all go on the auction block
on june 9 , the @entity111 approved a tough five - year plan for 2011 - 15 and introduced a bill in @entity114 to put austerity measures into effect
the government proposes reducing the public - sector workforce by 150,000 ; workers will also face changes in working hours , practices and wages , and the plan also sets out changes to social benefits , including pensions and unemployment aid
protests against those plans turned violent june 15 as demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at the @entity133 and police fired tear gas at protesters , police said
but @entity9 did not change course , telling lawmakers over the weekend , " the government must stop spending more than it takes in
" according to the @entity133 , these measures will help achieve 28.3 billion euros ( $ 40.5 billion ) in cuts from 2012 to 2015 and shrink @entity0 's public deficit to less than 3 % of gross domestic product , in accordance with the @entity47 target
@entity2 's @entity145 and @entity146 and journalist @entity147 contributed to this report .
