-- at least 23 people were killed and dozens wounded in a series of attacks targeting @entity7 areas across northern @entity8 on thursday , police officials told @entity0
the deadliest attack was in @entity10 , where 16 people died when a car bomb exploded in an outdoor market thursday evening
another 27 were wounded in the largely @entity7 city , about 100 km ( 63 miles ) north of @entity15 , police said
in @entity15 , gunmen shot dead three men outside their house in @entity20 , a mixed @entity7 - @entity21 area on the city 's southwest side
and in @entity26 , a @entity7 neighborhood in western @entity15 , gunmen opened fire on a group of people in a residential area and killed two people , police said
in @entity34 , a car bomb exploded outside a local hospital and killed two people
nine other people were wounded in this explosion
@entity34 is a largely @entity7 city about 360 km ( 224 miles ) north of @entity15
police officials in those cities spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to release information to media
the latest bloodshed followed the deaths of 56 people wednesday in a series of blasts that targeted mostly @entity21 areas in and around @entity15
the country has endured months of escalating violence stemming from decades - old discord between the nation 's @entity7 and @entity21 , the two largest branches of @entity55
july was the deadliest month in @entity8 since the peak of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007
according to the @entity58 , 1,057 @entity8 were killed and another 2,326 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence last month
@entity7 have felt politically marginalized under a @entity21 - led government since the ouster of longtime leader @entity64 in the 2003 @entity66 - led invasion
meanwhile , the government is wary that the @entity68 who 've been involved in fighting @entity71 president @entity70 's government are now targeting the government in @entity15
@entity7 - @entity21 frictions have escalated since an april incident in @entity75 , in northern @entity8 , where @entity8 security forces raided a site used by @entity7 protesters to demonstrate against the @entity21 - led government
@entity7 protests against the @entity8 government have continued since the @entity75 incident .
