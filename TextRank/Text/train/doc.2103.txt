an appeals judge in @entity1 on sunday cleared @entity3 couple @entity2 of starving their adopted daughter to death in 2013 , in a case that drew global attention to the @entity11 nation 's justice system
however , the couple were blocked from leaving @entity1 on sunday by immigration officials at @entity14 , who confiscated their passports , according to the @entity17 , which cited a family spokesman @entity18
a new warrant had been issued for their arrest on unknown charges , the agency cited @entity18 as saying
the couple remained at the airport sunday night with the @entity3 ambassador to @entity1 , @entity25 , @entity17 reported
earlier , @entity26 issued a statement thanking the @entity1 judge for his decision
" this has been an emotional trial for me and my family , " @entity26 said in a statement
" @entity34 and i want to go home and be reunited with our sons
we have not been able to grieve our daughter 's death , but we want to thank the judge for today 's decision
" the @entity42 -- who were living in @entity1 while @entity26 worked for a international company working on construction projects for the @entity45 -- were arrested in january 2013 when their 8 - year - old daughter @entity46 died
they were charged with starving her to death , convicted in march and sentenced to three years in prison
the @entity1 prosecutor sought to paint @entity34 and @entity26 as inhumane -- alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty - stricken parents in @entity54 -- and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges
the couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in november 2013 pending their appeal
in explaining his decision to overturn the conviction , judge @entity60 cited weaknesses in forensic reports and said the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said @entity46 was n't deprived
a report by pathologists hired by the defense , obtained by @entity71 , stated they found no evidence tissue samples were taken from @entity46 's body after her death , despite the fact @entity1 investigators submitted an autopsy report
advocates for the @entity79 suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the @entity1 judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered
criticism of @entity1 justice the case against the @entity42 shined a light on the @entity1 justice system and drew complaints from the @entity3
@entity1 is a key ally in the @entity3 - led coalition against the terror group @entity91 and host to many countries ' forces involved in airstrikes
the @entity1 government also helped the @entity3 secure the release of sgt. @entity98 from @entity100 captivity this year
despite the close ties , the @entity101 expressed concern
officials requested in october that @entity1 's government lift the @entity79 ' travel ban , allowing them to return to the @entity3
" the 22 long months of court proceedings following their daughter 's tragic death have compounded the tragedy for the @entity26 family , and it is time now , as the @entity116 stated , to let the @entity42 return home , " @entity3 secretary of state @entity107 said in a statement
" we are deeply concerned about new delays that have prevented their departure , " he said
a @entity123 special rapporteur investigating the justice system in @entity1 also called attention to the @entity42 ' case and urged the government to release them and send them home
fighting family after the couple 's arrest , their two sons , also adopted from @entity54 , were temporarily placed in a @entity1 orphanage
they have since been sent back to the @entity3 to live with @entity135 's mother
the entire family chipped in during the prolonged separation
with @entity26 fired from his job , the couple are living on donations from family and friends
@entity135 's brother , @entity143 , gave up his job in @entity144 to work on the case full time
he was the nerve center of the family , raising money for expenses and defense costs and dealing with the @entity42 ' lawyers and advocates
their focus on their fate took away from time for them to grieve @entity46 's loss
" everything has revolved around her case and our situation , " @entity135 said
" we have n't had a chance to really say goodbye and mourn
we just really want to be able to honor her place in our lives with our friends and family and that has n't happened yet
