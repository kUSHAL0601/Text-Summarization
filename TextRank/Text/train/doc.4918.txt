@entity0 , @entity1 -- my dad died when i was 2 , so my mother raised us [ @entity7 and his sister ] and exposed us to different things
we took music lessons , art appreciation lessons , and we even went to finishing school
my sister and i hated it at the time
we just wanted to be normal kids and eat our @entity18 on saturday mornings in front of the television , watching our @entity21
my mom was a very good cook
in fact , she was a private cook for an attorney for years
she exposed my sister and i to the same types of food that she was cooking at work
we were basically the only kids on our block that had eaten lobster with drawn butter
on holidays , we would go to work with her
we 'd always sit in the kitchen
i was just amazed with all the cooking ingredients and implements
i was one of those guys that was never picked to be on someone 's baseball team or basketball team , so i started cooking
my mother had always had a lot of cookbooks
i just started playing around
we always had butter ; we always had flour and sugar and vanilla and eggs
i might have looked at other recipes and did n't think we had the ingredients , and i certainly did n't have money to go buy them
the first thing i baked was a cake
i was 9 or 10
it was a plain yellow cake
i can remember the icing being a little runny , but it was good
we went to catholic school
we went to @entity62 once a week , while in school , as well as on sundays
@entity64 has always been with me
read more about faith and religion on @entity2 's @entity67 i 've certainly called on @entity64 when i 'm in the kitchen , when things are going wrong , when i 'm irritated or very upset about something
i 've called on @entity64 walking up here to unlock the doors and come into work -- to help me at not being quick - tempered or losing my cool
help me be the person i need to be
it [ becoming a priest ] is something that i thought about as a child
it was something i was going to do out of high school , and i put it off
i 'm glad now that i did n't go through with it , because i was very immature
but now i feel very strongly , and i know in my heart that i 'm ready to do it
i did n't wake up one morning and just sit up in bed and stretch and say , " well , i think i 'll try the priesthood
" there 's a lot of prayer involved
this prayer process , that 's neverending
i have a spiritual director i work with , and i started out with that at first
but this process of thinking about it , it 's been all my life
i developed a very close relationship with the archbishop [ archbishop @entity96 of the @entity97 ]
he was here , at the restaurant , one night about two or three months ago , and i said , " there 's something on my mind , and i 'd love to talk to you about it
" i met with him , and i was n't home 10 minutes and the vocation director called
i set up another appointment to meet with him , and the rest is history
there are parts of it [ the restaurant kitchen ] that i 'll miss and parts of it that i will not miss. i will miss the people
i will miss the guests
the cooking aspects , i definitely will miss. i will not miss the rushiness of it , the overwhelming feeling you get when you 're working the line , and it looks like everyone is ordering at the same time
i 'm hoping i can still do things [ in a kitchen ] , but i 'm hoping i can do it on a small scale , for fun
i would love to do something for the needy or poor , during the holidays when people really feel their lowest
not just your typical out - of - the - can , warmed - up meal ; i 'd like to do it [ serve them ] just like you 'd get here
i 'll move into the seminary
i am looking forward to embracing the simple life
that gives me great pleasure to think about
i want to give all of myself , and i do n't think you can do that when you have a lot of baggage
i have this massive cookbook collection -- close to 3,000 books -- that i 'm not just going to leave or just throw away
i have thought about , if i passed away , where would it go
i want to donate it to a school
with baking , you have to follow the rules
i try to be a very good rule player
play by the rules and work by the rules
the prayer life , the rules that a priest is supposed to live by , that really excites me
and being able to help people and minister to people
yesterday at @entity62 , one of the readings was about the widow who gave all of what she had
i want to emulate her , and i think this is the best way that i can see for me .
