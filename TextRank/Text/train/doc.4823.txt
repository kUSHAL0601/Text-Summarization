-- for the second time in three years , the @entity2 city of @entity3 has been declared the most expensive city in the world for expats by @entity7 , a human resources consulting firm
while it 's true that most of the @entity13 capital 's population lives in poverty on the outskirts of the city , in the center , @entity9 share the road with @entity19 and the latest @entity20
@entity21 makes such a killing here that it opened a second store within walking distance of the first
for those not familiar with @entity3 , however , the ranking may come as a surprise
@entity29 ( which took top spot in @entity7 's survey last year ) makes sense as the world 's most expensive expat city
so might @entity35 or @entity36
but @entity3 ? what 's it like to visit ? so , what 's this scandalously expensive place -- where a mid-level expat professional might earn $ 10,000 a month -- like to visit ? @entity42 , some context
@entity3 is the capital of @entity2 's second largest oil producer , @entity13 ( @entity45 beats it ) , a rising political and economic powerhouse
yet the country also suffered a destructive and violent 27 - year civil war , ending only in 2002 , which crippled its infrastructure and decimated its ability to produce its own food
as a consequence , almost everything in @entity3 has to be imported
heavy import duties , along with high taxes and monopolized supply chains linked to the powerful political elite further drive up the price of goods and services to astronomical levels
then there 's institutional corruption , which creates high prices through price fixing and price collusion
@entity68 - high hotel bills hotels are the visitor 's biggest expense
despite more opening in recent years , prices have remained stuck at about $ 500 a night for five - star hotels , $ 350 - 400 for four - stars and $ 300 - 350 for mid-level lodging
a meal at @entity3 's smartest restaurants will easily top $ 100 per person , including appetizers and drinks
such prices can be supported only by expats working for multinational companies and wealthy @entity13 who work for the country 's burgeoning oil and banking sectors
most @entity90 , by contrast , live on the city 's periphery and make vastly inferior incomes
while a mid-level banking professional might take home $ 8,000 - $ 10,000 a month , a driver or housemaid makes $ 500 a month , if the boss is feeling generous
luxury car traffic jams may be a common sight in the capital , but the roads are appalling and public services -- from driver 's license renewal to the post -- are horrendous
( perhaps send your postcards after leaving the country
) still keen to go ? @entity3 is a dynamic , albeit challenging , place to visit and one you 're unlikely to forget
but it does n't have to be prohibitively expensive -- if you know where to look
a ' cheap ' day and a night say you 're in @entity3 for a day and a night
you 'll need a hotel : @entity3 ( @entity114 , @entity115 ; +244 222 642 600 ; from $ 500 a night ) is considered the best in the city , with prices to match , while executive @entity119 ( @entity118 s / n , @entity119 , @entity3 ; +244 915407117 ; from $ 300 ) , offers rare decent value , all things considered
as soon as you step out of the hotel door , the only way to avoid a cash hemorrhage is to follow the age - old expat line and start living like a local
the city does n't have much in the way of museums and public parks , but it 's worth walking along the recently refurbished @entity131 , the seafood promenade that stretches from the local port to the @entity134 , the peninsula jutting into @entity135
if you do , keep an eye on the imposing , whitewashed @entity138 fort perched on a hill overlooking the city ; once you get close , take a left , go up the hill and you 'll find an armed forces museum ( +244 222 373 623 ) located inside the structure
beach life beaches are a must in @entity13 in summer
near @entity3 , @entity148 is a spit of land with thatch - roofed restaurants and hotel bungalows on one side and miles of deserted beach , with fantastic waves , on the other
you can catch water taxis out to @entity158 at the @entity160 dock ( $ 5 ) and spend the day there
another option is to get out of @entity3 altogether and head 40 kilometers south to the @entity162 , a beautiful landscape of cliffs , pinnacles and valleys stretching toward the horizon
dotted with baobab trees , the long , empty savanna will make you question why everyone stays crammed in the city
at @entity173 , about 150 kilometers south of @entity3 , you 'll find some of the country 's finest beaches , excellent for surfing
@entity13 cuisine @entity13 has a culinary tradition influenced by 500 years of @entity138 colonization and seafood from more than a thousand kilometers of coastline
in the @entity115 , @entity3 's central business district , a good spot for lunch is @entity184 ( @entity114 16 , @entity115 ; +244 923 542 868 ) , a friendly @entity13 bistro where the beer is cold and the food is cheap
it 's within walking distance of some of the city 's most popular hotels and the average check is $ 20
at @entity194 , where many of the city 's best restaurants are located , two low - key favorites are @entity198 do @entity199 ( @entity200 , @entity201 ) and @entity202 ( @entity200 , after @entity203 on your left side ; it has blue walls and white bars on the outside )
at both places you can eat a feast -- featuring excellent mufete , a local delicacy of beans stewed in palm oil , grilled tilapia , onion vinaigrette , boiled plantains , sweet potatoes and yucca -- for about $ 17
for dinner , on the fringes of central @entity3 in the @entity221 you can try the excellent cuisine of @entity13 master chef @entity224 at his @entity226 ( @entity225 , @entity227 , @entity3 ; +244 943 256 193 )
entrees here rarely top the $ 30 mark , and if they do it 's because you 're getting enough food for two
splurge time and if you want to splurge -- this is the world 's most expensive city , after all -- @entity236 ( @entity237 15 , @entity134 do @entity173 , @entity3 ; +244 936 000 018/9 ) is the king of @entity3 restaurants
entrees here can cost $ 150 -- seafood is flown in from @entity243 three times a week
you 're spoiled for choice if you want to prolong your night in @entity3
the city 's new nightlife darling is the @entity248 , in the bowels of the @entity250
but you could skip the $ 40 minimum spend there and experience true @entity3 nightlife at the @entity253 -- where there 's all kinds of music , a welcoming crowd and the $ 20 cover includes three drinks
@entity260 runs the @entity262 website .
