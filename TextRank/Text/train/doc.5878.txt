@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 administration 's planned drawdown of @entity7 troops from @entity8 is proceeding " as promised " and should lead to an end of @entity7 's combat mission there by the end of august , president @entity3 said monday
plans to reduce the number of @entity7 troops in @entity8 to 50,000 by the end of this month are on schedule , @entity3 told the national convention of @entity17
at that point , the @entity7 mission will shift to the training and support of @entity8 security forces
a full withdrawal of @entity7 troops from @entity8 is scheduled to occur by the end of next year
the war in @entity8 " is nearing an end , " he said
" as a candidate for president , i pledged to bring the war in @entity8 to a responsible end
and that is exactly what we are doing
" while the @entity7 military commitment in @entity8 is now nearing a conclusion , the president warned , there is still danger there for @entity7 troops on the ground
" the hard truth is we have not seen the end of @entity7 sacrifice in @entity8 , " @entity3 said
" but make no mistake , our commitment in @entity8 is changing -- from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats
" @entity3 's update on the conflict in @entity8 came in the context of a wide - ranging speech addressing several issues tied to national security and veterans ' benefits
@entity3 defended his decision to increase @entity7 military commitment in @entity62 -- a decision criticized by some of the more liberal members of his own party
he said the military has now gone on the offensive against extremist elements , and took issue with critics who claim the @entity7 end game in @entity62 remains poorly defined
" we face huge challenges in @entity62 , " he said
" but it 's important that the @entity7 people know that we are making progress and we 're focused on goals that are clear and achievable
" " if @entity62 were to be engulfed by an even wider insurgency , @entity79 and its terrorist affiliates would have even more space to plan their next attack
" " as president of the @entity7 , i refuse to let that happen , " he said
the @entity89 government has begun to " take the fight to violent extremists within its borders
major blows have been struck against @entity79 and its leadership , " @entity3 said
on @entity8 , the president provided a largely optimistic assessment of the @entity7 effort , saying violence there is currently " near the lowest it 's been in years
" but @entity8 officials released data saturday that they said shows july was the deadliest month for civilians since may 2008 , reporting that 396 civilians , 50 @entity8 soldiers and 89 police officers were killed
@entity8 officials also said 100 so - called " terrorists " were killed , and 955 others were detained
the @entity7 military has disputed the @entity8 figures , saying the actual numbers are less than half what @entity8 's government reported
the @entity7 command in @entity119 , @entity8 , " refutes that 535 people were killed in @entity8 during the month of july , " the military said in a statement sunday
it put the total number of people killed by " enemy action " at 222 , including 161 civilians , 55 @entity8 troops and six @entity7 -- the ninth - lowest civilian casualty count since january 2008 , according to the @entity7 military
the @entity7 military has said it believes @entity8 security forces can maintain current levels of relative stability , but that sentiment is not shared by many @entity8
former @entity8 prime minister @entity131 said in a recent interview with @entity2 that he is concerned that " the security is declining ... [ and ] that 's why we need really good resolutions , we need to expedite the formation of a government and we need to create an understanding in the region , and we need the help of the @entity7 to facilitate all of these issues through its good offices in @entity8 and elsewhere in the region
" starting in september , the number of @entity7 troops in @entity8 -- 50,000 -- will be almost a third of the total number there when @entity3 took office in january 2009 , the @entity145 has said
there will be 96,000 @entity7 troops on the ground in @entity62 -- more than three times the number there at the beginning of @entity3 's term
in july , there were 81,000 @entity7 troops in @entity8 and 87,000 in @entity62
while there is sharp public division over the @entity7 effort in @entity62 , @entity7 largely support the removal of @entity7 forces from @entity8
nearly two - thirds of all @entity7 back the administration 's plan to remove most troops by the end of august , according to a may 21 - 23 @entity2 / @entity170 poll
only 36 percent of @entity7 favor the war in @entity8 , the survey indicated
@entity3 offered praise monday for all the veterans of major @entity7 military conflicts since @entity176 " in the life of our nation , not every generation has been summoned to defend our country in its hour of need
but every generation to answer that call has done so with honor and courage , " he told the enthusiastic crowd
the president ran through a litany of administration initiatives for military veterans , including " dramatically increased funding for veterans health care across the board
" among the initiatives he highlighted : an increased use of electronic record - keeping that will allow veterans , for the first time , to go to the @entity202 's website and download or print personal health records " so you have them when you need them and can share them with your doctors outside the @entity202
" the new measure will take effect this fall , he said
@entity2 's @entity212 contributed to this report .
