@entity0 , whose roller - coaster , nine - decade career in show business included vaudeville , silent films , movies , television and @entity8 , died sunday
@entity11 died in @entity12 , the @entity10 's office said
@entity11 's career spanned almost the entire history of motion pictures
he made his first film , the silent " not to be trusted , " in 1926 and followed it up with several shorts based on the " @entity20 " comic strip
he was still making movies nine decades later , including " @entity22 " ( 2006 ) and " the @entity23 " ( 2011 )
at the time of his death , he had three more films in the works , according to the @entity28 , including a version of " @entity30 " with @entity31
@entity11 had just completed his last movie role in the next installment of " @entity22 " with @entity34
" he led a full life but did not have enough time to finish all he had planned to do
he had the time of his life and the utmost respect for the cast and crew , " his son @entity37 said in a statement to @entity39 monday
he separated from his wife , @entity46 , two years ago and moved in with his son and his wife , @entity48 , according to the statement
" with them he finally found happiness , health and a feeling of safety and was able to enjoy life again
" " @entity0 was finally enjoying life as a bachelor , and the morning of his death , they spoke of all their future plans , " the statement said
" he loved the business he was in and had a great respect for his fellow actors
" for a period in the 1930s and 1940s , boosted by the popularity of the " @entity68 " series of films , @entity11 was the no. 1 star at the box office and perhaps the brightest star at @entity71 -- a whole studio of " more stars than there are in heaven , " as the publicity said
yet he became as famous for many marriages -- eight , all told -- and his regular tumbles off the @entity80 pedestal as he was for his incredible energy and longevity
still , he never stopped getting up
" i keep going because if you stop , you stop , " he told the @entity85 's @entity84 newspaper in 2009
" why retire ? @entity87
" top box - office draw the diminutive 5 - foot , 2 - inch @entity11 began his acting career shortly after his first birthday , appearing on vaudeville stages with his parents
he was born @entity94 on september 23 , 1920 , in @entity95 , @entity96
his parents split when he was young , but spurred by his mother , he soon found himself in @entity80
before he was 10 , he was a star , appearing in dozens of shorts based on the popular " @entity20 " strip
he worked steadily through the 1930s , with notable turns in a 1935 version of " @entity103 " and 1937 's " @entity104 , " the latter opposite @entity105
( @entity11 also appeared in @entity105 's 1938 vehicle " @entity107
" ) but he shot into @entity80 's stratosphere in his next film series as @entity68 in more than a dozen films produced between 1937 and 1946
@entity68 was a good - hearted ball of teenage mischief , always trying to make a few dollars or willing to " put on a show , " no matter what it took : rounding up friends , using a barn , getting some spare parts from his wholesome middle - @entity120 neighborhood
inevitably , he would be called to account with his father , judge @entity68 , played at first by @entity122 and later by @entity123
judge @entity68 would reiterate the basics of fairness and morality , and @entity68 -- and the movie audience -- would have once again learned a valuable lesson
the films were hugely popular , even more so when @entity11 's character became the centerpiece starting with 1938 's " @entity132
" it did n't hurt that @entity11 was paired with @entity134 for three of the films
@entity134 and @entity11 also co-starred in several @entity137 musicals , including 1940 's " @entity138 " and " @entity139 " a year later
many marriages , money troubles but @entity11 's private life was n't always as wonderful as his on - screen persona would indicate
he was married eight times , three times in the 1940s alone
his first marriage , to @entity150 , began in 1942 and ended in 1943
in 1944 , he married an @entity152 beauty queen , @entity151 ; that one ended in 1948
his third marriage , to @entity154 , lasted less than three years
throughout , @entity11 was known as a spendthrift and a challenging partner
he loved horseracing and routinely spent his earnings at the track , even when there were n't many earnings to speak of , as there was during a fallow period in the 1950s
as an adult of a certain size , @entity11 found it much harder to find roles into which he could channel his prodigious talents
but he would n't stay unemployed for long
there was a tv series , " the @entity175 , " for a season in 1954 - 55
more important , there was a supporting actor @entity179 nomination for 1956 's " @entity180
" @entity11 , however , was n't very discriminating about his roles
other films during the late ' 50s and early ' 60s included forgettable flicks such as " @entity184 " ( 1957 ) , " @entity185 " ( 1960 ) and " @entity186 " ( 1960 )
he appeared in the classic " breakfast at @entity193 " ( 1961 ) but in the unfortunate , broadly acted role of @entity191 's @entity190 neighbor , mr. @entity189
he was one of the cast of a thousand comedians in " it 's a @entity197 , @entity197 , @entity197 , @entity198 " ( 1963 )
@entity11 also made tv guest appearances on such shows as " the investigators , " " @entity202 " and " @entity203
" on the latter , he played a jockey
' he is a showman ' after another 15 years of minor movie parts and tv roles , @entity11 's up - and - down career once again hit the heights
he earned an @entity179 nomination for his performance as a horse trainer in 1979 's " @entity214 " and dazzled @entity8 in the song - and - dance revue " @entity216 " -- a role , given his start , he was born to play
the show earned him a @entity221 nomination and ran for almost three years
over the years , @entity11 earned four @entity179 nominations
in addition , he received a special @entity179 in 1939 and an honorary one in 1983
@entity11 also triumphed on television in the 1981 tv movie " @entity227 , " about a mentally disabled man trying to live on his own
that performance garnered him an emmy
video : interview with @entity11 in march he also found a lasting marriage when he wed @entity46 in 1978
however , @entity11 once again faced financial struggles as he entered his later decades
they came to national attention when he asked a @entity10 court to appoint a conservator to protect him from his stepson and stepdaughter
@entity11 blamed his financial troubles on a stepson whom he successfully sued
he also took his case to @entity247 , delivering emotional testimony to a @entity249 in march 2011 in which he said family members took control of his life , making him " scared , disappointed , yes , and angry
" @entity11 made his audience laugh and cry when he implored senators to stop what experts call chronic emotional , physical , sexual and financial abuse of elderly @entity120 by family members and other caregivers
@entity11 called on @entity247 to make elder abuse a specific crime
" i 'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse
i mean to stop it
not tomorrow , not next month but now , " he shouted from the witness table
@entity11 : a spokesman against elder abuse @entity273 judge @entity272 appointed attorney @entity274 as @entity11 's permanent conservator that month
@entity274 immediately began seeking entertainment gigs for the aging performer , telling @entity39 that he had to revive his show business career quickly or would die " in very short order
" @entity274 summed up @entity11 's drive in a few sentences
" mr. @entity0 's parents put him on the vaudeville stage when he was 17 months old , " he said in 2011
" if mr. @entity0 were to not work , i think we would be attending mr. @entity0 's funeral in very short order
" it 's part of his fiber , " @entity274 continued
" his last months included reunions with old friends , the family statement said
" even someone of @entity0 's iconic statue was quite star struck and was extremely thrilled to attend @entity298 's oscar party recently , " the family said
" just last week @entity0 was ecstatic when they surprised him by reuniting him with one of his great loves , the race track
there they spent time with @entity305 and @entity306
he had exceptional care and a new lease on life
" people we lost in 2014
