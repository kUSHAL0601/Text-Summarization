@entity0 -- @entity3 's lawyer argued a time - stamped photograph and a restaurant receipt show the actor was not in @entity0 when a massage therapist claims he sexually assaulted him at the @entity8
" we found out the dates of the claim , we knew the story was false , " @entity3 lawyer @entity9 told @entity1 wednesday
the federal lawsuit , which includes claims by two men that @entity3 groped them while on their massage tables , seeks $ 2 million in damage for each plaintiff
the lawyer who filed the suit said " droves " of potential plaintiffs have been calling him with similar stories , but he must check their evidence before adding them to the case
" these are people from different resorts from every state from @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 where they were there when he was banned or they were assaulted or they claim to be escorts that were hired by @entity3 , " attorney @entity30 told @entity1 wednesday
@entity30 is a young @entity43 lawyer who said much of his practice is focused on going after sexual predators
he said he is not intimidated by the prospect of going against @entity9 , a veteran lawyer known for aggressive tactics in his representation of " a-list " @entity50 clients
" they ai n't got nothing on me , " said @entity30
" i 'm the real deal
he stepped into the ring with a gorilla
if you read the reports , if you look at my records , i do not give up on anything
" but @entity9 came out swinging hard against @entity30 on wednesday , first questioning the suit 's detailed description of the first incident in which @entity3 allegedly groped a male massage therapist repeatedly and finally masturbated during the two - hour session in a bungalow at the @entity8 on january 16
it claimed @entity3 picked up the plaintiff -- identified as @entity70 no. 1 -- in a black @entity71 and took him to a hotel bungalow where an @entity74 chef was cooking hamburgers
" my client does n't have a black chef , does n't own an suv or a @entity71 , " @entity9 said
" he drives a sedan
" and he was in @entity37 that day to be fitted for his wardrobe for his film " @entity82 , " @entity9 said
he arrived in the city on january 15 , a day before the alleged assault in @entity0 , and remained there at least through the next day , he said
a photograph of @entity3 , which @entity9 said was taken at the @entity37 fitting , bears a digital timestamp of january 16 at 4:30 p.m. , although the time zone was not specified
@entity9 also provided a receipt for a $ 382 meal at @entity91 , a @entity93 restaurant , apparently printed at 11:38 p.m. the same day of the alleged @entity0 assault
the merchant copy of the receipt does not include a signature
" my client was sexually assaulted at 10 a.m. , " @entity30 said wednesday
" i can get there on horseback to mr. @entity91 's in @entity37 in 12 hours
that 's not that remarkable
" he noted that @entity3 is a licensed pilot with a private jet
@entity9 's claim that @entity3 was on another side of the country and not with @entity70 no. 1 will be easy to disprove , @entity30 said
" in this information age , it 's very hard not to leave a digital footprint and travel around and use cell phones and vehicles and computers , rent bungalows at the @entity8
" the second plaintiff , who claims a similar encounter with @entity3 occurred at an @entity113 hotel where he was a staff massage therapist on january 25 , was added to the lawsuit tuesday
@entity30 said the case should be easy to prove because of documentation that was done soon after the incident
" he tells his boss , the employees all talk about it
there 's e-mails going back and forth about the incident
" " this second ' anonymous ' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one , " @entity9 said tuesday
it was " obvious " that @entity30 " checked media reports that my client was in @entity113 working on a movie " before filing the second claim about an @entity113 incident , he said
" however , the claim by @entity133 is just as fabricated as the claim by @entity135 , " @entity9 said
" our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims
" unless @entity3 accepts an out - of - court settlement , the actor can expect to testify in public and on camera about the allegations , @entity30 said
" he 's going to have a videotaped deposition with me asking him questions and if he goes to trial he is going be on the witness stand answering my questions , " @entity30 said
" that is far more intensive and productive as far as evidence than any police report will ever be
" the plaintiffs are identified in court filings only as @entity70 no. 1 from @entity36 and @entity70 no. 2 of @entity113 , a move their lawyer says is allowed by federal law to protect victims
@entity3 's lawyers know their names , @entity30 said
@entity9 said that @entity30 filed his clients anonymously to keep other people from recognizing them and coming forward with evidence against them
@entity3 , 58 , has been married to actress @entity166 for 20 years
the oldest of their three children , @entity170 , was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the @entity173 in january 2009
the lawsuit alleges that @entity3 called the first plaintiff , who advertises online with " professionally themed ads , " to arrange for a massage at $ 200 an hour
@entity3 picked him up at a @entity179 address and drove him to the hotel , according to the lawsuit
when they entered the bungalow , @entity3 " shamelessly stripped naked " in front of a professional chef and the plaintiff , the lawsuit states
" he wants me to get on the table , can you believe that ? " @entity3 told the chef , according to the document
" for the first hour the massage was without incident , other than he kept purposefully sliding the towel down that covered his buttocks to reveal about half of gluteus area , " the suit states
the massage therapist repeatedly slid the towel back up 10 times in the first hour , " reminding defendant that state law required that a massage client be fully draped during the massage , " the suit states
when @entity3 " started to rub @entity211 's leg , " he " thought it was accidental , " it said
later , however , there was more touching by @entity3 " and this time @entity211 told @entity204 to please not touch him again , " the complaint said
" defendant apologized , but then snickered to himself like a mischievous child , " it said
the lawsuit then described @entity3 allegedly touching and grabbing the massage therapist 's penis
" this was painful and uncomfortable , " the suit said
@entity3 apologized and suggested they " must have gotten our signals crossed , " and that he thought that the massage therapist " wanted the same thing he did , " it said
" defendant then tried to act like it was a simple misunderstanding
" @entity3 then asked him to switch places on the table for a " reverse massage , " the lawsuit states
@entity3 allegedly offered to perform a sexual act on the therapist
although the therapist " felt very afraid for his safety , " he agreed to stay and continue with the massage after @entity3 told him " ok , i 'll behave myself , " the suit said
@entity3 's statement " gave plaintiff confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control , " the suit said
when he resumed with a deep tissue massage on his shoulders , @entity3 told him , " say something nice to me , " it said
@entity3 , who allegedly began masturbating , then got up and screamed at the plaintiff " how selfish he was ; that @entity204 got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his ' @entity258 ' days , " the suit said
@entity50 is controlled by homosexual men " who expect favors in return for sexual activity , " the lawsuit document quotes @entity3 as saying
" defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up , " it said
the complaint said @entity3 told the therapist that " he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it , and when he began to make millions of dollars , that it all became well worth it
" when the therapist refused to take part , @entity3 said , " no problem
i will find new friends , " the suit said
he then offered to call a " @entity50 starlet " who wanted " three - way sex , " but " they needed to have sex together first before calling her , so this way they would be in - sync with each other sexually , " the suit said
the actor told him he could " make millions and be famous " if he lost some weight and adapted to same - sex relations , the suit said
when the therapist threatened to call police if he was not returned to where he was picked up , @entity3 drove him back , although calling him " selfish " and a " loser " on the way , it said
he paid the therapist $ 800 , double the $ 400 owed for the two hours , the suit said
@entity1 's @entity304 and @entity305 contributed to this report .
