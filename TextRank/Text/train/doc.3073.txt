-- @entity1 used to regularly show up late to yoga class on purpose
" that way i could be in the very back of the class where no one would watch me , " @entity1 said
" at 206 pounds , being only 5 - 10 , i felt like i really looked stupid
" last year , when the @entity8 photographer and part - time college student went in for his regular checkup , he got troubling news
the doctor told him he was in the beginning stage of hypertension and wanted to put @entity1 on blood pressure medication
@entity1 was only 32 years old
" i did n't want to end up sick , " he said
" my mom died at the age of 42 after struggling with obesity and high blood pressure
i knew she would n't want me to go down this path
" as a gay man , @entity1 said being overweight also made it hard to meet people
studies show gay men struggle more with body image than straight men and are more likely to end up with eating disorders to meet an ideal standard that is hard for many to achieve
" if you are overweight in our community , you become invisible , and i just hate that about us , " @entity1 said
" out at a bar or party guys would talk to me sometimes , but when i lost the weight the conversation took on a really different tone
... it 's not right to exclude people because they are overweight , but that 's the reality
" his doctor did put him on a high blood pressure drug , but @entity1 said he did n't like the way it made him feel
instead , he decided to make a radical change to the way he lived
he started by downloading an app called @entity51 ! , an interactive calorie counter program
" it 's awesome -- you can scan any bar code you have on food in the house , and it helps you keep track of what you are eating , " @entity1 said
tracking calories and fat became a game
he tried to see how much sugar he could eliminate from his diet
advice from a professor to diversify the food he ate made him put more color on his plate
" my family was very @entity72 , and we were more into potatoes and bread and meat , " @entity1 said
" now i try to avoid all that white
" he eliminated fast food
he cooked more at home
desserts were gone ; green vegetables were in
breakfast was yogurt or rice pudding , because he found the carbohydrates helped with energy
lunch was soup that was heavy on vegetables or a sandwich with lean meat
dinner was a chicken breast and rice that he cooked himself
keeping a strict diet helped him quickly see a difference
he lost about two pounds a week
when he was down 20 pounds , he decided it was time to start running
he started small and gradually built up his run over time , going from one mile to seven
" it really was not fun at first , " @entity1 said
" it was hilarious how hard it was running just a mile
i felt like it was 10
but gradually it got easier
" he also joined an exercise boot camp offered on campus
he kept up with yoga and then added regular exercise to his everyday activities
he could n't afford to join a gym , but that was ok -- " if i 'm watching tv , i push the table aside and pull out my exercise ball or lift weights , " @entity1 said
he knows many people complain that they do n't have time to exercise
he does get busy working and going to school , but he said that is no excuse
" i can do 3Â½ miles in 25 minutes now running , " @entity1 said
" anyone could find 25 minutes in their day to exercise
" he also enlisted his friends to hold him accountable
together they downloaded a @entity126 app that lets you monitor how much friends work out
that kind of friendly competition keeps him motivated , he said
plus , friends will call him with words of encouragement if he ever slacks off
he and his friends got so into exercise they created a group called @entity136
together they have tackled local @entity137 's to raise money for a variety of charities , including autism
one day they hope to do a long @entity144 fundraising bike ride that stretches over hundreds of miles
a photographer , @entity1 also started taking photos of himself so he could watch his progress
" those photos certainly keep me honest and motivated , " he said
now at 165 pounds and still losing , @entity1 walks around shirtless so much he says his friends teasingly ask when he 'll put his shirt back on
and yes , he gets hit on when he goes out
" i 've got so much more confidence and energy , and the best part is i 'm so much more comfortable with myself , " @entity1 said
" i 'm 33 years old and now i feel like i could live for at least 30 more
i did n't really feel like that before
" " what i 've learned from all of this is you 've got to figure out what will make you go out and do it , " @entity1 said
" trust me , i did n't want to run when it was freezing in december
but having friends invested in your success and , maybe even more important , doing it for yourself ... it all really does help
