@entity0 -- if ever there was a costume that erased gender , it 's got to be an astronaut 's suit
big , bulky , with a uniform shape and reflective mask , it 's pretty hard to tell whether the person inside is male , female , or @entity14 the chimpanzee
so when @entity19 plays an astronaut hurtling through space in new blockbuster " gravity , " one of the only clues she 's even a woman is the sound of her hysterical gasping : " i ca n't breathe ! i ca n't breathe ! " for 49 - year - old @entity19 , playing the lead role of dr @entity29 in the thriller which premieres in @entity31 this week , this is not a female action film -- it 's a " human action film
" and if it were up to her , the rest of @entity35 would stop making a distinction between the two
" there is a female and male in it
the point of view is everyone 's point of view , it just so happens that i have a female body and i fortunately got to do the part , " she told @entity1 in an interview at the @entity44 screening
" we were very conscious to not make it about the sex -- we made it about the situation and the adversities , rather than ' this is a woman in adversity ' or a ' man in adversity
' anyone can put themselves in my character 's situation and feel exactly the same
" @entity66 's sweetheart ? indeed , the infinite blackness of space , and indistinct white uniforms worn by @entity19 and co-star @entity70 , create a unique environment not just free from gravity -- but traditional gender cues
it 's quite literally a world away from some of @entity19 's best known roles -- the love interest of terrorist - busting cop @entity82 in 1994 thriller " @entity85 , " the tom boy @entity75 agent turned bombshell in 2000 chick flick " @entity88 , " or the executive trying to marry her assistant in 2009 rom - com " @entity92
" her 2010 hit " @entity94 " -- in which she plays a southern mom who adopts a black teenager -- earned her an @entity97 for best actress , also becoming the first film with a sole female lead to take over $ 200 million at the @entity66 box office
yet the day before she scored the highest accolade in cinema , @entity19 was picking up the @entity104 for worst actress in 2010 comedy " @entity107
" she is one of the few actors to accept the prize in person , revealing a charming ability to not take herself too seriously in a notoriously cutthroat industry
" they said that nobody went to see this film , but there 's over 700 members here and that means the majority of the 700 voted , " she joked at the time
@entity121 's the word while @entity124 this year named @entity19 the most marketable celebrity in the world , with annual earnings of $ 14 million , it seems her biggest priority right now is not career -- but family
when it was time for the 2010 @entity97 after - party , the best actress - winner instead opted to go home to her newly adopted son @entity135 -- whom she named after @entity137 jazz trumpeter @entity136 , also from her child 's hometown
it is perhaps a sign of @entity19 's strength of character that she continued with the adoption process after splitting with husband and tv mechanic @entity145 , after his infidelities were exposed in the press
today , mother and son have eschewed the bright lights of @entity152 for a home in @entity154 , @entity155 , with @entity19 admitting : " i feel happier , better and younger now than i did 10 years ago
" singing her praises @entity19 grew up in a house of music , her @entity160 mother @entity159 and @entity66 father @entity161 , both opera enthusiasts who taught singing
she and younger sister @entity164 lived in @entity165 , in a home constantly visited by their parents ' artist friends
when @entity19 announced that she wanted to pursue an acting career , her family was supportive , though realistic about the hard slog ahead
moving to @entity172 and supporting herself with various hospitality jobs , @entity19 was the ripe old age of 30 -- practically over-the - hill for a woman starting out in @entity35 -- when she starred in breakthrough film " @entity85
" @entity179 and while she 's since starred in numerous box office hits , you get the feeling " gravity " is a film that pushes her beyond the chick - flick persona she 's arguably better known for
" it took away anything i knew as an actor , " she said , referring to @entity188 director @entity187 's decision to shoot the actors in 12 - wire harnesses , to recreate zero - gravity
the harnesses were either operated by puppeteers , or attached to rotating rigs
all of which took place inside a cube covered in thousands of led lights to simulate the alternating glow of the sun. visual effects artists added the spacesuits later
" it left me closed in a box for 10 hours a day , with no one to talk to , and no life form around me , " said @entity19
it was the first of its kind , it was a prototype , they invented it
they did n't know if it would work until the day we got into it
" as alienating and frustrating as it was , being as cumbersome as it was , you knew you were a part of something that no one else had done before
you just sucked it up , and as crabby as i was most days , it worked
i did n't want to be very comfortable , my character was n't comfortable in space
" judging by " gravity 's " phenomenal box office sales -- so far taking over $ 400 million worldwide -- the rest of us are also lining up to see @entity66 's sweetheart outside her comfort zone .
