-- in movies like 1974 's " @entity3 , " where @entity4 played a walking statue of stoic wrath , vigilante justice is mean , nasty and also good , clean fun
but then there 's the kind of movie , like @entity12 's " @entity11 , " that salutes lone - wolf vengeance while also making you feel the spiritual toll it takes — a breed of thriller that 's exciting , cathartic and powerfully disturbing
" prisoners " is that kind of movie
it 's rooted in 40 years of @entity23 revenge films , yet it also breaks audacious new ground
the film stars @entity27 as @entity28 , a brawny survivalist who is also a gentle - voiced suburban dad
on a rainy @entity29 afternoon , @entity28 brings his wife ( @entity31 ) and kids over to the home of neighborhood friends ( @entity35 and @entity36 )
the two families eat , drink and joke around , and nothing too remarkable happens — until everyone realizes that @entity28 's little daughter , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , has left the house and disappeared , along with the other family 's daughter , @entity45 ( @entity43 )
@entity0 : fall movies we ca n't wait to see a search turns up nothing , but later that night , the police find a pale , mostly mute young creep ( @entity52 ) in smudged aviator frames and oily long hair hanging around in his skeevy rv camper — the same vehicle that the girls were trying to crawl up the ladder of that afternoon
the cops arrest this damaged - looking sad sack , interrogate him , and find no evidence
so they let him go
but @entity28 , after an encounter with the suspect outside the police station , is convinced that he 's guilty
he kidnaps the creep , brings him to an abandoned apartment building , and beats him to a bloody pulp , over and over again
he threatens to kill the young man unless he confesses
but the suspect / victim says nothing
if he is , in fact , innocent , then what @entity28 is doing is an unholy atrocity
but what if he 's guilty ? @entity28 's one - man torture - squad tactics justified then ? and what if many people ( along with the law ) would declare that no , those tactics are still not justified ? what should @entity28 do , given that every bone in his body is telling him that this is the only way he 'll ever see his daughter again ? what if every bone in his body is right ? " prisoners , " directed by @entity91 ( " @entity92 " ) from a script by @entity94 , is no shallow payback thriller
it 's a dazzingly potent , ambitious and complex movie , a film that forces you to ask questions that have no easy answers
what i 've described is merely the film 's first act
there are a great many twists and turns — both suspenseful and thematic — to come
yet at the heart of " prisoners " is something primitive and elemental and gripping , an obsession with torture , morality and the impotence of the justice system that speaks to our time as intensely ( and maybe controversially ) as the pitch - dark vigilante thrillers of the ' 70s once spoke to theirs
@entity0 's @entity118 talks porn sets with @entity27 @entity27 , in a staggering performance that 's unlike anything he has done before , acts with an unbridled rage , and he invests every snarl and rasp of that anger with meaning
@entity28 knows that in missing - child cases , each day the victim does n't turn up radically increases the chances that she never will , and so his fury , even at its craziest , comes off as a desperate display of committed action
haunted by what might be happening to his daughter , he has — at least in his own mind — transcended the law , yet that leaves him with nothing to believe in but himself , and @entity27 takes us on every step of that brave , terrible journey
each of the film 's major performances is powerful
as the cop heading up the investigation , @entity146 has a moody danger that all but redefines him as an actor ( for the first time , he does n't seem like too nice a guy ) , and @entity155 , as the suspect 's mother , unnerves you with the sinister banality of her homepsun middle @entity159 quirkiness
she 's the nightmare mom next door
in its treatment of torture as a means to an end , " prisoners " is very much a post- " @entity167 " movie , even if the sin at its heart is child abduction rather than terrorism
@entity28 's remorseless treatment of his suspect echoes @entity159 's treatment of its captives at @entity177 and other hidden locales after 9/11
only this time it 's personal : a desperate father out to save his daughter
" prisoners " takes the mythic simplicity of the vigilante film and adds arresting layers of ambiguity
watching the movie , we behold @entity28 's actions and feel that they may be horribly unjustified — a daring place for a film to put its hero — and we also behold his actions and feel that they may be what true morality demands
t 's a sign of the film 's power that either scenario could turn out to be true , and that each one is just as scary
