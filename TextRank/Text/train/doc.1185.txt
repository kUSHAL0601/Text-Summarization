-- @entity1 realistically ca n't win the title but the former world champion hopes to challenge powerhouse @entity4 at the @entity6 after posting the fastest practice times friday
@entity1 's time of one minute , 38.673 seconds in the second session in @entity10 was about one - tenth of a second quicker than @entity4 , the triple reigning world champion who has captured the last two races in @entity13
" it 's the first time i can remember that second practice has really gone well for me , " @entity14 ' @entity1 was quoted as saying by @entity16 's website
" we have n't changed anything but the day just went smoothly and all the processes with the team worked well
" @entity4 admitted there was " some room for improvement " in his @entity27
" it will be close with @entity14 , " he told @entity16 's website
" of course we 're not sure what others were doing with their fuel loads today , but it seems close ahead of tomorrow 's qualifying
" i like the track here , it 's a shame it 's so far from @entity36 , which is a great city , but it 's good coming here as it 's quieter than some other races , which means we can focus on our job
" the only driver with half - a - chance of catching @entity4 , @entity44 , was a distant seventh in the second session
he trails @entity4 by 60 points with a mere six races remaining and admitted this week he needed a comeback similar to @entity50 's in the @entity52 sailing to overtake the @entity53
but @entity44 did n't sound optimistic friday
" there is every probability that , again here , we can expect to struggle in the race , " @entity54 's @entity44 told @entity16 's website
" it wo n't be easy for us in performance terms , but we know that apart from that , we can do well on sunday
now , we must try and get the most out of what we have available and put everything together tomorrow and in the race
" @entity66 , @entity44 's teammate next season , crashed in the first practice session but was unhurt
@entity69 quoted the @entity70 as saying he would take action at the end of the season to fix a lingering back problem
" it is not really surgery , but for sure we are probably going to do something , " said @entity66
" i know what the issues are
