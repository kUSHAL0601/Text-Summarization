public transportation in any city almost always attracts an assortment of characters , but a hairy bus rider that roams the aisle on all fours and licks the seats might be a little much for even the most open - minded commuters
but public transit riders in @entity12 do n't just tolerate @entity13 , a black @entity15 - bull mastiff mix -- they 've grown to love her
" all the bus drivers know her , " passenger @entity17 told @entity1 affiliate @entity18
" she makes everybody happy
how could you not love this thing ? " @entity13 started riding the bus to the dog park a couple of years ago with her owner , @entity26
her first solo ride happened after @entity26 paused to smoke a cigarette and could n't finish in time to board the bus
@entity13 , knowing exactly what to do , hopped on the bus alone
@entity26 caught the next one and the two reunited four stops later at the dog park
for @entity26 , @entity13 's independence is n't really that surprising
" she 's been here the last two years , so she 's been urbanized , totally , " @entity26 said
when local radio host @entity40 saw @entity13 looking for a window seat so she could " get off at the dog park , " he could n't believe it
" i just look out the window and i 'm like , ' did that just happen ? ' " @entity40 told @entity18
indeed it did , @entity26 said of his friendly companion
" she 's a bus - riding , sidewalk - walking dog , " @entity26 said .
