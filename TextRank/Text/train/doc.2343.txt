a few years ago @entity0 boarded a public bus in the northern @entity3 town of @entity4
he went toward the nearest vacant seat but before he could sit down the man in the adjacent seat snapped , " go away ! do n't sit next to me
" " i wanted to answer back , but i controlled myself , " recalled @entity0 , now 53 years old
" i felt my blood pressure rise
" he stayed on the bus , standing
" there were lots of people on the bus , and they heard it all , but no one said a word
" @entity0 has long been accustomed to the unkindness of strangers
he suffers from a non-infectious genetic disease , neurofibromatosis type 1
it has left him completely covered from head to toe with growths , swellings and itchy sores
his mother suffered from the same illness before she died , and his sister has a milder version of it
his aunt , @entity33 , says his undershirt is often completely soaked in blood that seeps from the sores
in early november @entity0 traveled with his aunt and dozens of others from northern @entity3 to @entity38 , where they attended a morning public audience held by @entity40
@entity0 , who has difficulty staying on his feet for long , was in a wheelchair
" we did n't think we would be so close to the @entity40 , but the @entity48 kept ushering us forward until we were in a corner in the front row , " recalled @entity33 , a woman in her late sixties with a quick smile and an infectious laugh
" when he came close to us , " she said , " i thought he would give me his hand
instead he went straight to @entity0 and embraced him tightly
i thought he would n't give him back to me he held him so tightly
we said nothing but he looked at me as if he was digging deep inside , a beautiful look that i would never have expected
" @entity0 , accustomed to stares of shock and fear , was initially confused by the pontiff 's lack of hesitation
" he did n't have any fear of my illness , " he said
" he embraced me without speaking ... i quivered
i felt a great warmth
" in moments of drama , odd details often remain vivid
" i looked down at his shoes , " @entity0 's aunt recalled
" they were like this , " she said , holding her hands apart and laughing
" i thought yes , this is someone who really walks
" the entire encounter lasted little over a minute , and soon @entity0 and his aunt were back on the bus , @entity0 in a state of combined shock and joy
" he was almost not himself , " @entity33 said
" " i felt i was returning home ten years younger , as if a load had been lifted , " @entity0 said
but life returned to normal soon enough
he went back to his job at a home for the elderly , collecting and throwing out the trash , running odd jobs
he works there on weekdays and in slower moments enjoys chatting with the residents who do n't seem to notice his condition
his preferred topic of conversation is the ups and downs of @entity100 , his favorite football team
when i ventured to discuss football with him , suggesting he should consider the merits of other teams , like @entity105 or @entity106 , he was dismissive , shaking his head and wagging his fingers in contempt
@entity110 , the director of the home , said @entity0 's energy and humor help keep the residents ' spirits up
he said , " everyday he meets a lot of people here who like him , who chat and joke with him
" when @entity0 finishes work , he rides his bicycle back to the flat he shares with his sister @entity123
@entity124 says he can be lazy when it comes to preparing meals , and often prefers to make a sandwich to avoid having to wash the dishes
@entity131 @entity105 producers @entity129 and @entity132 had been trying for weeks to speak with @entity0 , ever since the photos of his embrace with @entity40 were first made public
initially his family was hesitant , but the encounter with @entity40 emboldened him
a change came over him , he said
" i feel stronger and happier
i feel i can move ahead because the @entity138 is protecting me
" " now that people have seen him they will be less detached , " said his aunt , who also hopes the @entity40 's embrace and the media furor it whipped up will raise awareness about neurofibromatosis
she is worried that cuts in cash - strapped @entity3 's health and social services could impact her nephew
@entity0 savors his moment with @entity40 , but says he still has unfinished business
" i hope he calls me so we can have a face - to - face meeting him and i. i have many things to tell him , " @entity0 said
one of the hallmarks of @entity40 ' papacy has been to call people , out of the blue
" what do you want to tell him ? " i asked
" that 's a bit private , " he said , shaking his head apologetically
" it 's between him and @entity3 " read more : @entity40 's embrace of man touches world read more : popular pope , but same old @entity175 ?
