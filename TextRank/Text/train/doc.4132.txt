@entity1 , @entity0 -- in @entity5 in august , @entity4 runner @entity3 will once again find himself staring down the 10,000 meters of rubberized track that curls between him and a third gold medal in the @entity10 event
@entity3 goes on a training run with companions at home in @entity14
he won gold in 1996 and 2000 , but finished a disappointing fifth in 2004 when a problem with his @entity19 tendon hampered training in the lead up to @entity22
this time it 's different
he 's pounding a well - worn path on often twice - daily runs through the streets of his hometown of @entity14
he 's older and injury - free
in 2004 , he was under pressure to become the first man in history to win gold over 10,000 meters in three consecutive @entity10
now it 's not even his first choice of race to run
" i 'm not interested in the 10,000 meters , " he says ; a somewhat surprising statement from a man just weeks away from competing in the world 's greatest ever sporting event , the pinnacle of any athlete 's career
the problem is he 's been there , done that and recognizes that he 's unlikely to match his younger opponents in speed over the distance
in @entity5 , he 'll be toeing the starting line with the current world champion @entity49 and @entity50 , both @entity4 who finished first and second in @entity22 in 2004
" they 're in good shape
they 're already superior athletes , " @entity3 says
" for me to be there , it 's not for @entity49 or @entity50 , just to be in the group , to stay together , to share their experience
most of them they know how to compete , they know how to win
" in march , @entity3 made the highly - publicized decision not to contest the @entity10 marathon in @entity5
he insists it 's not a slight against @entity66 and the @entity10 organizers but , as an asthmatic , he says the risks to his health are too great
running the 10,000 meters was a compromise , says @entity72 of @entity73 , @entity3 's manager
@entity3 did n't want to disappoint his fans and fellow countrymen who had been expecting him to race
" of course he 's running for himself also , " @entity72 says , " but for him , it 's a team effort to run for his country
he 'll be very happy if the other two guys are doing well
i think @entity3 would be very happy with a bronze medal
" would he ? " yeah , absolutely , " @entity3 insists
" the 10,000 meters is not my event any more
if i won bronze , fine
even if i do n't compete , i do n't mind
" while the @entity87 might merit a small note on @entity3 's calendar , there is a big red circle marked around september 28th , the date of the @entity92 , just five weeks later
" one of my targets this year is the @entity92 , to run a good time and if possible surpass the world record , " he says
it 's a record he set in spectacular style last november , covering the 42 kilometers in just two hours , four minutes and 26 seconds
it was his 25th world record
he attempted to better the time at the @entity101 in january , but missed out by a mere 27 seconds , a failure @entity3 blames on over-enthusiasm at the start ; he just ran too fast
" i paid the price at the end because i could not push anymore , especially the last seven or eight kilometers , " he says
in @entity107 , he 's hoping to strike the right balance of restraint and speed to take him over the line first and fastest
it wo n't be an easy feat. training for the 10,000 meters is all about speed
after the @entity10 he 'll literally have to switch gears to work on his strength and stamina
" it 's not a normal preparation for a marathon , " @entity3 's manager , @entity72 says
" normally you have a few months of preparation
it 's kind of new territory he will be in
" " i think it will be ok because @entity3 's 35 and his body is a running machine , " @entity72 says
" he 's done so much endurance , but you do n't know how the body will react
for him and for us it 's something to see because it 's never been done before at this level
" @entity3 is not fazed
he 's simply merged training for the two disciplines into one unconventional schedule
" i 'm trying to work on endurance and a bit of speed
if i move completely to speed work i lose the benefits of the endurance training
i 'm trying to handle both , " he says
it seems a lot of work for someone who 's conceded that his days as the fastest man over 10,000 meters are over
he 's already passed the baton to @entity49 , who bettered his world record over the distance in 2004 , and again in 2005 , at a blistering 26:17.53
@entity3 may not be putting money on himself to win in @entity5 , but he 's in no doubt that one of his @entity4 team mates will be first across the line
" for sure , " he says , " no question about it
