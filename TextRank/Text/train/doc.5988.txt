reports wednesday that three men have been arrested over plans to travel from @entity3 to join @entity4 -- and that one of them allegedly posted online about his desire to shoot the @entity7 -- is simply the latest reminder that terrorist groups and their sympathizers are exploiting the freedom of cyberspace
earlier this month , @entity4 posted a video of its horrific burning of a captured @entity16 pilot
unfortunately , this was not the first time @entity4 has used @entity17 , an @entity18 social media company , to broadcast its barbaric acts to the world
in august , when @entity4 released the gruesome beheading of @entity18 journalist @entity23 , it also used social media
in fact , @entity4 has been using @entity17 for years
nor is @entity4 the only terrorist group on @entity17
@entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity30 branch in @entity31 , @entity32 , are all on @entity17
on january 14 , the @entity30 branch in @entity34 , known as @entity35 or simply @entity35 , claimed responsibility via @entity17 for the terrorist attacks in @entity38 that killed 17 people
the group has two official accounts on @entity17
there are many more examples from such groups , all of which have officially been listed as foreign designated terrorist organizations by the @entity18 government
it 's with this reality in mind that on january 27 , my subcommittee held a hearing on terrorists ' use of social media
at those hearings , experts detailed how terrorist use of social media platforms has long been a problem
if social media is being used to help radicalize thousands of people and raise millions of dollars from many more , the question all this raises is this : why is no one shutting them down ? because @entity18 companies are n't
and nor is the @entity18 government
i 've heard two arguments for why we should keep the status quo
the first -- and easiest to set aside -- is the claim that if the @entity18 government were to shut down terrorists ' social media accounts , these measures would be violating terrorists ' free speech rights
my own belief is that the @entity82 does not apply to terrorists
these thugs gave up their right to free speech the first time they killed innocent civilians
we should certainly not be helping them kill more
but this is n't just my thinking
the @entity92 has already held this to be the case in @entity95 , when it ruled that if someone has aided a terrorist organization , their free speech rights were not protected
indeed , free speech does not apply when it harms others , such as creating and distributing child pornography
the second argument is that terrorists ' use of social media provides the intelligence community with information that they would not otherwise be able to acquire
but while terrorists may slip up from time to time , they are also aware that by its very nature , social media is about sharing , which means what they say can easily become widely shared
nor is terrorist use of social media a new phenomenon
we have had years to weigh the kind of intelligence that we can gather about terrorist groups against the advantages in messaging and recruitment that terrorists gain from it
and from what i have heard , allowing this public , online jihad to continue has provided no significant intelligence breakthroughs
the fact that there are more terrorists using social media than ever before should say all we need to know about whether they are benefiting from it
to put it bluntly , private @entity18 companies should not be operating as the propaganda megaphone of foreign terrorist organizations
so what needs to change ? for a start , social media companies themselves need to do more
it is not good enough to only pay attention when bad press threatens a company 's public image after something truly horrific is posted online
instead , companies not only have a public responsibility but a legal obligation to do more
section 219 of the @entity153 states that it is unlawful to provide a designated foreign terrorist organization with " material support or resources , " including " any property , tangible or intangible , or services
" that 's about as comprehensive as you can get
what 's more , most social media companies already have terms of service with prohibition of threats of violence that would preclude terrorist use of their platforms
but companies need to do a better job of enforcing their own terms
the lack of child pornography or stolen copyrighted material on social media platforms -- content that is quickly removed if it appears at all -- demonstrates what these companies can do
with this in mind , they would do well to consider having dedicated teams that remove terrorist content , and also streamline reporting processes for offensive content so users can easily report terrorist use on their platforms
companies have the technology and the resources to crack down on terrorists ' use of their platform ; they just need the motivation to act
this is where the federal government can assist
in 2011 , the @entity203 promised a strategy to prevent online radicalization
but more than three years later -- and despite a summit last week aimed at tackling extremism -- we are still waiting on a that strategy
without one , the federal government 's efforts to combat terrorist use of social media will be as haphazard and lackluster as the efforts of private social media companies
instead , we need a strategy that clearly articulates our goals and roles , and the responsibilities of each federal agency that needs to be involved , as well as how we are going to work with civil society
it is mindboggling to think that those who behead and burn others alive are able to use our own companies against us to further their cause
but that is exactly what is occurring
@entity18 newspapers would have never allowed the @entity230 to place an ad for recruitment during @entity233 should not be allowed to use private @entity18 companies to reach billions of people with their violent propaganda in an instant , all for free .
