@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity4 's @entity3 vice president , disputes the government 's charges that he organized a death squad targeting government and military officials , saying the false claims are politically motivated and he has never and will never be involved in violence
" today it is @entity2 , tomorrow it will be someone else , " @entity2 told reporters tuesday in the northern @entity4 @entity14 city of @entity15 , where he discussed a warrant issued for his arrest by prime minister @entity20 's @entity19 - dominated government
@entity22 , the @entity3 - backed but cross-sectarian political bloc to which @entity2 belongs , has accused @entity20 of consolidating power , saying the @entity19 - backed political leader has refused to give up control of @entity4 's @entity28 ministries
" i have said there is a purpose behind this and there is political assassination and today there is a fabrication to embarrass this man after all he has done over the years and despite all the sacrifices made , " @entity2 said , referring to himself and his efforts to bring about political consensus in the diverse country during the @entity42 era
" after eight years i am rewarded with this
" the warrant issued for @entity2 's arrest is the latest in a series of events that have threatened to destroy @entity4 's fragile power - sharing agreement between @entity3 , @entity19 and @entity14 , raising fears about the stability of the country even as the last of @entity53 troops are withdrawn
the arrest warrant was issued just days after @entity22 suspended its participation in @entity56 amid claims it was being cut out of the political process
the charges appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men , identified as security guards for @entity2
@entity4 state - run tv aired video of the men 's confessions
@entity1 can not independently verify their identities
an official in @entity2 's office , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns , said the three men in the videotaped confessions were security guards for @entity2
the official said the men did not look distressed , though they believe they were under some sort of threat to make such confessions
among the confessions was one by a man who detailed roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009
the person speaking said orders at times came directly from @entity2 and at times through his son - in - law , @entity89 , who is also a senior member of his staff
the man said the improvised explosive devices were produced and kept at an abandoned house belonging to @entity2 in the @entity94 neighborhood
he also alleged that the vice president personally thanked him after a number of attacks , and that he was rewarded $ 3,000 after the first @entity99 attack against a senior @entity101 official
the man in the video said @entity2 ordered him to map out security locations and checkpoints for the @entity106 , which protects the @entity107
he said he was speaking out to " clear his conscience " and " expose this criminal
" @entity110 said he had been warned to adopt certain political stances or the confessions would be aired
he said foreign political agendas and other countries moved this case against him but did n't elaborate
@entity22 members and others have said @entity20 is backed by @entity118
addressing reporters in the country 's @entity14 region , @entity2 indicated that the claims and the accusations that he engaged in these activities are absurd
he said the case should be transferred to the semi-autonomous @entity14 territory because of its neutrality
he also called for @entity130 observers and attorneys from the @entity134 lawyers @entity132 to guarantee the fairness of any proceeding
that 's because at present , he said , the country 's " judiciary has been politicized and lost its independence years ago and is controlled by the executive authority
" " i have big question marks over these confessions they made , " @entity2 said
" they can be easily disproved and refuted
but despite that , justice must take its course and everyone must resort to it , but on the condition that the requirements for justice are available
" " i am ready , along with my security guards , to stand in front of any judge as long as the basic requirements for justice are available , " he said
@entity110 questioned the legal procedure in the case and said airing confessions violates @entity4 law
he said federal court , and not the criminal courts , should handle charges against an @entity4 vice president
he also raised the issue of political immunity
@entity56 members have immunity and can not be prosecuted in crimes unless their immunity is lifted by the country 's @entity173
@entity110 questioned why he does n't have the same immunity
" it is strange that an investigation into various , complicated and old crimes committed over the years is concluded within 48 hours , " said the vice president
" this proves that the confessions were ready before the arrest of some of my security guards who are suspects ; they have worked with me over the past years with the utmost professionalism and no violation or acts punishable by the law were recorded against any of them
" when asked who is responsible , he said he directs " the blame ... to mr. @entity20
" since october , @entity4 security forces have rounded up hundreds of people accused of being members of @entity194 's outlawed @entity193 or terrorists
@entity22 says the majority of those people are members of its political bloc and that the prime minister is simply taking out his opponents
the political turmoil in @entity4 is raising concerns in @entity204 , with officials saying they are closely monitoring the reports about the arrest warrant
" we are talking to all of the parties
we 've expressed our concern regarding these developments
we 're urging all political sides in @entity4 to work out their differences peaceably , politically , through dialogue , and certainly in a manner that is consistent with democratic political processes and international standards of rule of law , " said @entity212 , a spokeswoman for the @entity213
ambassador @entity221 has been in contact with all of the parties in recent hours , she said monday
@entity110 left @entity0 monday for the @entity14 region for emergency talks with @entity19 vice president @entity226 and @entity4 president @entity227
the @entity228 said @entity2 has been banned from leaving the country
the vice president questioned statements from @entity53 president @entity232 , who recently said that @entity53 troops were leaving an @entity4 he described as democratic
he did n't understand if @entity232 is being misled or ignoring " the reality on the ground
" " i am a vice president addressing him today and my home is surrounded by tanks
what democracy are you talking about , mr. @entity232 ? " @entity1 's @entity242 contributed to this report .
