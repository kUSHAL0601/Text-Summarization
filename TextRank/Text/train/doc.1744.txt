-- international leaders expressed their condolences sunday after the death of former @entity5 president @entity4 , one of the leading anti-communist dissidents of the 1970s and 1980s
@entity8 president @entity7 : " he was a true @entity10 and has been a champion of democracy and liberty throughout his life
i recall with great emotion the contacts we have had while he held the office , first as president of @entity21 and then of the @entity5 and also as a @entity10 personality and man of culture
@entity4 's name will remain forever attached to the reunification of @entity27 and the expansion of its values to @entity30 and @entity27

he will be remembered as a leader who helped create a modern democracy in the @entity5
his achievements are historic and will live after him
he will be sorely missed
" @entity45 president @entity44 : " a man of culture and a writer of great talent , @entity4 was the incarnation of tireless commitment to democracy and freedom
his ascension to the presidency after the @entity51 in 1989 capped a life entirely dedicated to the fight against totalitarianism and for the defense of values that inspired his action -- tolerance , the promotion of human rights and the struggle against oppression
with the death of @entity4 , the @entity5 loses one of its great patriots , @entity45 loses a friend , @entity27 loses one of its sages
" @entity45 foreign minister @entity73 : " with him , we lose a great @entity10 conscience and @entity45 loses a friend
the @entity45 have not forgotten the meeting between the dissident and his companions with president @entity77 in @entity78 on december 9 , 1988
they have not forgotten the courage and the force of conviction of the herald of human rights
they remain very attached to the legacy of the poet - president , a man of letters who became a statesman , an author of the most beautiful pages in the history of democracy
" @entity100 president @entity99 : " i was deeply saddened to learn of the passing today of @entity4 , a playwright and prisoner of conscience who became president of @entity21 and of the @entity5
having encountered many setbacks , @entity4 lived with a spirit of hope , which he defined as ' the ability to work for something because it is good , not just because it stands a chance to succeed
' his peaceful resistance shook the foundations of an empire , exposed the emptiness of a repressive ideology , and proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon
" former @entity100 president @entity117 : " his strong voice for human liberty changed the course of his country and crossed continents
in the days of @entity121 rule over @entity21 , he was viewed as an enemy of the state for ridiculing the pretensions of an oppressive government
the most subversive act of the playwright from @entity78 was telling the truth about tyranny
and when that truth finally triumphed , the people elected this dignified , charming , humble , determined man to lead their country
unintimidated by threats , unchanged by political power , @entity4 suffered much in the cause of freedom and became one of its greatest heroes
