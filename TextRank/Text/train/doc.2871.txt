-- our dog @entity1 loves the holiday season
ham for @entity8 and pot roast for @entity10 's
with so much food moving around the house and visitors who generously -- and covertly -- feed her under the table , @entity1 has always been a happy dog during the season of giving
two reluctant reindeer : @entity1 , left , and @entity19
after we spent much of one holiday season at the animal emergency center trying to keep @entity1 alive , our holiday celebration turned into a hunt for household toxics
@entity1 was diagnosed with severe anemia , which could have been caused by any one of numerous toxic items found in the refrigerators , cupboards and medicine cabinets of most homes
now , @entity1 's kibble and treats practically need their own passport to reach her mouth ; human food is out of reach ; visitors are asked to put away any medications and shown where the " approved " treats are kept
it may sound extreme , but veterinary medical experts say this type of preventative behavior can keep pets safe
this is especially true during the holidays , when family chaos increases and your pet 's environment may change from day to day with the arrival of family and friends bearing gifts , holiday food items and exotic plants
" dogs and cats do not know what is bad for them , " said dr. @entity58 , associate professor and veterinary clinical toxicologist at the @entity60 in @entity61
" if there is medicine on the bathroom counter or food left on the table , that is irresistible to them
" and unless your houseguests are conscientious pet owners themselves , chances are they are n't aware that they may be creating a toxic environment for your pet
@entity58 says it is important to let guests know not to leave their medications in an open suitcase or otherwise exposed
over-the - counter and prescription medications can kill small animals
because metabolic systems vary between species , a drug that may alleviate pain in humans can easily induce a toxic reaction in a dog or cat
for example , ibuprofen ingested by a dog can cause gastrointestinal damage and kidney dysfunction
cats are especially susceptible to even small amounts of acetaminophen ( the active ingredient in @entity103 ) ; ingestion of just one tablet can result in anemia and potential liver damage
dr. @entity108 , a veterinarian at the @entity109 in @entity110 , says that many of the emergency calls he receives involve pets that have accidentally ingested prescription medications or been given an over-the - counter medication by well - meaning owners who believe that their animal is in pain
@entity108 says these calls increase significantly over the holidays
" dogs will eat almost anything , " @entity108 said , " and there is no such thing as a dog - proof cap
" take care in the kitchen , too
typical holiday staples such as grapes and raisins have been shown to cause renal failure when ingested by dogs
although small amounts of onions and garlic are often used in pet foods and treats to add flavor , ingestion of large amounts can cause severe red blood cell damage ; cats are especially sensitive
macadamia nuts can cause a short - term hind - limb paralysis , and bread dough , if eaten before baking , can expand rapidly once ingested and cause ethanol poisoning
sweets , gum and hard candies are often problematic depending on ingredients
chocolate contains a theobromine , a chemical that can affect the heart , kidneys and central nervous system
dark chocolate and baker 's chocolate contain higher concentrations of theobromine and are more toxic than similar amounts of milk chocolate
sugar - free gums and candies that contain the sugar - substitute xylitol can lead to quick onset of toxic clinical signs that may include a rapid decrease in blood sugar and possible seizures
think carefully before placing mistletoe or holly in low - lying areas , but put poinsettias anywhere you like
the effects of the poinsettia , long believed poisonous , are generally benign , says dr. @entity178 , author of a guide to @entity180 and professor of clinical sciences and toxicology at @entity184 of @entity185 and @entity186
exposed plant bulbs such as @entity188 and all species of lilies should be placed out of reach of pets not only during the holidays but year - round , @entity178 says
@entity195 in cats can reach critical levels almost immediately after ingestion and lead to acute kidney failure within 48 hours or less
" lilies are one of the most poisonous houseplants that exists , " @entity178 said
" it 's not just the flower but also the leaves
... if a cat eats any part of the plant , it would need to be treated immediately
" what should you do if your pet ingests a toxic holiday treat ? " do not wait , " @entity108 said
" most people wait too long to call us , and that reduces our options for treatment
" @entity108 recommends calling a local veterinarian or animal emergency hospital first , or the @entity222 national animal poison control center ( 888 - 426 - 4435 )
the @entity222 charges a $ 60 veterinary consultation fee , but information about toxins is free on the @entity222 web site
@entity58 does not advise calling human poison control centers or attempting to diagnose your pet on the @entity229
human poison control " is often not aware of the species differences and could inadvertently give the wrong advice , " @entity58 said
" when doing a general internet search , make sure the site is backed by a recognized veterinary organization or veterinary medical school
if it is not referenced , it is just someone 's opinion
" @entity108 and @entity58 both warn against inducing vomiting in your pet before speaking with a veterinarian
getting appropriate background information about the animal is critical to preparing a treatment plan for a particular toxin , they say , and every case -- every animal -- is different
@entity1 never recovered from her anemia , but she has been in remission long enough to create another toxic scare
after learning that @entity1 had ingested an entire bag of @entity258 's kisses , we called our local animal emergency hospital in @entity260
they did a quick calculation using @entity1 's weight to determine whether a one - pound bag of milk chocolate would reach toxic levels in a dog of her size
it would not , but we were forced to clean up the silver - streaked evidence for many days afterwards
@entity271 is a former journalist for @entity272 , @entity0 and the @entity273
she is a second - year student in the professional veterinary program at @entity184 .
