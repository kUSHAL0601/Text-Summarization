-- the " @entity2 " affair has set off a firestorm of debate in @entity5 and beyond -- about what constitutes support for terrorism , about detention without trial , deportation and , yet again , about the vexatious issue of @entity5 's relationship with @entity14
@entity2 is a militant @entity15 preacher who had been held in high - security jails in the @entity5 for a total of six years
last week , an immigration tribunal granted him bail , despite the government 's objections
@entity2 came to the @entity5 in 1993 with his wife and three children and was granted refugee status because he had been tortured by @entity26 authorities
but that was before his militant preaching became an issue and before @entity30 became public enemy no. 1
@entity5 has historically generous criteria for granting political asylum , but the consensus now on the left and the right is that the 51 - year - old preacher should not have qualified
by the time he arrived in @entity5 from @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity2 's hardline @entity39 views were well formed
writing in @entity43 in 2006 , @entity42 quotes a @entity45 journalist who had met @entity2 in the early 1990s
@entity46 said " @entity2 had struck him as far more radical than @entity47 ... influenced by @entity39 , the puritanical , fundamentalist strain of @entity49
" as a preacher in @entity52 mosques , @entity2 soon gained a militant following
in 1999 , he allegedly sought to justify the killing of @entity55 , including children , and attacking @entity57
three days after 9/11 , @entity2 preached that the attacks were part of a global struggle between @entity61 and @entity49 , and were a response to @entity57 's unjust policies
in another sermon , he sought to justify the killing by a muslim of a " non-believer " for the sake of @entity49
at the same time , @entity2 ran a magazine called @entity70 , which supported jihadists in @entity72 at a time when the @entity74 of @entity72 was waging a brutal campaign of massacres and assassinations
his rhetoric attracted a growing following in mosques and online among young militants , but no evidence has been produced in a @entity5 court to suggest he was involved with specific @entity30 conspiracies
a @entity86 government indictment sought to show that @entity2 did go beyond sermons
it alleged that an @entity30 member , @entity89 , made more than 20 trips from @entity86 to @entity5 between 1995 and 2000 , bringing @entity2 funds raised for jihad
when @entity52 police raided @entity2 's home early in 2001 , they found $ 250,000 in cash under his bed
@entity2 maintained it was to build a mosque , but some of the money was said to have been marked for the @entity103 mujahideen -- at that point a cause celebre among jihadists
@entity2 was detained in the @entity5 in 2002 under sweeping anti-terror legislation enacted after 9/11 -- along with dozens of other @entity108 militants
videos of his preaching were found in a @entity113 , @entity112 , apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks , including ringleader @entity117
@entity5 and other intelligence agencies asserted he had close ties to @entity30 leader @entity47
counter-terrorism sources also maintained he was a big influence on @entity122 , the @entity26 who would emerge as @entity30 's leader in @entity125
both had been convicted of involvement in a terror plot in @entity26 in 2000 , and according to one @entity30 operative , it was @entity2 who had introduced @entity122 to the @entity30 leadership
would - be shoe - bomber @entity132 was also an admirer
in denying @entity2 's release from jail in 2004 , a judge said , " we have no doubt that his beliefs are extreme and are indeed a perversion of @entity49 for the purposes of encouraging violence against non-muslims and @entity144 who are , or have been , supportive of @entity57
" in arguing for his continued detention the following year , the @entity5 government summarized his role , saying " he provides advice which gives religious legitimacy to those who wish to further the aims of extreme @entity108 and to engage in terrorist attacks , including suicide bombings
" his place in jihad was not unlike that of militant preacher @entity158 , who was killed in @entity159 last year
after @entity5 's highest court struck down detention without trial , @entity2 remained behind bars as the @entity5 government began proceedings to deport him to @entity26
he 'd already been convicted there in absentia of involvement in two terrorist attacks in 1998 , as well as the 2000 plot
@entity2 appealed , saying deportation would put him at risk of torture and lengthy pre-trial detention
his case moved gradually up the ladder of @entity5 justice but was eventually dismissed by the @entity177 , which found that " the risk that evidence obtained by torture would be used in the criminal proceedings in @entity26 would not amount to a flagrant denial of justice
" enter the @entity183 , whose decisions are binding in @entity5 cases
last month , the court decided that @entity2 could not be deported to @entity26 because there was " a real risk of the admission of evidence obtained by torture at his retrial
" @entity5 prime minister @entity194 reacted angrily to the decision , telling the @entity196 last week : " it is not acceptable that we end up with a situation you have someone in your country that threatens to do you harm that you can not try , you can not detain and you can not deport
" it 's a red meat issue to @entity206 politicians in @entity5
traditionally hostile to @entity14 's influence in @entity5 's affairs , they believe the @entity5 should not be bound by the court 's decision
ministers are conscious that emotions are running high
home secretary @entity214 told @entity215 : " the right place for a terrorist is a prison cell ; the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell far away from @entity5
" but as one popular tweet puts it : " @entity2 has not even been convicted of a parking offense in @entity5
" and that 's for two reasons
authorities are unwilling to produce evidence in open court that might prove some operational or direct link to terrorism for fear of compromising intelligence sources
and it is notoriously difficult to prove a crime has been committed by the use of words that influence others ' actions
as @entity5 's @entity240 admitted in 2005 : " we accept that @entity241 encouraged and raised funds for individuals to go to @entity244 ; he may not have gone further as an organiser
" while the @entity5 authorities try to negotiate assurances from @entity26 that would allow his deportation , @entity2 is on bail , but under strict conditions
he is electronically tagged , confined to his home for 22 hours a day , banned from using the @entity253 or a cell phone , banned from attending any mosque or publishing any statement , banned from receiving visitors without permission -- and those are just a few of the conditions
for now , @entity2 's ability to invigorate the hearts of jihadists is very limited .
