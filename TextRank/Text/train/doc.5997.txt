-- autonomous vehicles , levitating trains and supersonic tubes have all been suggested as radical ways to transport us faster as the new urban age approaches , but it seems the real secret to a faster commute has been with us all along -- the bus
bus rapid transit ( @entity12 ) systems are paving the way for sustainable , efficient , and affordable travel and now operate in 181 cities worldwide
but they 're not just your regular bus service
exclusive bus lanes dominate the center of roads , prepaid tickets prevent delays when boarding and raised platforms at bus stops make you level with the bus floor to get on
these small details all make for a smooth , slick service to help you reach your destination in record time and its nothing new , the first system was pioneered 40 years ago
the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) in the town of @entity37 , @entity34 began service in 1974
industrial growth saw the city 's population grow by 5.3 % per year in the 1970 's and this rapid influx of new people living and working in the city called for new urban design and led to this innovative use of buses in their own infrastructure by the mayor and architect @entity49
his design of a ' subway on wheels ' transported 50,000 people daily back in the 80s and today sees over 2 million passengers step on board each day
six circular routes radiate around the city in both directions and in dedicated lanes , enabling frequent services
colour - coding of buses also makes it easier to know if you ; re on the right track
this bus - based infrastructure is significantly cheaper to build than going underground like the metro systems seen in other cities such as @entity73 and @entity74
thirty - three cities in @entity34 now host a @entity12 , as well as a further 26 across the rest of @entity77
the continent is setting the example for the field but has its own social challenges to overcome with its users
one of the main goals of these systems is to remove the social snobbery associated with taking the bus by offering a faster service that people ca n't refuse
this was accomplished in @entity37 when the buses first appeared but new high - income earners are offering resistance
@entity37 has one of @entity34 's highest per capita ownership of private cars
the city 's mayor @entity96 is concerned he must convert a new generation
" cars are so accessible and relatively accessible , " says @entity96
" we have to convert a new public and how ? mainly with speed "
the lure is still faster travel but also convenience , with bus stops every 400 meters
but as with every growing city , populations begin to live further and further away from its epicenter
human rights activist @entity111 feels the system no longer accommodates the working class who can no longer afford to live in the city and therefore within easy access to the @entity12
" they have been pushed to the metropolitan region where you do n't have good integration with the system ... they have to take longer and longer trips to get to work , " says @entity111
the city has tried to overcome this with bigger , longer buses which encompass three buses in one
the result is a high - capacity bus capable of carrying 250 passengers at once -- as many as a @entity131 787
the priority now it to get people on board
the tried and tested technology of @entity37 has proven successful and the city has long been known as a laboratory for sustainability
so as the future approaches with daydreams of jetpacks and hovercrafts , the reality for us all may be not to miss the bus
