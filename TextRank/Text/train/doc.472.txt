@entity0 factored in monday 's third and final presidential debate , which covered foreign policy
at one point , president @entity3 accused @entity6 presidential candidate @entity5 of initially being against a withdrawal of forces from @entity0 in 2014
the claim : " in the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in @entity0 , now you 're for it , although it depends , " @entity3 said
fact check : @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity16 the facts : as early as last year , @entity5 said he agreed with a 2014 withdrawal date
" the timetable by the end of 2014 is the right timetable for us to be completely withdrawn from @entity0 , other than a small footprint of support forces , " he said during a november 2011 @entity6 candidate debate
and during a recent address at a veterans convention , @entity5 reiterated his support for a 2014 withdrawal
" as president , my goal in @entity0 will be to complete a successful transition to @entity0 security forces by the end of 2014 , " he said
fact check : comparing costs of @entity16 , @entity36 missions but during that same speech @entity5 added a caveat , saying he would talk to commanders on the ground to evaluate the conditions in @entity0 before the withdrawal
" i will evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders , " he said
this stipulation of seeking advice from commanders ahead of the withdrawal is where @entity3 and @entity5 differ
the @entity3 administration has repeatedly stated that a 2014 withdrawal is absolute
most recently , vice president @entity53 said many times during his debate with @entity5 's running mate , @entity57 , " we are leaving in 2014
" the @entity3 administration does however plan to leave 10,000 to 15,000 troops in @entity0 after 2014 , should the @entity0 government agree to it
during and interview with @entity61 in july , @entity5 again left the door open to moving back the 2014 deadline if commanders on the ground in @entity0 told him that they needed @entity67 troops to stay longer
fact check : is @entity70 's core decimated or growing ? " i do n't want to go into hypotheticals , but we recognize the circumstances may change on the ground either for the better or for the worse
i do n't think you set hard and fast deadlines without recognizing that there is the potential for conditions to change , " he said
@entity5 's criticism has centered on @entity3 announcing the withdrawal date
" announcing a withdrawal date , that was wrong , " @entity5 said during his announcement of entering the presidential race in june of 2011
" the @entity87 may not have watches , but they do have calendars
" conclusion : mostly false
@entity5 agrees with a 2014 withdrawal deadline but has added the caveat that he would seek advice from commanders on the ground at that point , leaving the door open to possibly staying longer
what @entity5 has disagreed with was the announcement of the withdrawal deadline , not the deadline itself
