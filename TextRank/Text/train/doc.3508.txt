@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 politician ended his " fast unto death " on saturday when the nation 's president gave him water and an ambulance rushed him to a hospital
@entity11 , who had been the construction minister and is currently a member of parliament , was on his fourth day of the fast amid protests against the @entity15
he said he would go without food until @entity15 @entity17 ban ki - moon dissolves a three - member panel looking into human rights abuses in the final stages of a decades - long war that ended in 2009 between the government and the @entity25 rebels
during the fast , @entity11 's @entity27 colleagues visited him in a special tent outside the @entity15 compound in @entity0
he was on a mattress on a specially - constructed dais protected by plain - clothed security
visits by ministers signaled government backing for @entity11 's protest against the @entity15
doctors warned @entity11 earlier saturday that his condition was worsening and administered saline to him
president @entity40 walked up the dais and gave a bottle of water to @entity11
he was then taken to a hospital
the event was shown on local tv and has been widely reported
the @entity15 and other countries have expressed dismay at the blockade of the @entity15 compound and @entity11 's leading role in the protest
the @entity15 office continued to function with limited staff
