@entity2 's horrific descriptions of his time in a @entity6 prison camp became a best - selling book , made him a key witness before the @entity10 and grabbed headlines around the world
he was one of the most high - profile @entity6 defectors , winning several human rights awards and inspiring a documentary as his memoir was translated into 27 languages
now the publisher of the book and its author say @entity22 -- who claims to have been born in and escaped from a @entity6 prison camp -- has revealed that parts of the story he told were n't true
@entity22 may have spent most of his life in @entity6 at a different prison camp , rather than the total control zone that formed the title of his biography
@entity22 's accounts of his time in the gulag have been widely reported in interviews with media including @entity0
he also wrote an opinion piece describing his experiences for @entity38
do n't discount @entity6 stories after defector 's recanting , advocates say @entity43 , author of the book " @entity45 , " said in a statement on his website over the weekend that @entity22 had changed " key parts of his story
" " on friday , jan. 16 , i learned that @entity2 , the @entity6 prison camp survivor who is the subject of ' escape from @entity53 , ' had told friends an account of his life that differed substantially from my book , " @entity43 said
" i contacted @entity22 , pressing him to detail the changes and explain why he had misled me
" @entity43 declined to provide additional details to @entity0 , but published a lengthy explanation on his website
a @entity62 story based on information @entity43 said he had provided to the newspaper said " the most horrific details " of @entity22 's story " still stand , " but some of the times and places of the events in his accounts were wrong
" from a human rights perspective , he was still brutally tortured , but he moved things around , " @entity43 told the @entity62 , where he worked as a reporter for 28 years
@entity22 did not immediately respond to a request from @entity0 for comment
in a post on his @entity79 page , he does n't go into details about the purported discrepancies , but he includes a link to the @entity62 's story and apologizes to his supporters
" this particular past of mine that i so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden , nor do i want it to be , " he says
" to those who have supported me , trusted me and believed in me all this time , i am so very grateful and at the same time so very sorry to each and every single one of you
" inconsistencies highlighted @entity22 " significantly revised details of his early life , " said @entity43 in a statement
the inaccuracies include the following : in the book , in his @entity10 testimony and in interviews with media including @entity0 , @entity22 has detailed torture and abuse he claimed occurred in a notorious prison known as @entity53
@entity22 told @entity43 on friday that he 'd actually been transferred with his mother and brother to a less restrictive prison camp , @entity108 18 , when he was six years old
it was there , not at @entity53 , where @entity22 now says he witnessed authorities execute his mother and brother
@entity22 had previously said that he had lived his entire life in @entity53 before escaping in 2005
he now says he escaped from @entity108 twice before -- in 1999 and 2001 , wrote @entity43 in his statement
during his second escape attempt from @entity108 , he was caught in @entity116 and repatriated to @entity6
first , he was sent to @entity108 and later transferred to @entity53 for torture and punishment , wrote @entity43
@entity22 now says he was 20 years old when he was tortured as a punishment for escaping , wrote @entity43
his original account indicated that he was tortured when he was 13 for plotting to escape
@entity22 had been saying that he was tortured when he was a teenager since his arrival to @entity124 in 2006
@entity22 had described in the book that his finger was chopped off by an angry guard after he dropped a sewing machine in @entity53
now , @entity22 told @entity43 that his finger was mangled as a guard pulled out his fingernails as punishment for escaping
" when i agreed to share my experience for the book , i found it was too painful to think about some of the things that happened , " @entity22 told @entity43
" so i made a compromise in my mind
i altered some details that i thought would n't matter
i did n't want to tell exactly what happened in order not to relive these painful moments all over again
" @entity22 told @entity43 that he thought that dates , places and circumstances were not all that significant , according to the author 's statement
challenges with @entity6 accounts accounts from @entity6 defectors are often difficult to confirm , with lack of documents and the regime 's general secrecy
@entity43 stated that he was working with the publisher to amend the book
it 's unclear what action the book 's publisher will take in response to the discrepancies in @entity22 's story
" @entity174 , the publisher of " escape from @entity53 " by @entity43 , has been apprised that there were some inaccuracies in the story @entity2 , the subject of the book , told the author , " @entity166 spokeswoman @entity165 said in a written statement sunday
" we are working with the author on an accurate understanding of the facts
@entity6 has repeatedly denied @entity22 's claims and described testimony before a @entity10 commission by him and others as " slander " put forward by " human scum
" in a video posted last year on a website that carries pro-pyongyang propaganda , @entity22 's father denied that his son was ever in a prison camp
@entity22 said in response that his father had been taken hostage and was being used in a campaign to discredit him
human rights activists argue that changes in @entity22 's account do not ultimately affect his testimony , saying they still believe he was tortured and that his story highlights the horror of prison camps
the @entity204 reported sunday that @entity22 said he had held back about revealing inaccuracies in his story out of concerns that it could hurt his advocacy work
" i dithered because friends feared the damage my coming out might do to the movement for @entity6 human rights , " he said , according to the @entity204
in his @entity79 post , @entity22 said he was not sure if he would be able to continue his efforts to end political prison camps in @entity6
" but instead of me , you can all still fight , " he said
" i still have faith in you
" @entity0 's @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .
