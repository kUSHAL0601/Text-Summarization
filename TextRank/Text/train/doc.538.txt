-- a woman who claims polygamist sect leader @entity2 forced her as a 14 - year - old to marry her 19 - year - old cousin said she is not giving up , despite the @entity6 's overturning @entity2 ' convictions and ordering a new trial
" this is not the end , and i by no means am backing down , " @entity9 said after the ruling at a news conference , portions of which were posted on the website of @entity0 affiliate @entity15
@entity2 , the " prophet " of the @entity19 , or @entity19 , was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five years to life after he was convicted on two counts of rape as an accomplice in september 2007
he was accused of using his influence to force @entity9 to marry her cousin @entity27 in 2001
the @entity6 ruled wednesday that the jury instructions in @entity2 ' 2007 trial were flawed
the first count of rape as an accomplice against @entity2 was alleged to have occurred shortly after @entity9 and @entity27 were married , when the two first had sex , the @entity6 opinion said
the second was alleged to have occurred after @entity2 refused to " release " @entity9 from her marriage and told her to " give herself to [ @entity38 ] ... mind , body and soul
" prosecutors relied on three separate portions of the law defining the circumstances under which sex is non-consensual , the opinion said
under those portions , the victim must express a lack of consent through words or conduct , the victim must be younger than 18 , and " the actor " must be in a position of special trust in relation to the victim
" @entity2 argues that the instruction erroneously focused the jury on @entity2 ' actions and position of special trust , rather than on @entity27 's , for the purpose of determining whether @entity9 consented , " the opinion said
the justices agreed , saying in the unanimous ruling that the jurors should have been asked to consider whether @entity27 was in a position of special trust and whether @entity27 lured or induced @entity9 into having sex
" the state interprets the term ' actor ' to mean the ' defendant , ' " the opinion said
" we conclude that the state 's interpretation is erroneous
" also , the jurors should have been instructed that in order to convict , they must find that @entity2 intended that @entity27 would sexually assault @entity9 as a result of his conduct
@entity9 told " @entity84 " on tuesday night that she was in " disbelief " after hearing that the convictions were overturned
" what i know is this : i would never have married my first husband unless @entity2 wanted it , " she said
" i would never had had unwanted sex with my first husband unless @entity2 demanded it
" she told @entity15 that she has no regrets about her testimony in the case
" if i had to do this again , i would n't change a thing , because i stood up for what i believe in , " @entity9 said tuesday
she is now 24 and has remarried and left the @entity19
her attorneys made her name public after the @entity2 trial , with her consent
according to @entity15 , she is in a witness protection program
she said she feared retribution for her testimony against @entity2
" he controlled thousands of people in fear for many , many years , " she said , and " many abominable sins and many things ... have occurred to thousands of people because of his influence
" the justices sent the case back to the lower court for a new trial
defense attorney @entity116 said tuesday that he expects the @entity118 , @entity119 , district attorney to decide quickly on whether @entity2 will be retried
@entity120 , senior deputy attorney for @entity118 , said wednesday that the district attorney 's office is still analyzing the @entity6 's ruling and consulting with the victim and others involved in the case before deciding to retry @entity2
@entity2 will be transferred , however , from the @entity127 just south of @entity128 to @entity118 in southern @entity119 -- closer to the @entity19 communities of @entity130 , @entity119 , and @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity116 said
@entity116 said tuesday that he will be requesting bail for @entity2 when a hearing is held in the lower court
but @entity2 remains under federal indictment for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in 2006
federal detainers remain in place , said @entity141 , spokeswoman for the @entity144 attorney 's office in @entity119
if @entity2 is not held on state charges , he will be taken into federal custody , she said
however , @entity2 ' biggest legal challenge still awaits him
he is awaiting trial in @entity149 , where he was indicted in 2008 on a felony charge of sexual assault of a child
the indictment accuses him of assaulting a child " younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant " in january 2005
if convicted on those charges , he could face a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison
an extradition hearing on the @entity149 matter was canceled tuesday after the @entity6 ruling
but the @entity149 attorney general 's office began new proceedings wednesday to extradite @entity2 , spokesman @entity164 told the @entity167
@entity2 had been awaiting trial in @entity132 on four charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor
but last month , a judge dismissed those charges
the @entity175 , @entity132 , prosecutor , had asked the court to throw out the charges , citing " much more serious charges " against @entity2 in @entity149 and the desire of his alleged victims that he " face these more serious charges as soon as possible
" the @entity19 drew national attention when @entity2 was arrested during a routine traffic stop in august 2006
at the time , he was on the @entity186 's @entity185
the @entity19 is a 10,000 - member offshoot of the mainstream @entity189 church , which renounced polygamy a century ago
@entity19 members openly practice polygamy at the @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity149 , and the two towns straddling the @entity119 - @entity132 state line
critics of the sect say young girls are forced into " spiritual " marriages with older men and are sexually abused
sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place
@entity2 had led the sect since his father 's death in 2002
@entity0 's @entity208 and " @entity84 's " @entity209 contributed to this report .
