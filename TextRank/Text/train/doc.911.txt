-- the possibility of engine fires has prompted @entity4 to recall nearly 1.5 million passenger sedans manufactured between 1997 and 2003 , the @entity1 announced monday
the recall involves certain @entity4 vehicles in which oil apparently can leak and ignite
the recall covers certain mid- and full - size passenger sedans under @entity4 's @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 brands
the affected vehicles have naturally aspirated 3.8 liter @entity18 engines -- that is , engines that use atmospheric pressure rather than a mechanical blower to bring in air for combustion -- according to documents that @entity4 filed with federal regulators last week
on friday , the federal government acknowledged the filing and agreed to the plan
the problem involves a potential for oil to leak on the exhaust manifold during hard braking
when a car operates under normal conditions , the manifold can get very hot
oil that runs below the manifold 's heat shield could ignite and spread to plastic channels that hold spark plug wires
as a solution , the company recommends a change in the bracket that holds spark plug wires , which will be done free of charge
owners and dealers affected by the recall will be notified by letter next month with details
the vehicles involved are : 1997 - 2003 @entity53
1998 - 2003 @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56
@entity4 issued a recall on a similar engine in 2008 , according to the company 's filing with the government
that problem was traced to a faulty gasket on the engine rocker cover .
