@entity1 / @entity0 -- @entity3 walks briskly and with a certain purpose
carrying three small bags and layered up for the @entity1 night , she weaves through traffic and over crowded pedestrian walkways
these are her first steps in a thousand - kilometer trip home to @entity0 province
" i feel great , because i am going home , " she says
" i only get home once a year or sometimes maybe twice
i want to go home to see my parents and children because i miss them
" like many migrants , @entity3 came to @entity1 for the money
she works two jobs as a maid and her husband gets odd jobs as a foreman
together they earn around $ 1,200 a month to support their extended family
" i do n't really like @entity1 , " she says
her life here is crowded and the work is constant
but opportunities to earn in @entity33 have drained from the countryside into the cities
and migrants are everywhere in @entity1 's sprawl
they clean homes , run fruit stands on wheeled carts , make crispy pancakes on gas fires for the breakfast rush , clean garbage off the streets and clip hedges by hand
they help run this city of more than 20 million
during the @entity51 , they post handwritten signs on their shops , receive red " @entity54 " envelops stuffed with bonuses , and leave in their millions
many @entity1 do n't notice them until they are gone
@entity3 joins the throngs milling outside @entity60 , an imposing @entity61 and @entity63 - style landmark
everywhere migrants sit on stools and buckets surrounded by their luggage , puffing on cigarettes in the cold
" i bet you have n't experienced anything like this before , " says @entity3 as we jam through the bottleneck to board
we 're stuck right in the middle of giant swathe of humanity
a muffled announcement , a shove forward , a half step backwards , then we shuffle forward all together
" do n't push me , " shouts one man as he gets a duffle bag shoved against his head
@entity33 has built up an impressive network of high - speed trains
but not the 8 p.m @entity86 to @entity87
she 's a stately string of carriages in bold blue , red and white , designed for comfort , not for speed
even that is compromised during @entity51
@entity33 take more than three billion trips during this period , more than 200 million by rail , so just getting a ticket is a bit like winning the lottery
tickets online to @entity87 sold out in seconds , says @entity3 , so she bought one to the first stop in @entity103 , hoping the conductors would n't throw them off in this time of goodwill
" any pregnant women , young children , or elderly in this carriage , " says the lead conductor , in a sharp navy blue uniform with officer - style cap as the @entity111 clatters out of the station
it appears nobody in our carriage could get a ticket beyond @entity103
so the conductors register us to be distributed through the train
some get sleepers in three - tiered bunks ; others jam in where they can
there is a saying in @entity33 : " @entity129 or poor ; get home for the holiday " ( 有钱没钱 ， 回家过年 )
it has become a bit of a cliché
but for @entity33 , and @entity33 migrants in particular , going home for the @entity51 , or @entity138 , festival is near mandatory and often the only time of the year they can be with their families
" i really do miss my children , " says @entity3
" it 's not like we are separated by a month or two , it 's for a whole year
that is a long time and there is such a huge distance between us
" @entity3 's family mirrors changes in @entity33
her father 's generation worked the fields near their village , but pollution and urbanization made farming untenable
@entity3 missed out on an education , so she works doggedly to support the whole family
her daughter works at an appliance factory
but her son is in university studying physics
he is their big hope
" his tuition costs thousands and we have to pay , " says @entity3
" but i am full of hope he will graduate and find a good job with a steady income and he will contribute to the family
everything we do is for our children and our family
" migrant families are full of these sorts of burdens and dreams
so , for many , ten hours in a crowded train is no real hardship at all
others on the train , like mr. fan , who runs a breakfast stand in @entity1 , are also happy to suffer the cramped conditions
" we go home once a year to see my kids and my parents
this travel is nothing to me
i am totally content , " he says
around him people sleep on the carriage floor , others pack in three abreast in standing room
they eat , try to sleep and play @entity198 , a popular @entity33 card game
" only eight minutes to go , " says @entity3 in the pre-dawn gloom as we approach @entity87
" i am feeling great , but i am sure you are tired
" soon there will be the reunion , the meals , the fireworks
gossiping with friends and seeing family
but @entity3 has only one thought
" every year when i get near my home i feel so happy
but going back is so hard
i feel so sad then that every time i cry
" @entity2 's @entity212 contributed to this report .
