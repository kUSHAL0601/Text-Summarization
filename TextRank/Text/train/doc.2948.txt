@entity0 , @entity1 -- forget going door - to - door , @entity4 , 31 , campaigns from window - to - window
he 's an independent candidate running for a seat in @entity1 's general election from @entity0
unlike the politicians he 's up against , who wear traditional @entity1 clothes , @entity4 dresses like a man with extraordinary powers -- the @entity15 superhero @entity13
as he pops his head into a window after scaling a residential building , he asks startled residents to vote for him
when asked if people take a candidate dressed up as a comic book character seriously , he sincerely says , that they do and they should
because unlike the fictional superhero , @entity4 has real guts , intense concentration and dedication
these are the qualities , he says , that enable him to scale a 45 - story building in just 19 minutes
" it takes a higher level of thinking and great organized thought , " @entity4 says , adding that a candidate needs these qualities to help the citizens of @entity0
after all , with great power comes great responsibility
though @entity0 is @entity1 's financial capital and one of the wealthier cities in @entity1 , " people are still deprived of the basic necessities like water , electricity , schooling , " he says
if he 's elected , these are the basic issues he will tackle
his election symbol is -- you got it -- a window
these symbols are a crucial part of @entity1 's election exercise
in a country where a large part of the population is illiterate , people cast their vote for a symbol rather than a candidate 's name
it 's a palm for the @entity65 , a lotus for the @entity67 , a broom for the @entity69 and a window for @entity4
the friendly neighborhood @entity13 says he hopes the public will grab the window of opportunity they have to bring about change in @entity0
he hopes they 'll take it and vote for him
will he win ? that 's still up in the air .
