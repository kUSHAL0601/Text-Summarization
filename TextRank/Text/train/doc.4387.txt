the first woman bishop to serve in the @entity1 was named wednesday in a historic step that follows years of sometimes contentious debate
@entity4 announced that the rev. @entity5 , who was been a priest since 1994 , will be the new bishop of @entity7 , in northern @entity8
she will be consecrated as a bishop on january 26
her appointment brings to a close a thorny chapter in the church 's recent history
women have been able to serve as priests in the @entity1 since the early 1990s
but some traditionalists resisted the move to allow them to become bishops , culminating in the issue being narrowly voted down in 2012 by the @entity21 , the three - times - a - year meeting that sets policies for the church
two years earlier , the church 's governing body had narrowly rejected a measure , aimed at satisfying conservatives , that would have allowed parishes that opposed women bishops to have an additional male bishop
a revised proposal was finally approved by @entity1 leaders last month
speaking at a news conference in @entity7 , @entity34 said she was grateful but also " somewhat daunted " to be chosen
" this is unexpected and very exciting , " she said
" on this historic day as the @entity1 announces the first woman nominated to be bishop , i am very conscious of all those who have gone before me , women and men , who for decades have looked forward to this moment
but most of all i am thankful to @entity45
" archbishop of canterbury @entity46 -- who has backed allowing women to be bishops -- said he was delighted by her selection
" her @entity52 - centered life , calmness and clear determination to serve the church and the community make her a wonderful choice , " he said
archbishop of york @entity59 said he would preside over @entity34 's consecration as a bishop " with great joy
" @entity34 , a mother of two whose husband is an airport chaplain , will serve as a suffragan , or junior , bishop in the @entity68
reform , an @entity71 evangelical network that has opposed the introduction of women bishops , warned that @entity34 's appointment would strain relations in the diocese
" we have known since july that the @entity1 would seek to appoint women to the episcopate -- against the biblical model of good church leadership , " @entity77 , chairman of @entity69 , said in a statement
" though it grieves us , it comes as no surprise
we pray that the @entity86 will uphold the promises made in july and enable the many thriving conservative evangelical churches in his @entity89 to continue to serve their communities with theological integrity under the oversight of a male bishop
" the @entity1 is the largest church of the @entity94 , with more than 26 million baptized members
the communion represents more than 85 million people in 165 countries , including the @entity100 @entity99
the @entity101 lists church districts that have women bishops including @entity104 and @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , the @entity99 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 .
