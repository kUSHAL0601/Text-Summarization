@entity0 -- the human rights commissioner for the @entity3 urged countries that have hosted secret @entity6 prisons to come clean monday , as the 10th anniversary of 9/11 approaches
@entity9 said @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 were among at least seven countries that hosted " black sites " for " enhanced interrogation " during the " war on terror
" " darkness still enshrouds those who authorized and ran the black sites on @entity21 territories , " he said
" the full truth must now be established and guarantees given that such forms of co-operation will never be repeated
" @entity6 officials have acknowledged the rendition program , but refused to discuss details and denied violating any laws
efforts to challenge the agency and get details about it in @entity35 courts have been turned aside
@entity9 's statement comes as documents seized from @entity39 's compound in @entity40 shed light on the program of extraordinary rendition , or questioning of terror suspects in third - party countries where @entity35 law does not apply
@entity1 saw a march 6 , 2004 , @entity6 letter to @entity40 officials about @entity49 , a former jihadist with the @entity50 and now a senior commander in the @entity53 forces
it concerned the @entity56 government 's arrest of @entity57 , @entity49 's nom de guerre for his rendition
a @entity6 officer said the man and his pregnant wife were being placed on a commercial flight from @entity64 , @entity56 , to @entity65 via @entity66 and then onto @entity40
" we are planning to arrange to take control of the pair in @entity66 and place them on our aircraft for a flight to your country , " the officer wrote
@entity49 fought for the @entity75 in @entity76 , but left after their fall in 2001 and was arrested in @entity56 in 2004
after some questioning by the @entity6 , he was sent back to @entity40 and jailed
the @entity3 's @entity9 said the @entity6 had held " high - value detainees , " including alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity80 , in @entity10 , between 2002 and 2003
the @entity10 site closed and a new secret prison opened in @entity11 in 2003 , @entity9 charged , and existed for over two years
@entity12 also hosted two sites , he said
@entity10 prosecutors and @entity12 lawmakers have investigated the phenomenon , but @entity11 has shown " little genuine will to uncover the whole truth , " @entity9 charged
" effective investigations are imperative and long overdue , " he said
neither the @entity6 , @entity11 nor @entity12 immediately responded
@entity10 's @entity91 said it would not comment while prosecutors in the country are still investigating
the @entity3 is a 47 - member group that promotes democracy and human rights on the continent
@entity1 's @entity98 contributed to this report .
