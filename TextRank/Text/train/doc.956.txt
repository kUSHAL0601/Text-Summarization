-- @entity2 judges began a sentencing hearing friday for @entity4 , who pleaded guilty two days earlier to all charges related to the killing of a 21 - year - old woman
@entity8 , brother of the victim , said that family members planned to be in court for @entity4 's sentencing
he said none attended the court proceedings on wednesday , when the 24 - year - old @entity16 national confessed to the charges of " qualified murder " and simple robbery
it was an apparent attempt to win a more lenient sentence , using a plea called an " anticipated conclusion of the process " under @entity2 law
five days earlier , the three judges delayed the start of @entity4 's trial after he declined to give a plea after expressing reservations about the " aggravating factors " tied to admitting his guilt
under sentencing guidelines , the panel of judges on friday could order van der @entity4 imprisoned for as much as 30 years
as he appeared red - faced , frowning and with his head hung low , his attorney , @entity38 , argued wednesday that a shorter sentence was in order
@entity38 claimed that his client was under special stress the day the 2010 murder occurred , which marked five years after @entity45 went missing
@entity4 -- who , with two others , was among the last people seen with the @entity49 teenager -- was detained twice , but never charged , in @entity51 's disappearance
@entity45 declared legally dead " he was pointed at and persecuted
the world had been against him for five years before this case , for a murder he said he never committed and for which there is no evidence whatsoever , " said @entity38
police say @entity4 murdered @entity61 in his @entity63 hotel room in may 2010 , then took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to @entity67 , where he was arrested a few days later
investigators believe he killed the @entity2 woman after she found something related to the @entity51 case on van der @entity4 's computer while she was visiting him in his hotel room
@entity49 probate judge @entity75 on thursday -- about six and a half years after she went missing -- signed an order declaring @entity45 legally dead
the girl 's body has never been found , and no one has been charged in @entity81
but van der @entity4 does faces possible extradition to the @entity83 in a matter tied to @entity51 's disappearance and her family
in june 2010 , a federal grand jury in @entity49 indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $ 250,000 from @entity51 's mother , @entity92
@entity4 offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of @entity51 's remains in exchange for the money , according to the indictment
he was allegedly given a total of $ 25,000 , and authorities believe he used that money to travel to @entity2 and participate in a poker tournament , where he met @entity8 .
