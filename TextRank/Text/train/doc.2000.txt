-- former @entity2 army chief @entity1 refused to testify tuesday at the genocide trial of former @entity2 leader @entity4 in the @entity5 and denounced the @entity7 - backed court as " satanic
" both men are on trial at the @entity10 for the former @entity11 , or @entity12 , for their role in the conflict that followed the breakup of the former @entity11 two decades ago
but @entity1 said he does not recognize the court in the @entity17 and rejects it as satanic
" it is not a court of justice , and it is trying us because we are @entity22 and are trying to protect our people from you , " he said
the former army chief , who was arrested in may 2011 after a decade on the run , is being tried separately from his former ally , @entity4 , but was called tuesday as a defense witness in latter 's trial
@entity1 agreed to answer only the first of six questions put to him -- on the positions held during his military career -- arguing that his testimony could harm his own case
@entity4 faces two counts of genocide , among other charges , one of which relates to the massacre of nearly 8,000 @entity46 men and boys in the @entity49 town of @entity50 in july 1995
the second question put to @entity1 by @entity4 's defense was , " did you ever inform me , orally or in writing , that prisoners in @entity50 would be , were being , or had been executed ? " the next was , " did we have any agreement or understanding that the citizens of @entity61 should be subjected to terror by shelling and sniping ? " @entity1 was also asked about the reasons for the shelling and sniping in @entity61 , and what he had told @entity4
more than 10,000 people , most of them civilians , died in the lengthy siege of @entity61 , the @entity49 capital , by @entity2 forces that pounded the city every day from higher ground
@entity1 was also asked if he and @entity4 had any agreement " to expel @entity46 or @entity73 residing in @entity75 - controlled areas " -- a question related to the second genocide charge faced by @entity4
@entity4 : from psychiatrist to ' @entity79 ' elaborate disguise the court proceedings are now in recess , the @entity12 said
there was already an early break in proceedings after @entity1 asked to be brought his dentures before he answered questions , said @entity12 spokeswoman @entity88
@entity4 was captured in 2008 after more than 13 years of hiding in plain sight in @entity90
he had adopted an elaborate disguise that included long hair and a full beard , and was practicing alternative medicine in the @entity96 capital
his trial started in 2009 , and the prosecution rested its case in may 2012
the defense case began in october of that year
@entity1 is accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in a trial that began in 2011
both men would face life in prison if convicted
the court can not impose the death penalty
@entity111 conflicts the @entity12 is still prosecuting a number of cases of alleged war crimes committed during the conflicts in the @entity111 in the 1990s
the @entity50 massacre became an emblem of the dissolution of @entity11 -- once a multiethnic state of @entity22 , @entity73 , @entity46 and others -- into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict
other defendants at the court include @entity73 @entity75 rebel leader @entity126 , accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes ; and @entity129 , a @entity75 nationalist politician who faces charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes
the tribunal says " the most significant number " of its cases have dealt with alleged crimes by @entity96 or @entity2
but there have been convictions for crimes against @entity22 by others , including @entity73 , @entity49 @entity46 and @entity142
@entity0 's @entity143 contributed to this report .
