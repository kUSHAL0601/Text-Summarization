-- three experienced hikers were rescued from @entity4 's @entity3 , but a father and son in a separate group are missing , the @entity1 said
battling heavy snow , rescue personnel and a @entity11 helicopter reached the three men around noon ( 3 p.m. et ) thursday
the men were part of a group of 10 hikers who set out on their journey up the mountain on monday
about 45 people looked for the three hikers -- @entity21 , 34 ; @entity22 , 45 , and @entity23 , 45 -- the @entity1 said in a statement
all three were able to walk and move during a general health assessment
two other hikers on a 36 - mile cross-country loop were supposed to return tuesday
they are @entity29 , 27 , and his father , whose first name is unknown , park officials said
both men are originally from @entity34 , but their current residences are not known
the younger @entity36 is 6 feet , 5 inches tall and weighs about 287 pounds
his father is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds
they had hiked in with a friend , who became ill and hiked out , the park service said
@entity41 , an @entity42 , @entity43 , resident and leader of the larger group , said extreme weather dumped up to three feet of snow and drastically lowered visibility in @entity49 and @entity51 national parks
the group of 10 hikers shared a love of climbing , outdoor activities and adventure , @entity41 said
they set out on their hike shortly after 4 a.m. monday in several sub-groups , including one led by @entity41 and another including all three missing hikers
" every single one had been training for this event for years , " said @entity41
the snow began for @entity41 's group when they reached 10,000 feet up what he called the " 10 - mile hill , " and picked up significantly as they went up another 2,000 feet
his group reached the summit around 3:30 p.m. monday , staying briefly at a shelter there before going back down the mountain
the climb back down was much more difficult than expected , according to @entity41 , due to the heavy snow
" it was by far the hardest thing we 've ever done , " said @entity41 , who said he has climbed @entity77 in @entity78 , among other peaks
at one point , his group met and talked briefly with the climbers who later went missing
@entity21 later sent several texts , the last of which was between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. tuesday in which they said they could n't find the trail because of the snow and were heading to the summit shelter
the three climbers did not have snow shoes , said @entity41
however , they likely had enough food and water to last several days , he said
temperatures near the mountain 's peak were in the 20s , @entity41 added , not low enough to make frostbite a major concern
a rescue operation involving two hikers was begun and aborted wednesday because of the snow
on thursday morning , " bigger and more experienced teams " were brought in , said @entity41
" we wanted to do this , " said @entity41
" these guys were doing what they loved , and we 'll continue to do what we love
