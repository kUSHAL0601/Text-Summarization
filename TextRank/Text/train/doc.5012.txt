a brutal attack wednesday on the offices of the @entity4 satirical newspaper @entity3 -- famous for its blistering cartoons -- left 12 people dead
in the aftermath of such cowardice , we in free @entity9 societies have to ask ourselves : what kind of world are we going to live in ? and will we allow these intolerant radical @entity15 bullies to decide for us what we can read and what we ca n't ? as an editorial cartoonist working in a small @entity21 town in @entity22 , it might have been easy for me to feel insulated from attacks thousands of miles away
but we live in a global society , and this attack hit me on a very personal level
i was fortunate enough this past fall to travel to @entity28 , and also to a little town called @entity30 in the countryside , where locals throw an annual bash celebrating @entity4 's long love affair with the art of cartooning , illustration and caricature
it 's a wonderful event , and it 's clear that the @entity4 love their cartoonists and their art. they crowd in by the hundreds to meet the artists and to maybe get their caricatures drawn
it was there that i met one of the victims in wednesday 's attack , cartoonist @entity51
from what i gathered , he was something of a rock star in @entity4
like all the artists there , he was funny , pleasant and gracious with his time , and his death , along with 11 others , is beyond appalling
the reality is that this is not just an attack on @entity3 , but an attack on all of us who hold dear freedom of expression , no matter where we live
@entity3 is irreverent , anti-religious and occasionally vulgar
the writers and cartoonists routinely anger many of its readers
back in 2007 , for example , it reprinted the @entity75 cartoons that were first published in a @entity77 newspaper , illustrations that had outraged the @entity80 community
and in 2011 , @entity3 " invited " @entity75 to be guest editor and showcased a caricature of him on the cover
since then , it has been reported that several of the editors and cartoonists have lived under the constant threat of death
yet for every cartoonist i have ever met , the occupation is more than a job : it is a lifelong obsession
and while i have never considered this obsession that i share to be a life - threatening career , it is hard to escape the fact that this is now the world we live in , one where hooded gunmen kill journalists and cartoonists in cold blood because they are angered by printed words and drawings
so , how do we respond ? it would be much easier -- and safer -- to simply shut up , put the pen down and walk away
the editors and cartoonists at @entity3 certainly could have done that at the first sign of trouble
@entity113 , the editorial director and one of the cartoonists , for example , was under special high - profile protection , according to @entity117 , which quoted the publication 's attorney as saying , " the threats were constant
" yet @entity113 persisted , refusing to give in to fear
and in the end it cost him his life
opinion : cartoonists , killed for their art , and humanity how that can be so is bewildering
we should be focusing on issues like beating hunger and poverty
yet despite the remarkable technological advances of @entity9 civilization , we find ourselves engaged in a clash with extremists stuck in the seventh century , bent on oppressing women and imposing suffocating religious views on the rest of the globe
our freedoms are at risk , plain and simple , and we must all decide how we will respond
for my part , i will go back to my drawing board and try to make sense of this ridiculous , senseless and vicious assault on my friends and colleagues an ocean away
under constant threat of death , @entity113 was quoted in the @entity4 newspaper @entity155 as saying , " i would rather die standing than live on my knees
" that seems like a good place to start .
