-- in a world of mass - marketed gadgets designed to be trashed and replaced after a few years , is there room for the @entity5 , a machine that lets you design and draw images on ... you guessed it ... eggs ? or how about the @entity11 , a hand - crafted cover for the @entity13 and other tablets that can be personalized to look like your favorite book ? @entity17 thinks so
that 's why he started @entity19
located in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity19 aims to develop and design tools that help " makers " around the world build items that more mainstream manufacturers ca n't ... or wo n't
from designing actual tools to researching the best ways to create small manufacturing businesses in urban areas , the @entity19 is designed to spur a movement that , in itself , was spurred by modern business practices
@entity17 says that , even with history 's largest range of mass - produced products available on the market , they 're just that -- mass produced
consumers , he says , actually have a harder time finding products that suit their personal wants and needs
" inspired in part by @entity48 " make " magazine and the book , " makers , " that spun off from it , " makers , " @entity17 says , are an emerging subculture of designers and engineers inspired to create with individual interests , not mass - market appeal , in mind
" in the @entity60 and @entity61 , people are starting to realize that there 's this opportunity to make again , " @entity17 said
" i think in the rest of the world , they 're kind of like ' well , is n't it funny you all call this ' making
' we 've been doing this forever
that 's one of the things that 's exciting to me is the meeting of those two places
" at last @entity78 's @entity77 conference in @entity79 , @entity80 , he talked up some of the products that have been created with the help of @entity19 , and other creations from the " maker movement " including the aforementioned @entity5
" they sell , actually , quite a lot of them , " he said
" imagine trying to buy one of these at @entity89
probably not going to happen
" or the @entity11 , which he says single - handedly saved a 50 - year - old book - binding company in @entity94 and allowed them to add 10 new jobs during the height of the recession
the maker movement he aims to support , @entity17 says , is n't just about making new products available
in many cases , he says , it 's the creator , not the consumer , who gets the most satisfaction
" i think that 's the fundamental thing behind the wonder in the maker movement , " he said
" this idea that , ' wow ... the difference between nothing and something was me
' " @entity0 's @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .
