-- goals from @entity2 and @entity3 earned @entity4 a comfortable 2 - 0 win against @entity6 in the opening match of @entity8 played in @entity9
the 2002 @entity11 semifinalists created a string of chances against a poor @entity15 side who never looked like getting on the score sheet
central defender @entity2 opened the scoring for @entity4 in the seventh minute , volleying home from close range from a well directed free kick delivered by @entity22
@entity4 should have gone 2 - 0 up after 23 minutes when @entity24 striker @entity23 was sent through on goal by a defense - splitting pass from the boot of @entity3
@entity23 was only denied by a fine save from @entity15 goalkeeper @entity29 which saw the ball cannon onto the roof of the net
the @entity34 were fortunate not to be further behind at half time as @entity4 continued to push forward with a series of incisive moves
aside from a chance which fell to defender @entity40 in the third minute , and an error from @entity4 's goalkeeper @entity42 late in the first half @entity6 never looked like scoring
the second half carried on where the first finished off , and it was no surprise when @entity3 added a second for @entity4 after 52 minutes
latching on to a mistake made by @entity50 , the @entity48 midfielder swept forward into the penalty area before coolly slotting past a helpless @entity52
the goal did seem to finally wake @entity6 from their slumber , and striker @entity56 forced a fine save from @entity42 in the 80th minute but it was a rare moment of skill in a woeful display by the 2004 @entity60 champions
moments later , @entity61 nearly added a third for @entity4 at the other end
the result means @entity6 continue their winless @entity11 finals record
their only other appearance in 1994 finals yielded no goals and no points
@entity4 face a sterner test next thursday when they meet @entity73 in @entity74 , while the @entity34 meet @entity75 in @entity76 .
