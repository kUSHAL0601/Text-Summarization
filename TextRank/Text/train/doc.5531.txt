human rights lawyers filed a class action law suit in a @entity3 federal court accusing the @entity4 of gross negligence and misconduct on behalf of victims of a cholera outbreak in @entity9 in 2010
" the claims are that the @entity4 engaged in reckless and gross negligence and misconduct bringing cholera to @entity9 , " said @entity10 , a lawyer and board member with the @entity13 - based @entity12 in @entity9
the group is demanding financial compensation for the 8,300 @entity9 who died as a result of the cholera epidemic as well as some 650,000 more survivors of the illness
how women are lifting up @entity9 @entity4 spokesman @entity27 expressed to @entity28 " it is not the @entity4 ' practice to discuss in public claims filed against the @entity32
" earlier this year , however , @entity33 ban ki - moon declared the @entity4 could not receive claims for compensation from @entity9 cholera victims , arguing that the organization had legal immunity according to an international convention
in october 2010 , a cholera epidemic exploded in @entity9 , striking as the island country was still reeling from a deadly earthquake earlier that year which killed tens of thousands of people
the cholera bacteria , which is not indigenous to @entity9 , spread rapidly , ultimately killing an estimated 8,300 people
the epidemic sparked riots in several cities and towns against the force of some 8,000 @entity4 peacekeepers deployed there
@entity9 transitions from relief to rebuilding several scientific and medical investigators eventually concluded that one of the likely sources of the outbreak was sewage leaking from a @entity4 base housing @entity61 peacekeepers
the base was perched above a tributary stream leading into the @entity64 near the town of @entity66
" the way we understand disease transmission today , there is no other good explanation for how a ( cholera ) strain that was present only in the northeastern region of the @entity76 subcontinent traveled 9,000 miles to @entity9 and happened to end up in a river next to a base with @entity4 peacekeepers from @entity61 , said @entity80 , a former @entity81 reporter who was one of the first journalists to investigate the source of outbreak in 2010
@entity80 , who further investigated the @entity4 's response to the outbreak in his book " @entity88 : how the @entity91 to save @entity9 and @entity92 , " accused the @entity4 of covering up its responsibility for the cholera epidemic
" in 2010 , the @entity4 did n't want anyone to talk about this , " @entity80 said , in a phone interview with @entity28
" they were directly castigating anyone who would bring up the topic
" in september , the prime minister of @entity9 raised the issue during a speech before the @entity102
" the @entity4 has a moral responsibility for the eruption of the epidemic , " said prime minister @entity103 , according to a @entity4 transcript
@entity103 argued that the current efforts made by the @entity4 to eradicate cholera were far from sufficient
he called for the creation of a joint commission to further study the disease
in a briefing to journalists on wednesday , @entity4 spokesman @entity27 said as a result of the @entity9 epidemic , the organization was in the process of adopting steps to prevent the further spread of the disease
" part of our lessons learned from this has been to screen peacekeepers for cholera , " @entity27 said
health authorities continue to document thousands of cholera cases a month
at least 182 @entity9 died of cholera between april and august 2013 , according to the @entity32
in 2011 : @entity9 cholera victims demand @entity4 compensation
