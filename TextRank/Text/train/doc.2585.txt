photographers often go to bizarre lengths to earn the confidence of their subjects
just ask @entity5 , who got on his knees and howled his way into the heart of a pit bull mix named @entity10 at a dog park in @entity12 , @entity13
something had to be done
each time @entity15 showed up , @entity10 charged at him , barking and occasionally nipping at his legs
one day , @entity15 knelt down next to her and started to howl " like a wolf , " he said
she stopped " dead in her tracks " and joined him , starting a ritual that persists today
" she matched me howl for howl , and immediately after that she just loved me , " @entity15 said
@entity10 was one of many canine friends @entity15 made at @entity29 , where he spent three years shooting what he calls the most unexpected work of his career
the 64 - year - old says he has spent most of his life looking through the viewfinder , " hoping to be surprised " by what he saw
" @entity41 " ( " @entity42 " ) stands out in his oeuvre thanks to its perspective
to take the photos of the dogs and their shadows , he would mount a camera to the end of a pole , raising it up to 7 feet
" the pleasure of it was learning new skills after all these years being a photographer , " he said
" and the dogs are just running around like maniacs
that 's what 's so great about it
" response to " @entity41 " also has been unusual , he said
the photos are being exhibited and sold in galleries in @entity13 , @entity62 and @entity63 before he has had a chance to edit them into a book
that 's a first in a career that began in the 1970s , when @entity15 left his job as a @entity73 trader to focus full - time on a hobby
not that he 's been struggling for recognition
he is a two - time guggenheim fellow , and his work has been exhibited around the world and published in 13 books
as @entity81 's director of photography since 1996 , he has also earned the admiration of many students , including one who started a @entity85 , " s * * * t my photography professor says , " dedicated to his " legitimately insane " and " legitimately brilliant " classroom rants
@entity15 and his wife , @entity89 , started bringing their standard poodle to @entity29 about nine years ago , when @entity91 was just a puppy
@entity93 was closer , but dogs have to be kept on leashes there , @entity15 said
at @entity29 , located in the southwest corner of @entity12 near the @entity98 , @entity91 could roam free
@entity15 did n't start photographing the dogs until 2011 , when he was nearly finished with another project and started fretting over what was next
social media follow @ @entity104 on @entity105 to join the conversation about photography
one day , as the sun streamed unimpeded across the park , casting long canine shadows , he had a revelation
" there was something about the primal nature of the shadows of these little lovable pets of ours
their shadows , i felt , revealed a wilder side of their nature , " he said
" they immediately struck me as something like cave drawings
" the powdery layer of dust on the ground made for a fresh canvas each day , @entity15 said
when he arrived in the morning , the wind had blown it smooth
as the hours went by , tracks from dogs and people brought to life new texture and form
" what was interesting to me is i was essentially photographing the ground , " he said
" i would find interesting patches of ground and call the dogs over or follow them and get picture of what was actually there
" he stopped photographing there last year when the city renovated the park , tearing up the ground and putting down a new surface
it 's actually better for the dogs and their owners
it 's less dusty , and @entity91 still gets to hang out with @entity10 and the rest of their friends
but it effectively ended @entity15 's project
" it 's a beautiful pebbled surface , " he said
" i could see taking a few pictures but i think i would get bored pretty quickly
" @entity5 is an @entity166 photographer and professor at @entity81
you can follow him on @entity105 .
