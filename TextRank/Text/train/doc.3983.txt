-- in july 2000 , @entity1 and his wife , @entity2 , were woken up by a knock on the door at 4 a.m. " i heard the knocking and i thought , ' @entity6 , my son is dead
and then i heard ( @entity2 ) scream and that nightmare became a reality , " says @entity1
nearly a third of all @entity12 traffic - related deaths in 2010 -- more than 10,000 people -- involved alcohol , according to the @entity15
their son , @entity16 , was killed by a drunk driver while driving home to celebrate his mother 's birthday
a few months later , @entity1 and @entity21 started an organization to keep people from getting behind the wheel drunk
called the @entity28 @entity27 , the goal of the organization is to register a million designated drivers
the name comes from @entity16 's experience at the @entity32
during his senior year , @entity16 was selected by his peers to be a hero ( human education resource officer
) " they saw him as a great leader who made them laugh and saw the humor and the positive in everything , " says @entity1
the @entity42 wanted to carry that theme into the campaign
" out of our heartbreak , we wanted to do something to honor our son , and that was an expression of his positive nature , " says @entity1
" @entity16 represents all victims and all the people whose lives we are trying to save , and i think he would 've liked that
" the @entity56 message is simple : be a hero
@entity1 says the group has " a serious mission and a serious goal which can be achieved by people doing the right thing and appealing to the hero in everybody
the @entity63 campaign is active in seven states and partners with law enforcement , schools and local businesses
billboards , decals and magnets are used to get the message out
" people see the billboard , they see sticker on the car , they go into a bar and they see the poster on the wall , and they 're going to say , ' what is this @entity63 campaign ? ' " it 's a simple reminder , says @entity1 : " who 's your driver tonight ? who 's your hero tonight ? " the group holds annual events like the @entity91 and the @entity92
last year over 2,000 people walked on the boardwalk in @entity95 , @entity96 , to show their support
" it 's really something that 's captured the support of the community , because everybody has the same reaction when i talk about that knock on the door
that is the knock you never want to get , " says @entity1
the @entity42 hope that because of their message , other families will be spared from hearing that knock on the door at 4 a.m.
