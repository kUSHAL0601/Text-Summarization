@entity0 -- three @entity4 police officers were found guilty of sexual exploitation and abuse of a 14 - year - old @entity8 boy while they were serving in a @entity0 police mission in @entity8 , a @entity0 spokesman told reporters tuesday
the three were found guilty in a court - martial proceeding conducted by @entity4 authorities in @entity14 , @entity8 , said the spokesman , @entity15
@entity4 authorities alerted @entity8 officials to the outcome of the military procedure this month , saying that " the guilty parties will be punished , including dishonorable discharge from service , loss of benefits and imprisonment , with the latter sentence to be served immediately on return to @entity4
" each is to serve a year in jail
the three were in a @entity4 - formed police unit serving in @entity31 , @entity8 , as part of the @entity33 in the wake of the devastating earthquake there in january 2010
the attack happened this january
the three officers have been sent back to @entity4
the @entity0 spokesman said the international body is in contact with @entity4 authorities to " examine the formal details of the procedures and to ensure appropriate follow - up
" asked by a reporter if the one - year sentence was appropriate for the crime , @entity15 responded , " the @entity0 will not comment on the terms of the punishment under the member - states , the judicial procedure
that 's obviously a matter between @entity4 and @entity8 , but as we stated from the outset , the @entity0 considers this to be a case of the most serious sexual exploitation and abuse
" in a separate case , five @entity59 marines were accused last year of sexually assaulting a teenager at a @entity0 base after a video was posted on the @entity64
that case is still under investigation .
