-- the stars of tennis took time out from their @entity4 preparations sunday to honor the man who helped them become some of the highest - paid athletes in the world
@entity8 passed away friday , aged 54 , succumbing to the motor neurone disease that had forced him to step down as head of the men 's @entity11 @entity11
@entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 led a minute 's silence ahead of the start of the @entity20 , while similar tributes were held at tournaments in @entity23 and @entity24
" @entity8 was n't just the president of the @entity11 but was a player himself , a board member , " @entity14 said on the @entity11 website
" he 's given so much time and effort to the @entity11 , and i think this is really what we will try to honor in a small way today
" @entity8 reached a career - high 34 in the world rankings , but his efforts in administration had far bigger impact on the game , from his time on the players ' council to running the @entity11 's @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 operations before becoming president in early 2012
the @entity48 took the end - of - season championship to @entity50 as part of tennis ' global spread in the early 2000s , and then brought it to @entity54 where it has become a lucrative moneyspinner and showpiece for the @entity11
he has also been credited with getting the players a larger share of prize money from the four grand slam tournaments since he took over the top role a year and half ago
" he was always very nice to work with
gentle , " said 17 - time grand slam winner @entity14
" i 've really enjoyed every step of the way working with him
for me , it was hard seeing him not be the same anymore towards the end physically
but we can only appreciate what he 's done for us and what he did until the last moment he really possibly could
" that will never go away
i 'm sure that the @entity11 and the players will come up with something for the legacy of @entity8
" @entity15 said @entity8 was " a very loved person " on the circuit
" the only thing we can do is say thank you for everything he has done for our sport , all the support , and all the good things he has done these years to help us and to help us to have a better sport
it 's a sad moment for all of us
" world no. 2 @entity14 is returning to action this week to defend his @entity20 title , having recovered from the back injury that hampered him at @entity94 in march
like @entity15 , he is happy that the @entity96 event has reverted to traditional red clay after experimenting with a blue surface last year that was roundly condemned by many players and subsequently banned by the @entity11
" there was a lot of criticism about the color , about the quality of the court as well , being extremely slippery , " he told reporters
" i do n't know if that was due to the color , but this tournament has in the past had issues with the quality of the court
i think through what happened last year with the controversy around the blue clay , it was a big eye opener to have a proper court here now
" i think this year , from what i 'm hearing from the players , it 's a good quality court and the players are happy
in the process , hopefully we 'll see better tennis this year
" top - ranked @entity13 , who ended @entity15 's eight - year reign in @entity130 last month , is also happier with the new surface
" the court is great
the one where i practiced is great
i have n't practiced on the center court yet , but i 'll try to do that tonight to get a little feel about it , " the @entity135 said
@entity15 bounced back from his @entity130 final defeat to win the @entity142 title for the eighth time in nine years
" the courts were not at the level to play professionally last year , " he told reporters
" fortunately this year they are very good
in @entity20 , we have the problem of the dry climate , so it 's very difficult to have the clay that settles down properly
" the women 's tournament is also packed with top names , as defending champion @entity17 seeks to protect her no. 1 ranking from the challenge of in - form @entity159 -- who will go top if she wins the title
@entity17 made a slow start to her opening match against @entity166 qualifier @entity164 on sunday before winning 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 1
however , her older sister @entity167 was forced to withdraw ahead of her match against @entity96 's @entity169 due to a back injury
@entity50 fifth seed @entity171 crashed out , losing 6 - 3 6 - 2 to 18 - year - old @entity174 @entity173
former world no. 1 @entity175 continued her decline , as the @entity178 10th seed lost 6 - 2 6 - 4 to another @entity166 player , @entity179
@entity182 eighth seed @entity180 , the 2011 @entity20 champion , went through to round two along with @entity185 's world no. 4 @entity183
meanwhile , veteran @entity186 won the @entity187 on sunday , beating fellow @entity24 @entity188 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 13 years after losing in his previous final appearance in the clay event
the 35 - year - old , a former world no. 2 , will now climb to 13th in the rankings
it was the first all - @entity24 final in @entity195 since 1965 , and @entity188 was unable to defend his title -- having also won it in 2007
in @entity198 , @entity197 upset top seed and world no. 4 @entity201 6 - 1 6 - 4 to win the @entity202 on sunday
it was the 28 - year - old @entity204 ' fourth career title , and first since january 2011 .
