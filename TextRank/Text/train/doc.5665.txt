" getting to know @entity10 's first family the attack , which occurred during a meeting of ministers and security officials , was coordinated by rebel brigades in @entity19 , said the deputy head of the opposition @entity49 , col. @entity50
the government described it as a suicide bombing
but @entity50 said a remote control was used to detonate an explosive device that had been planted inside the meeting room
@entity58 quickly named gen. @entity59 as defense minister , state - run news agency @entity57 said
state - run @entity57 said the government has killed or captured a " large number " of terrorist infiltrators in @entity19 and inflicted " heavy losses " on terrorists in @entity64 and @entity65
video from a @entity19 suburb showed @entity10 rejoicing after news spread of the bombing
soon after , the pro-government @entity73 militia took to the streets , attacking with knives , shooting and saying , " this is retribution for what you have done , " according to an opposition activist in @entity19 , who is going by the name @entity81 to protect her identity
there were bodies in the streets around the @entity86 , a @entity87 refugee camp , and people were too afraid to collect them , @entity81 said
" the people are really scared , " she said , adding that mosques were blaring the messages " stay in your homes " and " @entity94 is great
" a @entity19 resident said shootings occurred in @entity97 , a major road that includes branch offices of state security agencies
in the neighborhood of @entity106 , where violence has raged in recent days , @entity49 fighters " launched their biggest attack yet all over @entity19 , in 17 points , " said @entity101 , a rebel fighter
they were working to " disperse the regime 's forces all over the capital , " he said
@entity10 , on the official @entity57 , said its armed forces " chased down terrorists who infiltrated " @entity106 , and " killed and arrested a large number of them
the military units also chased down terrorists who terrorized some families in the neighborhoods of @entity120 and @entity121 and forced them to leave their homes
" with the @entity10 government restricting foreign journalists from gaining access to the country , @entity0 can not independently confirm reports of violence or details about the attack
the bombing took place in a building in @entity134 , near @entity4 's home and the @entity137 embassy , which suspended its operations in february
security officials and government spies have had a heavy presence in the area
the bombing 's repercussions spread from the capital of @entity10 to the capital of @entity147 , where clashes erupted wednesday between the @entity147 police and hundreds of protesters outside the @entity10 embassy
some of them were chanting , " @entity153 , @entity153 , @entity4 ! " " we only wanted to remove the flag and replace it by the independence flag , but the @entity147 riot police started beating us so we pelted them with rocks , " said @entity154 , an organizer of the protest in @entity156
" next thing you know they fired an incredible amount of tear gas , several canisters landed on the @entity151 nearby
" he added , " we want people in @entity10 to see how we are supporting their cause here in @entity147
" most of the protesters were @entity147 , @entity175 , an @entity147 activist and web designer at the scene
@entity178 , a spokesman from the @entity179 , told @entity0 that 15 protesters were arrested
some suffered minor injuries , from excessive inhalation of tear gas to bruises
meanwhile , @entity137 president @entity187 called @entity189 president @entity188 on wednesday to discuss the @entity10 situation , the @entity186 said
" they noted the differences our governments have had on @entity10 , but agreed to have their teams continue to work toward a solution , " it said
a planned @entity201 vote on a draft resolution on @entity10 was delayed at the request of @entity204 , joint envoy to @entity10 for the @entity205 and the @entity206 , until 10 a.m. thursday , diplomats said
@entity204 , who met tuesday with @entity188 in @entity207 , earlier this year put forward a peace plan that has failed to stop the violence
western countries are pushing for a resolution that threatens sanctions against @entity4 's regime if government forces do n't stop attacks
that draft also calls for renewing the 300 - member @entity205 observer mission for 45 days
the observers ' work has been suspended because of violence
throughout @entity10 's 16 - month crisis , @entity189 has opposed any international effort that would blame , punish or change the leadership of the @entity10 government
@entity189 -- along with @entity225 -- has vetoed two previous draft resolutions in the @entity201 , leading to accusations that @entity189 is protecting the @entity10 regime
@entity189 , meanwhile , has put forth its own draft , which " strongly urges all parties in @entity10 to cease immediately all armed violence in all its forms
" the @entity189 draft also calls for renewing the @entity205 observer mission for three months
at the @entity205 , @entity236 ambassador @entity235 said wednesday 's events in @entity19 " underline as clearly as never before that the @entity201 now has to act
it has to send out a strong signal to the @entity10 regime to stop the use of heavy weapons
we want to give the @entity204 plan , which we all support in the council , some teeth -- and that 's why we should adopt a resolution with the sanctions threat
" in @entity250 , @entity8 , @entity249 said the situation in @entity10 is nearing an all - out civil war
" in other words , it 's getting very , very messy , " he said
" when you get full - out civil war , there is no coming back from the abyss
" next for @entity10 : showdown or stalemate ? the attack represents " a massive psychological blow to the regime " and will accelerate @entity4 's " demise , " predicted @entity265 , an analyst with @entity266 , a think tank that provides risk assessments on global business
it could suggest that " the regime itself is crumbling , " said @entity273 , an analyst with @entity274 , a think tank focusing on international affairs
events in @entity10 show " a real escalation in fighting , " said @entity137 defense secretary @entity279
it " tells us that this is a situation that is rapidly spinning out of control , and for that reason it 's extremely important that the international community , working with other countries that have concerns in that area , have to bring maximum pressure on @entity4 to do what 's right , and to step down and to allow for that peaceful transition , " @entity279 said
the @entity137 government announced wednesday a new round of sanctions against members of the @entity10 government
timeline : how the horror has unfolded @entity10 information minister @entity301 , speaking on state tv , vowed that those behind the attack will be held accountable
he insisted that those trying to divide the army are failing
" this army has not been divided , " he said
but increasing numbers of officials in the @entity10 military have defected in recent days
two brigadier generals fled overnight to @entity313 , bringing the number of @entity10 generals in @entity313 to 20 , a @entity311 official said
@entity29 , one of those killed wednesday , was a member of the country 's minority @entity317
who was named by the @entity321 in sanctions this year
@entity137 citizens were prohibited from engaging in transactions with him and other officials amid what the @entity137 government called @entity10 's " continued use of violence against its people
" in 2006 , the @entity321 named @entity332 -- then @entity10 's director of military intelligence -- in an executive order , freezing his assets and prohibiting @entity137 citizens from engaging in transactions with him
at the time , the @entity137 government called @entity332 " a key architect of @entity10 's domination of @entity339 , as well as a fundamental contributor to @entity10 's long - standing policy to foment terrorism against @entity343
" what we need to know about @entity10 days ago , @entity346 , the former @entity10 ambassador to @entity348 who has become the country 's highest - level diplomatic defector , told @entity0 that @entity332 had run an @entity351 in @entity348 training camp
a @entity137 official said @entity346 ' claim was " broadly consistent with our understanding " of the @entity10 regime 's cooperation with @entity351 " elements
" but the @entity10 regime has repeatedly denied involvement in terrorist activities -- and has blamed the violence of the past 16 months on " armed terrorist groups
" dark images of horror and despair smuggled out of @entity10 @entity10 's @entity351 boomerang since the crisis began in march 2011 , the @entity205 estimates , more than 10,000 people have been killed in the violence ; the opposition @entity23 estimates that more than 16,000 have died
defector : ' the battle for @entity19 is coming ' @entity0 's @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 and @entity380 and journalist @entity381 contributed to this report .
