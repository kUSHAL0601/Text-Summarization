@entity0 -- with no new video game consoles announced during the @entity4 , the talk this week has been about the myriad of gaming choices players are going to have
from titles with huge blockbuster potential to independent offerings , game designers have broadened their imaginations to bring exciting entertainment choices
yet , some of the most interesting games from @entity4 this year have an air of familiarity about them , like seeing an old friend again in a new way
' @entity20 ' from the makers of " @entity22 : combat @entity32 , " @entity23 introduces a universe where mankind is on the precipice of extinction and the players are the last hope of fending off a menace determined to end the human race
utilizing an open - world concept , " @entity20 " gives players the chance to explore a broken - down @entity36 with other players in single and cooperative missions
the game has some mmo elements built in , but the idea of exploring and charting your own course in a beautiful but deadly world is enticing
" @entity20 " is scheduled for release in september for the @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49
' evolve ' on its surface , " evolve " looks like a four - player cooperative game where the team seeks out and defeats fantastical monsters
the twist , however , is that boss monsters are also controlled by another player
this " 4 versus 1 " game mechanic encourages teamwork , planning and execution by the hunter players who try to kill the big baddie before they become the hunted
the player - character monsters are able to grow and evolve as the game progresses , giving them the opportunity to turn the tables on the other four
" @entity55 " is scheduled for release in october for the @entity47 , @entity49 and pc
' @entity72 : unity ' set in turbulent 18th - century @entity75 , players are once again thrust into the role of an assassin charged with stopping the @entity78 , an ancient order bent on controlling the world
the seventh main title in the franchise now offers cooperative play , enabling three others from the @entity85 to join in your fight
abilities and missions appear similar to past games , but the element of cooperative play creates the need for teamwork , strategy and some really cool moments
the group is still likely to be outnumbered in many of the quests , yet their unique abilities should get them through to the goal
" @entity72 : unity " is scheduled for release in october for the @entity47 , @entity49 and pc
' @entity22 : the master chief collection ' in preparation for the release of a new " @entity22 " title next year , @entity105 is giving players a chance to relive or discover for the first time the genesis of one of the most iconic characters for the @entity115 , the space marine known only as " master chief
" " @entity22 : the master chief collection " puts all four major " @entity117 " games together , remastered and playable in a seamless way to experience the franchise as one very long adventure
while the older games ' graphics have been updated , there is also the option to enjoy theme the way they were originally designed
that includes some of the unintentional bugs that players found and used to their advantage
the collection is jammed with maps , multiplayer options and iconic weapons , all aimed toward the " @entity22 : @entity140 " title coming in 2015
" @entity22 : the master chief collection " is scheduled for release in november exclusively for the @entity49
' @entity142 ' a universe full of whimsy and imagination
fantastical creatures of all shapes , sizes and abilities
levels created by the brain power of millions of people around the world
oh , and now you have friends
@entity156 is back in " @entity142 " from a new developer , @entity158 , and he 's brought some help to solve new challenging levels
@entity161 , @entity162 and swoop help as the well - known stuffed yarn boy makes his way through new multiplayer action spanning all 8.7 million user - generated levels in the @entity156 universe
" @entity142 " is scheduled for release this november exclusively for the @entity47
' @entity170 ' this entry from independent game company @entity172 puts players in a vast universe that game designers themselves have described as infinite
huge beautiful worlds , where dinosaurs exist alongside modern technology , are at the player 's fingertips to explore
this science - fiction story is designed so that no two players will have the same experience even though they will be in the same universe
every player starts on a different planet , making the potential unique gameplay nearly endless
" @entity170 " does not have an announced release date , but it is exclusive to the @entity47 at launch , with @entity115 and pc coming later
. ' @entity192 ' from the fantastic to the hilarious , " @entity192 " lets you become a transformative squid , shooting ink and battling in 4 versus 4 territorial combat
the idea is to cover the battlefield in your team 's color while the opposing team tries to do the same
switching from an ink - shooting person to a squid creature , players can quickly travel in the ink of their team to reach destinations quickly
it is competitive , but in a friendly way , as players race the clock toward victory
" @entity192 " will be available in 2015 for the @entity213 ' @entity214 ' @entity215 joins an all - star cast in the new competitive fighting game , " @entity214 " like others in the series , players can choose from iconic video game characters to do battle in 4 versus 4 action
two versions of the game are planned for release , one for the @entity213 and one for the handheld @entity228 console
there are exclusive features for each , but the addition of new characters and @entity235 fighters ( @entity237 avatars that represent the player themselves ) should give fans and newcomers many hours of entertainment
the @entity228 version is schedule for release in october , while the @entity213 version will come out during the 2014 holiday season
' @entity246 : @entity247 ' @entity248 returns to gaming consoles and has a new tool in his war on crime in @entity254
a revamped and upgraded @entity255 offers players new ways to take down bad guys , travel the city and generally strike a new kind of fear in the hearts of criminals
more than just a means of transportation , the @entity255 feels like a separate character helping @entity246 during hand - to - hand combat , taking on larger opponents or acting as a distraction to allow the @entity246 access to new areas
while still perpetually dark , @entity254 looks more inviting this time around and opens up new gameplay choices and style options as the adventure progresses
" @entity246 : @entity247 " is scheduled for release in 2015 for the @entity47 , @entity49 and pc
