they 're a relatively small group of parents in a big country
but their decision not to vaccinate their children can have a profound impact on public health
opponents of vaccines against diseases like measles are simply on the " wrong side , " @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity7 says
just how many people are we talking about , and what do we know about them as a group ? here 's a look at some key numbers
according to the @entity20 , in the @entity19 : 95 % of children in kindergarten have had vaccines for preventable diseases , including two doses of the measles , mumps , and rubella ( @entity30 ) vaccine
but that figure is not spread evenly across the country
82 % of children in @entity34 have had the two - dose mmr vaccine that doctors say is necessary
in @entity38 , virtually all children in kindergarten ( 99.7 % ) are vaccinated
26 states have not reported meeting a government target of 95 % coverage for @entity30
the differences stem from varying laws over when exemptions are allowed
the @entity46 reports : 48 states and the @entity48 allow religious exemptions from vaccines 20 states allow philosophical exemptions
even within states that have high exemption rates , " vaccination exemptions have been shown to cluster geographically , so vaccine - preventable disease outbreaks can still occur where unvaccinated persons cluster in schools and communities , " the @entity20 says
because of health complications , some children should not be vaccinated , doctors say
these children are also one of the biggest reasons vaccination is so important
those unvaccinated can carry the disease and infect vulnerable children
families with medical exemptions make up a small portion of those who do n't vaccinate
the @entity20 reports : in @entity76 , there were about 1,000 medical exemptions in the 2013 - 2014 school year , and more than 17,000 philosophical exemptions
@entity79 had less than 800 medical exemptions and about 4,000 religious exemptions
@entity79 does not allow philosophical exemptions
@entity38 and @entity83 do not allow religious or philosophical exemptions , and they reported only about 50 medical exemptions combined
( see a full state - by - state breakdown here
) why do some parents opt out ? they 're more likely to have vaccine safety concerns and to " perceive fewer benefits associated with vaccines , " a study found -- despite the scientific evidence and debunking of a study that suggested vaccines could trigger autism
most of these parents do believe vaccines are necessary to protect the health of their children
but many also believe their children could suffer from the vaccines themselves
the study was published by @entity101 , the official journal of the @entity103 , in 2011
it found that among parents who delay and refuse vaccines : 70 % say they believe the vaccines are necessary to protect the health of their children ( compared with 96 % of parents who vaccinate ) 63 % say they fear their children could have serious side effects ( compared with 31 % of parents who vaccinate )
57 % say they have concerns about autism
78 % say they believe children get too many shots
there 's also more mistrust of the medical community among those who do n't vaccinate
while 95 % of parents who vaccinate said medical professionals in charge of vaccinations have their children 's best interest at heart , 77 % of parents who delayed and refused vaccines agreed
the @entity101 study also found that families of unvaccinated kids are more likely to be : wealthier on average , with annual incomes more than four times the poverty level non-hispanic white married couples in @entity140 - speaking households educated , with college degrees , and covered by private health insurance
in the medical community , conversations are underway about how to reach out to these parents
" there 's not much we can do about the small core of people who oppose vaccines based on ideology , " @entity146 , a brain injury doctor in @entity148 , wrote in a @entity0 column
" ... but we have a better shot with the larger and more rational border zone of the vaccine hesitant who may base their concerns on genuine cases of vaccine harm , such as the very small but accepted link between influenza vaccination and a temporary paralysis called @entity165
" cultivating " a strong patient - doctor relationship is the most successful method of reversing vaccine opposition , " he wrote
that means carving out a system in which " your doctor is granted the time to truly understand you , while at the same time allowing your doctor to treat you appropriately
... if we 've done our job right , you 'll seek out the insights we 've earned from treating many challenging cases over many years
and we 'll know we 've succeeded in our new relationship when you let us vaccinate your children
" what is your message to those who do n't vaccinate ?
