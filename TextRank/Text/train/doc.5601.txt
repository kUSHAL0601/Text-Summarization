-- a @entity2 candidate running for @entity3 says his past donning of a @entity6 outfit was part of a historical lesson -- and defended his background in military re-enactments
@entity11 , a @entity12 favorite running for election in @entity15 's @entity14 , explained his position during an interview on @entity0 's " @entity18 " monday night
@entity11 participated in @entity20 re-enactments for several years in the past decade and created a @entity22 alter ego
he has said he started participating in the events as a way to bond with his son
@entity11 has also participated in @entity26 and @entity27 re-enactments
" the whole purpose of historical re-enacting is to educate people one - on - one , " @entity11 said
" and that is done by going out and participating in re-enactments
" when asked whether he thought the men being impersonated were " valiant men , " @entity11 said , " i do n't think we can sit here and judge that today
we were not there the time they made those decisions
were there bad people ? absolutely
were there atrocities committed ? absolutely there were
there are people that want to deny the holocaust ever happened in this country and around the world
" the website for @entity11 's re-enactment group -- which impersonates members of the 5th @entity56 , @entity57 -- does not mention the @entity50 directly
according to @entity57 's website , it is a nonprofit group with a " common interest in the @entity22 side of the war and want to tell the story of the average combat soldier of the @entity22 military
" " racism or any type of embracement of @entity6 ideology of any kind is strictly prohibited by this re-enactment unit , " the website reads
but the website does not mention what historians have said about the division -- that the group was involved in war crimes and atrocities , including the death marches and massacres of @entity82 in the spring of 1945
when asked if @entity11 knew of the atrocities associated with the @entity56 , the candidate replied , " what happened in @entity22 during the second @entity20 is absolutely one of the low points in human history
in fact ... [ the website ] talks about what happened and that we do n't support that
we do n't support the political or the ideological motives of that time
we 're talking strictly about the history
it 's important for us to remember that history
" @entity11 's political opponents were quick to condemn him as a " @entity6 enthusiast
" " it 's an unbelievably disturbing story here about this @entity6 enthusiast , " @entity102 , national press secretary for the @entity103 , has said
@entity0 's @entity106 contributed to this report
