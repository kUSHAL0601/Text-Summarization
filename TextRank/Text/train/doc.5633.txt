-- a few weeks ago col. @entity1 , a @entity2 officer stationed in @entity3 , fell victim to a particularly modern hazard of war : @entity8 fatigue
col. @entity1 was fired from his post at @entity12 's @entity11 after he wrote an essay for the @entity15 wire service in which he voiced his frustration about @entity8 - obsessed officers who spend more time worrying about font size and bullet points than actual bullets
col. @entity1 's was just the latest in a series of complaints about the military use of slide presentations -- you may recall public ridicule of the famously incomprehensible " spaghetti slide , " and a recent @entity29 article , that cited other officers just as frustrated with the emergence of the military bureaucracy 's " powerpoint rangers
" but @entity8 is n't inherently bad -- just misunderstood
and bad @entity8 presentations are n't just a concern of the military
we 've all sat through presentations -- or suffered or even dozed through them
the truth is , most are poorly constructed and instantly forgettable
why does this matter ? because presentations decide elections , military strategies and multibillion - dollar business deals ; they educate our children and they spread the ideas that shape society 's most important goals and directives
ultimately , a presentation succeeds or fails on the strength of its message and how well it 's told
and those elements have nothing to do with the brand of the software package involved in its production
you know instantly when you 're watching a great presenter at work -- you may even own the @entity65 to prove it
sometimes , presenters try to punch up weak content with stunts
i remember one speaker who rode onto the stage on a motorcycle -- and promptly lost control and crashed
) another presenter rappelled down to the stage like a mountain climber
i remember the stunts , but not the messages
poor presentations can have disastrous consequences
@entity80 , perhaps the most important writer on the display of information , demonstrated how the disintegration of the space shuttle @entity85 in 2003 might have been averted by a more objective presentation of the damage inflicted on @entity85 's wing by a piece of foam debris during takeoff
as it was , @entity80 wrote in his article , " @entity94 : assessing the @entity106 and @entity107 , " @entity96 officials came away from @entity8 - driven briefings by @entity99 engineers with an overly optimistic view of the situation , in part as a result of hard - to - understand slides overloaded with bullet points
in other words , a bad presentation may have caused that disaster , and a good one might have prevented it
of course , we ca n't be naive : a persuasive presentation is n't necessarily a good presentation
in 2001 , @entity115 executives @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 presented @entity8 slides at an employee meeting that winningly depicted the company 's robust health and the bright future of its projected earnings
by the end of that year the company was worthless
eventually , the @entity127 @entity126 charged those executives with 10 counts of a variety of crimes -- based on their presentations
meanwhile , the @entity115 scandal may have been preventable by the right presentation
in 1999 , a presentation by the @entity136 accounting firm feebly warned the @entity138 's audit committee of the company 's sketchy accounting
had that presentation sounded a bold warning , the audit committee might have been able to save the company
for that matter , it might have saved @entity147 , which did not recover from its role in @entity115 's dealings
unfortunately , the development of presentations is a skill that is rarely taught and for which few sources of best practices exist
bad presentations kill ideas , waste money and impede progress
great ones illuminate , persuade , generate consensus and spark action
how do you create a great presentation ? i 've been in the business for 20 years , but until recently even i could n't define the deep structures and elements of truly superior presentations
my research into this question led me in unexpected directions
the answers i found had nothing to do with technology or the internet ; they were revealed in screenwriting , @entity180 and @entity181 drama , mythology and literature
great presenters employ the basic narrative techniques used throughout history to connect with audiences and move them to action and new understanding
the presentations that work are not the ones with the most data or the most elaborate charts and graphs ; the winners are those with the most compelling and convincing narratives
we 're a distracted , multi-tasking society
so presentations need to lure and re-lure an audience simply to keep their attention
audiences are looking at the clock or fiddling with their handheld devices throughout a presentation
you do n't connect with your audience by throwing information at them -- you do it by taking them on a journey toward your perspective
whether you 're a ceo , a salesperson , a general or a biochemist , you must understand how to connect with an audience , how to construct a powerful narrative argument , and how to visually display information for maximum audience comprehension
i read recently that our nation is suffering a crisis of literacy , with only 35 % percent of high school seniors able to read proficiently
yes , you read that correctly ( assuming you 're not part of the 65 % of high school seniors
) but literacy really means the ability to communicate effectively
for professionals and citizens in every strata of society , true literacy now includes the ability to communicate effectively through presentations
the stakes could not be higher for our country
if corporate executives communicate poorly , businesses and the economy suffer , and jobs are lost
if teachers communicate poorly , our children do n't learn and advance
if generals communicate poorly , our troops and their missions are put at risk
these are dangers we can not ignore
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253 .
