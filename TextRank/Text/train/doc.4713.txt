@entity0 , @entity1 -- donating to charity itself is a relatively new phenomenon in a society that traditionally values family units
president @entity8 is criticized by opposition parties who say he supports policies that favor the rich
so the announcement that @entity1 president @entity8 will be donating $ 26 million , the bulk of his wealth , to charity , is considered highly unusual
the president 's office said the money will be used to set up a new youth scholarship program
" my fortune , which i accumulated through hard work during my life , is very precious to me , " said @entity8 in a statement
" i have long thought that it would be good if my wealth was spent for society in a valuable way
" @entity8 , who came to office last february , promised to donate his personal wealth to society in late 2007 when he was accused of amassing his fortune through illegal means
he was since been cleared of all charges
but he is now facing criticism from opposition parties who say he supports policies that favor the rich
@entity8 is a former ceo of @entity40 and the @entity0 mayor
but he emphasizes his impoverished beginnings , as a poor young man who had to earn his college tuition cleaning streets
" looking back , i realize that all of those who helped me were poor , " said @entity8 in the statement
" i know that the best way for me to pay back such kindness is to give back to society what i earned
" analysts say this move will hopefully encourage many others to follow .
