@entity0 , @entity1 -- a top @entity1 official has a stern warning for those who criticize president @entity6 on social networks : he 's watching what they say , and taking names
" i am always going online , and i am writing down the first and last names of the people who insult him on @entity17 and @entity18 , " vice president @entity11 said in remarks widely reported in @entity1 media this week

more on free speech : @entity33 top court restrains cyberlaw constructive criticism is fine , said @entity35 , a congressman from the president 's party
but officials have seen something more nefarious , he said
" we are very worried because this is a case of systematically using communications mechanisms to plant hatred against the government , to harm the image of our president , " @entity35 said
@entity1 opposition leaders have a different take
they say such comments show the government 's authoritarian aim to censor social networks
" obviously on social networks one can not expect everyone to be praised
the opposition also receives insults from public officials , criticisms with no meaning , attacks , and it would never occur to us to block social networks , " said @entity55 , who heads the opposition @entity56
" that 's why we 've recommended to the vice president that he gets an account , that he interacts ( with people )
he will learn a lot more about young people , and surely not everyone will applaud him , but some will agree with him

" where is freedom of expression ? " others , like @entity96 , noted that the tone of discourse had gotten out of hand

there are about 1.7 million @entity17 users nationwide , he said
that means government officials , he said , should see social media as an opportunity government can join , rather than a threat

" " it is a device that can be used to deepen democracy , " he said .
