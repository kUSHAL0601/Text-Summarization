@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 competition officials have formally cleared the global tie - up between @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity8 's @entity7 as well as giving a green light to the merger between @entity5 and @entity7 , saying it would not significantly impede competition in @entity13
the moves were welcome by @entity15 , chief executive of @entity5
the global alliance still needs a final green light from the @entity19 authorities , but mr @entity15 said that the @entity21 approval was an " important and vital step forward "
" the high number of new services on @entity25 to @entity19 routes since the open skies agreement demonstrates that @entity28 is open
between us , we have agreed to make available @entity28 slot pairs for our competitors to use on services to the @entity19
this is a pragmatic decision , so that we can get the joint business up and running as soon as possible
the slot commitments provide a further guarantee that there will be no possible loss of competition as a result of our joint business " , he said
the move comes after more than a year of analysis
the @entity46 first announced that it was looking at the alliance in april last year , along with the rival @entity48 , which includes @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51
at the time , the commission said that the level of co-operation envisaged between @entity5 , @entity19 and @entity7 appeared to be more extensive than among the alliance members generally -- and stretched to joint management of schedules , capacity and pricing on transatlantic routes , as well as revenue - sharing on these routes
officials were anxious to find out whether the co-operation would generate offsetting consumer benefits
but in february , officials in @entity0 started consulting on concessions the three carriers offered to address potential anti-competitive implications of the deal , and in march put these out for public comment -- a move that signalled likely eventual approval for the deal
under the concessions offered by the airlines , seven daily slot pairs will be made available to other carriers
these will comprise three on the @entity25 - @entity80 route , two on @entity81 and one on each of @entity84 and @entity25 - @entity85
this will allow one or more competitors to operate a total of 49 return flights between @entity25 and the four @entity19 destinations a week
on the @entity25 - @entity80 pair , the carriers will also provide the competing carrier with slots at @entity80 's @entity95
in addition , the three airlines will provide access to their frequent - flyer programmes on the relevant routes ; allow the combining of fares , so that competitors can carry passengers one way on their own planes and back on the alliance 's flights ; and conclude special pro-rate agreements , making it easier for a passenger to connect from the alliance 's short - haul @entity13 flights to a competitor 's transatlantic flight
the commitments , which are legally binding , will run for 10 years .
