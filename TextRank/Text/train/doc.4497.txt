-- accompanied by unusually cold temperatures , snow fell late saturday from @entity3 east to @entity4 , prompting a series of warnings but few major headaches
one major storm system affected communities from @entity10 , @entity11 , to @entity12 , @entity13 , as many residents spent the first part of their weekend dealing with the first significant snow of the season
throughout the @entity18 , temperatures averaged about 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal , with freeze watches in effect as far south as @entity21
by 7:15 p.m. , just over 5 inches of snow had fallen at @entity10 's @entity23 , breaking the 1964 record for december 4 of 4.6 inches
a winter weather advisory remained in effect in the @entity10 through midnight
more than 300 flights were canceled in and out of @entity10 saturday morning , the @entity10 @entity26 said
the situation improved gradually over the course of the day , though @entity23 was still experiencing ground traffic delays -- for the planes that touch down , but are slower getting to their gates -- ranging from 16 to 30 minutes by early evening
the timing of the storm -- coming after the friday evening rush hour , with most snow falling while people slept -- and the fact snow did n't stick to most major roads helped keep auto accidents minimal
" it 's @entity10 , it 's great , " resident @entity42 told @entity0 affiliate @entity43
" i 've got no qualms about ( the snow ) at all
" the @entity47 issued a winter storm warning through 7 a.m. et sunday for @entity50 regions of northwest @entity13 , southwest @entity4 and southeast @entity51
while the accumulating snow was expected to be fairly minor , forecasters warned of icy roads and winds gusting as strong as 45 mph
in addition , expected light snow prompted the agency to issue a winter weather advisory -- effective until 1 a.m. et -- for parts of southern and central @entity4 as well as northeast @entity13
residents of southern and eastern @entity3 and @entity62 already saw considerable snow
a foot fell in @entity65 , @entity3 , about double that in @entity67 some 60 miles to the east , according to the @entity47
@entity69 , @entity62 , got between 3 and 5 inches of snow saturday , and some snow also fell in the southwest @entity73 city of @entity74
@entity75 also was in the storm 's path
the @entity47 reported 3 inches had fallen and it predicted flurries in the city through tuesday
the most snow in @entity81 -- 7 inches -- accumulated 70 miles to the west in @entity83
other cities in @entity81 and @entity85 are expected to be hit hard by snow in the coming days
five to 10 inches of lake - effect snow were forecast for @entity88 , @entity81 , located about 50 miles southeast of @entity10 , with @entity89 , @entity81 , also feeling the storm 's effect
other more eastern communities along @entity93 -- such as @entity94 , @entity81 , and @entity95 and @entity96 across the border in @entity93 -- may get as much as 20 inches of snow by daybreak tuesday
the @entity47 has issued a warning for lake - effect snow for many of these areas from 8 p.m. saturday through 6 a.m. tuesday , predicting snow might fall at a rate of 1 to 3 inches an hour
earlier this week , the @entity107 , @entity108 , area , was being buried by such sustained lake - effect snow
that wednesday through friday storm dumped up to 3 feet of snow in a narrow band centered in @entity113 -- though locations as little as 12 miles away only got 6 to 12 inches , if not less
forecasters are also predicting more snow this week in the region .
