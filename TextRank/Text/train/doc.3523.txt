@entity0 , @entity1 -- a skydiver 's historic free - fall from the stratosphere was called off tuesday due to wind gusts that ruined the helium balloon set to hoist him to high altitude for the record - breaking attempt
another attempt is not expected before thursday due to weather conditions
@entity13 is aiming to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet ( about 23 miles ) , more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner -- with nothing but a space suit , helmet and parachute
he also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier in such a dive
at that altitude , the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds , he is expected to be free - falling faster than 690 miles an hour
organizers initially delayed the balloon launch tuesday morning because of gusting winds , then tried to make it happen a few hours later at the @entity0 launch site
however , as @entity13 waited in the capsule to be carried up to high altitude , another wind gust whipped the more than 500 - foot - tall white balloon and ruined it for the mission
@entity38 , the technical project director for the mission , said only one back - up balloon is now available to carry out the attempt
" there 's a lot riding on that , so the main thing for us is making sure the probability is very high , " @entity38 said
asked how he felt about having to call off the attempt , @entity38 replied : " deflated
" " for @entity13 , it 's a lot of frustration , " @entity38 added
" a lot of anticipation getting to this point , and then feeling that he 's going to have to wait -- it 's a lot of anxiety on his part , i 'm sure
" ' human helicopter ' breaks record for world 's longest flight years of preparation and untold costs to the primary sponsor , @entity65 , led to tuesday 's scheduled attempt
when the launch occurs , @entity13 expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent in a capsule hanging from the helium balloon
then he will climb out of the capsule , jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched " delta " position to maximize his speed
he plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes , then deploy a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to @entity77
the attempt has serious risks
he and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous " horizontal spin
" at temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero @entity84 or lower , and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected , his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit
if he loses consciousness during the five - minute plunge , he will survive only if his parachute deploys automatically
another unknown : the effects on the body of breaking the sound barrier
while reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft , planners for this jump believe there will be little effect on @entity13 because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air that shock waves are barely transmitted
" i 'm not nuts , " @entity13 said when @entity2 first interviewed him about the project in 2010
" you know , our records are meant to be broken , and i 'm a very competitive person
" on a more serious note , he added , " of course i 'm afraid of dying , because i worked so hard to reach this level
you know , i 'm living a good life
i think the most important thing i 'm doing is to come back alive
" @entity13 is an @entity117 helicopter pilot and former soldier who has @entity119 jumped from such landmarks as the @entity121 in @entity122 and the @entity124 statue in @entity125
@entity119 is an acronym for buildings , antennas , spans and @entity77 -- the four things from which you can jump
he has been preparing for his latest feat for five years -- both physically and mentally
" you have to remember all the procedures , " he said in an interview during testing for the jump
" you know you 're in a really hostile environment
and you can not think about anything else
you have to be focused
otherwise , you 're gon na die
" the balloon being used is light and translucent
the material is only .0008 of an inch thick , and it will change shape and size as it rises
the pressurized helmet and suit , which restrict @entity13 's mobility and together weigh 100 pounds , have been equipped with sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate
cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt
@entity13 was not doing interviews leading up to the jump , but his performance coach , @entity161 , described him as mentally well - prepared
" he knows that he 's rehearsed it and knows what to do , " @entity161 said sunday
" we want him in the right state of mind
we ask him to reflect on what he 's done , what he 's been through and what he 's achieving for himself personally , so he can relax and focus
" the record for such a jump is currently held by col. @entity171 , who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a @entity175 @entity174 mission
more than 50 years later , @entity171 is a consultant and mentor for @entity13 's effort
@entity171 has also been giving @entity13 advice on what to expect
for example , he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air : " there 's no way you can tell how fast you 're going , because there 's no visual cues
" @entity171 rejects any suggestion that he is jealous that @entity13 is poised to beat his record
" oh no. i 'm delighted , " he told @entity2 recently
" he 's advancing science , and he 'll do a great job
