" probably the start anyone would dream of on that front nine , " said @entity1 , who once shot a round of 57 at a course near his birthplace of @entity26 , @entity7
" i made everything , so you get those days where you just look at a putt and you hole it
" @entity33 rookie @entity32 wins @entity35 wildcard one of those nine birdies included a 42 - footer on the eighth as the @entity39 runner - up secured a tournament - record 29 on the front nine at @entity41
" i 've put myself in great spots this year , had a good chance at @entity44 , had a good chance at @entity46 , a few other tournaments , @entity48 earlier , " added @entity1 , referring to how close he has come to winning in the @entity10 " i 'm just going to keep on doing what i 'm doing
the more i 'm in the position on the back nine on sunday , or in this case on a monday , then it 's going to happen sooner or later
@entity55 's playing partner @entity20 , who had led by one stroke at the start of sunday , had nothing but praise for the @entity7 's round
