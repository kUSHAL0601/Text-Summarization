sweet family film based on a true story
it 's no spoiler to say that there is a happy ending , partly because this is the kind of constantly uplifting heart - warmer in which even the villains are congenial , but also because the injured animal is played by its real - life counterpart
@entity16 also plays a version of himself as a kindly wise man whose expertise in prosthetics helps save @entity2
while the plot occasionally feels like " @entity23 " without the drama , it 's a cute story if you do n't mind temporarily trading in your cynicism for a bag of popcorn
