-- if word had leaked out , @entity1 would have been killed
that 's what @entity5 administration officials told senators at a classified briefing wednesday in defense of the decision to not notify @entity11 about the deal to free the captured @entity14 sergeant in exchange for releasing five @entity17 figures held at @entity18
the question of what legislators should have known and when has helped propel a broader controversy over whether bringing home a soldier accused by comrades of deserting his unit was worth releasing the alleged terrorist leaders
under fire from conservative @entity30 for making the deal , as well as politicians from both parties for not notifying @entity11 as required by the @entity34 , the @entity28 has argued president @entity5 had the legal authority and moral high ground to do both
" i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get a young man back to his parents , " @entity5 told reporters thursday at the end of the @entity41 summit in @entity42
" ... we had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated and ... we saw an opportunity and we seized it , and i make no apologies for that
" asked whether he was surprised at the backlash , @entity5 said " i 'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in @entity61 , " and he reiterated what he called a time - honored @entity57 principle that " we do not leave anybody wearing the @entity57 uniform behind
" " ... we do n't condition whether we make the effort to get them back
" ' dead silence ' meanwhile , the administration made sure word got out of the threat to @entity1 's life if any information on the swap went public ahead of time
sen. @entity73 of @entity74 , an independent who caucuses with @entity75 , told @entity0 that administration briefers made clear both the threat to @entity1 from a leak and that he could talk about it
" they had intelligence that , had even the fact of these discussions leaked out , there was a reasonable chance @entity1 would have been killed , " @entity73 said
" and that was one of the pieces of information that we learned yesterday that gave it some credence in terms of why it had to be kept quiet so long
" a @entity95 aide took that further , telling @entity0 on condition of not being identified that senators were told in wednesday 's classified briefing that the @entity57 had credible information that leaked word of the deal meant death for @entity1
the new details enhanced the perception of a @entity28 scrambling to respond to congressional anger over the exchange announced saturday in a @entity108 ceremony at the @entity28 with @entity5 and @entity1 's parents
as part of the classified briefing , senators were shown the so - called proof of life video of @entity1 , which the administration has said shows the soldier in deteriorating health
" he could barely talk
he could n't focus his eyes , " @entity73 said , adding the video had an effect on the room full of senators
sen. @entity124 , @entity125 , was among those who saw the video
" i think he looked a little strange to me
it was hard to tell
he was up close , " he told @entity0
" i do n't expect anybody who 's being held in prison to look like they 're in great shape , to tell you the truth
" other senators who saw the video at wednesday 's classified briefing said @entity1 looked drugged , not sick
but @entity73 noted " there was a dead silence in the room " after it played
@entity1 ' life ' video shown , senators still skeptical @entity146 too high for critics conservative critics call the price for @entity1 's release too high , noting that his @entity14 colleagues say he deserted his post in @entity153
the @entity5 administration and @entity75 supporters have pushed back , saying @entity1 's life was under threat in captivity
an @entity14 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after @entity1 's 2009 disappearance concluded that he left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a @entity57 military official briefed on the report
the official spoke to @entity0 on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information there was no definitive finding that @entity1 deserted , because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity14 officials could n't do without talking to the soldier
some soldiers involved in operations to find @entity1 have said at least six soldiers were killed searching for him
but a @entity57 official told @entity0 that @entity181 and @entity14 officials have looked at the claims , and " right now there is no evidence to back that up
" at the same time , defense secretary @entity186 told reporters that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find @entity1
still , former army staff sgt. @entity193 , @entity1 's former squad leader , told @entity0 's " @entity196 " that he believes @entity1 is at least partly to blame for the soldiers ' deaths
" i ca n't really say i blame @entity1 to fullest extent , but if he would n't have deserted us , these soldiers very well could have been in a different place at a different time , " he said
@entity193 also said he heard radio intercepts that an @entity57 " was running around looking for people to speak @entity203 and wanted to seek out the @entity17
" the accusations of @entity1 's desertion caused some @entity30 legislators to question whether the @entity57 should have exchanged @entity17 terror suspects for him
" it 's very interesting to me that they would be willing to release five extraordinarily dangerous @entity17 members in exchange for this soldier who apparently left his post , " @entity208 sen. @entity208 of @entity74 told @entity0 on thursday
@entity1 's showing sign of improvement @entity1 is resting and showing signs of improvement as he recovers at @entity219 in @entity220 , according to @entity181 spokesman col. @entity221
while @entity1 is conversing in @entity203 and is described as being more engaged in treatment , he has not yet spoken to his parents , @entity221 said
in @entity61 , the back - and - forth over the @entity1 release took on increasingly political overtones , with @entity30 who once called for getting him out saying the swap released hardened @entity17 commanders who could attack @entity57 forces and interests
consideration of such a deal dates back several years but failed to gain traction when the possibility first emerged in 2011 , according to sources
@entity1 backlash surprises @entity28 a @entity181 official familiar with the thinking of @entity238 told @entity0 that @entity5 's first defense secretary opposed the idea back then , as did his successor , @entity242 , and former secretary of state @entity243
with combat operations in @entity153 set to end no later than december , the @entity57 thinking changed
the imminent conclusion of hostilities raises issues about the status of war captives , with adversaries traditionally exchanging prisoners
@entity73 noted that the @entity17 figures involved in the swap may have been freed soon in any event
end of war was a factor " there is a reasonable legal argument that these five guys would have had to be released any way within the next year under the law of war , " he said
" they were being held in @entity18 as enemy combatants
under the law of war , when hostility cease , enemy combatants have to be released
" according to @entity73 , " this may have been the last chance to get @entity1 where these guys had true value to us as a negotiating tool because if they had to be released anyway , we 'd be in the same situation without @entity1 home
" at the same time , @entity73 said the @entity5 administration erred by failing to notify @entity11 ahead of time about the swap
" there could have been notification that would have been somewhat more secure than a widespread notification to @entity11
i think that 's where there were mistakes made , " @entity73 said
@entity288 's journey to save his son the @entity18 detainees swapped for @entity1 : who are they ? @entity292 and @entity293 reported and wrote from @entity61 , and @entity294 reported and wrote from @entity295
@entity0 's @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity292 contributed to this report .
