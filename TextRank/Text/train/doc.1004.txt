@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the @entity1 opposition leader and symbol of anti-government fervor , lashed out against @entity1 authorities on tuesday , saying remnants of the " tyranny " and " dictatorship " that prevailed under the toppled @entity10 of @entity1 's regime persist today
" in the early years of the @entity13 , most people were convinced that the structure of the revolution would destroy the past political situation of tyranny and dictatorship , and i was one of them who believed that , " said @entity3 , a former prime minister
but now , he said , he no longer believes that
" the current political situation in @entity1 indicates the presence of the remaining roots of tyranny and dictatorship of the @entity10 , " whose regime was overthrown in 1979 and replaced by an @entity29 republic led by @entity30
" i do n't believe that the revolution achieved its goals , " said @entity3 , speaking out forcefully as the tensions over @entity1 politics continue
the regime is marking the anniversary of the shah 's overthrow with a series of events that began this week and culminate on february 11
@entity3 and @entity41 , another @entity1 opposition leader , have urged supporters to demonstrate
those celebrations coincide with @entity1 trials and executions of street protesters who demonstrate against the june 12 presidential election victory of incumbent @entity48
in the final results @entity48 was declared the winner over @entity3 , a result seen by many @entity1 as questionable or rigged
the initial protests broke out last summer and have persisted
in late december , at least seven people were killed and hundreds arrested , witnesses said , as they took to the streets on @entity57 , a @entity29 holy day which occurred on december 27
@entity3 's nephew was among those killed during those protests
the @entity1 government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence
police have arrested 4,000 people in the post-election crackdown
@entity3 , who made his web site comments in a question and answer format , said an @entity1 government that reflects " dictatorship in the name of religion is the worst kind " and he added he has lost hope " that the revolution had removed all those structures which could lead to totalitarianism and dictatorship
" " the most evident manifestation of a continued tyrannical attitude is the abuse of parliament and judiciary
we have completely lost hope in the judiciary , " he said
" stifling the media , filling the prisons and brutally killing people who peacefully demand their rights in the streets indicate the roots of tyranny and dictatorship remain from the monarchist era
" the semi-official @entity101 news agency reported tuesday that @entity1 will soon execute nine more people in connection with the country 's post-election riots
the nine are among 11 who were sentenced to death by @entity0 's @entity109 last month
@entity1 vows to execute protesters two were hanged last week , and a senior judiciary official was quoted as saying " the two people who were executed as well as the other nine who will soon be executed had certainly been arrested during the recent riots
" each had belonged to an anti-revolutionary group , had aspired to sow dissent and to uproot the regime , " the official said
@entity3 also praised the grass - roots @entity121 opposition movement
but he said while protesters should vent their opinions , they should follow law and not overstep legal bounds
any law - breaking would hurt the reform movement , he said
" the ultimate goal is to move toward an independent , free and united @entity1
women and men of all cultures , classes and ideas should have opportunities , " he said
" the green movement stands for human dignity , open ideas , diversity and freedom of expression
" @entity3 has n't been arrested since the protests began , but he is facing the wrath of an establishment targeting reformers like him
at the same time the regime is risking even further civil unrest if it takes him into custody
recently , @entity1 's parliament asked authorities to arrest " the main instigators and directors " of violent anti-government protests , the state - run @entity149 reported wednesday , the same day massive pro-government rallies were held in @entity0 and other cities
legislator @entity158 named three people he said " must be arrested " -- @entity3 , @entity41 , and @entity160 , daughter of the former reformist president , ayatollah @entity161
" they must not remain on the sidelines and be safe , " @entity158 said
" those who issue statements and invite people to create chaos in the streets and attack one another must be dealt with according to @entity29 laws
" pro-government crowds demonstrating in @entity0 have chanted " @entity172 , " " @entity173 to @entity174 , " and " death to @entity3
" noting the pressure and threats in the highly - charged political environment , @entity3 has said on his @entity180 page that he is ready for " martyrdom
" @entity2 's @entity182 contributed to this report .
