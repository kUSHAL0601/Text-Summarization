at approximately 3,350 meters , it 's @entity1 's highest and most active volcano
living up to its volatile reputation , @entity2 blew its top again over the weekend
@entity2 eruptions are relatively frequent -- the past 12 months have seen a string of powerful lava fountains , flows and ash emissions
the result : a landscape that constantly changes as lava hardens , craters collapse and , in some cases , are created
a trip to the top section of @entity2 is a bizarre experience -- from near the stunning peak it 's easy to understand why the volcano is one of @entity23 's most popular tourist destinations
more : 10 things to know before visiting @entity23 it 's tricky to line up a visit when the volcano is spewing fury like an angry goddess ( @entity29 , or @entity30 , was the @entity32 goddess of the volcano ) , so most @entity2 tourists end up with the saner , sober version
the images in the gallery above are from one such lava-less visit
yet even on calm days , the @entity2 landscape is otherworldly -- it only takes a bit of imagination to picture @entity41 stumbling about with his tricorder looking for life
bleak yet stunning with black lava sand , volcanic gravel and rocks that crunch underfoot , the volcano is a world apart from the classic beaches and hilltop @entity51 towns that dot @entity23
for hikers who start from the amenity - packed base at 1,800 meters , the scenery varies little
the walk up can be monotonous
another way up is via a cable car from the base that connects with a 4x4 bus to take visitors to the 2,800 - meter mark
a guide meets each vehicle and leads a walk around the area -- this is a good way to see some of @entity2 's numerous craters
total trip time : up and down in two hours , including lots of photo opportunities
for most visitors , it 's the easier , more efficient way to see the volcano
you can get closer to other parts of the volcano by signing on with one of many authorized @entity2 expedition tour outfits
cable car , 4x4 and compulsory guide fees cost about € 57.50 ( $ 80 ) per adult
cable car only is € 27.50
at almost three kilometers above sea level it is n't always exactly gelato weather on the mountain
layered clothing is a smart idea
the volcano turns into a no - frills ski resort that operates december to february , depending on snowfall
getting to @entity2 in peak summer months , @entity2 traffic gets busy
the easiest way to get the mountain is via public bus from @entity94 or other nearby towns
in less hectic periods , driving is ideal
the windy road on the south part of the peak that crisscrosses old lava flows is a nice teaser for the scenery to come
@entity105 driving directions can be found on the @entity2 administrative headquarters website
maps , expedition operators and more details can also be found at the @entity2 administrative headquarters
@entity2 is open daily , all year ( when not erupting in a life - threatening way ) , 9 a.m. -5:30 p.m. ( last cable car ) ; in winter to 3:30 p.m.
