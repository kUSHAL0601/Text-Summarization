-- of all the parts that make up my somewhat quirky life , there are few things that raise a stranger 's eyebrows faster than discovering i love country music
not a " i like that one song by @entity10 " kind of love for country music either
mine is a " @entity15 i would love to join you and @entity16 for dinner next saturday , but you see i have tickets to see @entity20 so ... " kind of love
when did this love affair begin ? january 24 , 1988
the night i met @entity22
back then , it was n't uncommon for families to gather around the television , and mine had done so that night to watch the @entity26
@entity27 was receiving a special honor , and @entity29 was scheduled to perform
at the time , those two were the most popular singers on the planet but for me , the night belonged to @entity22
i had never heard of him or his mid-tempo ballad " @entity34 " before the show
everyone knew who @entity37 was , but usually the only country music you heard in my house was the theme song to the " @entity43
" but something about the purity of @entity22 ' voice captured me
and even at the relatively immature age of 16 , i found his portrayal of never - ending love so beautifully constructed by the lyrics of " forever " that to this day , it eclipses almost every other love song i have heard
in fact , when i put together a brief video asking my better half to marry me , " forever " was the only song i put on the soundtrack
that 's why i was so sad to hear @entity22 was in critical condition in a @entity62 hospital
he was an unlikely voice of my youth
about as unlikely as you could be
instead of listening to the latest from @entity66 or @entity67 , i would go to the record store and play his song " @entity71 " over and over again
my friends would snicker and mock the twang in his voice
what they could n't understand was that the various inflections in @entity22 ' voice were the commas in the stories that he spun
stories so universal that a white adult man from a small town in @entity85 could touch a skinny black kid in @entity87 without ever meeting
when i 'm in the car singing " @entity34 , " i imagine someone 1,000 miles away is cranking that song up in the car and for three minutes and 31 seconds , we 're connected
" they say that time can play tricks on a memory , make people forget things they once knew
well , it 's easy to see it 's happening to me i 've already forgotten every woman but you ... " complete strangers can stand silent next to each other in an elevator and not even look each other in the eye
but at a concert , those same strangers could find themselves dancing and singing together like best friends
that 's the power of music
and when you 've experienced this magical bond with strangers , there is even a greater connection to the artists that provided the vehicle for that bond
that 's why it 's hard for to see @entity22 this way
we 've all watched once - beloved music icons such as @entity27 and @entity127 fall from grace in similar fashion -- ensnared by drug abuse , publicly humiliated , fighting for and sometimes losing their lives
as @entity22 lies critically ill in a hospital bed , those of us who count ourselves his fans , pray his story does n't end in the same way
but we 've watched the declining grip he 's had on his life for a handful of years now
the uncontrollable drinking , the arrests
because of @entity22 , i learned @entity148 was the man who sang " @entity43 " theme song
because of @entity22 , i have developed lifelong friendships with some amazing people who work in and perform country music
before @entity22 , i used to think " soul music " had one certain sound
because of @entity22 , i learned that was n't true
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .
