@entity0 and @entity1 on friday postponed the signing of a landmark military intelligence pact after the prospect stirred discontent among @entity6
@entity1 occupied @entity0 for 35 years during the first half of the 20th century , and anti-japanese sentiment still lingers
the two countries had originally been scheduled to sign the accord in @entity11 on friday
but the ceremony has been put on hold pending consultations on the matter with the @entity16 , an official at the @entity18 said
the planned pact is intended to " provide a legal framework on sharing classified military information , " including the threat from nuclear - armed @entity6 , @entity23 , a spokesman for the @entity18 , had said thursday
but as news of the proposed deal suddenly emerged this week , @entity6 expressed misgivings
" this is clearly a deception , " said @entity27 , the head of @entity29
" i am angry at the fact that our government pushed the deal ignoring the national sentiment
we were colonized by @entity1 for more than three decades and we also suffered separation and civil war because of @entity1
" @entity1 has been accused of forcing thousands of @entity6 to enroll into the military during the occupation between 1910 and 1945 and of coercing hundreds of thousands of women to serve as sex slaves
they were known as " comfort women " for soldiers in the @entity45
street protests and lawsuits in @entity0 have sought redress for the sufferings of the comfort women
the idea of a military deal between the two countries appeared to revive some of that anger
" i do n't want this treaty to take place , " @entity54 , who works for a legal firm in @entity56 , said before the postponement of the pact was announced
" i am especially not happy at the fact that the signing will take place in @entity1
" @entity11 and @entity56 have also been arguing about who has sovereignty over a group of small islands , known as @entity68 in @entity0 and @entity68 in @entity1
@entity1 has long claimed the islets in the sea east of @entity0 as its territory , but @entity56 insists all @entity6 territory was returned after independence in 1945
" there is still national sentiment on the history and the @entity68 dispute , " said @entity74 - in , a political science professor at @entity76
" they should have gotten some concession from @entity1 on the issues and also made the process public , " said @entity74 , a former national security adviser to the administration of former president , @entity82
other observers have argued in favor of the deal , noting the present threat to both countries from the secretive @entity6 regime
" the treaty was inevitable given the current trend in northeast @entity97 including that of @entity100 's growing influence and its ties with @entity6 , " said @entity93 , the head of @entity94
" @entity0 is good with human intelligence , while @entity1 has an upper hand in technology intelligence , " said @entity27 , who is also a former vice president of the @entity102
" the two nations are likely to cooperate when it comes to the @entity6 threat
" @entity0 has already signed similar treaties with 23 other countries , including the @entity111 and @entity112 , according to the @entity113
and @entity56 and @entity11 have deep and long - established economic ties
as of 2011 , @entity1 and @entity0 were each others ' third largest trading partners , according to @entity117
some @entity0 said they thought it was time for @entity56 and @entity11 to move on from the past
" for the sake of the interest of the country , we need to put historical factors behind us , " said @entity120 , who works for a construction company in @entity56
" i support the deal
