@entity0 -- two years ago , @entity2 helped her mother shave her head after chemotherapy treatments made @entity8 del @entity7 's hair fall out
@entity2 then tied a blue - and - white cotton scarf they had purchased together in @entity11 around her mother 's bald head
" my hope was that these little things would help , " said @entity2 , who lost her mother , 58 , to ovarian cancer in march
to channel her grief , the daughter began training for her first - ever 26.2 - mile race
" i did n't realize how much anger i had and i wanted to turn it into something positive
" she traveled this week in @entity0 , planning to wear the scarf in sunday 's @entity24 , which normally draws 47,000 runners
" i thought it was only right to wear it , and try to be fearless like she was
" millions try to get back to ' normalcy ' when mayor @entity31 on friday announced the cancellation of the race because boroughs were still reeling from @entity35 , @entity2 hardly hesitated
" i had a two - second reaction , " she said
" i 'm going to run anyway
" the race was set to begin on @entity38 , where the majority of the city 's storm - related deaths were recorded
but controversy surfaced this week over concerns that the event would drain resources needed for the massive recovery
" it 's tough , " said @entity2 's brother , @entity48 , 30 , who lives in @entity0
" but you understand the reasons why they had to cancel
" while @entity2 agreed , her decision to endure the brutal strain of running the distance is more than a simple desire to run
" throughout my mother 's illness i noticed i started to get more goal - oriented , " she said
@entity2 participated in a half - marathon just prior to her mother 's death
" i was trying to do all things that once seemed unimaginable
i felt that if i could do all these extraordinary things , that my mom could beat cancer
" deputy mayor : @entity24 ' was going to be divisive ' both @entity2 and @entity68 , who traveled from the @entity69 with her husband and daughter to run in the marathon , plan instead sunday to run in @entity74
some participants will do a full marathon , looping around the iconic green , while others will run shorter distances
the impromptu gathering of runners was scheduled through social media , with the aim " to acknowledge all your training and efforts to prepare and come to the @entity24
" runners should assemble at 10 a.m. at @entity89 's @entity88 , according to an unofficial @entity91 site dedicated to this year 's marathoners
@entity68 arrived in @entity0 a day before @entity35 barreled across the @entity93 , demolishing homes , flooding subways and leaving millions without power
" i turned 42 years old this year , " she said
" i wanted to do 42 kilometers at age 42
" others debated saturday whether they would run at all
" i think a lot of people are just going to join in when people start running , " said @entity99 , a 27 - year - old fashion designer at @entity100 in @entity89
" that may be my best tactic
" the recovery effort continued saturday across wide sections of @entity38 , @entity108 and @entity109 , while gasoline shortages plagued @entity111 , where some of the worst storm damage occurred
on battered @entity38 , local residents had planned to mix relief efforts and the inclination to run
@entity35 's victims @entity117 and @entity118 organized a series of " street - run 5k " runs to raise money and other donations for storm - affected neighbors
and by 5 p.m. saturday , they had raised $ 13,500
but with a plethora of donations , the organizers called off the races and had a suggestion to supporters
" the best thing we can do right now is offer our physical help along the @entity38 shoreline , " the @entity132 wrote
" we encourage you to join us , or to find a location that has been affected and offer your time -- it 's the best donation you can make right now
" relief organizations such as @entity141 reported that many runners had exchanged their sneakers for work boots , working with the organization to deliver food kits
" i could have sat in the hotel room
i could have gone sight - seeing , and probably would have still felt pretty empty , " said @entity149 , who traveled from @entity150 , @entity151 , for the race
" but this is a good feeling that there are people out there in a pretty bad situation at the moment and we 're doing our small part to help out with that
" how you can help
