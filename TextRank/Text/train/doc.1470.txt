he was known by fans as " @entity0 " since he played alongside guitarist @entity5 , the brother of @entity1 co-founder @entity6
" as an original member of @entity1 , @entity0 was there in the trenches with me from the beginning , " his brother @entity7 said in a @entity9 posting
" he was my level - headed brother , a solid performer and talented audio engineer , always giving more than he got
" the new - wave band began after @entity7 and @entity6 met as art students at @entity18
the group wrote its first music in may 1970 -- the same month @entity22 troops fired on antiwar protesters on the @entity18 campus , killing four students
@entity1 actively toured in recent years , including a televised performance playing at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29
" he was excited about the possibility of @entity6 allowing @entity1 to play shows again , " @entity7 wrote in his brother 's death announcement

he was a great friend
i will miss him greatly
" @entity44 is the name of the band 's headquarters , a landmark on @entity59 's @entity58
the band 's name was derived from the word " de-evolution " -- the idea that humans are regressing into a destructive herd mentality , @entity7 told @entity67 in an interview in february 2010
" when you think about 1980 , if somebody would have showed you in a crystal ball ( for ) 2010 , you would have thought it was a bad joke , " @entity0 said
" @entity73 happened and now everybody agrees
they do n't think we 're crazy
they know that it was true
