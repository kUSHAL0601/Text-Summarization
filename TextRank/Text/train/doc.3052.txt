-- @entity2 president @entity1 has told @entity0 he believes there is no on - field racism in football and that players who think they have been abused should simply say " this is a game
" the head of world soccer insisted @entity2 had been tireless in their efforts to combat the specter of racism in football but suggested any player who is abused during a game should shake hands with their opponent upon the final whistle and move on
the football authorities in @entity18 are currently dealing with two high - profile allegations of player - on - player racism , involving @entity21 and @entity18 captain @entity22 and @entity25 's @entity24 striker @entity23
both players deny the claims
when asked by @entity29 anchor @entity28 if racism exists on the field of play @entity1 said : " i would deny it
@entity1 comments spark @entity36 fury " there is no racism , there is maybe one of the players towards the other , he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one , but also the one who is affected by that , he should say it 's a game , we are in a game
" at the end of the game , we shake hands , this can happen , because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination
" this year has also seen allegations of high - profile racism by fans
former @entity61 defender @entity60 walked off the pitch during a @entity64 league match after a banana was thrown at him from the stands , while the @entity68 @entity67 was forced to apologize to @entity21 in july when their @entity70 midfielder @entity69 was subject to racial slurs during a pre-season encounter
@entity73 : how should football tackle racism ? on wednesday the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) announced they had charged @entity25 player @entity23 over a clash with @entity77 's @entity76 during an @entity79 match in october
@entity76 alleged the @entity24 had aimed racial taunts at him -- a claim @entity23 denies
in a statement on their official web site the @entity67 said @entity23 is alleged to have used abusive language towards his opponent , including " a reference to the ethnic origin and / or color and / or race " of @entity76
@entity91 's @entity90 is investigating allegations that @entity22 racially abused @entity94 defender @entity93 during an @entity79 match last month
in his interview with @entity0 , @entity1 , who was re-elected unopposed as the head of world football despite allegations of corruption surrounding the voting process for the right to host the 2018 and 2022 @entity103 , championed his organization 's commitment to tackling racism
" i think the whole world is aware of the efforts we are making against racism and discrimination , " he added
" and , on the field of play sometimes you say something that is not very correct , but then at the end of the game , the game is over and you have the next game where you can behave better
" @entity1 's comments provoked an immediate response within soccer
@entity77 's @entity124 , brother of @entity93 , took to @entity36 to say : " tell me i have just read @entity1 's comments on racism in football wrong ...
if not then i am astonished
" i feel stupid for thinking that football was taking a leading role against racism ...
. it seems it was just on mute for a while
" the ' @entity133 ' campaign , who work to eradicate racism from football in @entity18 and @entity137 , said @entity1 's comments were " worryingly out of touch
" a statement from @entity1 was later posted on @entity2 's official web site , in which he sought to clarify his comments
it read : " i would like to make it very clear , i am committed to the fight against racism and any type of discrimination in football and in society
" my comments have been misunderstood
what i wanted to express is that , as football players , during a match , you have " battles " with your opponents , and sometimes things are done which are wrong
" but , normally , at the end of the match , you apologize to your opponent if you had a confrontation during the match , you shake hands , and when the game is over , it is over
anyone who has played a football match , or a match in any sport , knows that this is the case
" having said that , i want to stress again that i do not want to diminish the dimension of the problem of racism in society and in sport
i am committed to fighting this plague and kicking it out of football
