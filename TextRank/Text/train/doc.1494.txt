-- whether it 's breaking records on the piste , or making hit records in the studio , @entity1 is determined to do things her way
the 29 - year - old , who broke ranks with her national skiing federation to set up her own team , last weekend had the satisfaction of breaking the iconic all - time @entity15 points record of the legendary @entity17 as she shrugged off pre-race death threats
the @entity19 has celebrated her numerous victories by turning cartwheels and , even more daringly , once famously unzipped her ski suit to reveal her under clothing to photographers after some rivals had wrongly accused her of gaining an aerodynamic advantage by placing padding in her sports bra
but not content with just grabbing the sporting headlines , @entity1 is also hitting the high notes in a fledgling career as a pop star -- inspired by influences such as @entity35 , @entity36 and , of course , @entity38
a leading @entity19 music producer persuaded @entity1 to record a number he had written
given her maverick reputation and single - minded approach , the title could not have been more apt : -- " my way is my decision " -- and it proved an instant hit , quickly reaching no. 1 in the @entity19 charts
the accompanying video -- which sees @entity1 moving in time to the catchy up tempo song -- has had over a million hits on @entity52
at one point , @entity1 dons a skiing helmet and uses a ski as a mock guitar , but fooling aside it is clear she has more than a modicum of musical talent
" it was a new challenge -- i love music , " she told @entity0 's @entity62 show
" when i was a kid i played the piano for six years and all my family are musicians
" having focused relentlessly on her skiing career since her teenage years , @entity1 is relieved to find an outside distraction in a completely different field
" i was always looking for something different
skiing is always so huge , you need so many talents to be fast and be good at this sport , " she said
" you need some talent and sensibility which you get with music
" @entity1 's skiing rivals were already aware of her talents on and off the slopes , and she often entertains her rivals with her piano skills when they stay at exclusive five - star hotels on the tour
when a concert was laid on at the @entity86 in @entity87 in @entity88 last month , she was quick to grab the microphone and belt out a few numbers
maze had plenty to celebrate , having won a gold in the super-g and two silvers in the super-combined and giant slalom
many predicted she would achieve the almost unprecedented feat of winning medals in all five of alpine skiing 's disciplines , but tiredness and muscle soreness saw her finish fifth and seventh in the slalom and downhill respectively
but her incredible consistency across all the events has served @entity1 spectacularly well during the @entity15 season , and she clinched the @entity111 of overall women 's champion with nine events still remaining with victory in the super-g at @entity117 a week after the championships at @entity87
it left her in touching distance of the all - time points record of the " @entity122 " @entity17 and this was duly achieved with her ninth victory of the season in saturday 's downhill at @entity126
it took her past the magic 2,000 points mark of @entity17 and completed @entity15 wins in all five of skiing 's disciplines
with echoes of her hit pop video , she celebrated her win this time by using her ski as a guitar , and had time to throw in her trademark cartwheel
but afterwards , @entity1 revealed that she had received an email death threat , and there was a strong @entity140 police presence at @entity141 , where she finished fourth
typically , she shrugged off the threats
" it should n't be part of the game but life is not perfect
it 's not nice for me , it 's not nice for my team
they want to ruin your day , ruin the record , " she told gathered reporters
maze has had to play second fiddle to the likes of @entity157 superstar @entity156 , the previous holder of the women 's points record of 1980 , but no longer
" i 've been improving for the past four or five seasons
you did n't see me much before , but i was improving and this season it all fits together , " she said
since 2008 , @entity1 has been guided by her @entity164 coach and boyfriend , @entity166 -- going it alone with their team " @entity170
" it has paid off in spectacular style
" winning the overall is a dream i 've had since being a young skier
it 's everyone 's dream
" @entity156 's shocking crash in the super-g at the world championships -- she was airlifted off the piste after sustaining a serious knee injury -- tempered @entity1 's subsequent triumph , and the @entity19 's look of horror and concern for her rival was only too evident
" i 'm really afraid of crashes , " she admitted
" i always concentrate 100 % to make sure i do not make any mistakes such as happened to @entity156
" she was pushing the limits , she always does and that 's why she 's a great fighter
" @entity156 faces a race against time to be fit in time for the @entity194 in @entity195 next year , where @entity1 is determined to add to the two silvers she won at the @entity197 in @entity198 as she carries the hopes of her small nation
" it 's my next major goal , to win a gold that 's my goal , " she said
and do n't rule out a return to the top of the music charts ( " i 'm really proud of that " ) by a young woman with talent and a zest for life -- a real crowd - pleaser in every sense .
