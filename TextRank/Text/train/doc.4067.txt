@entity0 is paying a price for not ignoring a swarm of paparazzi surrounding him at an airport this past summer
@entity0 's lawyer entered a no contest plea monday on behalf of the rapper to a misdemeanor count of battery against a photographer
a no contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea for purposes of the sentencing
judge @entity17 sentenced @entity0 to serve two years ' probation for the misdemeanor battery conviction
he must attend 24 anger management sessions , perform 250 hours of community service and pay restitution to the victim
@entity17 said he will review the community service to make sure he is getting no special treatment
photographer @entity26 told the judge he wanted @entity0 thrown in jail
" i was only doing my job , and he broke the law , " @entity26 said
" i believe that if i did what he did to me , i would have been put behind bars
" the incident was caught on camera , leaving @entity37 with the prospect of a tough trial and the possibility of jail unless he accepted a plea deal from prosecutors that included probation
@entity0 was not required to appear in court since the charge was just a misdemeanor
the video recorded the following exchange : " @entity0 ! @entity0 ! talk to me , @entity0 ! " a photographer shouted outside of a @entity52 on the night of july 19 , 2013
" now come on , @entity0 , i do n't want to fight with you
" " i told you , do n't talk to me , right
you 're trying to get me in trouble so i step off and have to pay you like $ 250,000
" @entity0 is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands
@entity0 retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer
" i simply asked him a question , and i did n't use any vulgar language , " @entity26 told the judge monday
" in fact , i gave him a compliment and told him that he was cool
" lawyer @entity65 has filed a civil suit against @entity37 on behalf of the photographer
@entity69 @entity68 investigated an incident in january in which @entity0 was accused of assaulting a man at a @entity69 chiropractor 's office
@entity0 avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man
