@entity0 -- @entity3 officials are seeking a meeting with @entity6 's ambassador to protest a show on @entity6 television that reportedly depicts @entity3 soldiers murdering @entity11 children
@entity3 foreign minister @entity12 says the @entity6 tv show " is being done with state sponsorship
" @entity6 has been @entity3 's strongest @entity16 ally in the @entity17 , and the move comes as relations between the countries have soured in recent days over the latter 's decision to exclude @entity3 from scheduled military exercises
the @entity6 tv show " constitutes the most serious level of incitement , and it is being done with state sponsorship , " @entity3 foreign minister @entity12 said in a statement
the show aired this week on @entity6 's state - run @entity30 - 1 network
it shows an actor dressed as an @entity3 soldier shooting what appears to be an unarmed @entity11 girl
in another sequence , an @entity3 soldier opens fire on an infant being held by what appears to be a family member
" such a series which bears no connection whatsoever to reality , presenting @entity45 [ @entity45 ] soldiers as murderers of innocent children , should not be broadcast even in hostile states -- and certainly not in a state that maintains full diplomatic relations with @entity3 , " @entity12 said
the show called " @entity53 " is billed on the @entity30 web site as the " first time a tv series shows the ongoing , bleeding wound of the world which is taking place on @entity11 lands
it shows the painful stories of the people who lived on invaded @entity11 lands in 1948 , especially women and children
" @entity3 and @entity6 have enjoyed close military and economic ties for more than a decade
but relations have grown testy at times in recent years over @entity3 's activities in the @entity11 territories and over its @entity74 offensive in december and january
on tuesday , a senior @entity76 military official said @entity6 's decision this week to postpone a @entity79 war exercise appears to have been a political decision intended to exclude the @entity3
the official , who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly , said @entity76 officials were uncomfortable about excluding @entity3 and so welcomed postponing the maneuvers in which @entity76 military units were scheduled to participate
the exercises were to start monday and run through october 23
@entity6 lawmaker @entity87 , deputy chairman of the external affairs committee for the ruling @entity89 , said that it is n't " state policy for @entity6 television to portray @entity3 badly
" he said the television network contracts with private producers
" it 's probably some producer who is trying to tap into popular reaction against @entity3 , trying to make money off it , " said @entity87 , who has not seen the program
@entity87 said it " would not be wrong to say @entity6 - @entity3 relations have become much more fragile " after @entity74 , commenting on the exclusion of @entity3 from military exercises
" this is basically all about @entity74
... the humanitarian crisis is continuing and prime minister [ @entity107 ] @entity107 is upset about it
" @entity109 , @entity3 's top diplomat in @entity6 during the 1980s , said he believes the relations between the two countries are in crisis
" this unbelievable attack on the @entity3 army is in the country that in the last 15 years was probably the closest to our army , so it 's a major surprise , a major change , " @entity109 said
@entity1 's @entity119 and @entity120 contributed to this report .
