-- @entity1 initially opted for a career in wildlife conservation so she would n't have to deal with people
but working with wild animals in her native @entity6 has taught her that it is near impossible to prevent some vulnerable species coming into contact with human communities --- often with damaging consequences
as executive director of the @entity14 and chairman of the @entity16 , @entity12 now aims to reduce people - wildlife conflicts arising from these scenarios
" @entity19 is the only continent remaining on this planet that still has its full diversity of large mammals , " she says
" we ca n't afford to lose it
we 've always been able to co-exist with wildlife
" see also : uneasy truce between @entity27 and nature in some parts of the rural @entity6 however the durability of this ancient cohabitation has been tested in recent times
lions have become a particular problem for farm owners and @entity27 tribes , with whom they share the country 's vast savannahs , often preying on valuable livestock
this has led many farmers and rural communities to take matters into their own hands , in some cases killing whole prides they perceive as a threat
the use of pesticides such as @entity52 -- a tablespoon of which costs less than a dollar and is enough to kill a lion -- has become a particularly ruthless way of doing so
" @entity6 lions have reduced from about 15,000 about 15 years ago to fewer than 2,000 now , " explains @entity1

" through dialogue and education programs , @entity12 is aiming to end these practices
she hopes to show rural communities how they can coexist and even benefit from their proximity to lions
" in many parts of @entity27 land now what we have are programs where people are rewarded for protecting wildlife
they are rewarded for keeping land open
" " they are trained so that they can participate in conservation
and they are given opportunities to get investors to come in and work with them
i really think that is the solution
" see also : last of the bush trackers a constructive and respectful dialogue with communities is highlighted by @entity12 as a key factor in achieving these aims
but it 's not just the human population who have been the focus of her organization 's educational efforts
the @entity102 graduate is also working to train wild lions so they know not attack livestock
she admits such a tactic may sound bizarre but believes it is essential to safeguard the big cat 's future in @entity6
" @entity109 are very , very intelligent animals
the reason why lions do n't prey on certain livestock in certain places is because they get hammered ( if they do )
" " there are ways that you can punish lions - and one of them is that you can put rock salt into a shot gun and shoot at them
it 's not going to injure them or kill them but it hurts like hell
they 're not going to come back because they do n't want to have that pain again
" @entity1 speaks with a passionate conviction on the benefits these training programs have brought
yet with more than 75 percent of @entity6 's wildlife inhabiting land outside of government protected areas , she admits there is only so much they can achieve on their own
it was for this reason that in 2007 she decided to join @entity143 , a bloggers network which connects conservationists and publicizes conservation work across the world
she has since taken over as the website 's chief executive and its popularity has soared
" initially all we were doing is raising money - it was every blogger for himself
and what we noticed , what i noticed , very early on is that many of the bloggers were telling the same story
" this observation helped @entity12 grasp that the blog platform could be used as a network tool for conservationists , helping them stay in touch as well as share their research
" all of the bloggers who were online on other predators ( such as crocodiles , jackals and birds ) are now sharing each other 's technology and learning from each other and exchanging , " she says
see also : beauty trumps beast in conservation efforts the power of communication emphasized by these exchanges has since acted as an inspiration for @entity12 's latest conservation project --- the creation of recorded oral history of @entity6 's biodiversity
" in my work , especially working with the local communities who are dealing with wildlife on a daily basis - i have been reminded constantly ( that ) most of the knowledge is maintained in the minds of the elders , " she says
" i hear these people lamenting that old stories are now gone and nobody can tell them
those elders are not literate - they ca n't record their stories
" by filming conversations with older tribes people and storing them on the internet , @entity12 aims to keep this cultural knowledge and experience alive
she also hopes a new generation of rural @entity6 's will gain a historic perspective on how to live alongside animals such as lions
" all they ( young people ) see about wildlife is killing livestock or destroying property , " she says
" ( but ) through these stories , children are able to actually discover this incredible culture and biodiversity that we have in @entity6 and across @entity19 , " she says .
