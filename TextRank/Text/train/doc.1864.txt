-- a small plane headed from @entity3 to suburban @entity4 crashed onto an interstate shortly after takeoff tuesday , killing five people , authorities said
two men , one woman , two children and a dog aboard the plane died in the crash in @entity14 , @entity3 , just after 10 a.m. et , said @entity15 , a senior air safety investigator with the @entity16
the plane , a six - seater @entity18 , was headed from @entity19 , @entity3 , to @entity20 in suburban @entity4 when it crashed onto @entity21 about 14 minutes into the flight , @entity15 said
the plane was at about 17,500 feet when " there was some discussion between the pilot and the controller of locations of icing conditions , " he said
he told reporters monday night the conversation seemed " routine " and was " not a distress call
" @entity15 said he did not know whether the conversation concerned a cloud that might contain ice ; actual icing on the airplane ; or whether the pilot was inquiring where ice might be or reporting it
" i 've heard this thirdhand
... that 's something i need to listen to the tapes to know , " he said
@entity15 said he was not aware of any icing conditions on the ground at @entity19 that would have required the plane to be deiced
however , he stressed that the investigation is in its infancy and it is too soon to speculate what might have caused the crash
" it 's too early to tell whether it was something mechanical or something the pilot did -- we just do n't know , " he said
preliminary information is that the five were headed to @entity4 for a combination business - leisure trip , @entity15 said
authorities did not release the names of those who died , pending positive identification by the medical examiner and notification of relatives
but @entity69 investment banking firm @entity68 reported that those on board were two of the firm 's managing directors , @entity71 , 45 , and @entity74 , 36 ; @entity71 's wife , @entity76 , and their two children , @entity78 and @entity79
ages for the children were not given
" the plane belonged to mr. @entity71 , an experienced pilot whose passion was flying , " the company said in a statement
" the firm is in deep mourning over the tragic and untimely death of two of its esteemed colleagues and members of @entity93 's family
" no one on the ground was injured , although a pickup truck narrowly missed the plane , @entity15 said
the debris field from the crash was spread over about a half - mile , with part of a wing and the plane 's tail found in a tree in a residential area , he said
witnesses reported the plane was in an " uncontrolled spin " before it crashed
a @entity110 radar facility in @entity69 lost radio contact with the plane , and also lost it on radar , @entity110 spokesman @entity109 said
the crash site was about 30 miles southwest of the @entity116 , @entity109 said
@entity15 said monday evening he was not sure how long after the conversation regarding icing that the plane dropped off radar , saying investigators will be determining that
the plane struck the southbound lanes of @entity21 , continued through a wooded median and came to rest on the northbound lanes , @entity123 lt. @entity122 said
most of the interstate was shut down after the crash , @entity122 said
one northbound lane and two southbound lanes were open as of tuesday afternoon , but officials were " still trying to recover both the pieces of the plane and the remains of the victims
" @entity15 said monday night the wreckage recovery was halted about 6 p.m. because of darkness and would resume after tuesday 's morning rush hour , at 9:30 a.m. the @entity141 said motorists had two of three travel lanes in each direction available for monday evening 's rush hour
