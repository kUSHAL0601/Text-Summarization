-- @entity1 woke up on sunday to a brand new economy , apparently
the federal government had changed the baseline for calculating @entity5 for the first time since 1990 , and as a result the economy was boosted by around 75 %
this was thanks , in part , to the contributions of accelerated sectors like telecoms and entertainment
overnight , the economy of the " giant of @entity18 " had grown from $ 292 billion to $ 510 billion
it could now claim to be @entity18 's largest economy , and the world 's 26th
it was another headline - grabbing moment for a government already smug from @entity1 's status as one of the " @entity31 " economies , which also includes @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30
they are seen as successors to the now - famous @entity34 as profiled by former @entity36 economist , @entity35
but more interesting than this news is the countrywide response
in summary , it was a loud hiss
to hear one columnist tell it , " until @entity46 , the tomato seller at @entity48 , can be guaranteed uninterrupted power supply ... any economic statistic indicating that @entity1 is the largest economy in @entity18 ... can not be worth more than the paper it is written on ! " to be sure , this is not a particularly bright argument
no country is changed overnight
after all , statistics matter
to dismiss a decade of annual growth averaging 7 % in real terms is to insist on ignorance about how nations are changed in the long term
and , in terms of how the world views our country with respect to investment and risk , this news can not hurt
but the argument against has some merit
there are some urgent numbers that , alas , wont go away
despite our new status , @entity18 's gdp per capita is $ 7,352 compared to our $ 1,555 , according to 2012 statistics
@entity18 produces 40,000 megawatts , set to double by 2025 , while we battle a miserly 3,000 with no prospects of improvement , if our immediate history is any guide
barely a week ago , in a nod to the over 100 million living far under the poverty line , the @entity81 president said @entity1 was one of the world 's poorest countries
then there is our biggest and most urgent crisis -- a debilitating lack of jobs
the @entity91 has youth unemployment at over 54 % , although some commentators insist the true number is almost 80 %
our work with @entity96 , a portal to expand access to jobs and opportunities for young people , suggest they are closer to the truth
if anyone disagrees with the numbers , they must accept the visual aids
in february , @entity108 were hit with the harrowing image from the nation 's capital , @entity112
at least half a million youth fought for 4,500 positions available in the @entity115 , with tens of thousands gathering at the @entity117
amid the crush , 16 people died
in @entity1 , hundreds continue to die as the vestiges of state control have completely broken down , in a war that terrorist organization @entity124 is clearly winning
how much direct foreign investment can our brand - new economy truly bring if @entity1 is still defined by insecurity , rampant inequality and a government that suspends its central bank governor , after he warns of missing oil revenues ? not much , @entity108 believe
and they have saying this loudly for months and years
there was a time when the president 's people would dismiss the naysayers as a vocal minority on social media
according to the @entity145 -- the country 's most credible barometer -- @entity108 president @entity147 's approval ratings for march took a 10 - point hit , continuing a trend from last year that makes it clear he is no longer a popular president
that is why numbers that should give a psychological boost to a battle - weary citizenry instead lead to scorn , to disbelief , to nationwide derision
because people are tired of pointless numbers and meaningless chest thumping
@entity108 are tired of waiting for their leaders to lead
last week , the @entity162 released its first @entity163
@entity1 youth ranked lowest for wellbeing
the country was ranked near bottom in terms of economic opportunities , near bottom in use of @entity172
@entity1 's education system -- as seen by young people aged 12 -- 24 - is ranked the worst in the world
much can fall apart , but when your youth lose faith in the present , and are incapable of seeing hope in the future , that is the worst possible thing that could happen to any country in the world
that 's not so easy to rebase
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .
