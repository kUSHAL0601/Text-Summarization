-- still concerned about some faceless government bureaucrat peeking at your e-mails and other online communications ? well , you 've got a new champion : @entity6
the computing giant has announced a set of new privacy features , in a post that specifically calls out " government snooping " as the reason
responding to news reports that the @entity16 may be monitoring more online activity than was previously believed , @entity6 attorney and executive vice president @entity13 wrote that the company is rolling out three new features : -- expanded encryption across @entity6 services
-- reinforced legal protections for customer data
-- enhanced transparency designed to show customers that @entity6 products do n't have " back doors " that make government surveillance easier
" like many others , we are especially alarmed by recent allegations in the press of a broader and concerted effort by some governments to circumvent online security measures -- and in our view , legal processes and protections -- in order to surreptitiously collect private customer data , " @entity13 wrote in the post published late wednesday
" ... if true , these efforts threaten to seriously undermine confidence in the security and privacy of online communications
indeed , government snooping potentially now constitutes an ' advanced persistent threat , ' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks
" just over a month ago , a @entity52 report said the @entity16 can tap into overseas data links to collect millions of text , video and audio records from tech giants like @entity58 and @entity59 every day
the @entity16 denied that report
@entity16 spying claims : five things you need to know wednesday 's post says @entity6 launched " a comprehensive engineering effort " to enhance encryption on communications via tools like e-mail service outlook , productivity suite office 365 , @entity70 and @entity71
@entity72 sent between customers and @entity6 is now encrypted by default , meaning messages will be garbled during transition so they become useless to anyone who may intercept them between the sender and intended recipient
all messages traveling between @entity6 servers will be added
some changes went into effect immediately , and all will be active by the end of 2014 , @entity13 wrote
" while we have no direct evidence that customer data has been breached by unauthorized government access , we do n't want to take any chances and are addressing this issue head on , " the post said
in recent months , some of tech 's biggest players have been pushing back against perceived government intrusions
in september , @entity100 @entity99 of @entity101 and @entity102 of @entity59 took to the stage at the @entity105 conference to condemn government surveillance of private citizens online
@entity6 's move follows @entity58 and @entity59 , both of which have stepped up encryption of users ' data in light of reports about the @entity16
in a blog post last month announcing the new protections , @entity115 wrote that " @entity59 has never given access to our data centers to the @entity16 or any other government agency
