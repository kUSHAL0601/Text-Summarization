-- @entity2 's defense team now includes @entity3 and @entity4
both singers stood up for the 19 - year - old pop star as he was being hammered on @entity7 and tv after his @entity10 arrest thursday , encouraging their fans to show some compassion and support
" everyone is entitled to their own opinion , and to stand up for themselves , but i think we should be supportive of @entity20 , " @entity3 told her @entity3 -- aka her fans -- in a post on her website thursday
" we may not understand everything celebrities do because there 's only so much we see , but @entity2 and @entity20 were ' born this way ' too
let 's spread love and compassion to @entity20 today
that is what we are all about
" @entity29 , who once had @entity2 on her show to surprise him with a car as a birthday gift , sounded genuine when she tweeted she hopes the star will be able to mature without injury
@entity37 star @entity35 , who spent some time on tour with @entity2 and shares a manager with the pop star , @entity41 , did n't directly address @entity2 by name , but the timing of her reaction on @entity7 spoke volumes
meanwhile , other stars such as @entity47 and @entity48 had decidedly less kind reactions to the news that @entity2 had been pulled over while drag racing in @entity52 , @entity53 , and then arrested on charges of drunken driving , resisting arrest and driving without a valid license
" all jokes aside , @entity2 is a piece of s * * * , " @entity47 tweeted
@entity48 joked , " 50 in a 30
@entity60 , @entity2 even drag races like a p * * * *
" " @entity64 " actor @entity63 said , " just saw the mugshot of @ justinbieber
i got ta admit , she 's kinda hot without all of her usual makeup on
" over on late night , @entity2 was the top joke on both " @entity71 " and " @entity72
" @entity73 poked fun at @entity2 's transformation from teeny - bopper to apparent troublemaker
he also joked about the outcry from distraught @entity20 who were depressed that criminals in @entity53 got to meet their idol before they did
on " @entity72 , " @entity81 skewered @entity2 's mug shot , saying that he mistook it for a commercial for @entity85 , an acne treatment product
but according to @entity2 's manager , @entity41 , and his friend @entity90 , the singer 's arrest is no laughing matter
" he 's fine , " @entity90 posted thursday afternoon
nobody thinks it 's a joke
" " been a long day
bottom line is we are defined by how we handle adversity
be there when it counts
love fully in good times and bad , " @entity41 added
" ( @entity2 ) love you and i will act in the manner of someone who truly cares
that is all i have to say
thanks for all those concerned
" if all else fails and the arrest brings @entity2 's career to a halt , at least he has @entity109 in his corner
the former rap artist has offered @entity2 a job .
