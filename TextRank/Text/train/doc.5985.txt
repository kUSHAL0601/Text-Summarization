@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , owner of @entity4 in @entity0 , @entity1 , said police have pulled him over twice for what he calls " @entity7 " -- driving while black
when he questioned why he was stopped , officers pressed him for insurance information -- not something a driver should be pulled over for , he said
" people are just tired of that happening , " @entity3 said
" why should we get pulled over every time we get in the car ? " @entity3 would n't be surprised if @entity14 , 18 , smarted off to officer @entity15
it happens quite often , " @entity3 said
it 's common for black people to give police attitude in the area , he said
@entity15 , a white police officer , fatally shot the unarmed , @entity22 on august 9 -- the event that started protests and violent street clashes in the town of about 22,000 people
dozens of people have been arrested as @entity0 became a flash point of racial conflict
black residents of @entity0 say there 's been friction for years with the overwhelmingly white police department
white residents also complain the police are heavy - handed
the department was formally accused of using excessive force tuesday in a federal lawsuit
the family of @entity42 says he died of cardiac arrest september 17 , 2011 , when police fired tasers at him , according to the lawsuit
the family says that @entity42 , who they say suffered a psychological disorder , was walking around naked and posed no threat to police
the public relations firm handling media inquiries of the @entity0 police did not immediately respond wednesday to @entity2 's request for comment on the suit
to locals and longtime observers , tension has been brewing since the 1970s , when school desegregation and white flight changed @entity0 's demographics
today , two - thirds of @entity0 's population is black , but arrest statistics do n't reflect that
according to a 2013 report released by the @entity1 attorney general , african - americans are highly over-represented in crime statistics
they accounted for 93 % of arrests after traffic stops , 92 % of searches and 86 % of traffic stops
@entity14 shooting , protests highlight racial divide the police chief is white
there are only three african - americans on the 53 - person police force
the mayor is white , and so are five of the six city council members
police chief defends department police chief @entity88 has come under heavy criticism for the way police have handled protests and looting , but he defends the department against accusations of racism
when @entity2 asked him about the perception that police stop blacks more than whites , @entity88 said , " well , if that is the perception out there , then that 's something we have to work on
" when asked if it 's more than a perception , he said , " i do n't think so
" but @entity107 - @entity107 residents say it 's more than perception
@entity110 , 27 , said she believes race played a factor in @entity14 's death
" i 'm not saying that every white police officer in @entity0 is racist like that , but some are " she said
" first time i seen a black cop is when they blocked off the street , " she said , referring to recent turmoil in her city
' they all got a power trip problem ' @entity125 , 31 , has lived in @entity0 since 1994
when he was 20 , an officer came to his house because he was playing music too loud , he said
the officer told him to open his door but he stuck his head out the window instead , he said
after an exchange of words , the officer smacked him in the head , he said
his father talked him out of filing a report
" they all got a power trip problem , a lot of them , " he said
@entity143 , 22 , said , " police do what they want , " he said
" they abuse that badge
" he thinks that 's exactly what happened with @entity14
" they get trained to use their night sticks and @entity153 , and they get trained to fight
there 's no reason to pull out a gun and definitely no reason to kill him , or overkill him is what they did , " he said
" that could 've been me
" a traffic case brought @entity163 into conflict with @entity0 police
@entity163 filed a federal lawsuit against the city and four police officers in 2010 , alleging the police used excessive force against him in the jail cell after arresting him in 2009
last march , a federal judge ruled in favor of the city and the officers
in the lawsuit , @entity163 says officers wrongly arrested him in the first place , thinking he was another person by the same last name
lawsuit alleges excessive force at the jail , police beat and kicked him so badly he suffered a concussion , the lawsuit says
" i should n't have been there , i was the wrong person , " he told @entity2
" they beat me for no reason while i was handcuffed
" to top it off , police charged him with four counts of property damage , saying he had bled on their uniforms
he also was charged with driving while intoxicated , speeding , failure to drive in a single lane , no proof of insurance and failure to obey a police officer
police tell a different story in their responses to @entity163 ' lawsuit , saying @entity163 acted intoxicated , belligerent and aggressive toward arresting officers
one officer claims he suffered a broken nose
in a 2010 plea bargain in municipal court , @entity163 pleaded guilty to two counts of property damage , careless driving , speeding , failure to obey a police officer , and two non-moving violations , according to a @entity217 magistrate 's summary of the case
two counts of property damage were dismissed
after @entity163 filed his lawsuit in august 2010 , police charged @entity163 with felony assault on a police officer
that charge was dismissed in 2013
chief says he improving department @entity226 , @entity163 ' attorney , said he 's not shocked by the @entity14 case
" @entity0 had a policy and custom for its officers to use excessive force at will , " @entity226 said in the lawsuit he filed for @entity163 , who like @entity14 is @entity107
chief @entity88 , who was hired in march 2010 , told @entity2 he 's trying to improve the department
" i was n't here when that happened , " he said of the @entity163 case
" all i can say is that from the time i got here i 've been working on improvements to make this a very professional police department
" @entity226 said @entity88 is trying to improve the department , but " the culture in the police department was one where there was no fear of punishment
" meanwhile , one of the four officers @entity163 sued , @entity248 , left the police department and ran for city council , reported @entity252
she won election in 2012
@entity226 does n't know if the @entity14 case will help his appeal of the @entity163 lawsuit
he expects the case to be heard the week of december 8
" i 've been told by other lawyers the appeal now stands a better shot , " he said , " but i do n't speculate
