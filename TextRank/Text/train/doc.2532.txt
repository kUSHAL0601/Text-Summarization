-- animated television specials are among the most cherished holiday traditions of yuletide revelers young and old
mention " a @entity12 " ( 1965 ) , " @entity9 " ( 1964 ) or " @entity14 " ( 1969 ) and people light up like @entity5 's tree ( after the kids gave it a little love ) , @entity9 's nose , or the hot sun that melted poor @entity11
you can thank " @entity18 " -- the first animated @entity12 special -- for that holiday gooeyness
it premiered 50 years ago this month
" @entity18 " originally aired on december 18 , 1962 , on @entity21 at 7:30 p.m. for the first time since 1967 , the special will air on a major network -- once again on @entity21 -- saturday , december 22 at 8 p.m. et. while the major networks have aired the aforementioned holiday staples , including " @entity25 ! " ( 1966 ) every year since their airdates , " @entity28 " has n't aired outside of syndication for 44 years
now that " @entity18 " has hit he half - century mark , this often overlooked , underappreciated , somewhat obscure @entity12 special is experiencing a renaissance of sorts
@entity0 spoke to animator @entity34 , author of " @entity18 : the making of the @entity35 , " about how " @entity28 " paved the way for @entity12 specials yet to come
" because this was such a huge success , " said @entity34 , " it inspired other people to follow in its footsteps , especially ' @entity9 , ' which was the next one
" @entity34 could n't pinpoint why " @entity18 " fell by the wayside , but he did note that the character began to dwindle in the years following the @entity12 special
your @entity12 traditions " ' @entity49 ' had a book attached to it , " said @entity34 , " ' @entity5 ' had all of those books , all of those specials
these were constantly in the forefront of peoples ' minds during the holidays
and ' @entity9 , ' well , who does n't know that song ? between all of these other specials getting all of this promotion , and mr. @entity28 kind of fading , it really got lost for a long time
" as far as adaptations of @entity70 ' 1843 tale " @entity71 " go , many have tried , many have failed , and -- arguably -- a handful have succeeded
most people would count " @entity28 " among the successful renditions
" i think this is one of the stronger versions because it 's quite loyal to the original , " said @entity34
" they are reciting lines from the book , and on an emotional level i think it 's one of the strongest -- even over live - action -- because the songs really emphasize the emotional aspect of it
they know exactly where to go to tell their story
" that 's right -- " @entity18 ' is a musical as well as an animated special
" to take a classic story like that , " said @entity96 , " and then to mix in mr. @entity28 , and then make it a musical , it 's kind of a big leap
and he did n't just make it a musical ; he went after the best @entity105 songwriters of the time
it 's one of the stronger , if not the strongest , musical interpretations of @entity70
" composer july @entity109 and lyricist @entity110 , who were developing " @entity111 " at the time , wrote the songs for " @entity18 " while ensconced at the @entity113 in march and april of 1962
the @entity109 - @entity115 team created @entity105 - caliber songs like " @entity117 " and " @entity118 , " which gave " @entity18 " an emotional quality which made it more theater than the cartoon it was
@entity124 presented as a play - within - a - play , the special features the character of @entity28 starring in a @entity105 production of " @entity71
" that little technique solved the producers ' dilemma regarding whether or not audiences would buy @entity28 as @entity133
" @entity28 had kind of changed over the years , " explained @entity34
" he had started out as this crotchety old man and over the years he had become softer
[ producers ] thought it would be kind of weird to put this character in a role with no explanation
nowadays people do it routinely and you do n't think twice about it , but at the time it was a big leap
originally , mr. @entity28 was going to be in a small community theater production , but as the songs got bigger , they decided to make it a @entity105 production with him as a well - known actor
" although " @entity18 " was released on @entity149 / dvd as a special anniversary edition , @entity34 is the first to admit that the animation is n't what resonates with longtime fans of the special
" the animation fills the bill , but there is n't anything in the way of nice motion or defining the characters through the way they move , " said @entity34
" it 's all about simply hitting their marks to tell the story
it 's a little rough around the edges , but it works , too
the songs are so good that you overlook stuff like that
" @entity34 pointed out that the important thing is that the special " has a lot of heart
" in fact , the instant the special ended on the night it premiered , producer @entity177 's phone rang
@entity182 had phoned to tell @entity177 how wonderful it was
@entity34 wrote about the conversation in his book
" let me tell you something , @entity187 , " @entity182 told @entity177
" not only is this generation going to watch it , but your children , your children 's children and your children 's children 's children will watch this show
that 's how good it is
" @entity182 's stamp of approval was the ultimate gold star
" here 's this guy that practically invented animation as we know it , " @entity96 told @entity0 , " who takes the time out of his day to watch it and call this guy up and tell him how much he liked it
" much to the dismay of fans , a " @entity18 " soundtrack has never been released
plans for a storybook record were scrapped , and the audio master tapes are long gone
@entity34 said there 's a chance they 've simply been mislabeled and are somewhere in the vaults
" we 're still looking for them and hopefully one day there will be a @entity224 release , " he said
@entity34 also explained that the cast and crew had no idea that " @entity28 " was destined to become a classic
" everyone who worked on this simply thought they were doing a special for that year , " he said
" nobody thought it was going to last as long as it did
everyone was surprised it did as well as it did
they were so happy with it they aired it for the next five years and it was still getting good ratings
the second year it got better ratings than the first
" the @entity246 fans of " @entity18 " remain dedicated to keeping their beloved special 's memory alive
at a december 2009 screening at @entity250 in @entity251 , many of those in attendance sang along and called out lines similar to midnight screenings of " the @entity256
" ( but with far fewer fishnets , one would imagine
) " the fans are very dedicated , " said @entity34
" those who remember it remember it very well and are very passionate about it
so it 's exciting that @entity21 is putting it back on and it will be exposed to a whole new generation of viewers
" that whole new generation of viewers may never grasp the concept of a television event
" it 's funny , is n't it , that tv specials have kind of disappeared , " said @entity34
" at one time a special was special
there used to be just three networks and when someone did something unique , everyone knew about it and they set aside time to watch it
but now we have access to everything at any time of the day , at any place in the world , and you can watch it on a postage stamp or a screen almost as big as a movie theater screen
" but back in the 1960s of course , @entity96 pointed out , if you missed your favorite @entity12 special you were forced to wait for the next airing
" you only had that one chance , and then 52 weeks later you could see it again
