this week , as the @entity1 decides whether to reauthorize the @entity2 and @entity4 approaches , it 's worth noting that most domestic violence victims do n't ask for roses , chocolate or federal funding
instead , we have one simple wish : we want the abuse to end
we do n't want the relationship to end
this fact about " crazy love " surprises many people
how could you still love someone who has hurt you ? the answer is as complicated as love itself
we victims tend to be hope junkies , open - hearted and optimistic
we believe that our loved ones are capable of change
some would say we are na√Øve
others say we are too kind or too forgiving
often we can not find the courage to leave an abusive relationship until our life ( or our children 's safety ) has been threatened
when victims end an abusive relationship , the first thing we need is shelter
this is the no. 1 request made by victims who call the @entity38 , the federally funded national helpline ( @entity40 )
it is a practical request -- a roof over our heads
but it is also an emotional one -- the deep need to seek safety and to protect our children from danger
watch @entity50 's @entity49 many victims know instinctively what friends and family usually do n't : the most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after you leave
more than 70 % of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out
like 20 - year - old @entity60 , who was shot in the face last year as she and her toddler daughter tried to board a bus
so safe shelter is , naturally , our biggest priority
the second most common request also surprises people -- even in a town like @entity70 , with nearly 100,000 lawyers
victims say that after immediate shelter , what we need most is legal advice and representation
any woman who is going to turn herself from domestic violence victim to a domestic violence survivor needs this service
@entity81 : unlock the intelligence , passion , greatness of girls i should know
i come from a family of @entity89 - educated lawyers
yet , when i left my abusive ex-husband -- an @entity92 @entity91 trader who kept three loaded guns in our house -- i had no one to accompany me to family court to get my temporary restraining order made permanent , and no one to help me begin divorce proceedings
so i went to court alone
fortunately , a young legal aid attorney from a local women 's shelter showed up
she spoke to my husband and the judge
she pointed me in the direction of the bullet - proof glass window where my new restraining order awaited
she recommended a divorce lawyer i could hire immediately
thanks to her , and dozens of other strangers who helped me , i left my ex-husband
today i 'm happily remarried and the mother of three wonderful children
i have a black lab and drive a @entity118 minivan
i could n't have left and rebuilt such an ordinary , happy life without the kindness of others
@entity81 : poems of war , peace , women , power here in @entity70 , 700 registered pro bono lawyers have joined forces with a new nonprofit , the @entity129
it now has more attorneys than @entity70 's largest law firm
the lawyers are typically stay - at - home moms craving volunteer work that puts their legal training to good use
@entity81 : tales of passion the volunteer lawyers ' group provides mentoring , training , court appearance scheduling and malpractice insurance , all within a $ 350,000 annual budget , which is tiny considering it serves a city of more than 600,000 people
since its founding , it has helped more than 2,000 family violence survivors
in 2012 , its lawyers donated more than 14,000 pro bono legal hours
i call that true love
this @entity4 , i 'd like to call on all lawyers in @entity70 and elsewhere to consider helping stop domestic violence for good
the d.c. volunteer lawyers project model can be replicated in any small town or big city
by giving victims a little pro bono assistance , lawyers can help make our nation 's dinner tables , homes and families the safe and peaceful oases they should be
by giving a small amount of time , like the advocate who helped me so many years ago , we can all help victims of domestic violence
now that 's a @entity4 present we can all get mushy about .
