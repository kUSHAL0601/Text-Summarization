@entity0 , @entity1 -- funeral services for the sons of @entity5 are scheduled for early saturday afternoon in @entity0 , @entity1 , where authorities say @entity5 set his house on fire , killing all three of them
services for 7 - year - old @entity11 and 5 - year - old @entity12 will be held at the @entity13 and will be open to the public , according to @entity15 , an attorney for the @entity16
@entity5 was a suspect in the 2009 disappearance of his wife , @entity18
his two sons died sunday along with @entity5 in what police believe was a murder - suicide
a social worker brought the boys to @entity5 's home for a court - ordered supervised visit , authorities said
but as they approached the door , @entity5 pushed the social worker back , took the boys inside and locked the door
" he blew up the house and the kids ! " the social worker shouted in a 911 call released late tuesday by @entity37 , spokesman for the @entity38
@entity5 took the children and slammed the door in her face , she said
" i thought it was a mistake
i kept knocking and then i called 911
" the powerful blast shook houses , with debris landing on lawns blocks away
minutes before he wounded his two young sons with a hatchet and set his house ablaze , @entity5 left a last voicemail to family members
" i am not able to live without my sons , and i 'm not able to go on anymore , " he said , according to @entity52 , which obtained the voice mail
" i 'm sorry to everyone i 've hurt
" investigators found the hatchet they believe was used on the boys in @entity59 , @entity1 , home , said @entity37
authorities believe @entity5 set an explosive fire there after wounding the boys sunday afternoon
autopsies showed his sons suffered " chop " injuries to their necks , but both boys and their father died from inhaling carbon monoxide , the county medical examiner 's office said
before dousing his home with gasoline and setting it ablaze , @entity5 gave toys and books to charity and sent multiple goodbye e-mails
that evidence suggests that @entity5 planned the deaths for some time , @entity37 said -- " i believe this was intentional
" it was a gruesome development in a saga that began two years ago in the @entity87 suburb of @entity88 , @entity89 , when 28 - year - old @entity18 disappeared
@entity91 interviews @entity18 's sister the farewell e-mails @entity5 sent included one to his attorney , saying simply : " i 'm sorry
" he also sent e-mails to his pastor and others just minutes before the fire , giving instructions on how to handle his end - of - life business , according to @entity37
the sheriff 's department has copies of some of the e-mails sent to the attorney , family and friends , in which he said " he could n't live with what was going on , " @entity37 said
the spokesman added that authorities found two 5 - gallon cans of gasoline in the home , one of which appeared to have been lit right next to the bodies , which were found together in the same room
the deaths of @entity5 and the children could mean @entity18 's disappearance might never be solved
still , the case remains open and investigators vowed to pursue it until the point of closure
follow a timeline of the case " i promised the @entity130 i was n't giving up , and i 'm still not because we want to get some closure here , " @entity88 , @entity89 , police chief @entity129 said monday
" the case is still active ; we 're not closing the case
we still got things that have not been resolved
" @entity18 - @entity5 's sister , @entity18 , told @entity2 on tuesday she had been told by her family that @entity5 could be arrested within a few weeks and that authorities were attempting to build a case against him despite the lack of a body
" we were all excited that something was going to happen , " she said , adding the family was hoping that a deal could be made or @entity5 could be coerced to divulge his wife 's whereabouts
in the meantime , @entity5 , who had not been arrested or charged , was embroiled in an ugly custody dispute with the @entity16
in recent months , the children had started opening up and talking about what happened the night their mother disappeared , members of the @entity18 family said
" they basically kept saying how they went on a vacation in the desert , and camping ... they stopped at some place , and @entity157 and @entity158 left , and only @entity158 came back , " @entity151 , @entity18 's mother , told @entity159 's " today " on tuesday
@entity160 , @entity18 's father , told " today " that the younger boy , @entity12 , had drawn a picture of the family 's minivan
asked who was in the minivan , the child told his teachers " that was his daddy , @entity11 and himself , and that @entity157 was in the trunk , " he said
but , @entity18 told @entity52 's " @entity173 , " the boys ' remarks were inconsistent
" when i would say , ' well , @entity158 said @entity157 stayed home ' ( from the camping trip ) , then they would go back to , ' i do n't remember , ' " a rehearsed , you know , a coached statement , " he said
authorities believe that by setting the fire , @entity5 not only killed his children -- he eliminated evidence in his wife 's disappearance
" those boys were evidence
those boys were going to be evidence against him , " @entity37 said
" you 're looking at somebody who 's willing to kill their own kids ... killing your wife is n't that much of a stretch from there
" asked whether she believes @entity5 's motive was the custody battle or remarks made by the children , @entity151 told " today " she felt it was both
" he was feeling cornered , " she said
" ... basically , he did n't like us , and he wanted to get the kids away from us so much , " she said
" it really bothered him that the boys were showing such affection to @entity160
" according to investigators , @entity5 had said the last time he saw his wife was the night he and his sons -- then ages 2 and 4 -- left to go camping after midnight in freezing weather
@entity18 's sister eventually reported her missing
a month later , @entity5 and his children moved from @entity89 to @entity1
the double homicide and suicide on sunday came days after a judge refused @entity5 's petition to regain custody of his children
the judge instead ordered @entity5 undergo psychological evaluations -- an order that came after authorities turned up child pornography in the home @entity5 shared with his father , @entity224
as part of the investigation into @entity18 's disappearance , a search of the home was conducted last year
during the search , investigators " discovered numerous images and recordings of adult and juvenile females , " according to a statement released by the @entity38 sheriff 's department
@entity224 was subsequently charged with 14 counts of voyeurism and one count of possessing images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct , according to court documents
he remained jailed and on suicide watch on tuesday , @entity37 said
after the arrest of @entity5 's father , custody of his sons went to the @entity130 , according to @entity1 state court records
@entity5 maintained in court documents filed last week that he established his own home after his father 's arrest and had " consistently proven my fitness as a stable and loving parent under close supervision by ( child welfare caseworkers )
" the @entity130 said they were concerned about @entity5 's having visitation , but noted that several previous visitations were uneventful
however , they were worried about the first visitation after the court 's ruling , @entity160 said on " today
" " we knew that if he was cornered and felt like there was no way out , that he was capable of this , " he said of @entity224
the couple had communicated their concerns to police and child welfare workers , he said
" i understand they have a lot of people and they deal with a lot of people who exaggerate the threat -- cry wolf , if you will , " he said
but , given the circumstances , " we felt they should have taken more care
" @entity2 's @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity288 's @entity287 and @entity289 contributed to this report .
