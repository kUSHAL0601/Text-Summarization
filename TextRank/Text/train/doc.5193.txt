-- when @entity3 all - star @entity2 announced earlier this month he was just finishing a 15 - day fast , it caught even his closest allies off - guard
everyone from @entity7 coach @entity6 to teammate @entity8 said they had no idea @entity2 was on a special diet
others were skeptical : could a professional athlete really survive , much less perform , without eating for 15 days ? it turns out , he probably did n't
@entity2 cut out meat and carbohydrates but did take in some calories , according to media reports
nutritionists say he was pushing his luck , even with that modified version
" athletes need a regular intake of carbohydrates and protein , not only to fuel their activity , but to recover , " says @entity22 , a sports dietitian from @entity23 who works with professional basketball , baseball and football players
your brain on food : obesity , fasting and addiction @entity38 , a sports dietitian at the @entity40 @entity39 in @entity41 , suspects he might have simply cut out meat or tried some kind of liquid diet : " with a no - food fast for 15 days , we would have seen a noticeable change in his body , and we did n't
" @entity51 says a serious athlete should forget fasting altogether -- " if you 're on a quarter tank of gas , you 're not going to compete well " -- but if you do decide to try fasting for religious or other reasons , there are a few things to keep in mind
remember fluids if you choose to avoid food for any length of time , you still need to stay hydrated
the human body can function fairly well for up to three days without food , but you should n't go even a few hours without ingesting water or juice , say nutritionists
keep it short it takes about three days without food for the body to go into an unhealthy starvation mode -- less if you do n't have a big meal before the big fast , according to @entity75
it takes about a day for the body to run through stored carbohydrates and start to burn fat and protein for energy
burning fat may sound tempting , but around the three - day mark , it leads to a buildup in the bloodstream of acids known as ketones -- a condition known as ketosis , which can result in nausea , dizziness and stomach pain , along with severe bad breath
as days turn to weeks , it eventually leads to organ damage
a two - or three - day fast might not be dangerous , but even just a few hours without calories will impact performance , especially for an athlete
" as you get lower blood sugar , you 're feeling some fogginess and dizziness , even if you keep hydration up , " @entity75 says
" you can function , but there 's a point you realize where you 're not functioning optimally
" do n't fast to lose weight " i ca n't recommend fasting , " says @entity51 , a dietitian in @entity23
" if people want to do it for discipline or mental clarity , that 's ok
but my concern is for the other 360 days a year
" " you have to look at sustainability , " agrees @entity75
" a lot of people fast for a week , and all they think about is what they 'll binge on when they 're done
it 's not teaching anyone a healthy relationship with food
" plan carefully planning is critical when you place constraints on your diet
for example , last year during the monthlong @entity131 , @entity75 laid out a special meal plan for @entity136 fencing hopeful @entity134
during @entity131 , observant @entity137 avoid eating or drinking between dawn and dusk , so @entity75 focused on the narrow windows when @entity134 was allowed to eat
" we focused on foods that are really easy to digest and not overly fatty , " @entity75 says
" things like rice , applesauce and yogurt -- everything in small chunks of food
" even so , @entity134 cut back her training during @entity131 , backing off when she felt tired or dizzy
@entity75 notes that planning can be even tougher for people juggling jobs and families
fasting is n't for everyone some people should never fast : pregnant women , anyone on medication that needs to be taken with food and diabetics -- not to mention anyone else with a medical condition that requires regular food intake
@entity51 adds that people younger than 18 should also never fast
" they 're still growing and developing , and it can also set up psychological issues with food
" @entity170 's resolution or not , @entity2 said last week in @entity171 he is starting to get his energy back and that he does n't regret the experiment
" it was just something i wanted to do
i think at times in life you just need clarity on some things and you just want to rebuild your body up , and rebuild your mind , and just clear everything up , and start afresh
" with a wide smile , he added , " i 'm back eating now ! " @entity137 @entity184 wrestle with @entity131 dilemma despite daily @entity131 fast , @entity137 nfler trains for season
