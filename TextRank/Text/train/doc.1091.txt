@entity0 -- holding back tears of nervousness , @entity2 accepted @entity6 's first peace prize thursday at a hotel conference room in @entity0 , a day before the @entity9 honors imprisoned @entity6 dissident @entity10 as this year 's peace laureate in @entity12
the six - year - old local girl received a trophy and a certificate in front of a sea of television cameras from the organizers of the @entity20 , which also comes with an award of $ 15,000
the ceremony 's hosts said @entity2 was chosen to accept the award on behalf of @entity25 , the real winner and @entity27 's former vice president , because " children symbolize peace and future
" members of the prize jury said @entity25 , who they deemed had made major contributions to bridging the gap between @entity27 and mainland @entity6 , could not attend the event for " reasons known to everyone " -- but apparently not to the recipient himself
" we know who @entity42 is , but do n't know anything about this prize , " @entity39 , director of @entity25 's office in @entity41 , told @entity1 earlier
the hour - long award ceremony and press conference appeared thrown together at the last minute , jarred by microphone malfunction , awkward moments of silence and egregious @entity52 interpretation errors
none of these factors seemed to have deterred the organizers , who promised to make this an annual event
brushing aside suggestions that their prize was meant to counter the @entity61 award , the head of the jury insisted their focus to be promoting the ancient @entity6 sage 's philosophy
" @entity6 is a great nation that has been influenced by the @entity71 concept of peace for a long time , " @entity67 , chairman of the prize committee , told @entity1 before the ceremony
" we want to promote world peace from an @entity77 perspective
" " @entity79 is full of small countries that had fought each other for centuries , " he added
" we do n't want to see people who do n't understand peace to ruin the concept
" other members of the jury launched tirades against the @entity89 , accusing it of destabilizing northeast @entity91 for staging war games in the region amid current tensions on the @entity95
@entity67 declined to give details about his group -- other than stressing it is a non-government organization and the prize money came from an anonymous donor -- or how the five judges selected the nominees and the eventual winner
candidates for this year 's @entity42 prize included @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109 , a @entity110 leader loyal to @entity0
of the eight nominees , only a @entity6 poet , @entity111 , showed up and said it was a great honor to be chosen along with the other men
@entity6 has responded furiously since the @entity61 committee announced its decision on october 8
officials have repeatedly called @entity10 -- currently serving an 11 - year sentence for " inciting subversion " -- a common criminal and the award a @entity123 plot against @entity6
a businessman first proposed a rival peace prize in a commentary on the november 17 edition of @entity128 , an @entity52 newspaper published by the @entity130 mouthpiece @entity131
echoing government spokesmen , @entity132 said that by awarding the prize to a criminal , the @entity61 committee created 1.3 billion " dissidents " in @entity6
" we often stress the need to fight for the right to speak , " he wrote
" @entity6 's civil society should consider setting up a ' @entity20 ' ... to declare @entity6 's view on peace and human rights to the world
" the @entity89 @entity145 wednesday overwhelmingly passed a non-binding resolution to praise @entity10 , prompting strong condemnation from @entity0
" we urge relevant @entity89 lawmakers to realize their mistake , change their arrogant and unreasonable attitude and show respect for the @entity6 people and national sovereignty , " said @entity148 , a foreign ministry spokeswoman
back at the @entity42 award ceremony , organizers refused to say if they will watch friday 's @entity61 event
despite the perceived rivalry between the two peace prizes , they seem to have one important thing in common -- the absence of their recipients at this year 's award ceremonies .
