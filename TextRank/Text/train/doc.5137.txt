-- over the past couple of weeks , i have been asking random people who identify as @entity4 if they trust @entity5 , and each of them gave me an answer like this -- " i trust him more than i trust @entity10
" it 's just a long winded way of saying " no. " they said they did want to see his taxes
they said they have reservations about a major tax plan lacking specifics
some said they saw the video of him describing himself as a pro-abortion rights moderate ; others knew that in the hardcover version of his book " no apology , " he expressed pride in @entity31 and believed that " we can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country
" they know he flip flops
and yet , their dislike of president @entity10 is so strong that they 're willing to overlook that whole character thing and swallow the bitter pill that is @entity5
how can they do that , you say ? well for starters , @entity10 is n't exactly a rock of @entity49 himself
@entity55 's " @entity54 " has been keeping track of the more than 500 promises the president made during the 2008 campaign and found thus far he 's kept 37 % of them
he 's broken 16 % , compromised on 14 % and is still working on another 22 %
so even though @entity5 smells , @entity10 's not exactly lilacs
he promised to address gun control
he promised to close @entity58
@entity10 was for gay marriage , then he was against it , and now he 's for it again
if you believe his evolution was n't about politics , then you probably believe @entity66 was robbed in 1980
this is why some @entity4 are willing to vote for a guy they may not trust : he 's viewed as the lesser of two evils
but pointing out the evils in the other party does nothing to address the evils in their own
here 's the thing : the question of trusting @entity5 has nothing to do with @entity10
voters might not like to think about that too much , but they need to look beyond campaign sleight of hand to give it some serious thought because the future of the middle class depends on it
this week , both @entity5 and vp hopeful @entity88 have been touting a multitrillion dollar tax - cutting plan with no details , essentially asking voters to take it on faith that it 'll all work out
many conservative pundits , including @entity96 , say @entity5 's math -- where it exists -- is a bit fuzzy and all @entity5 can say is " trust me
" so again , i ask @entity4 : do you ? not in comparison to @entity10 , but in comparison to your understanding of the word trust
knowing what you know -- and do n't know
because if he wins , saying " i trust him more than i trust @entity10 " is not going to help matters in january
it 's not going to protect the middle class ' ability to write off the interest on their mortgages or deduct charitable giving
@entity5 said the plan wo n't touch those deductions , but he wo n't tell us which deductions it will touch
trust him with our taxes , he says
and yet , he wo n't trust us to even look at his
at the @entity125 , @entity5 's wife , @entity124 , painted a picture of their early years together as if the two of them were barely getting by
and then an old @entity131 interview surfaced in which she said " we were happy , studying hard
neither one of us had a job , because @entity5 had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time
" realizing that struggling college students work and do n't usually live off investments , she backed away from her earlier characterization , telling " @entity141 " later that , " @entity5 and i do recognize that we have not had a financial struggle in our lives
" @entity148 ... you do know that she did n't just realize this , right ? you do know that her speech was designed to manipulate voters in an attempt to paint her husband as a regular @entity154 , a guy just like them , someone they could trust
so ... do you ? do you trust @entity5 ? @entity10 has only kept 37 % of his promises
but @entity55 's @entity158 , which they describe as having followed " dozens of promises made in 2010 by @entity125 leaders " and in their pledge to @entity161 , found that the @entity4 has only kept 19 % of its promises
if you ca n't trust a guy who has only kept 37 % of his promises , how do you trust leaders that have only kept 19 % of theirs ? better yet , how do you trust a guy , who as governor of @entity169 , signed an assault weapon ban in 2004 , reiterated his support for a ban in 2007 and then shows up at an @entity174 convention in 2012 talking like some sort of @entity177 wannabe ? i do n't think you can
which i guess is why many @entity4 have a hard time saying they do
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .
