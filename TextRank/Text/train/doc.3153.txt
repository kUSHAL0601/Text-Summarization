he 's getting every last drop out of his forecast of six more weeks of winter
just as the jonquils and tulips are poking their leaves above ground , a monster of a storm is sweeping across the @entity12 , up the @entity13 and into the @entity14
look at these snowfall predictions with the official start of spring just over a week away
@entity18 - area commuters could be facing up to 8 inches of fresh new snow as they head to work wednesday

out @entity45 , the weather 's warming up , but even that comes with problems
the melt from a heavier - than - normal snowpack has turned into flooding along the @entity52 in north - central @entity53 , forcing folks from their homes
" we actually have about 60 residences that we 've evacuated , " @entity57 police chief @entity56 told @entity0 affiliate @entity58
" probably around 80 people who reside in those residences
" police are preparing for the worst , he said
" the area 's just getting larger and larger and further northbound , " according to @entity56
" so it 's definitely expanding as we speak
