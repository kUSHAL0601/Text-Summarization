-- @entity1 , producer of " @entity2 , " is under heat for his live - tweet - turned - hoax aboard @entity5 over @entity6 weekend
his live tweets about a feud with a disgruntled passenger went viral and garnered him tons of attention and sympathy
turned out the whole thing was made up
@entity1 admitted it on @entity14
should @entity1 not have made up the woman in 7a whom he called @entity16 ? maybe
but then again he 's in the creative industry
to me , what 's more fascinating is how quick we are to jump on any interesting human interaction
@entity1 conceived of a short story on @entity14 and it was so good that hungry media outlets seized on it and spread the story like wildfire
if @entity1 wanted publicity , he got it
if the media wanted a good and verified story , it should have done its job of fact - checking
@entity1 just happened to live - tweet a fiction
but the bigger issue is : is it ok to live - tweet other people 's conversations ? based on my own experiences , i 'd say yes , to an extent
a few weeks ago , it was an unusually warm night in @entity42
i had a friend in town and we went up to the roof to enjoy the view
more groups of people came up and cluttered the smallish space
suddenly a couple burst on to the roof
simply put , they began breaking up on the roof , in front of everyone
it all seemed so familiar to me , the back and forth , the arguing between the couple
i 'll tweet out what they 're saying , i thought
i did n't think too much about it
it just seemed like a relatable situation
the breakup , # roofbreakup as it became known , started to pick up steam , and eventually went viral
i began to receive messages and tweets and e-mails from all over the world , with the overwhelming majority expressing their delight and joy in reading the tweet - sized transcript
but not everyone condones this behavior
@entity77 , a social media content editor at @entity79 , posted an essay on medium entitled , " please stop live - tweeting people 's private conversations
" @entity77 mentions my # roofbreakup , @entity1 's airplane feud ( before it was revealed to be a hoax ) , a date someone overheard on @entity88 , and the time where @entity90 overheard former @entity93 director @entity92 's phone conversation with reporters
@entity77 says she believes it to be " unethical and unfair to regular people to broadcast their lives to an audience against their will
" she 's right in some ways
however , except in the case of @entity92 , the people in her examples are anonymous
they just as easily could have been fiction , as in the case of @entity1 's airplane feud , where the characters existed in an invented scenario to evoke people 's sympathy
but there is no harm if a conversation with universal appeal is shared publicly as long as the people remain anonymous
for example , with my own live - tweeting of # roofbreakup , i did n't give any clues as to who the couple were
when sifting through the endless responses sent my way in the wake of # roofbreakup , time and time again i came across " oh i 've been there before " and " sounds like my last breakup
" the only explanation for the level of exposure that my # roofbreakup got is that people connected with the situation
it was gossiping in the 21st century , except instead of using specifics and pointing out the people , it remained " guy " and " @entity138
" i did n't live - tweet a couple 's private conversation ; i live - tweeted any two people 's breakup conversation
technology is quickly changing our lives and we are adapting accordingly
it 's so easy to communicate and share information and knowledge instantly
and now we have to deal with having private conversations in public spaces
but private and public are not always distinctly drawn lines
sometimes the two mesh and things get blurry
as humans , we 're intrigued with the lives of other people
when other people 's lives parallel ours , we feel less alone in the world
just as often as you read a headline about a natural disaster , you will see a headline about a personal disaster
elaborate proposal videos go viral daily
couples fighting in public get on @entity171
go ahead and share the story you overheard on the street or cafe , just make sure to not give away the personal identities
a story with no specific names attached is no less fake than fiction
you may wonder : did the # roofbreakup really happen ? you can believe me or not , but i promise you it did
had i witnessed the breakup on my roof five or six years ago , i would have told everyone i knew about the crazy exchange
i would have walked back into my apartment and re-enacted it for my then roommates , embellishing and recalling every line i possibly could
but i witnessed the breakup in 2013 , and i communicated it in a way that seemed just as normal as any other
it just happens that i can tell the story to more people
