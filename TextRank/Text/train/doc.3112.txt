-- smartphones inch closer to becoming remote controls for your life at next week 's 2013 @entity4 in @entity5
the annual event is the largest gadget conference in the world , where major technology companies and scrappy startups can show off their latest innovations
if the show sets the tone for the year 's technology , 2013 will be about watching tv on your 5 - inch smartphone while your self - driving car ferries you to work
companies will continue to try to connect everything to the @entity22 -- lights , power outlets , cars , cameras , kitchen appliances -- and allow you to control them from a mobile device
there have been some big changes at this year 's conference
longtime headliner @entity34 has dropped out of @entity4 , and mobile devices are increasingly saving their big announcements for the @entity39 event in february
but hopefully the void is filled by exciting discoveries and gadgets we ca n't predict
television : it 's about the content there will be wide , thin , innovative tvs at @entity4
they will have glorious high - resolution oled screens and cost way too much money for the average consumer , when and if they become available
@entity54 is teasing a tv that is a possibly a new shape or translucent , and @entity56 has a 110 - inch led tv with @entity58
but the big television story this year will be the industry 's continuing quest to break out of these beautiful boxes and move onto tablets and smartphones
how people consume content has changed drastically in the past few years
they are cutting cords with the cable companies and signing up for on - demand services such as @entity70 and @entity71 , or buying shows and movies through @entity74 or @entity75
viewers want to watch tv on their smartphones and tablets
they are multitasking , watching the " @entity80 " while commenting on @entity79
in response , television companies will attempt to connect tvs to the @entity22 and share content between mobile devices , set - top boxes and televisions
home automation and the art of connecting everything there is very little in your home that wo n't be connected to the internet if electronics manufacturers have their say
cheap sensors are making it easy to turn devices you 've used without much thought into " smart " devices that do a bit of the thinking for you
connected devices for the home and your health will be plentiful at @entity4
thanks to impeccable design , the nest automated thermostat was one of the first commercial hits in this area , though others had tried integrating automation into existing home gadgets before
this year , smartphones will be on a bit of a power trip , getting apps to control home security , unlock doors , conserve energy and tinker with lighting
cars get smarter and go online auto companies will have a larger presence at @entity4 this year , with @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and others showing off technology to make cars smarter
there will be self - driving and assisted - driving cars , which use a combination of mounted cameras , sensors and gps to can take the wheel completely or just help a driver into a tight parking spot
vehicles are connecting to the @entity22 to improve navigation , better monitor a car 's performance and alert the driver to maintenance needs
they are also taking a cue from ( and synching with ) smartphones
cars will continue to integrate apps , voice control and entertainment into the dash , some even running on the @entity159 operating system
the hot smartphone size is 5 inches mobile device unveilings probably will be at a minimum this year , since the major companies are saving their big announcements for the @entity39 conference in @entity166 next month
there will be a few smartphones making their debut next week , though , and for the most part , they will have nearly identical specs : @entity159 , 5 - inch 1080p display , quad - core processor , 13 - megapixel camera
a few entries could mix it up , including a rumored 6.1 - inch @entity179 device from @entity180 and the company 's first @entity183 handset , the @entity184
smartphone accessories will flood the floor , with the usual glut of headphones , cases and stands
touchscreen computers and cheap tablets last year 's hot computer was the super-thin ultrabook laptop , but that category has cooled down significantly
this year , the spotlight will be on tablet / laptop hybrids running @entity198
the new @entity200 operating system is built for touchscreen computers , and manufacturers seem to be having some fun with the form factor
( check out the @entity206 and @entity205
) cheap , sub- $ 100 7 - inch @entity159 tablets will still abound , but like smartphones , there wo n't be much in the way of innovation as companies hold back until february
room for smaller , innovative companies the big players lying low presents a great opportunity for the smaller exhibitors to get noticed and make connections
this year , innovative technology will come from unexpected places as smaller companies such as @entity222 , a smart - watch company that got started as a @entity225 campaign , debut products
now that it 's easier for a small operation to raise money and manufacture a physical product on a budget , the gadget market is ripe for a shakeup
some big - name startups will also have a presence
@entity236 will be on the floor , and its motion - sensing technology will appear in @entity206 notebooks this year
@entity240 will return this year after making a splash with its @entity243 game tablet in 2012 .
