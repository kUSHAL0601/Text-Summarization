-- a rural @entity2 community will say goodbye tuesday to seven children who were killed when their parent 's farmhouse went up in flames last week
the children -- ages 7 months to 11 years -- died march 8 when the fire fully engulfed the @entity12 family 's two - story house in @entity13 , about 25 miles northwest of @entity14
their parents were both outside the house at the time of the fire
mother @entity19 was milking cows in the barn and father @entity22 was making deliveries on his milk route
" while mom 's milking cows , her 3 - year - old daughter comes running into the barn and the 3 - year - old tells the mother that there 's smoke inside the house , " @entity25 of the state police said last week
" @entity33 leaves the barn , comes running out , sees that the house appears to be on fire
" the mother went to two neighbors ' houses before she could get someone to call 911 , he said
she then found her husband sleeping in his milk truck and they rushed back to the home to find their home engulfed in flames and firefighters trying to put out the blaze
the children -- six girls and a boy -- were found dead inside the house
the 3 - year - old was the only child who survived
the funeral is scheduled for the @entity54 in @entity55
@entity56 will be at the church of the @entity59 cemetery
the fire sent shock waves through the central @entity2 community
" it 's just hard to explain how somebody could lose their whole family in a wink of an eye like that , " @entity63 , who works at an insurance company in @entity13 , said last week
" it 's just unbelievable
" " everybody i 've talked to here ... has felt a lot of sympathy toward these people
it 's a real shame the way things like that happen , " he said .
