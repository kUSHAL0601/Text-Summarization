just days before the @entity2 committee announces the winner of this year 's @entity4 , the world found out who stands at the opposite extreme on the quest for peace and justice
we have discovered who the biggest cowards on the planet are today
the competition for the mark of shame is hard fought , but the title goes to the men who approached a van carrying girls home from school in @entity22 on tuesday and asked for one very special 14 - year - old
then shot her in the head
the world 's worst cowards are the members of the @entity22 @entity28
perhaps they believe their thick dark beards , dangerous weapons and fanatical religious pronouncement make them fierce warriors
but their actions tell the true story : the @entity22 @entity28 are terrified of a 14 - year - old girl named @entity37
and why are they so afraid of @entity37 ? mostly , because she is not afraid of them
and because @entity37 is a relentless advocate of education for girls , something the @entity28 find very threatening
the @entity28 , with all their bravado , seem to fear women most of all
news : @entity22 enraged over attack on teen blogger the cravenness that has come to define the group -- also known as the @entity53 , or @entity53 -- is easily matched by @entity37 's stunning bravery
the fearless activist for girls ' education now lies in a hospital bed trying to recover from serious injuries to her head and neck
overnight doctors performed emergency surgery to remove a bullet near her spinal cord and to relieve swelling in her brain
@entity37 knew she was on a @entity53 hit list , but she did not back down
the @entity28 , whose religious , social and political views are founded on a brutally anti-woman ideology , can not countenance even a young girl challenging their ideas on a blog
shortly after tuesday 's assassination attempt , which also left two of @entity37 's school friends wounded , @entity53 spokesman @entity76 acknowledged the group tried to kill her and vowed they will try to do it again if she survives
as is common , he couched the threats in extreme interpretations of @entity86 and on repression and intimidation of women
" any female that , by any means , plays a role in the war against the mujahedeen , " @entity76 declared , " should be killed
" news : ' @entity97 ' -- a chorus of support across the world the @entity53 spokesman called @entity37 's advocacy for education " a new chapter of obscenity , " adding , " we have to finish this chapter
" he also accused her of being pro-west and admiring president @entity108
@entity37 started to become a problem for the @entity53 when she was just 11
the @entity22 @entity28 , who hold the same ideology but are not directly affiliated with the @entity112 @entity28 , had taken over @entity22 's @entity113
@entity22 politicians were turning a blind eye to what had become an increasingly brutal regime
they executed their critics , ordered all men to grow beards and whipped women in public as punishment for real , imagined or fabricated offenses
it was all about imposing their will , their version of @entity86 law , and subjugating the entire population , but women in particular
the @entity28 reportedly had destroyed more than 200 schools and ordered all girls ' schools shut down when @entity37 slowly emerged from obscurity
in 2009 , she started writing a blog for the @entity138 under a pseudonym , talking about her dreams for the future and how the @entity28 were pushing those aspirations further and further out of reach

at about the same time , the videotaped beating of a 17 - year - old girl by a group of @entity28 went viral in @entity22 , adding chilling images to a girl 's lament
until then , @entity22 had treated the fight against the @entity28 as an @entity158 problem , something going on across the border in @entity112
@entity37 helped @entity22 realize their own country , their own way of life were threatened by the @entity53
the government fought back and regained control of the region
she continued to speak out and was the first recipient of her country 's @entity168 last year
she and her cause became celebrated throughout the country , and increasingly despised by extremists and their supporters
rural areas of @entity22 and the districts near the @entity112 border include deeply traditional regions from where the @entity28 took much of their social views
many practices , particularly regarding women , are horrifying to more modern @entity22 living in places such as the capital , @entity183
the country has become a dangerous incubator of fanatically enforced prejudice
a prominent politician who opposed @entity22 's controversial blasphemy laws was killed last year
just last month a @entity190 girl was sent to prison after her neighbors concocted blasphemy charges against her
the country has become one of the front lines of the struggle between modernity and the deeply intolerant , misogynistic practices dating back centuries
@entity37 , despite her young age , stands at the battle line of the push for equality
@entity206 : your views on girls ' education the rule of the @entity28 in @entity112 between 1996 and 2001 showed just how the outcome in @entity22 could affect everyone , but especially women 's lives
the @entity53 aims to impose precisely the kind of rules the @entity28 forced on @entity112
@entity112 women were barred from working , studying , leaving their homes without a male companion
even laughing out loud was prohibited
they became nonentities , stoned and beheaded at the local stadium , banned from showing their faces , speaking their voices or earning a living
in 2002 , just after the regime was toppled , a @entity229 study of mental health in the country found a vast majority of @entity112 women suffering from depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder
a decade later , in bordering @entity22 , in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against @entity37 , many question if the threat has receded to the extent the authorities claim
by trying to kill a bright and admired young girl in cold blood , the @entity28 have revealed not only their own moral makeup
they have also reawakened the @entity22 people to the threat posed by extremists and the choices the country faces
@entity22 are pressuring their populist politicians to speak out against the crime , to take sides
@entity22 is home to the world 's worst cowards
but it 's also @entity259 's home
let 's hope she makes it , and inspires many to follow in her small but indelible footsteps
there 's something -- and someone -- for the @entity2 committee to consider
join us on @entity271 / @entity270 .
