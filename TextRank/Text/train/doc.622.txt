-- @entity2 parents are suing their son 's school , alleging it watched him through his laptop 's webcam while he was at home and unaware he was being observed
@entity8 and @entity9 of @entity10 are suing the @entity11 , its board of directors and the superintendent
the parents allege the district unlawfully used its ability to access a webcam remotely on their son 's district - issued laptop computer
the lawsuit seeking class - action status was filed wednesday in @entity23
the suit said that on november 11 , an assistant principal at @entity26 told the plaintiffs ' son that he was caught engaging in " improper behavior " in his home and it was captured in an image via the webcam
according to the @entity37 ' complaint , neither they nor their son , @entity35 , were informed of the school 's ability to access the webcam remotely at any time
it is unclear what the boy was doing in his room when the webcam was activated or if any punishment was given out
@entity48 , a spokesman for the @entity11 , said the district would only remotely access a laptop if it were reported to be lost , stolen or missing
@entity48 said if there were such a report , the district first would have to request access from its technology and security department and receive authorization
then it would use the built - in security feature to take over the laptop and see whatever was in the webcam 's field of vision , potentially allowing it to track down the missing computer
@entity48 said parents and students were not explicitly told about this built - in security feature
to receive the laptop , the family had to sign an " acceptable - use " agreement
to take the laptop home , the family also would have to buy insurance for the computer
in an " acceptable - use " agreement , the families are made aware of the school 's ability to " monitor " the hardware , he said , but it stops short of explicitly explaining the security feature
he termed that a mistake
@entity48 added that mistakes might be made when combining technology and education in a cutting - edge way
all 2,300 students at the district 's two high schools were offered laptops to " enhance opportunities for ongoing collaboration and ensure that all students have 24/7 access to school - based resources , " according to a message on the superintendent 's web site , which the suit quoted
@entity48 said the district is proud of the laptop program and the ability to close the technology gap between students who have computers at home and those who do n't
but he acknowledged schools will have to take a step back to re-evaluate the policies and procedures surrounding the program
the @entity112 of @entity2 is n't involved in the litigation , but its director , @entity114 , criticized the school district 's action
" neither police nor school officials can enter a private home , physically or electronically , without an invitation or a warrant
the school district 's clandestine electronic eavesdropping violates constitutional privacy rights , intrudes on parents ' right to raise their children and may even be criminal under state and federal wiretapping laws , " @entity114 said " ... @entity131 's ' 1984 ' is an overused metaphor , but it applies here in spades
part of the school officials ' punishment should be to retake ninth - grade civics class
" @entity140 , a senior staff attorney for the @entity141 who specializes in electronic privacy , also said the school may have broken federal wire - tapping laws
he called the school district 's action " foolish and dangerous , " saying the matter could prove to be a warning to other districts
multiple requests for further comment from the @entity37 ' attorney , @entity151 of @entity152 , went unanswered .
