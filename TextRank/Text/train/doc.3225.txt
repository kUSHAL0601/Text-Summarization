my friend was just murdered under the guise of revolution
two unhinged people walked into a restaurant in sunny @entity8 and attacked my friend @entity9 and his partner , @entity10 , shooting them dead as they ate their lunch
they then turned and yelled something about it being the " start of the revolution , " witnesses said
they left behind a " @entity17 " flag and a swastika
they killed another person at a @entity20 and then themselves
these two did n't start a revolution
they just took the lives of two heroes
they tore fathers from children and turned wives into widows
they brought darkness into the lives of all who loved these two men and another bystander
they traumatized people who witnessed the tragedy
they left a scene of carnage for dozens of fellow police workers -- the fallen cops ' friends , colleagues -- to process emotionally and mentally
all for some perverse , horrific act masquerading as revolution
authorities say that the shooters viewed law enforcement as oppressive and that they had participated in anti-government protests
but you do n't start a revolution by ambushing two innocent men in a fast food restaurant
they were n't " big government henchmen
" they were two good cops
we may all have problems with cops sometimes
who has n't felt angry after getting pulled over ? and yeah , i know some cops are just plain bad
some are just out to push people around
some are drunk on their authority and try to dominate everyone they encounter
but anyone who knows any cops personally knows that those are the exceptions
because for the most part , cops are good folks simply doing our dirty work
they are the society 's janitors , taking out the trash and cleaning up the messes none of us want to deal with ourselves
like you and me , they work for a paycheck , only their office is a squad car , their market is something like the @entity92 and their briefcase is generally a 9 millimeter
unless you are in fact " a bad guy , " most of these men and women in uniform are n't making your life more difficult , they 're making it easier
they are not a target of your revolution ! whatever your desired revolution , it should n't take its power from cowardly acts of violence inflicted on the innocent
@entity9 's killers should be shunned in the public memory -- there is no cause that can redeem them
their brave victims are the ones to be honored and celebrated
my friend , @entity9 , was a dynamite guy
he was a riot to be around : kind and funny , capable of ridiculously juvenile behavior but also profound intellectual depth
@entity9 helped me build the shed in my backyard
he was a tireless worker , and once he was done with a job , he 'd be the one bringing you a lemonade
@entity9 was a family man , a devoted husband and dad , and with the birth of a daughter , he was relishing the joy of being a new father again after over a decade of raising his first two wonderful kids
he liked to swim with his kids in the backyard
he loved going dancing in clubs with his wife
he was remarkably patient in training and tolerating the family 's lovable but absolutely insane dog , @entity139
as a cop , @entity9 was top notch
when it came time for business , he was the first guy through the door , the one you would want showing up if you were in any kind of danger , because he was fearless and capable
and now @entity9 is dead , because two jerks decided they could n't patiently let the system work like the rest of us
they could n't control their impulses
they could n't act like adults
these were not heroes or revolutionaries
they were cowardly psychopaths who chose to throw a terrifying tantrum
if you 're frustrated with government , if you 're worried about the republic , if you 're convinced black helicopters are watching you in the night or there is something else under your skin , there 's something you can do : start a blog , write a book , go to a protest , join a cause , call a senator , call a talk show , run for office
do what people in a free society do , not what out - of - control adolescents in " @entity183 " would do
and if you just ca n't restrain yourself from going on a murderous rampage followed by your own cowardly suicide , do the rest of us a favor and do it in reverse order
shooting a cop does n't make you a revolutionary
it just makes things worse for everyone
thanks for making my life better than it would have been otherwise .
