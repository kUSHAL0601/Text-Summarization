-- a 4.0 - magnitude earthquake struck eastern @entity3 on saturday , one week after a similar but smaller tremor rattled the region , the @entity1 reported
the quake was centered 5 miles northwest of @entity8 and 6 miles southeast of @entity9 , the agency said
the quake 's epicenter was 55 miles east - southeast of @entity12 , and 145 miles northeast of @entity13
according to the preliminary estimate , the earthquake struck 1.4 miles deep
there was a lot of shaking " and a rumbling sound , " said @entity19 , a former @entity8 police chief running for sheriff of @entity21
" i could see the house move ... it seemed like the ground was moving
" the quake struck one day after @entity27 director @entity26 announced that work would be halted on a fluid - injection well in @entity8 , due to fears it could be contributing to a recent apparent spike in seismic activity in the area
according to the @entity41 @entity40 , an injection well " is a device that places fluid deep underground into porous rock formations , such as sandstone or limestone , or into or below the shallow soil layer
" the decision came after the state of @entity3 invited experts from @entity46 to collect more information about seismic activity in the area
the well is owned and permitted to @entity50 , a @entity8 company , according to the state
" while conclusive evidence can not link the seismic activity to the well , @entity26 has adopted an approach requiring prudence and caution regarding the site , " the department said in a press release
@entity60 -- ceo of @entity62 , an independent natural gas and oil exploration , production and marketing group that oversees the @entity50 well -- recently told @entity0 affiliate @entity67 that there 's full cooperation with experts , though he expressed grave doubts that the injection wells were to blame for the quakes
" we have approximately 1,000 wells between @entity3 and @entity76 and we 've never had a problem ... with an earthquake or spill , " @entity60 said
one of the @entity46 experts , dr. won - @entity80 , said that a problem could arise if fluid moves through the ground and affects " a weak fault , waiting to be triggered
" he explained the underground waste " slowly migrates " and could cause issues miles away , adding that the danger could persist for some time as the water travels and seeps down toward the fault
" in my opinion , yes , " the recent spate of earthquakes around @entity8 is related to this fluid - injection well , @entity80 claimed -- though there has been no definitive determination , by the state or authorities , indicating as much
there have been " moderately frequent " reports of earthquakes in northern @entity3 since the first one was reported in 1823 , the federal agency noted
a 1986 tremor , measuring magnitude 4.8 , caused some damage
another in 1998 measured a 4.5 and was centered in northwestern @entity76
according to the @entity107 , a 2.7 - magnitude earthquake struck around @entity8 around 1:24 a.m. on december 24
" no damage was reported , " the network said on its website
the state of @entity3 has documented 11 " seismic events " in 2011 -- each of them , at that point , of magnitude 2.7 or lower
the @entity117 noted that a 4.0 magnitude quake , like the one on saturday , releases approximately 40 times more energy than a 2.7 magnitude tremor
@entity8 police sgt. @entity121 said that the latest tremor " shook the whole building we were in , " but that there were no signs of significant damage in the city
that appeared to hold true elsewhere in the eastern @entity3 city , based on early post-quake surveys
" a lot of house alarms , it shook the buildings , " @entity121 said of the aftermath
" the fire department has n't reported any major damage
" within just over three hours of the quake , nearly 4,000 people from 357 zip codes and 23 cities -- including one as far as @entity143 , @entity144 , 515 miles from the epicenter -- had submitted reports to the @entity1 's " did you feel it ? " form on its website
@entity3 is far from the @entity152 's major tectonic plates , with the nearest ones in the @entity154 and the @entity155 , the @entity1 explains on its website
still , there are many known faults in this region , with the federal agency noting that it is likely there additional " smaller or deeply buried " ones that have n't been detected
" few , if any , earthquakes in the seismic zone can be linked to named faults , " according to the geological survey
@entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this report .
