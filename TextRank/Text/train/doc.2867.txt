-- ever since @entity2 ' turn as the @entity3 in " @entity4 , " voice artists who specialize in character work for animated movies have been sidelined by celebrities , no doubt tickled to do something they can show to their children
@entity12 tackles the voice of an energetic panda in the animated feature " @entity16
" @entity17 especially has invested in star power -- though the studio 's rationale must be to flatter an older , media - savvy audience
( after all , it 's the place that teamed @entity23 and @entity24 in " @entity25 " and loaded the " @entity32 " franchise with the dulcet tones of @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31
) too often though , @entity17 movies coast on lazy pop cultural references in place of the deeper story and character development found in @entity39 productions
" @entity16 " goes a step further
it 's essentially an old - fashioned star vehicle , a virtual @entity12 movie that saves us the dubious pleasure of watching the real @entity12 doing the splits
( if you doubt that he could , check out the gravity - defying stunts an effects - enhanced @entity46 is capable of in " @entity51
" or , on second thought , just take my word for it
) @entity12 is @entity55 , a tubby panda who dreams of kung fu " awesomeness " but whose career prospects boil down to inheriting his father 's noodle stand
that is , until doddery turtle @entity64 ( @entity66 ) baffles everyone by anointing po the " @entity68 , " a champion who will defend the valley from the wrath of mighty snow leopard @entity72 ( @entity74 )
this inexplicable appointment not only threatens the safety of the entire community , it infuriates @entity80 's small ratlike lieutenant , @entity79 ( a petulant @entity81 ) , who has dedicated himself to grooming a group called the @entity83 for just this task : @entity91 ( @entity92 ) , @entity89 ( @entity90 ) , @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , @entity86 ( @entity85 ) and @entity93 ( @entity94 )
ireport.com : share your review of " @entity16 " how can a chubby novice such as @entity55 compete with these fierce warriors , let alone his former protégé , @entity72 ? @entity79 puts @entity55 through the wringer in the hope that he 'll see sense and quit , but along with his prodigious appetite for chop suey , it turns out the panda is also quite the glutton for punishment
in other words , this is a fortune cookie variation that heroic slacker @entity12 has played many times before : @entity55 may look out of shape , but what he lacks in strength , discipline and intelligence , he more than makes up for in gut ( s )
you do n't mess with the @entity55 , man
the action tends to blur into a whirlwind of slapstick chaos
choreography of kung fu between a snake or a mantis and a leopard may be too anatomically mindboggling to animate in greater detail
@entity131 was fast , but at least he had hands
the highlight is @entity55 's breakthrough training bout with @entity79 , a brilliantly inventive comic tour de force built around a solitary dumpling
directed by @entity137 and @entity138 , the film is brisk and businesslike , with an appropriately ersatz @entity141 look , but it does n't betray any personality beyond @entity12 's
not that he is n't engaging , but it seems a waste of resources that @entity90 , @entity88 , @entity85 and @entity92 share about a dozen lines between them
" @entity16 " is fun as far as it goes , but unless you 're 12 , you 'll be hankering for something a bit more substantial half an hour after it 's over
" @entity16 " is rated pg and runs 95 minutes
