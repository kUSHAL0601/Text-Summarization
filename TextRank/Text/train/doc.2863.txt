@entity0 -- @entity0 police thursday were investigating a sucker - punch assault on a 23 - year - old man for a possible connection to a series of attacks known as the " knockout game
" in the latest assault , the unidentified man was walking on a street in the @entity13 on wednesday afternoon when he was punched in the head and fell to the ground , police said
after he was down , two other men punched him several times before running away
nothing was taken from the man , and police were looking into a possible link to assaults around the country where teens randomly try to make strangers unconscious with a single blow
the victim suffered bruising and swelling to his face but refused medical treatment
at least eight suspected " knockout " attacks have been reported since october in @entity0 , but police have said they see no evidence of a trend
possible ' knockout ' game victim : ' the whole group of kids laughed ' authorities have reported similar incidents in @entity0 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44
in @entity46 , @entity41 , police said there were seven reported incidents possibly connected to " knockout " assaults , but it was unclear if they were carried out by the same person
there were no major injuries in the attacks , which occurred in the same three - to four - block area on november 17 - 18
the assaults stopped after police questioned a suspect , though no arrest was made
" we have no reason to believe this is a hate crime , " said officer @entity61 , a @entity46 police spokesman
some previous assaults in the region have targeted @entity68 people
@entity69 said police believe the attacks were copycat crimes spurred by media attention
youth violence expert @entity74 blamed the media and parents for what he called extreme aggression by @entity80 's youths
negative attention , he said , is often rewarded
@entity80 loves violence , and so do our kids , " he said
" we market violence to our children and we wonder why they 're violent
it 's because we are
" @entity74 , a professor of psychology and education at @entity92 in @entity93 , said some young people are desperate for attention
he called it the " @entity101 effect , " where teens will do anything to get noticed , no matter how unconscionable
" these kids know the consequences , " he said
" they want to get arrested
they want to get caught , because they want that notoriety
they know they wo n't go away forever because they 're kids
it 's a win - win all around for them
" police keep close eye on reports of disturbing ' knockout ' game
