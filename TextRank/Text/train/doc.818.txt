@entity0 -- @entity2 recalled its ambassador to @entity4 and closed its embassy in @entity0 and its consulates in @entity7 and @entity8 saturday , following protests in the @entity4 capital over a human rights lawyer imprisoned in the @entity13 kingdom
the decision to pull out @entity2 diplomats came after protester " attempts to storm and threaten the security and safety of its ( embassy ) employees , " according to the @entity22
throngs of @entity4 had gathered in front of the @entity25 this week , calling for the release of @entity4 lawyer @entity27 -- detained earlier this month for allegedly insulting @entity28
@entity2 officials say @entity30 was arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle thousands of pills into the country
but the @entity33 say @entity30 had been traveling on a pilgrimage to @entity35 when he was detained
the @entity0 - based group credited the activist for demanding better treatment of @entity2 - held @entity4 detainees and criticizing the kingdom over alleged human rights abuses
@entity42 has since been sentenced to flogging and faces a year behind bars , the group reported
video of the demonstrations in @entity0 was posted online earlier this week and showed sign - wielding crowds chanting slogans in front of the @entity25
" say it , do n't be afraid , the @entity4 will be lashed , " the crowd chanted
" we will lash the ambassador ! @entity51 us imprison us ! tomorrow the revolution will be in @entity53
" in a statement saturday , the @entity4 government denounced " these irresponsible acts , " saying that it regrets " the individual incidents , which were conducted by some citizens against the @entity58 in @entity0
" " the incidents only reflect only the view of those who carried them out and nothing more , " the statement said
the protests and saturday 's decision by @entity2 authorities to remove diplomatic personnel from the country appear to have again ratcheted up longstanding tensions between the two @entity72 nations
" it 's a relationship that 's been flawed , " said @entity73 , senior fellow at the @entity74
" especially since the uprising , many @entity4 regard @entity2 as a counterrevolutionary force in the region
" relations between the two countries soured in 1979 when the kingdom broke off diplomatic relations with @entity4 after it inked a peace deal with @entity84 following the @entity85
the ties were later restored in november 1987
@entity4 , the most populous @entity13 country , has often engaged in " a subtle competition " with their @entity2 counterparts " over this question of regional leadership , " @entity73 said
@entity4 erupted in protest last year during 18 days of demonstrations in @entity0 's @entity94 after similar uprisings in neighboring @entity96 , ultimately ousting @entity4 's longtime president @entity97 after nearly three decades in power
" the @entity2 were not enthusiastic about their uprising , " @entity73 said of @entity4 , pointing to apparent concerns among elites in the oil - rich kingdom over their own grip on power
" and they were angry at the @entity107 for its role in supporting the movement
" in february 2011 , president @entity111 called for orderly transition in @entity4 to a fully representative democracy , saying the transition " must be meaningful , it must be peaceful and it must begin now
" @entity1 's @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report .
