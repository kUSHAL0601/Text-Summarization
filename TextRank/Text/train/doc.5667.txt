-- the crew of a @entity3 - flagged cargo ship , held more than a week and accused of arms trafficking , is expected to set sail monday or tuesday from @entity6 after authorities dropped charges against them
" while we have n't left yet , it looks like a positive solution has been reached , " a crew member , who asked to remain anonymous because of security concerns , said in an e-mail to @entity0 on sunday night
he said the charges were dropped for the captain and the 14 crew members
a @entity18 official confirmed sunday the charges were dropped , but @entity6 's @entity19 told @entity0 they had no information regarding the case
the @entity22 docked at the port of @entity24 , @entity6 's second - largest city , on august 29 , according to the crew member
a few days later , the crew was told the ship was under investigation for arms trafficking , and last wednesday , the captain and crew were charged
the captain , @entity32 of @entity33 , was taken into custody and made a court appearance
he came back to the ship once , to move the ship from the docks to anchor in @entity41 , but he was held on land while the crew members were told to stay on the ship , the crew member said
after the charges were dropped sunday , the crew member said the captain was finally able to return to the ship
the crew member who spoke to @entity0 said there were " normal shipboard conditions " while the ship has been detained and that there was never any danger or threat of physical harm
though the @entity6 authorities who boarded the ship were armed , he said , " at all times the guns were pointed at the ground
" he thanked the @entity61 for their help with the case and @entity64 , the ship 's manager , for constantly updating the families of the crew
the @entity22 , built in 2000 , is a 393 - foot long , heavy - lift cargo ship with two cranes , according to its operator , @entity72
@entity18 spokesman @entity73 said last week the detention had to do with customs paperwork for rifles that were on board for the crew 's protection
" we , of course , know that the high seas and that piracy have been a major topic in recent months and years , and so that 's something we 've been combating , " @entity73 told reporters
" it 's normal for many ships to have some type of self - defense on board
" the crew member in touch with @entity0 said the ship 's security team keeps the rifles in a locker on board
he said the captain declared the weapons on arrival in @entity24 and was cleared to have them , but the @entity6 authorities denied there was permission for the weapons and confiscated them
