-- the @entity2 outage saga continues
a hacker associated with @entity4 claimed responsibility on monday for taking down websites housed by or registered with that internet services company
but on tuesday , @entity2 , which says it is the world 's largest host of secure websites , said the " service outage was not caused by external influences
" " it was not a ' hack ' and it was not a denial of service attack ( @entity18 ) , " @entity12 , @entity2 's interim ceo , said in an e-mailed statement
" we have determined the service outage was due to a series of internal network events that corrupted router data tables
" once the issues were identified , we took corrective actions to restore services for our customers and @entity2
we have implemented measures to prevent this from occurring again
" the company added : " at no time was any customer data at risk or were any of our systems compromised
" @entity12 also apologized to @entity2 's customers and said that the company has a track record of having its computer servers up and working for customers 99.999 % of the time
a @entity41 user named @ @entity42 previously had claimed responsibility for taking down @entity2 's system , impacting an untold number of websites that use the company to store their data or to register their web addresses
the company says the " intermittent service outage " lasted from 1 to 7 p.m. et on monday .
