-- football legend @entity1 has accused world governing body @entity2 of being corrupt and run by greedy officials who have made millions from the sport
the 1986 @entity6 winner delivered the broadside at his first press conference as coach of @entity11 - based club @entity10 on saturday , as he reflected on the recent @entity2 presidential elections in which incumbent @entity13 ran unopposed
@entity13 's main opponent , @entity14 of @entity15 , was suspended ahead of the vote along with fellow @entity2 executive @entity17 following accusations of bribery
" there is a lot of corruption involving @entity2 officials and they are all millionaires because of football , " the former @entity21 player and coach said
" i wonder if @entity13 has ever kicked a football in his life , and yet we have been under the control of such people who have refused to give up power in @entity2
" why do n't they all just relinquish their positions , take the money they have made and leave the running of the sport in the more capable hands of former football players ? " @entity1 , a controversial figure who was sent home from the 1994 @entity6 for using drugs , said he had never liked the @entity2 establishment
" i do n't support corrupt people and i will never be on their side
i have always been asked by them to support the @entity2 family
but what family are they talking about ? this sport belongs to us and they have never ever asked us to be part of the development process , " the 50 - year - old said
" they have too much power and this has made them so arrogant and proud
this is not what a genuine football lover needs from such officials
after all football , is the biggest sport in the world
" we will continue doing what we are doing so that these corrupt people go away
they are too old and since they have made so much money at the cost of football , they should simply take it all and go away
" @entity1 , who turned up more than an hour late for the media briefing , added that @entity2 had stifled his attempts to form a players ' union
" what did @entity2 do ? they worked against us to ensure the union never saw the light of day , " he said
meanwhile , @entity2 is investigating @entity21 's 4 - 1 defeat by @entity84 on wednesday as part of a wider investigation into match - fixing , according to a report in @entity90 's @entity89 on saturday
the paper said there was evidence of irregular patterns as referee @entity95 of @entity96 allowed three extra minutes of injury - time in addition to the five already awarded before @entity21 scored from a penalty
" @entity2 can confirm that this match between @entity84 and @entity21 was one that we had an active interest in , and forms part of a wider ongoing investigation , " it said in a statement to the @entity89
the @entity107 released a statement denying the accusation on saturday
" we are concerned at attempts by unscrupulous elements to play down the feat that our national team performed by beating @entity21 , " general secretary @entity110 said
" this match was shown on many television stations , including @entity117 , and in front of a crowd of 50,000 , and we are certain that @entity84 's @entity84 deservedly won that match , playing to the rules , and clearly outplaying our opponents
