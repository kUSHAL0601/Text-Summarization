-- @entity1 strengthened his position atop the @entity4 world rankings sunday with a convincing win over @entity6 in the final of the @entity8
the @entity9 triumphed 6 - 2 6 - 3 in little over one hour and 20 minutes to increase his rankings lead over @entity11 , @entity12 , who was defeated by @entity6 in the quarter finals of the @entity16 tournament earlier in the week
@entity1 now heads to the season ending @entity19 event in @entity20 as favorite to end 2014 as the world 's top player
" i played the best match of the entire week today when it was most needed , " said @entity1 on court after the match
" i got a lot of returns back and just overall i 'm extremely happy with the performance
" on the battle with @entity12 for the @entity32 spot , he added " i see it better now than one week ago , that 's for sure
" " it helps that i won the title ... that i 'm playing well , and that i 'm feeling good about myself on the court playing indoors
that encourages me , as i said before , prior to the last event of the year
" now i can not affect his ( @entity12 's ) matches
i can affect only what i can do in my own matches
so i 'll try to stay focused on what i need to do and play well in @entity20
every match that i play and win gets me closer to holding no. 1 at the end of the year
" @entity1 was playing his first tournament since his wife @entity48 gave birth to the couple 's first child last month
he did n't drop a set as he cruised to the @entity16 title for the third time in his career , adding to victories in 2009 and 2013
sunday 's victory also marked @entity1 's 600th career match win , something achieved by only four other active players ( @entity12 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 ) .
