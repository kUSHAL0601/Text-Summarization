-- in the same way a @entity5 playlist is incomplete without a tipsy , eggnog - drinking grandmother having an unfortunate accident with reindeer , the melodrama of certain shows and films improves when a boozy grandmother is written in
the minor role is normally reserved for television , but it makes the jump to movie theaters this year in " @entity15 , " @entity17 's cerebral thriller based on @entity19 's 2002 novel , with @entity20 playing the hard - drinking @entity21
" she 's such a strange grandmother , " @entity20 told the @entity23 press about her first role as a family matriarch
although @entity20 , 63 , said she 's old enough to play one , her @entity21 is n't " a granny grandmother
" " she 's the comic relief in this very deep , very hard movie ; she comes in and the movie gets lighter , " said movie reviewer kit @entity29
" she 's trying to vacuum while ash is falling from her cigarette
" television critics say it 's hard to nail down when this character first made an appearance , but the anti-grandmother role we know today was more than likely inspired by the spirited older women on " @entity42 , " and has since become a television staple
@entity44 played a version of the difficult , drinking grandmother for seven seasons as @entity48 on " @entity49 , " and @entity50 has taken her vodka neat as @entity52 on " @entity55 " and as @entity53 on " @entity54
" the @entity57 hour - long melodrama " @entity69 " has the scheming @entity59 -- whose signature scent is @entity61 with a top note of gin -- and @entity64 has perfected the role as @entity66 on " @entity67 " and @entity68 on " 90210
" " these women , they 're not knitting -- they 're more interested in mixing their drinks than watching kids , " said @entity71 's pop culture writer @entity70
" they 're more inclined to offer a witticism or a barb than to give you sweet advice
these ladies are n't cooking -- i do n't think they even eat
... maybe they eat the olives
" they 're the exact opposite of the stereotypical grandmother , said @entity94 's senior editor @entity93
" they 're supposed to be the truth - tellers -- whether it 's liquid courage or lowering their inhibitions , i do n't know , " @entity93 said
" but everyone can relate to having an older relative that embarrasses you to some degree , " he added
" @entity105 just did a drunken grandma on ' @entity107
' there was a wedding scene where she got drunk , gave a toast and ended up kicking the cake over
it 's about the universality of how we deal with our older relatives
if you make them drunk , there 's some way to at least codify what embarrasses us about them , or to excuse their outrageous behavior
" with @entity93 's own grandparents , though , " it 's less often an indication of how much they 've had to drink and more often just who they are
" because it 's a role that 's virtually paint - by - numbers -- drunk grandmothers are nearly always wealthy , white and cruelly witty , with poor parenting skills -- it demands a strong actress who can keep the potentially two - dimensional from falling flat
case in point for film reviewer @entity29 is the difference between the @entity21 in @entity19 's novel and @entity17 's cinematic version
" i loved the book , but the funny thing is that i do n't remember the grandmother , " @entity29 said
" she definitely is more memorable in the movie , and i 'm glad her character is in the movie because it adds another layer to it
" which , of course , has everything to do with @entity20 , " @entity29 added
the talent of the women who have taken these minor roles and turned them into iconic characters is what has kept the " drunk grandma " role from veering into clich√© territory , @entity93 said
" even with the criticisms people had of ' 90210 , ' they liked @entity64 and what she was doing , " @entity93 said
" she brought some reality
the teen drama tends to be a little stylized in terms of its emotional truth , and she 's kind of there to cut through the artifice
" @entity70 , who also lists @entity174 's " development " character as one of his favorites , thinks these roles are always such a hit because , regardless of what series they land in , they always manage to " punch it up
" ( need proof of @entity174 's comedic timing ? do a search for " @entity185 " on @entity186
) " they 're the @entity188 to a @entity189 , " @entity70 said
" @entity174 was sharp , funny , mean and heartless --- and at the same time , she was fabulous in a @entity192 suit like it was always happy hour somewhere
she made it look like such a blast
" while their alcohol - induced shenanigans are obviously trumped up for comedic effect , the idea of a grandmother who 's independent , technologically savvy and having fun is n't the foreign notion it used to be , said @entity203 , the 81 - year - old author of " how not to become a @entity204
" @entity203 herself has spent her post-child - rearing years traveling the world
" when people think of a grandmother , their eyes glaze over
but now , many of us are doing things we love doing
we 're not sitting somewhere and rocking in a rocking chair , " said @entity203 , who herself enjoys a glass of wine or two to cap off her evenings
but , despite the truth that these characters are reflected in the real world more than ever , television and film still does n't have anything close to the godmother of the grandmother character , " @entity42
" " hopefully , it 's not the drunk grandmother [ character ] that have made it better for older actresses , but you never know , " @entity93 said
" maybe it 's become , play a drunk grandmother and you get to work past the age of 60
