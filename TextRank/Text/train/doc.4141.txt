-- what do president @entity1 , @entity3 gov. @entity2 and @entity5 president @entity4 have in common ? they all have been the subject of a snide " prayer " circulating that seemingly calls for their deaths
a recently created @entity14 page reads , " dear lord , this year you took my favorite actor , @entity17 ( sic )
you took my favorite actress , @entity19 ( sic ) @entity20
you took my favorite singer , @entity21
i just wanted to let you know , my favorite president is @entity1
" the page has received more than 600,000 " thumbs - up " messages of approval since it was posted april 10
but its owner , who does not disclose his or her identity on the popular social media site , wrote , " we are not really praying for the death of @entity1
it is just some humor to show our disapproval of our current president
" similar imprecations were circulating online last year
but @entity14 spokesman @entity41 said that " while it may be considered distasteful and objectionable to some , " the page does n't violate the company 's content policies
" we 're sensitive to content that includes pornography , bullying , hate speech , and actionable threats of violence , and we react quickly to remove content that violates our policies when it is reported to us , " @entity41 said in a written statement
" @entity14 is highly self - regulating and leverages its more than 400 million users to keep an eye out for offensive content , " he added
" we encourage users to report such content , and we have a large team of professional reviewers who evaluate these reports and take action per our policies
" variations on the jab have circulated in @entity3 , where teacher 's union officials apologized for a nearly identical memo that substituted gov. @entity2 for @entity1 earlier this month
@entity2 is locked in a bitter struggle with the @entity72 over funding for state schools , but union president @entity75 said , " language such as that has no place in civil discourse
" and in january , hackers posted a similar message on @entity4 's web site
" dear @entity84 , in 2009 you took my favorite singer -- @entity21 , my favorite actress -- @entity20 , my favorite actor -- @entity87 , my favorite voice -- @entity95 , " the hackers wrote , the last entry a reference to a young @entity5 woman shot and killed during protests over last june 's disputed presidential election
" please , please , do n't forget my favorite politician -- @entity4 -- and my favorite dictator -- @entity99 -- in the year 2010
