the robot valet , nicknamed " @entity20 , " takes it from there
the robot measures the vehicle , picks it up with a forklift - like system , and takes it to the back area , where it will position it in one of the 249 parking spots reserved for automated valets
the machine is capable of carrying standard cars weighing up to 3.31 tons
the robot valet is even connected to the airport 's flight data system , and by checking customer trip data with the database , @entity20 knows when the customer will return for the vehicle
a traveler can note any itinerary changes in a parking app , which is available for @entity44 and @entity45
@entity3 's airport is relatively small , and officials touted the convenience of heading to the terminal from the parking structure entrance
@entity20 " makes the distances between planes and passengers ' vehicles even shorter , " according to a statement from the airport
" our product is especially appealing to business travelers , who arrive at the airport shortly before the flight , seek efficient parking , and return within a few days , " said @entity57 , the airport 's managing director
the introductory rate for robot valet parking at @entity3 is 29 euros ( $ 39.59 ) per day or 4 euros ( $ 5.46 ) per hour
although the airport is targeting business travelers in a hurry , the service is open to anyone
if airport customers use the robot valet , airport officials said they would consider expanding the system
@entity20 was produced by @entity76 in the @entity78 town of @entity79
@entity80 previewed the robot valet in 2013 ; @entity3 is the first installation of the system .
