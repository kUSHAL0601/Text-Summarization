-- @entity2 president @entity1 , who was nicknamed " @entity6 " for his fiery comebacks and larger - than - life personality , has died
@entity1 had traveled to @entity7 for unspecified medical treatment last week , and died at a hospital there tuesday evening
officials did not disclose a cause of death
" it 's shocking , it 's devastating , because i knew he was sick
but i did not know it was going to end this way , " said @entity17 , permanent secretary at the @entity2 @entity18
" ( we ) lost a man who devoted his whole life to his country
" succession of office vice president @entity27 has been appointed acting president , said @entity29 , the cabinet secretary
he will serve for 90 days until elections are held
@entity27 , who is of @entity32 descent , will be the first white president in @entity33 since apartheid
he is ineligible to be elected president because his parents were not born in @entity2 , @entity29 said
absence of leadership @entity1 took office in september 2011 after the incumbent president tearfully conceded in a televised speech , a rarity in a continent known for volatile elections and leaders fighting their defeat tooth - and - nail
analysts hailed his election as an example of an @entity50 nation with a vibrant democracy
but not too long after he took office , speculation swirled over his lack of visibility -- which especially stood out for a man who loves the spotlight
aides said his absence was a result of private international visits , and maintained those trips had nothing to do with medical treatment
the nation 's bloggers have frequently criticized what they describe as " absence of leadership , " leading @entity1 to make a surprise appearance in parliament last month and declare that he was not dead
political origins @entity1 was born in the @entity2 town of @entity74 in 1936 , and worked as a police officer during the colonial administration
he later trained as a pilot in @entity78 before returning home and helping develop housing projects in the nation
during @entity2 's struggle for independence from @entity84 , he jumped into politics , and later founded the @entity86 -- then an opposition party
his campaign events electrified crowds drawn to his extroverted nature and fight for the average man
@entity1 , who narrowly lost to his predecessor @entity92 in 2008 , was a major critic of @entity94 investment in the nation 's copper industry
he especially targeted foreign companies that mistreated @entity2 workers , making him popular among the nation 's miners who accused the @entity94 of deplorable work conditions
while in office , @entity1 warned foreign companies that while their investment is crucial to his nation , they must abide by the labor laws
the veteran politician has served in other positions , including city council , member of parliament and cabinet minister for local government
before his election , the copper - rich nation in southern @entity33 had been ruled by the same party for two decades
@entity50 president @entity115 was the continent 's last white president
his party lost to @entity119 's @entity118 in @entity50 's first multiracial , fully democratic elections in 1994
@entity122 took a deputy position in the new government for two years
people we 've lost in 2014 @entity0 's @entity127 contributed to this report .
