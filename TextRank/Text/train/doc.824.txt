the drill was not aimed at preparing for an all - out war scenario but to respond to a new terror threat that has emerged from the ashes of the @entity10 revolution
@entity16 claim that close to 3,000 fighters from the militant group @entity18 have infiltrated @entity10 in support of the @entity21 regime and several hundred are now operating the @entity0
@entity18 -- the @entity23 - backed group based in southern @entity24 - has called for the destruction of the state of @entity4
leader sheikh @entity27 has stated that once the @entity10 uprising is put down , he will turn his attention to @entity4
" statements that were made by high ranking officials that the @entity10 border will become a border with terror is something we are dealing with every day , " said lt. col. @entity30 , the @entity31
" we are making sure that there will be no penetration through the northern border of @entity4
" @entity1 told : @entity43 @entity42 arrive in @entity10 , more to come @entity30 gave @entity1 an exclusive tour of the region that has seen a tripling of @entity4 forces and intelligence gathering over the last six months
the @entity16 now monitors the region 24 hours a day , seven days a week
corporal @entity50 , a soldier working in the @entity16 's @entity51 , said they have the authority to deploy special forces units , artillery and aerial bombings if they suspect a threat to @entity4
" we can see it for a few miles coming at us , " she said
" if we see something coming at us , we can tell that immediately and everybody is prepared to do something about that
" in addition to the constant surveillance , @entity4 is erecting a fence with @entity10 along its side of the disengagement zone
the mountainous @entity0 , known for its beauty and favored by backpackers and hikers , is one of the most traveled areas for @entity4
it was captured by @entity4 during the @entity77 in 1967 against @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity10 , but since 1974 , right up to the @entity10 revolution , the area was a quiet , almost bucolic military posting
@entity10 's children deserve chance to be kids again the turmoil in @entity10 changed the equation and in june , both countries nearly came to a full - on , open confrontation at a crossing post in @entity92
@entity10 rebels overran government - backed forces and for a few hours occupied the area
the @entity4 forces watched , ready to intercede if the fighting spilled across the border
" the shooting began at 5am , " recalled @entity30
" it was a morning full of fighting where the @entity10 army and rebels were shooting at one another
" to strike back at the rebels , the @entity10 army moved several tanks and armored vehicles into area and the @entity16 went on high alert
" we had a lot of forces ready to react
tanks , intelligence , special forces ... artillery , air force -- everything was ready for this incident , " said @entity30
" if we would have seen that there was a leakage or direct fire into our territory we would have reacted immediately and destroyed the source of fire
" even before the skirmish at @entity92 , shots between rebels and @entity10 government forces have strayed across the border
the @entity16 's response to these is to destroy the firing position -- whether rebel or @entity10 army
" i do not differentiate between a force that is @entity10 or a force of the rebels , " @entity30 said
" if i identify armed men next to the fence , we are prepared to face all the threats and respond
" frustration in @entity142 with aid to @entity10 rebels
