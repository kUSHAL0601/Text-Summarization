@entity0 , @entity1 -- four suspected militants were killed and seven arrested in @entity1 in a security forces operation targeting those responsible for a devastating weekend bombing on the outskirts of the city of @entity9 that left scores dead , authorities said tuesday
police said a suicide bomber rammed a water tanker laden with explosives into a crowded marketplace saturday , setting off a huge blast that killed at least 89 people and wounded at least 180 others
@entity19 in @entity9 had refused to bury those killed in the devastating bombing until authorities responded to their demands to take military action against @entity26 extremists thought to be responsible
following tuesday 's operation , they announced that the burial will begin at 9 a.m. wednesday
the macabre protest , now in its third day , is an expression of the anger and frustration among @entity19 in the southwestern province of @entity34 , whose capital is @entity9 , over the government 's failure to shield them from bloody sectarian attacks in recent months
" we want the military to protect @entity19 and want it to take control of law and order in the province , " @entity40 , president of the @entity41 and the organizer of the protest , said monday
" civilian government has failed to maintain law and order in the province
" the outlawed @entity26 militant group @entity53 has said it carried out the saturday attack
the bodies of about 80 of the victims -- some in coffins , others wrapped in sheets -- have been laid out on the street in @entity61 , the @entity19 suburb of @entity9 where the attack took place , said @entity64 , the health secretary in @entity34
authorities are still trying to identify the other bodies , he said
hundreds of demonstrators in @entity61 have braved the winter cold to stay out day and night with the victims ' bodies
" what is our sin ? why are our people being killed ? " said @entity73 , a teenager at the protest who said her brother was among the dead
" why are we being killed for our faith ? " she continued , breaking into tears
the bombing , which has prompted demonstrations in cities across @entity26 - majority @entity1 , follows a day of bomb attacks targeting @entity19 in @entity9 last month that killed at least 85 people
@entity53 also claimed responsibility for those attacks
desperate protest the @entity19 community 's decision to delay the burial of the bodies this week , a form of protest they also adopted after the january bombings , is a sign of its desperation after repeated requests to authorities for better protection
not burying dead bodies immediately after death is taboo in @entity103 ; a person 's soul is not considered to be at rest until the body is in the ground
the @entity1 government in @entity0 said tuesday that it would carry out " a targeted operation aimed at eliminating those responsible for playing with lives of innocent civilians and restoring peace and security in @entity9
" and a senior @entity9 police official , @entity116 , said security forces carried out a raid in the city monday night in which four militants were killed and seven were arrested
it was not immediately clear if any of these announcements were enough to satisfy the @entity19 community 's demands
@entity34 security officials were negotiating with the protesters to try to persuade them to end their demonstration and bury the dead
the government had vowed monday to catch the perpetrators and bring them to justice
but human rights groups say authorities have a bad track record of prosecuting those who carry out and incite attacks on @entity19
prime minister @entity138 has sent a delegation of lawmakers to @entity9 to assess the situation and make recommendations
he has also requested that intelligence agencies explain how the suicide bomber managed to breach security measures
@entity138 's announcements monday came as protests over the attack spread beyond @entity34 to other parts of @entity1 , including major cities such as @entity152 and @entity0 , local media reported
a persecuted minority the @entity19 community primarily targeted by @entity53 in @entity34 are @entity155 , an ethnic minority from neighboring @entity157
@entity158 said monday it had documented 91 separate attacks on @entity19 across @entity1 since january 2012 that had resulted in the deaths of about 500 people
at least half of those killed were @entity155 , @entity158 said , even though they are one of the smallest ethnic groups in @entity1
" the last two months have been the worst on record for @entity9 's beleaguered @entity73 community , " said @entity166 , deputy @entity167 director at @entity158
" in fact , the attacks in january and february constitute some of the worst killings in @entity1 's recent history
" @entity158 urged @entity1 authorities to " immediately carry out an impartial and independent investigation into the persistent failure of civil and military authorities to end such attacks
" a lack of prosecutions the rights group said that to its knowledge , " no one has been prosecuted for the january 2013 attacks or other targeted killings of @entity155 in recent years
" the bombing saturday also drew condemnation from the office of @entity191 secretary - general @entity190 and the @entity192 of @entity1
the commission said it was " at a loss for words at this latest catastrophe to befall the long - suffering hazaras of @entity34
" @entity53 has tried to justify its attacks by arguing that according to its interpretation of @entity103 , @entity19 are not @entity19
it claims @entity19 insult close companions of the @entity103 prophet , @entity202
but human rights groups are scathing in their criticism of the group
" these attacks demonstrate @entity53 's utter disregard for human rights and basic principles of humanity , " @entity166 said
