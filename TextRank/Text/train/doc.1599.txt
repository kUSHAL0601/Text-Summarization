-- the @entity2 ' dramatic rescue of @entity3 and @entity4 early wednesday ended the hostages ' three - month ordeal in @entity7
but why was it left to the @entity9 to conduct this operation in a country thousands of miles away ? the short answer is that the @entity9 has the military and intelligence capabilities to conduct the rescue of a @entity9 citizen in pressing need of medical attention
the longer answer is that @entity7 lacks the capacity to suppress piracy and other organized crime without international support
this is evidenced by the failed attempt of @entity7 forces to rescue a @entity29 family in march 2011 , where , as has so often been the case , local authorities found themselves outgunned by the organized criminals
there are no @entity7 agencies that can effectively fight piracy and other crimes in @entity7 , which has existed under a relatively impotent @entity37 since the central government collapsed in 1991
most of @entity7 is a patchwork of quasi-autonomous regions , across which neither governance nor law enforcement is coordinated
while most nations recognize the transitional government in @entity48 as the legitimate government of @entity7 , its reach is extremely limited
local administrations are thus left to manage issues of organized crime with little resources or support
the result : citizens exist in a precarious truce with a well - armed and organized criminal element
it is in this context of lawlessness that the @entity9 opted to take direct action to release these two hostages
but such heroic and high - profile moves , by the @entity9 or any other nation equipped for them , are not a long - term solution to @entity7 's plague of organized crime , now spilling across borders
to break this cycle of crime , the international community must step up its commitment to investing in @entity7 stability and addressing the symptoms of the nation 's governance vacuum
a recent report by the @entity80 estimated that $ 9 billion in humanitarian and development aid went into @entity7 over the past 20 years
this is a stark contrast to the billions that piracy costs the world each year
a forthcoming one @entity86 report finds that $ 7 billion was spent on measures to address @entity7 piracy alone in 2011
if the international community does not shift toward building sustainable @entity7 law enforcement capabilities at sea and ashore , the only realistic options to resolve hostage situations will continue to be through military action or ransom payments
among the ways money used to combat piracy is spent : 1
international navies support operations to patrol @entity7 waters and the @entity102 @entity101
nations fund suspect and prisoner transfer arrangements and " outsourcing " of prosecution within the region , as well as @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107
( even more will be spent to incarcerate convicted pirates
the maritime industry spends billions on armed guards , extra insurance , " ship hardening " and re-routing
shipping companies pay expensive ransoms , if other measures fail
@entity7 criminal elements have proven themselves to be amazingly resilient and adaptable
and we can expect that this rescue may lead to an even greater escalation of violence and corresponding threats to innocent human life , including the estimated 190 hostages held ( one of whom is a recently captured @entity9 writer ) and the thousands of seafarers who continue to transit this dangerous area
indeed , the violence has been increasing as pirates confront private security teams and aggressive naval actions
they have changed their tactics to separate and conceal hostages and are re-investing ransom funds into criminal enterprises
gangs are also becoming more sophisticated
hostage takers now demonstrate a familiarity with international law that prohibits negotiation with international terrorist groups
groups labeled as terrorists simply sell their hostages to middlemen who can legally negotiate
yet there has been surprisingly little investment from the international maritime community in a sustainable solution , although for a brief time last fall it appeared there might be a ray of hope
when the radical @entity162 group , @entity161 withdrew from @entity48 in early fall 2011 , many saw this as an opportunity to reinvigorate efforts to stabilize @entity7
in september , key regional leaders from @entity7 adopted a " @entity171 " to improve security , the constitution , reconciliation and good governance
but with a fractured political system and roiling conflict between the country 's regions , implementation has been slow
now the world 's eyes are turning to a high - level conference to be convened by @entity181 prime minister @entity180 in @entity182 on february 23 aimed at tackling the root causes of the problems in @entity7 , including piracy
we can only hope that this conference will set the stage for a coordinated and forward - looking international effort that engages all the stakeholders in @entity7 and looks past the symptoms
join the conversation on @entity195
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .
