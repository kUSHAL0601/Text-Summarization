-- according to a study by the @entity5 , nearly half of all 12 - year - olds in the @entity3 are using social network sites , despite not meeting the minimum age requirements for sites like @entity9
and such popularity only balloons once the teens grow older : roughly 64 % of 13 - year - olds are social networking ; between the ages of 14 to 17 , that figure jumps to 82 % , says @entity5
but that does n't mean @entity9 is n't trying to stop kids from becoming addicted to the network at such a young age ( though indoctrination does have its benefits ! )
according to a report by the @entity24 , @entity9 is kicking out roughly 20,000 underage users per day
in a meeting with @entity29 's cyber-safety committee , @entity9 's chief privacy adviser @entity26 agreed that underage users were taking advantage of the site
after all , any user no matter his or her age can register for the site by simply lying when signing up -- @entity9 has no mechanisms to detect whether a teen is telling the truth or not
@entity0 : @entity9 map of the world " it 's not perfect , " said @entity26
however , @entity9 's privacy czar did argue that @entity9 is trying to stop these young'ins from continuing to use the site
" there are people who lie
there are people who are under 13 [ accessing @entity9 ] , " @entity26 said
" @entity9 removes 20,000 people a day , people who are underage
" of course , that 's a fraction of the nearly 600 million users on @entity9 , but underage users have become a growing concern for the network , especially as it faces increased pressure from regulators -- whether in @entity29 or the @entity3 @entity0 : most innovative companies -- facebook last april , senators @entity57 , @entity59 , and @entity60 penned a letter to @entity9 ceo @entity62 over privacy issues related to collecting the personal data of users
this month , sen. @entity57 stepped up pressure on the world 's largest network , with support from even more @entity71 colleagues
this time the focus was specifically on " users between 13 to 17 years of age
" " @entity9 's new privacy policy would endanger the privacy and safety of children as young as 13
under @entity9 's policy , 13 million users under the age of 18 may be allowed to share their personal information just like adult users , " @entity57 argued
" these younger users are the most vulnerable to predators on @entity9 and the rest of the @entity87 and it should be impossible for them to inadvertently share their phone numbers and home addresses with anyone
" and that 's not even taking into consideration the users who are younger than 13
