-- the diplomatic fallout over this week 's attack on @entity4 's @entity3 in @entity5 deepened saturday as @entity6 temporarily reduced its embassy staff and @entity9 's ambassador @entity5 was summoned home
a @entity6 @entity12 spokesman said the reduction is for " security reasons
" " some of their diplomatic staff and their families will leave @entity5 and return to @entity6 , " said the spokesman , who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media
he could n't say how many people are leaving , when they are departing and for how long
@entity9 foreign minister @entity21 received @entity9 's envoy to @entity23 in @entity24 after he was recalled for consultations , said @entity9 foreign affairs spokesman @entity26
the ambassador , @entity28 , will not return to @entity23 until @entity9 has received assurances on the protection of its diplomatic mission
" there has been no decision to close the embassy , " @entity26 told @entity0
" we have received some assurances from the @entity5 ambassador to @entity24 , but we would like to get more full guarantees of the security and protection of our diplomatic mission according to international law before sending our ambassador back to @entity23
" the spokesman went on to say that @entity9 officials are " staying in close contact with our @entity48 partners and allies
" meanwhile , 25 @entity5 diplomats and embassy employees arrived in @entity23 saturday morning after @entity5 was ordered to close its embassy in @entity54 , according to the @entity55 , the country 's official news agency
the group was greeted by a crowd of university students at @entity23 's mehrabad airport , the agency reported
