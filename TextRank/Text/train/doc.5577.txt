@entity0 -- @entity2 is , to some conservatives , a party turncoat whose views on the use of military force and his chumminess with the president make many @entity11 ' skin crawl
the candidate for defense secretary is seen as @entity15 's most controversial nominee for his second - term cabinet
the former two - term @entity11 senator from @entity18 will likely face a tough @entity20 confirmation hearing thursday , but is expected to be confirmed , nevertheless
@entity15 's @entity16 : who 's in , who 's out ? but none of that is stopping conservative groups , and billionaire activist @entity26 , from pushing hard and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads to block the nomination
" if it 's a strategy , it does n't seem like a particularly enlightened one , " said @entity30 , a senior fellow at the @entity31 and co-author of the book " it 's even worse than it looks : how the @entity37 constitutional system collided with the @entity38
" " they almost certainly realize they 're going to lose and that he 'll be confirmed
" the effort is partly about making a public ado about @entity44 , @entity30 said
" they want to show some sort of collective reaction against it and a number of their key interests are pumped up about it , so they figure why not make a fight out of it ? " new ads from @entity58 group sound alarm bells at least two groups publicly released ads last week slamming the nominee
@entity37 for a @entity61 put out a 30 - second spot that urged viewers to call their senator and vote against @entity44 's confirmation " before it 's too late
" another group , the @entity67 , also revealed a new spot targeting @entity44 's record in the @entity20
@entity26 , the @entity70 conservative financier who also heads the @entity71 , was reportedly calling @entity11 senators personally to urge them to vote against @entity44 , according to the @entity73
but the opponents also have significant concerns about @entity44 's record
@entity44 in 2007 remarked that the " jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers
" republicans who are already uncomfortable with president @entity15 's policies toward @entity80 are hard - pressed to embrace a defense secretary with such views
five things @entity44 may be asked " for a lot of groups , especially @entity92 and conservative groups that care about @entity80 , this is a fundamental issue of right and wrong , " said @entity84 , former @entity85 press secretary under president @entity86 , @entity1 contributor and board member of the @entity71
" despite the fact that this is an uphill fight , groups are making the fight because they believe in it
" sens. @entity99 , @entity101 - @entity100 , and @entity102 , @entity103 , are perhaps the two highest - profile @entity92 senators who have announced their support for @entity44 after speaking privately with him in recent days
then there is @entity44 's criticism of the @entity109 and the @entity110
@entity44 has also faced some criticism on both sides of the aisle because of past positions he has taken on @entity116 and on @entity37 military action
and in 1998 he spoke of an ambassadorial nominee as being " openly , aggressively gay , " remarks for which he has since apologized
a view of what 's really behind @entity44 nomination fight and he has n't been sparing in his criticism of conservative and @entity11 figures , saying radio show hosts like @entity129 " try to rip everybody down " but " do n't have any answers , " and labeling @entity86 as callous on @entity131
" in a town that seems too focused too often on personalities and politics , this is a matter of conviction based on policy -- the wrong man for the job , " senate minority whip @entity132 , @entity133 , told @entity1
sen. @entity142 , @entity143 , prominent among politicians who have questioned @entity44 's suitability for the job , recently told @entity1 he will not exert his power to block @entity44 's nomination , but " i plan to make a judgment as to whether i think he 's appropriate to be secretary of defense or not
" but some @entity11 also believed that @entity44 , like @entity152 , was vulnerable , according to political experts
( @entity154 , the @entity37 ambassador to the @entity155 , withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after drawing heavy criticism from @entity142 and other @entity11 over her public statements about the deadly september 11 attack on the @entity37 consulate in @entity163 , @entity164 )
" there is an element of strategic calculation going on here , " said @entity165 , a political science professor at @entity166
" they see him as being more vulnerable and they have a chance to stop this nomination or embarrass the president or at least make it more difficult for him
" @entity177 defends fellow @entity16 nominee @entity44 groups opposing @entity44 released new television ads recently with dire warnings of what they think could happen should @entity44 be confirmed
the first spot , from @entity37 for a @entity61 , uses themes that mimic a movie trailer for a spy / action thriller
the 30 - second spot says " we live in a dangerous world " and points to threats from @entity116 , @entity189 , and " even @entity190
" " but @entity15 's nominee for secretary of defense wants @entity37 to back down , " the narrator continues
" an end to our nuclear program
" the narrator then urges viewers to call their senator and vote against @entity44 's confirmation " before it 's too late
" @entity44 's other war @entity206 plans to run television ads in @entity0 and in certain states against @entity15 's nominee , the group said , as well as print ads , web spots , and a website
sources close to the group said they would spend about $ 500,000 to air the new ad on @entity1 and @entity217
they call it an " all the above " strategy that " will be nationwide , focused on the many disqualifying characteristics of the @entity222 nomination -- including not only his now well - known statements against @entity80 and his weak opposition to the @entity116 nuclear threat , but also his to be disclosed personal , business and ethical conflicts
" @entity142 moves from backer to skeptic on @entity44 increasingly , outside groups are going to get more involved in nomination fights , said @entity67 spokesman @entity233
" i think what have seen are outside groups get more involved , it has n't be unusual for outside groups to get involved in @entity239 nominations , " @entity233 said
" i think what you see now are additional groups getting involved in communicating about other nominations that are particularly problematic or controversial
@entity2 's nomination to defense secretary in this administration is a particularly troubling and controversial nomination
" the opposition is also about policy and personality
conservative groups take issue with @entity44 's policy positions , but also , " they do n't like the fact that he is a supporter of president @entity15 , " said @entity257 , an associate professor of political science at @entity166 in @entity259
" republicans have been playing opposition politics for four years and it 's not easy to come out of that mold , " he said
" in @entity44 's case there 's no love lost
they see him as someone as who turned on his party and they do n't want there to be any confusion that this is a real @entity11 going into the @entity15 @entity16
" opinion : reality check for @entity44 bashers @entity1 's @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .
