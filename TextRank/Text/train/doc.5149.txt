-- a 10 - year - old @entity3 boy is in a juvenile detention center after denying in court thursday a charge that he murdered another child , authorities said
the mother of the alleged victim , @entity9 , said on @entity11 's " @entity10 " show that the suspect was her 12 - year - old son 's " best friend
" @entity14 , a registered nurse , said that her son died after stepping in front of the 10 - year - old as he was trying to stab another child
" the things we taught him cost him his life , " @entity9 said of her son
" we taught him do n't start a fight , do n't run away from a fight ( and ) if you see a fight ... stop it
" the @entity28 received a call shortly after 1 p.m. monday about the stabbing in @entity31 , which is about 20 miles northeast of @entity32
despite efforts by sheriff 's deputies , paramedics and hospital staff to save him , the boy was pronounced dead around 2:30 p.m. monday , the sheriff 's department said in a statement
the @entity43 's @entity42 filed murder and felony charges wednesday against the 10 - year - old suspect , said @entity47 , a spokesman for that office
an attorney for the young suspect " denied the charges " during his arraignment thursday morning , according to @entity47
the boy -- whose name has not been made public , in accordance with the district attorney 's policies regarding juvenile suspects -- is now being held in a juvenile detention center in the county , he added
@entity14 said that the boy who stabbed her son was actually targeting another child
" @entity9 took the knife for that boy , " she said , describing her son as intelligent , caring and " everything to me
" the victim 's father , @entity66 , called his son a " good ... boy with christian values
" since he is a juvenile , the boy accused of killing @entity9 can not be found guilty but can be convicted on a " true finding of fact , " explained @entity47
