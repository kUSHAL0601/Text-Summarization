-- i was 23 and a graduate trainee journalist when @entity3 survived an ambush in @entity5 that robbed her of an eye
to me , she was already part of a small band of women war correspondents , starting with @entity10 , who were my role models
to me , these women lived the story , gave voice to the voiceless and urged the myopic world to sit up and give a damn
the romantic in me yearned for their life of exotic travel , dangerous liaisons and hushed confidences over drinks and cigarettes in dingy bars , where stories were written and lifelong friendships made
the realist in me did not understand the risks then
it was n't until later that i realised i am not brave enough to be like @entity3 and some of the women i 've met in my work
i 've travelled to some dark places and reported from some danger zones , but nothing of the magnitude that she and they have encountered
i had first come across @entity39 while doing work experience on the foreign desk at the @entity42
to a young , hungry , aspiring foreign correspondent , she was an inspiration
but her experience in @entity5 several years later gave her added gravitas in my eyes
she was a survivor in a world where safety had not yet really become part of the culture and conversation in news rooms and , even then , in the years before the inexorable rise of social media raised the stakes and cacophony of information for traditional journalists , she was a rare breed
having decided in the wake of the devastating earthquake in @entity63 that i no longer wanted to report from these so - called hostile environments , that i no longer wished to do so as the mother of a small daughter , i now work for the @entity67 , a charity that provides safety advice and training to journalists working in dangerous situations
at @entity67 , i 've seen the risks journalists take and face across the world and i 've learned about the people whose names and lives are hidden behind the statistics -- who represent the 120 or so men and women working in the news media killed every year trying to do their job
unlike @entity3 , most of them are n't well - known journalists , reporting for famous newspapers
most come from countries like @entity88 , the @entity89 and @entity90 , where ineffective governments and corrupt officials , businesspeople and gangs want to silence them
along with @entity95 and @entity96 , @entity3 is probably the best known journalist to die whilst covering the @entity97
however , almost 30 more news media workers have died doing their jobs since the uprisings took root across the @entity102 last year
with their unknown names and faces , they are unlike her
but like @entity3 , they are men and women who felt compelled to fight against injustice , armed only with their words and images
@entity3 knew that no war was risk free
and , after @entity5 , she knew that more than most
but she knew too that journalists have a responsibility in helping write that first rough draft of history
in a speech that 's been much quoted in the past 24 hours , which she gave at a service in 2010 paying tribute to journalists killed in their work , she said : " our mission is to report these horrors of war with accuracy and without prejudice
we always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story
what is bravery , and what is bravado ? " there are many who turned back before @entity3
her mother said she wanted to finish " one more story "
her bosses urged her to leave the besieged @entity143 city of @entity144
one friend , the @entity146 's @entity145 , says he sensed in her a vulnerability he 'd not seen before in the days before she left for @entity143
shortly before she died , she told another friend , @entity149 ' @entity148 , that it was the " worst they 'd ever seen "
and , yet she felt compelled to continue shining a light on the worst suffering humans can inflict on each other , to give voice to the voiceless and expose the truth - in her case at a terrible price
her death and that of the brilliant @entity162 photographer @entity161 have highlighted risks that journalists take to do their jobs
it has shown that there still remains a rare breed of talented , humane journalist who believes it is worth risking everything to tell the story of the victims of war
at @entity67 , we want to pay tribute to @entity3 and the men and women like her
i hope her death will make the world sit up and realize what 's going on in @entity143 and i hope her death will make people realize the risks that journalists across the world take every day to bring home the news
@entity3 remains for me a role model , the @entity10 of her generation : an extraordinary woman who combined grit and glamour
women like her are rare in an industry long dominated by men
often the risks they face are no different from their male counterparts
but , on many occasions they are
at @entity67 , we 're launching a book dedicated to the safety of women journalists
in it , 40 women from around the world , including @entity0 's @entity207 , tell of covering war and civil unrest , corruption and disaster
they detail episodes of desperate detention , of kidnap , assault , extraordinary escapes and moments of awe - inspiring bravery , as they share their experiences of being a female journalist
the decision to put together this unique book was triggered by the terrible attack on @entity225 in @entity226 last year
it went to print just days before @entity3 's death
" no woman 's land : on the @entity233 " will be published on march 8 , @entity232
it will be launched with a tribute to @entity3
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .
