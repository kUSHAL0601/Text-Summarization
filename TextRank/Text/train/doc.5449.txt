@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 begins serving an 11 - month sentence in an @entity6 federal prison monday , while the drug case against his wife is set for a hearing in a @entity11 , @entity1 courtroom
@entity3 , whose real name is @entity3 , was on his way from @entity14 , @entity15 , to the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity6 , monday morning , according to his lawyer 's office
it 's the same prison where the rapper served seven months last year on a federal weapons conviction
" tiny " @entity24 's name was on monday 's court calendar for arraignment on a drug charge , according to the judge 's clerk , but it was unclear if she would travel from @entity14 to @entity1 to attend
the couple 's latest legal troubles began when a @entity34 's deputy stopped them on @entity35 in @entity36 two months ago for a traffic violation
they were arrested after suspected illegal drugs were found
the district attorney decided last week not to prosecute @entity3 , 29 , but @entity24 , 35 , was charged with misdemeanor drug offense
she is accused of possessing @entity42 , commonly known as ecstasy , according to the court filing
the rapper 's arrest and a failed drug test the next day convinced a federal judge last month to send @entity3 back to prison for violating his probation on a federal weapons conviction
@entity3 was given until monday , november 1 , to begin serving his 11 - month sentence .
