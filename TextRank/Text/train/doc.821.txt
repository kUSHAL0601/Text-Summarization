@entity0 -- @entity4 was booted from a rehab facility this month after smashing his mother 's car window during a family session , his probation officer reported wednesday
the judge overseeing @entity4 's probation in his @entity12 beating case ordered the singer to immediately enter another rehab program and stay for 90 days
@entity4 , who was arrested on an assault charge in @entity16 , last month , still faces a possibly probation violation charge that could send him to prison
" there is much concern with the probationer 's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility , " the probation report said
the singer sat nervously in a @entity29 courtroom , holding girlfriend @entity31 's hand as he waited while his lawyer , @entity32 , met privately with the judge and prosecutor before his hearing began wednesday afternoon
@entity4 's freedom has been in question since he was arrested on a sidewalk near the @entity39 after allegedly punching a man
the probation imposed when he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in the 2009 attack on @entity12 -- his girlfriend at the time -- requires that he stay out of legal trouble
the lawyers and judge emerged from chambers with a deal , which required @entity4 to spend the next 90 days in a court - approved treatment facility
@entity29 deputy district attorney @entity52 told the judge she still reserved the right to ask for @entity4 's probation to be revoked on the @entity16 arrest
@entity59 judge @entity58 ordered the probation officer to provide a detailed report about that incident , with that report expected to be presented when @entity4 returns to court on december 16
@entity4 voluntarily entered a rehab center on october 28 , a day after he was released from a @entity16 jail
" his goal is to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior , enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point , " representative @entity66 said when he entered
when he checked out on november 10 his representative said he would continue in the program as an outpatient
however , the probation report given to the judge wednesday disputed that , saying he was kicked out of the program
it quoted a center official saying he was ordered out for " breaking programs rules by acting violently
" the violence involved @entity4 " throwing a rock through his mother 's car window " after a family session at the center in which she said she wanted him to stay in the treatment
" mr. @entity4 preceded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother 's car window and it shattered , " according to letter from the rehab center included in the probation report
@entity4 's " prognosis is very guarded " unless he gets professional help , the letter said , @entity4 will leave the new rehab center three days a week to work eight - hour shifts of community labor so that he can complete the 1,000 hours of work still remaining in his punishment for the attack on @entity12
the report estimated he will have to work on community labor three days of every week until next august to meet his deadline
he may also travel to @entity16 for a court hearing monday in the assault case there , the judge said
his lawyer said he would try to get the hearing delayed
@entity120 report could help @entity4 's defense
