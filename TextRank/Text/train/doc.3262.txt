-- @entity1 -- who gained fame then infamy as a collegiate football coach in @entity4 -- is now poised to lead a new team : @entity6
the school 's board of trustees announced friday that it 'll offer the president 's job to @entity1 , who has worked as an administrator at the @entity12 since departing as head football coach at @entity14 under a cloud of controversy
" mr. @entity1 has the personality and leadership skills , in addition to widespread community support , to dramatically raise @entity6 's profile and prominence across @entity4 and the nation , " board chairman @entity17 said in a statement
if the job offer is finalized , @entity1 will know his way around the school
he obtained legendary status as @entity6 's head football coach between 1986 and 2000 , during which time he led teams to four @entity34 national championships
this success catapulted @entity1 to the top job at @entity14 , which historically boasts one of the top football programs in the country
he quickly picked up where he left off , leading the @entity41 to the 2002 national championship and seven big 10 championships
but @entity1 's tenure there did n't end well
he left under pressure in 2011 after reports surfaced that several @entity14 players -- including star quarterback @entity49 -- swapped team and personal memorabilia and equipment for tattoos and other benefits
those actions alone violate @entity57 rules , but it 's how @entity1 acted -- and did n't act -- that really drew the ire of the @entity57 , the nation 's dominant intercollegiate sports organization
" of great concern to the committee was the fact that ( @entity1 ) became aware of these violations and decided not to report the violations to institutional officials , the @entity69 or the @entity57 , " the @entity62 on infractions said in a report issued in december 2011
by then , @entity1 had resigned from his @entity14 post ( the school later recharacterized his departure as a retirement ) and quoted him as saying that he took " full responsibility for my mistakes
" the whole ordeal led the @entity41 to vacate all 12 of their wins from the 2010 season and to suspend five players for the first five games of the following campaign
in addition , the @entity57 issued a five - year order for @entity1 that limited his athletics - related duties and applies to any @entity57 school that wants to hire him as a coach
yet @entity1 -- who holds a bachelor 's degree in education from @entity92 and a master 's degree in education from the @entity12 -- remained active in @entity4 and in the field of education
in 2012 , he became vice president for strategic engagement at the @entity12 school and the following year was promoted to executive vice president for student success
the job as president at @entity6 , which boasts nearly 13,500 students and more than 135 undergraduate and graduate programs , would be another step for @entity1
@entity106 , the president of student government at @entity6 for 2014 - 2015 , says reaction to the @entity1 's apparent hiring has been mixed on social media
" it 's been very polarized , " @entity106 said
" people said they either really wanted @entity1 , no matter what , or ... said he was the worst candidate and could n't believe ( university officials ) would consider him
" the new president faces a university in flux
several other top administrative positions , including provost , are open and will need to be filled , @entity106 points out
the student government leader said he thinks @entity1 , as president , would excel at " being a cheerleader , the face of the university ( because ) he knows the area and donors " and expressed confidence he can craft " a vision " for @entity6 and its future
if and when he is officially hired , @entity1 will have lots of attention and , perhaps , momentum to get things done
" the fact that @entity1 is coming back and it 's getting people excited , i hope it helps in a meaningful way , " said @entity106
" i hope he takes advantage of the hype that he has caused
" @entity6 has had two presidents over the past two years , not including its current interim leader
sophomore @entity140 says that many in the @entity142 are hoping @entity1 can steady the ship and perhaps turn all the attention into a positive
but , at the same time , things could quickly turn south -- just like @entity1 's time at @entity14
" if @entity1 can bring stability to @entity6 and bring in more donations , keeping tuition down , i 'm for it , " @entity147 said
" do i think he has the potential to be a bust ? yes
