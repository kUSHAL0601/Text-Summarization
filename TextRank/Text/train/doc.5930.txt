-- for 50 years one spy has outfoxed , outgunned , and outdressed every villain thrown his way
his name ? @entity5 ... @entity5
now a new 007 exhibition in @entity7 is celebrating the half century since the world 's most famous secret agent first appeared on screen
it was 1962 when @entity12 's @entity5 defeated @entity13 and floated off into the sunset with @entity15
today the first @entity17 's bikini is one of more than 400 items on display in an exhibition tracing the design of the one of the world 's most profitable film franchises
from @entity26 's golden gun to @entity28 's tiny trunks in the 2006 remake of " @entity30 , " the @entity32 exhibition in @entity7 allows fans to follow in 007 's footsteps on a journey from 1962 up through @entity5 's golden anniversary ahead of " @entity37 " , which is due to be released in october
" adventure films have come and gone , but @entity5 has remained a huge box office draw throughout , " exhibition co-curator @entity40 told @entity0
" and he 's also the best - dressed man in cinema history
" @entity5 's ' @entity43 ' speedboat is show 's star turn fans are greeted at the gallery 's exhibition by a waxwork of @entity12 leaning against a replica of @entity5 's famous 1964 @entity52 car
from there , a bullet - shaped entry way leads through to the @entity55 , which features a life - sized recreation of character @entity58 's death by gold paint from the 1964 film " @entity61
" " @entity63 's golden body is one of the most iconic @entity5 images , and we went to great lengths to cast a form -- not just a mannequin -- to painstakingly make a body that resembled her nubile proportions from @entity61 , " @entity40 said
the exhibition 's narrative arc is formulated much like a @entity5 film : visitors pass through @entity76 's office , where @entity78 's top spy received his mission orders , to @entity80 , where he picked up his latest gadgets
a montage of the casino scenes from every @entity5 film play on the walls of the casino room before visitors take a trip through the " real , fictional , and otherworldly " exotic locations of 007 's many adventures
@entity91 : i 'd consider playing @entity5 the exhibition also traces the evolution of @entity5 's formidable wardrobe , from @entity98 's @entity97 - made tuxedos to @entity101 's @entity100 suits , and showcases a number of @entity17 dresses , including @entity106 's @entity105 dress from " @entity107
" @entity40 and her colleagues dug deep into the 007 archive in order to find pieces that evoke design in @entity5 films
" this is the only exhibition where @entity5 is a supporting character -- equally iconic are the sets , the gadgets , and the costumes , " she said
the costumes are remarkable , but at the end of the day @entity5 is a man of action -- which is why the exhibition 's grand finale culminates in the @entity126 from " @entity107 , " where visitors are surrounded with footage of 007 's many chase scenes in the snow
the exhibition ends where many of the spy 's adventures began : at the bar with a martini -- shaken , not stirred , obviously -- in classic @entity5 fashion
new @entity5 ' @entity139 ' game debuts
