-- a teenager who only picked up sailing to keep out of mischief while her mother worked at a yacht club has become a sporting success story in @entity6
@entity7 , 14 , won the bronze medal in the women 's laser radial sailing event at the @entity11 last year , and was subsequently named @entity12 at her country 's sports awards
her rapid success has seen her travel as far away as @entity17 and @entity18 to sail in tournaments -- a far cry from the humble village of @entity22 , from which @entity7 regularly makes the 40km trip to train at the @entity25
despite being blessed with thousands of kilometers of coastline , sailing is not a common pastime in @entity6 , a former @entity27 colony is south east @entity31
although she loves the sea , it is likely @entity7 would never have learned to sail were it not for the fact her mother , also named @entity7 , worked at the yacht club

thank @entity53 she got to where she is
" @entity7 's specialty is sailing @entity57 -- small yachts typically used by young people to learn to sail
she picked up the skill so quickly due to her dedication to training , she said -- a disciplined approach enforced by her mother
" she does not let me miss practice , " said @entity7
" if you do not miss practice , those who are experienced miss practice and get weaker
" @entity70 , one of the club 's directors , said @entity7 had become a national cause celebre following her unexpected success at september 's @entity11 , held in @entity6
" everyone reacted -- everyone was surprised
she was just 13 years old
no one was expecting a girl coming from a poor background to get a medal , " he said
" some of the sailors had been competing for five years , and @entity7 only had a year and half of training , and she managed to get to the medals
this was the surprise of the @entity11

" @entity7 does n't feel the pressure when she has to do something , " he said
" the other kids felt the pressure because there were another 13 countries racing for the medal
" @entity70 said the club 's membership used to be mostly made up of foreigners -- diplomats and development workers -- but it had been actively pursuing an outreach program to engage more young people in sailing
while many of the new recruits came from disadvantaged backgrounds , the club would cover the fees of the most promising , in the hope they would act as ambassadors for sailing
@entity7 's rapid success would go a long way to attracting other young @entity6 to the sport , he said
" for the normal citizens of @entity89 , when they look to this club , they always think this is a fancy club , " he said
" normally sailing clubs are like golf clubs , they 're for rich people
but we 're slowly changing this perception
