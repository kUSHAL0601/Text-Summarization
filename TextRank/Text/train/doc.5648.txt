@entity0 -- lithium - ion batteries , under global scrutiny following @entity7 fires , likely have a future in aviation provided there are adequate safeguards , a top @entity3 safety advocate said on wednesday
" i would not want to categorically say that these batteries are not safe
any new technology , any new design , there are going to be some inherent risks , " @entity13 , chairman of the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , said in @entity0
@entity13 added that the agency , which investigates transportation accidents and other incidents , is still " several weeks away " from determining electrical problems that have grounded the @entity7 worldwide in recent weeks
her investigators are specifically looking at a fire in early january that destroyed one of the two powerful batteries embedded in the belly of a @entity7 while the plane was on the ground in @entity30
" we need to understand why ( the @entity30 fire ) happened and we need to make sure that in future installations that those risks are mitigated , " she said
another battery - related incident that forced an emergency landing of a @entity7 several days after the @entity30 incident is part of the investigation that also includes the @entity41 , @entity43 regulators and @entity7
although there are only @entity46 in service worldwide , the stakes are high for the world 's largest aircraft manufacturer
following a difficult development , @entity7 has several hundred 787s on order at roughly $ 200 million apiece
the @entity7 is the first commercial aircraft to have extensive use of lithium - ion batteries , which can hold more electrical power in a smaller , lighter space
the battery type , used in starting the 787s two engines and running its auxiliary power system , is susceptible to thermal runaway -- a chemical chain reaction -- if overcharged or undercharged
resulting fires can be difficult to extinguish
the safety board has determined that thermal runaway and a short circuit occurred on the damaged 787 in @entity30
but it has not concluded which event occurred first , or whether they were the cause or the effect of the fire
@entity13 noted that the safety board has long had concerns about lithium - ion battery technology because of fire risk
" that is never more important than in aviation , " @entity13 said
" they ( aircraft ) do n't have the opportunity to pull over when there 's a fire
they do n't always have accessible compartments
they do n't have fire suppression in some of those areas
and so that is where we have raised concerns in the past
" the @entity14 also has concerns about that battery technology being shipped as cargo , saying the packaging and labeling is crucial to safe shipment
but she expressed hope that there were technological solutions to the technological problems
" we want to see that ( battery technology ) move forward
but the safety side of that is making sure that you 've done the right risk assessment ; that you understand what the failure modes are and that you 've mitigated any potential risks
" lithium - ion battery experts consulted by @entity1 say the batteries are safe for use in aviation
" the lithium - ion batteries can be safely transported on an airplane as long as the appropriate procedure for transporting them is followed , " said @entity116 of @entity118 's @entity117
in fact , " these lithium - ion batteries are safer than most chemicals being transported , " he said
@entity116 said he believes the root cause of the @entity30 fire was a problem with the management or the monitoring system of the battery , not the battery itself
" if you ban the transportation of lithium - ion batteries , everyone has to throw away their laptops , cell phones , @entity141 , etcetera , before they board the airplane
can you imagine that ? " he said
battery expert @entity145 also said batteries almost never self - combust
" you can never say never
but it is almost impossible to have a thermal runaway that would cause the combustion that you 're talking about , " he said
lithium - ion battery failures during use " are very rare , " said @entity145
" the statistics that we have are on computer batteries
and the cells that go into computer batteries have a failure rate of one in 10 million or even one in 40 million cells
so it 's quite rare , " he said
however , the fire incidents aboard the two @entity46 very early in the plane 's life has raised concern among safety experts
@entity7 has said its technical experts are working " around the clock " and are focused on " resolving the issue " and returning the 787 to service .
