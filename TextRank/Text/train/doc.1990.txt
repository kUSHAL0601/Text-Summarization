@entity0 -- president @entity2 wished the nation a happy @entity4 on thursday and also used his weekly address to renew his call for bipartisan cooperation on addressing major issues facing the nation
in the remarks usually delivered on a saturday , @entity2 said the first family will have the same kind of holiday experienced by millions of @entity14 -- filled with friends and relatives , good food and football
" and just as folks have done in every @entity4 since the first , we 'll spend some time taking stock of what we 're thankful for : the @entity24 - given bounty of @entity14 and the blessings of one another , " the president said
the @entity28 menu thursday featured traditional @entity4 fare , including turkey , ham , two kinds of stuffing , sweet potatoes , mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie , along with macaroni and cheese , greens and five other kinds of pie
@entity2 called for @entity14 to think about those less fortunate and saluted the " countless " @entity14 serving their country and communities , from soldiers on guard around the world to volunteers at local soup kitchens and food pantries
on thursday morning , @entity2 called 10 members of the military -- two from each the @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity52 -- deployed in the @entity14 operations in @entity58 and @entity59 , the @entity28 said
the president " thanked each of them for their service and sacrifice and wished them and their families a @entity4 , " the @entity28 statement said
the day before , the first family spent an hour handing out @entity4 dinner packages to people at @entity69 , a local aid organization
such service is " emblematic of what @entity14 have always done , " @entity2 said in his weekly address
" we come together and do what 's required to make tomorrow better than today , " he said
" that 's who we are
" that means supporting the nation 's soldiers and working together to help spur faster economic recovery from the recession , he said
" but we wo n't do it as any one political party , " he said
" we 've got to do it as one people
and in the coming weeks and months , i hope that we can work together , @entity86 and @entity87 and independents alike , to make progress on these and other issues
" noting his scheduled meeting tuesday with congressional leaders from both parties , @entity2 said it was time for " a real and honest discussion , because i believe that if we stop talking at one another and start talking with one another , we can get a lot done
" " for what we are called to do again today is n't about @entity86 or @entity87 , " he said
" it 's not about left or right
it 's about what we know this country is capable of
it 's about what we want @entity14 to be in this new century
