-- " what time of day do you think we should be open ? " veteran public relations executive @entity0 asks her staff
" 10 , 10:30 , " comes the response from several 20 - something employees , along with a few giggles
@entity0 is n't about to keep the doors closed until 10:30 a.m. , but she 's listening
the chief executive officer of @entity10 has been doing plenty of listening to her staff of about 80
the vast majority of them are members of the millennial generation -- born after 1980 -- and some of their requests might be considered audacious by executives many years their senior
millennials at @entity10 have asked for free food , which @entity22 offers ; a juice bar ; a yoga / @entity25 room ; even reimbursement for a personal trainer
@entity28 did n't grant any of those perks , but she understands that they may not seem outrageous for someone with a millennial mindset
" they want the workplace to recognize that they 're not 9 - to - 5 people
they 're not people that are ever going to wear gray flannel suits , " @entity0 said
for many millennials , the priority is , " life first , work second
" " i have a girlfriend
and these are all things that are very important , because we work to live and not the other way around , " @entity10 staffer @entity47 said
as millennials play an increasingly important role in the work force , their likes and dislikes are changing the way @entity58 works and forcing a growing number of executives in a wide range of industries to change policies and management style
millennials have seen their parents laid off and burned out by corporate america , so life / work balance is especially important to them , management experts say
" if you want to get the best people , you have to meet them halfway , " said @entity70 , associate professor at the @entity72 's @entity71
" being inflexible wo n't get you anywhere
" so , @entity75 does permit very casual dress : tattoos are on display , as are toes sticking out of flip - flops
the company sponsors rooftop happy hours three days a week , offers half - day summer fridays and gives time off for volunteer work
hiring director @entity83 recently returned from a six - month volunteer stint with @entity85 in the aftermath of the country 's devastating earthquake
" i 'm really lucky i got to do that and then come back to the job that i 've loved for five years , " @entity83 said
@entity0 feels it 's best not to manage from an authoritarian position
rather , she strives to be a leader , peer and student of her young employees
why ? because they are plugged into the social media revolution that is changing the way the world communicates , including corporate @entity58
" they 're the new marketplace
they 're the new brains
they come with all the social media tools and tricks embedded in them as natives , " she said
the public relations veteran recognizes that she needs to be flexible enough to accommodate as many requests as possible from her young staffers , requests she says she would n't have dared made when she was starting her career in the early ' 80s
managing millennials requires executives to check their egos and build up a thick skin
not only are young employees demanding , they 're quick to voice criticism , even online for the world to see , something @entity0 has experienced
but she 's put aside inclinations to exert her power in favor of recognizing the potential of her young employees , who she argues are anything but slackers
" you 're not the smartest person in the room anymore
you may be the most experienced
you may be the wisest
you 're not the smartest , " she said
it 's paid off for @entity10 the firm has enjoyed strong growth under @entity0 , with clients including @entity142 and pharmaceutical firms @entity144 and @entity145
the millennial style of working can yield success if the boss is willing to throw out the old rulebook .
