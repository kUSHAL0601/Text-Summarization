-- @entity1 is trying not to get caught up in the national story that he has become -- one that landed on the cover of @entity5 this week , and one that 'll just keeping growing if he leads the @entity6 to the @entity7 with a win in @entity9 on sunday
still , he ca n't help but allow himself a few glimpses into the hysteria
they usually come while sitting at the computer , looking through photos of strangers replicating his touchdown celebration , flexing his arm and kissing his bicep , in unusual places
" i saw a girl kaepernicking while she was riding a horse , " he said at a news conference this week in @entity22
yes , it is a word now -- kaepernicking -- just like the phenomena surrounding another quarterback unafraid to run with the football
but unlike @entity30 , whose celebration of kneeling in the end zone in prayer became known as " @entity34 , " there are plenty of reasons to think @entity1 will have staying power in the @entity38
he will start just his ninth career game against the @entity40 on sunday , with the @entity41 on the line
but already , teams have struggled to defend against his speed as a runner and his improving accuracy as a passer
@entity1 rushed for 181 yards , a playoff record for a quarterback , and threw with 263 and two touchdowns in a playoff win against @entity52 last week
@entity38 serves up barn burners here are seven reasons why you 'll be hearing plenty about no. 7 on the 49ers , in this season and beyond : 1
might as well start here , because if you 've seen a 49ers game in the second half of the season , you had to notice that @entity1 ( pronounced kap - er - nick ) has plenty of them
they were at the center of a media firestorm in december when a columnist for @entity73 / @entity72 wrote , " @entity38 quarterback is the ultimate position of influence and responsibility
he is the ceo of a high - profile organization , and you do n't want your ceo to look like he just got paroled
" his family was outraged
" are you categorizing this kid on something like tattoos ? " his mother , @entity81 , told @entity82
@entity1 had a 4.0 gpa in high school and is active in charities
as for the tattoos ? the ones on his biceps are @entity93 verses , and the words across his chest say , " @entity96
" besides : tattoos are hardly viewed negatively , especially among young people
the tattoos might make people notice @entity1 , but his playing style makes it impossible to stop watching him
of the four quarterbacks still alive in the @entity38 playoffs , he is unique
@entity106 ( @entity107 ) , @entity108 ( @entity109 ) and @entity110 ( @entity111 ) are all classic drop - back passers who run as a last resort
@entity1 runs the 40 - yard dash in about 4.5 seconds , which is exceptionally good for a quarterback
he does n't want to be known as a " running quarterback , " a tag that has dogged several two - dimensional quarterbacks to come before him
" when i got into high school , college , i watched @entity122 , @entity123 a lot , ( @entity126 ) @entity125 , watched the old clips of ( @entity129 ) @entity128 , " @entity1 said
" they were all quarterbacks that were mobile and could make plays
" the key is not complicated : " run where they 're not
you want to run away from where the defensive players are
when they get close , get down
defenses would be unwise to dismiss @entity1 as a passer
he has completed 62.4 % of his throws this season for 1,814 yards , with 10 touchdowns and -- maybe most important for a team with a stellar defense -- just three interceptions
plus , there 's a maturity in his game
his coach , former @entity38 quarterback @entity151 , is impressed with his ability to shake off bad plays
" as a quarterback and you throw an interception in a game , there 's just a tendency the next time to double check things , " @entity151 said
" you 're double checking , then double checking
and that 's not the way to do it
so you want him to be trusting what he sees and cut it loose
and i think he 's shown a rare ability to not do that , to not have to double check
he has the perfect coach
@entity1 would still be another mostly anonymous backup if @entity151 had n't made one of the gutsiest decisions of the @entity38 season
@entity151 replaced @entity179 , who had played well during the season and led the team to the brink of the @entity7 in 2011 , with the untested second - year pro. it was n't just a leap of faith
in the eight quarters that preceded a concussion injury , @entity179 had completed 32 of 35 passes for 385 yards with five touchdowns
think about that : he had more touchdowns than incomplete passes
still , @entity151 is a former quarterback who saw another dimension in @entity1 , and one who will be able to build an offensive system around his strengths
he 's on a team on the rise
good quarterbacks make their teams better , of course
but the opposite is true
@entity1 was n't stepping into a desperate situation when he took charge in @entity22
he was taking over a contender
@entity22 , which lost to the @entity206 in the @entity41 championship game a year ago on a late field goal , has one of the best running backs in the game in @entity211 ( 1,214 yards ) and the second stingiest defense ( allowing 17.1 points a game )
he also has an elite young target in receiver @entity216 , who caught 85 passes for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns
@entity1 's play is a major reason the 49ers are four - point favorites on the road , even though @entity111 rarely loses in the @entity224
everyone likes a good backstory
@entity1 has a terrific one
he was born in @entity229 in 1987 and adopted by his parents , @entity231 and @entity81 , who had lost two infants to a congenital heart disease
the family moved to @entity235 when @entity1 was 4 , and quickly his talent as an athlete became clear
the kid noticed , too
he wrote a letter to himself as a fourth grader not only predicting that he 'd be a quarterback in the @entity38 , but also that he 'd play for the 49ers or the @entity52
hey , it certainly does n't hurt , in this era , to be trending on social media
the @entity245 asked readers to send photos of them @entity248 , and did they ever respond
in front of a frozen waterfall
on the top of a mountain
on top of a motor home
as far as letting the hype get to him , @entity1 said the new fame had n't changed anything
i watch anything on tv but sports , and i go to bed and come back and do it the same way the next day
" if he wins his next game , he 'll wake up as a @entity7 quarterback
and an even bigger story .
