@entity0 called the police after she said her husband , staff sargent @entity2 , punched her in the face and fired gun shots at her from the upstairs window of their house
he 's now in jail -- serving eight years in prison for assault with a deadly weapon
before this incident in 2012 , @entity2 served 28 months in @entity13 and a year in @entity14
@entity2 is not alone : as many as nine percent of recent retuning veterans have been arrested , according to a study by the @entity17
@entity19 's @entity18 was granted exclusive access to the @entity21 in @entity22 , which houses a program geared specifically toward veteran support services
many veterans say they did n't know about the resources provided by the @entity27 to help make their transition back into civilian life easier
the program ay @entity21 is one of the first of its kind -- and some veterans say it is providing them the guidance they did n't receive during their time in the military
" i got out blind , not knowing all that was out there , not knowing that the @entity27 could assist with housing or medical or dental or anything like that , " @entity42 , who was honorably discharged from the marines , said
" i did n't know any of that
i just got out and figured that was the end of my service
" @entity42 spent time in the facility because he forged checks after his military service concluded
" i was struggling really bad , " he said
" i needed the money right then and there
" the facility offers a series of services to help veterans help transfer the skills they obtained in the military , including a veterans ' benefit coordinator , anger management courses , job training and substance abuse counseling
5 ways to honor veterans beyond @entity67 drug and alcohol violations are chief among the common crimes for which the 75 veterans serve time in dormitory 5 - a of the correctional center
@entity74 , who served in the army in @entity14 for five years , told @entity19 's @entity18 he took drugs to deal with " some of the sights and stuff i seen over there
" " by us being here i actually kind of got back some of those military values , " he said
" now i 'm actually on the right track
" @entity84 , a counselor at the facility , says the biggest challenge facing the group is post-traumatic stress disorder
part of her job , she says , is reaching out to the community to let veterans know that their facility can help
veterans say these support services and peer workshops set their facility apart from the rest of the prison community
some even called the facility a " brotherhood
" " i got a college degree since i 've been here and did really well , " @entity102 veteran @entity101 said
" guys tended to be supportive of that whereas before they were anywhere from indifferent to mocked it and would get in the way of it
" the program is still too new to fully assess its success , but early numbers suggest that the rate of offenders who return to prison after spending time in the facility is lower than average
but when it comes to fighting stigma about seeking mental health in the veteran community , there 's still a long way to go
" do n't be too proud to help
help is out there , " @entity101 said
" we laid down our lives for the country
there 's people who are willing to do the same for you , for your health and your betterment
" @entity135 wants to give some @entity137 veterans a second chance
