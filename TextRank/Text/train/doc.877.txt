-- on monday , news broke that about 200 girls had been kidnapped from their school in @entity4 , in the northeastern state of @entity6 -- a region at the center of @entity10 's five - year terrorist insurgency
the very next day , the @entity10 military announced that all but nine of the girls had been rescued
this turned out to be untrue
the school 's principal and the girls ' parents complained that the girls were still missing
in august last year , a military spokesman announced the death of @entity21 , the leader of @entity23 extremist group @entity22 , at the hands of the military
but like the news of the release of the schoolgirls , it proved to be fiction
' misleading sources ' incidents like this have come to shape the way the military is perceived in the wildly unpredictable battle against @entity22
posts on the military 's social media accounts regularly boast of " smoking out " or ambushing terrorists or recovering weapons -- often written in way that brings to mind @entity44 's infamous former information minister under @entity45 , dubbed " @entity46 , " who claimed coalition forces were in retreat even as @entity50 tanks rolled almost unchallenged across the country in 2003
like him they 've also ended up pinning the blame for inaccurate reporting on " misleading " sources
even when there is truth to its narratives -- and there have been major successes , including a crackdown that started in early 2013 that killed several top @entity65 commanders and driven others across the border into @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 -- the triumphalism seems odd when juxtaposed with the harsh reality of events like the @entity4 abduction , or the one at another government school in neighboring @entity75 in february , in which more than fifty schoolboys were murdered in their dormitories , with nary a soldier in sight until several hours later
perhaps the military resorts to this impulsively buoyant tone because it believes it can not afford to sound anything otherwise
or perhaps it 's simply because it can get away with it -- because the @entity10 authorities have a long and remarkable history of getting away with anything they say
that tenuous relationship with fact makes it relatively easy for senior government officials to publicly dispute government finances to the tune of billions of dollars ; and for an assortment of newspaper headlines to display wildly differing casualty figures the morning after a bombing incident
death ' cheap and plentiful ' and then there 's the scale of @entity10 's tragedies
for a country that is not at war , death is cheap and plentiful
so cheap and so sweeping in its audacity that @entity10 readily make jokes about it
that might help explain the trademark blunted edge of @entity10 outrage
if it happens often enough , the mind is soon inured , and eagerly accepting of the sense of resignation that might offer the best protection against the emotional impact of the next cycle of negative breaking news
all of the above combine to create the context in which the @entity10 military -- wielding political power for 29 of @entity10 's first 39 years after independence -- has learned to operate
not since the civil war , almost 50 years ago , has it been tested this much
the closest it got were the lengthy tours of duty in @entity131 and @entity132 , in which it played a prominent role at the head of the @entity136 , intended more as a " peacekeeping " unit than a combat force
indeed what we are seeing may be evidence of its struggle to adapt to new rules of engagement , fighting an enemy driven by convictions much deeper than those displayed by the pro-democracy activists and diamond - obsessed rebels it contended with in the 1990s ; possessing access to sophisticated weapons , and operating in terrain far better suited to insurgents than conventional armies
abuse claims the increasing militarization of the troubled zones has since spurred accusations of human rights abuses , from local and international observers
an @entity164 report from april 2014 has called for an end to the use of " heavy - handed military and police methods that risk pushing yet more restless , jobless and frustrated youths into violence and extremism
" communication strategies also require overhaul
in the age of social media , the military needs to realize that propaganda is now a lot more likely to be found out and discredited
news reports suggest that the military , long hampered by aging hardware , is now acquiring new weapons and equipment
in a country where institutional graft is the rule and not the exception , it is crucial to ensure that the military budgets are spent to boost the military 's capability , and troops ' morale -- and not pocketed by bigwigs
international cooperation also needs to be stepped up ; and it does seem that the government is now more willing than ever to work with @entity199 and @entity50
@entity10 have long been wary of allowing the @entity50 military the sort of foothold it has in countries like @entity204 and @entity205 , but there 's certainly room for more intense cooperation that does not involve abdicating total control
finally the military will need to prepare to adapt itself to the reality of the government 's planned shift to a " soft " counter-terrorism strategy , embodied in a document unveiled by @entity217 , @entity218 , a retired @entity220 colonel , in march
amid the backlash it has faced recently , the beleaguered military can count on the support of a growing number of @entity10 , who think that it is being under appreciated for the work it is doing
just this week a " support the @entity230 " page launched on @entity229 , in honor of " our military men and women on the field who risk their lives daily to keep us safe
