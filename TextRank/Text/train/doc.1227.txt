when @entity1 was a newbie president , there was no shortage of ambition or lack of confidence in the government he was about to lead
government should be seen as a force for good , not evil
sure , he told us , it needed to be " smarter and better , " but that could — and would — happen under his watch
never mind that @entity15 spent years " reinventing government " with mixed success
or that only 2 % of the @entity19 public believes that government can be trusted to do the right thing all the time
president @entity1 was convinced he could change all that with programs that would deliver for @entity19 — such as health care reform — and the public would be grateful
instead , the president is living his own version of " @entity30 " : staring down a rabbit hole of government bureaucracy and inefficiency
the government he has studiously tried to grow , manage and change has become his own personal nemesis
all of which makes you wonder : does the president himself trust government anymore ? the scandal at the @entity41 is just the latest in a slew of bureaucratic messes that strike at the core power point of the @entity1 presidency : making government work
consider the disastrous health care website rollout
even the question of @entity52 surveillance raises questions about the role of government : did the civil libertarian @entity1 allow spies to run amok ? the president is clearly having a running debate with himself over all this
about a year ago , after the @entity52 program was revealed and @entity62 and libertarians started squawking , @entity1 seemed more than a tad defensive on government spying
" if people ca n't trust not only the executive branch but also do n't trust @entity68 ... to make sure that we 're abiding by the @entity70 ... " he said , " then we 're going to have some problems here
these are not trivial matters
health care is the signature legislative achievement of the administration , and a botched rollout made it smell bad at the start
fixing the @entity79 — and aiding veterans — is a cornerstone of the @entity1 presidency
and yet , it all looks as if somehow the bureaucracy has beaten the boss
it 's a management issue
so far as i can tell , the governing style of this administration has two extremes : issues singled out for micromanagement ( as in , foreign policy , from the @entity94 ) and issues completely delegated ( as in , @entity79 management )
what seems to be missing is the in - between : the continual monitoring and early warning system that avoids presidential blindsiding
that 's the area in which most of the business of government actually gets done
and it can get done
the apparatus to do the nation 's business in a competent way is there
use it , and manage it
that 's what chief executives are hired to do
government is unwieldy and difficult and hard to tame , sure
but if your presidency is based , in large part , on telling @entity19 that government can work for them -- which it can -- you need to make it work
it 's not that the president is a hopeless manager
he does very well when he leads a hierarchical organization with a single goal , like a presidential bid
he 's top dog , he 's not negotiating with anybody , and he 's not trying to get people to do things they do n't want to do
in a campaign , for instance , they all want to elect the same person : him
but when you have to negotiate — or lead — people not related to you , or not indebted to you or who do n't agree with you , it 's a different story
managing or negotiating with people with mixed motives ( @entity68 , anyone ? ) is not an @entity1 strong point
by nature , bureaucracies are hard to trust and even harder to tame
and if a chief executive is n't careful , it 's an energy - sapping ( and legacy endangering ) vortex that sucks you right in
just ask @entity1 , who was government 's best friend
does he still feel that way today ? hard to know
but my guess is he 's a bit like @entity155
" i ca n't go back to yesterday , " she said , " because i was a different person then
" opinion : @entity1 is responsible for @entity79 mess , but it may not be entirely his fault
