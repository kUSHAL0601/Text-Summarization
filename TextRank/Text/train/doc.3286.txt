-- a trip to @entity2 to learn more about her family 's ancestry became a nightmare for @entity8 journalist @entity7
in january 2009 , several men showed up at the @entity2 - @entity8 's door and carted her off to @entity12 , the notoriously brutal lockup outside @entity13 where three @entity8 hikers were recently imprisoned
like @entity15 , @entity15 and @entity15 , @entity7 was accused of being a spy for the @entity8 like them , she denied the accusation
@entity2 tried , convicted and sentenced @entity7 to eight years
but , to her shock , she was freed after 100 days
she returned to the @entity8 in may 2009
on wednesday , @entity15 and @entity15 were freed after two years at @entity12
@entity15 was released last year
@entity0 talked with @entity7 about the advice she would give the hikers and about her experience at @entity12
@entity0 : did you ever hope that you might be set free , even after your sentence ? @entity7 : i did n't think i was going to be set free after being sentenced to eight years
when they said i was going to be freed , i was in disbelief , very happy disbelief
@entity0 : you wrote in your book that about gaining a unique kind of mental clarity and toughness
@entity7 : i learned over time , especially from my cellmates , that things happen to you , and you ca n't control them
all you can control is your response to them
in prison , you can not control your physical environment
@entity0 : you can say that , but to actually live that way under those circumstances is another thing
you were interrogated for days on end
@entity7 : ( the interrogators ) were mostly harsh and threatening , but then they would say , " oh , are you hungry ? do you want us to make comfortable ? do you want some tea or some water ? " i think it was partly to mess with the person 's mind
my cellmates , the women who were prisoners , they are the strong ones
there were times when i was angry and told myself that i hate the sin and not the sinner
i had to learn from my cellmates , who were in prison much longer
i asked them , " how do you not hate these people for doing this to you ? " ( @entity7 says she nurtured relationships with other prisoners by teaching them @entity70
many were at @entity12 for believing in @entity71 , a monotheistic faith believers are persecuted for in @entity2
) @entity7 : these prisoners told me , " we do n't hate ( the guards ) , but we forgive them , " which was incredible to me
i tried hard to hate the sin and not the sinner
... i realized we are all human beings , and ( the prison workers ) do their jobs to have job security
they get paid for it
some of them do believe in the ideology , and some do n't
if our captors , i believe , were raised in a different environment , they would n't do what they do
but i really got a lot of strength from other prisoners
we taught each other jokes in our different languages
i taught them vocabulary that had to do with shopping and @entity70 curse words
@entity0 : how did you exercise ? @entity7 : sit - ups , push - ups in our cell
we were allowed to go outside four times a day , escorted by guards who pushed and tugged at the chadors we had to wear
the guards would take us to a cement cage -- the walls , all cement and bars
overhead them , at least you could see sky
@entity0 : when the guards were marching you back and forth , did you say anything to them ? did they speak to you ? @entity7 : they mostly did n't say anything
( but ) a female guard -- she was older -- reached under my chador and grabbed my hand and squeezed it
@entity0 : did you see any other humanity like that in your guards ? @entity7 : there was humanity in some of them , in this female guard
she seemed to be trying to tell me that everyone would be ok
toward me , the guards were mostly civil
i did see them yelling at other prisoners
i assume that because i was a foreigner , and @entity2 say they are kind to foreigners
we tried to learn more about the women guards , because they would stop by our cells when they were giving us food
they were very tight - lipped and were instructed not to say much about themselves
we got tidbits about their lives
one had kids , and one had a nose job ; this kind of plastic surgery is very popular in @entity2
they had the same values -- caring about how they looked -- like other women would have
but i did n't get that close with any of them
they do n't allow it
@entity0 : tell me more about how you kept sane , especially in solitary confinement
how did you even keep track of time ? @entity7 : well , i thought i was going crazy
i was in solitary for more than two weeks ; then i was sent to a cell that had state - run tv playing so i could see the time
i could hear the call to prayer and see sun rays cast on the cell walls and floors
@entity0 : can you describe what solitary confinement was like ? @entity7 : it was dark
i could hold my hands out and touch two walls
there was ratty brown carpet
there was a broke toilet
a sign on the wall quoted ( founder and supreme leader of the @entity182 said , " prisons must be colleges for human improvement
" there was a window on the ceiling out of reach that was covered with metal mesh and bars
on the other side of my wall , i heard a prisoner whimpering
i was very worried , because no one knew where i was
( @entity7 wrote in her memoir " between two worlds : my life and captivity in @entity2 " that only after many days did @entity2 authorities allow her to call her father
they forced her to lie to him in saying that she did n't know where she was and that she was in trouble for drinking alcohol
) i tried to keep my sanity by singing songs like @entity208 carols and " we will rock you , " and i played notes with my fingers on the wall
i kept saying things that gave me courage like @entity220 's " i do believe i am seeking only @entity217 's truth and have lost all fear of man
" @entity0 : when you were let out of solitary , what happened ? @entity7 : they put me in another cell
@entity0 : and you were held for four months
what did you think when news came last week when the @entity2 president said that @entity15 and @entity15 were going to be released ? and what did you think when they were freed wednesday ? @entity7 : in @entity2 , you never believe it until you see it
i thought about their families
@entity0 : you 've talked to their families before
@entity7 : i could relate to how worried they were
my parents were in a similar situation
i wanted to comfort them and to explain what prison was like for me
@entity0 : what would you say to @entity15 and @entity15 now ? @entity7 : i 'd like to hear from them how their situation was
i hope that they are able to adapt well in this new part of their life and perhaps learned lessons in prison that can help them when they 're free
i would tell them to take their time and not feel pressured to make decisions
it 's theirs again .
