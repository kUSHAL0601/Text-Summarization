editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- it ca n't be very hard for @entity24 to explain to his family why he wants to fly around the world with only sunlight for fuel
in the 1930s , his grandfather , physicist and inventor @entity31 , applied his excitement and interest in ballooning to designing a high - flying balloon attached to a pressurized aluminum gondola
the first of its kind , @entity31 's flying machine completed a record - breaking climb more than 50,000 feet into the air , gathering valuable data about the @entity43 's upper atmosphere along the way
fitting that @entity24 , for what it 's worth , defeated the notorious sir @entity47 by becoming the first man to circumnavigate the globe in a balloon in 1999
his grandfather 's pioneering principles of balloon technology were eventually applied to allow descent into the deep ocean , which informed the work of his father , @entity57 , an oceanographer and engineer who made history in 1960 as part of the first and only manned exploration of the @entity62 , the deepest place in the ocean
the work of his family would provide the vision -- and the name -- for @entity69 's @entity68 , who would seem to exercise some influence over the real @entity24 too
@entity24 's enthusiasm for adventure , morally sound intuition and haircut seem directly taken from @entity69 's description of the fictional spaceship captain
@entity24 believes that as much as the world is locked into short term ways of thinking , there are positive and optimistic solutions that are profitable , protect the environment , create jobs and help economic growth
to fulfill his own vision , @entity24 has applied his and his family 's pioneering spirit and brilliance to develop @entity89 , a solar - powered long - range glider to fly around the world and to harness an unlimited form of renewable energy using technologies that wo n't contribute to daunting environmental concerns
think of him as @entity96 in reverse
watch the rest of @entity99 at @entity9 @entity24 's dream is already coming to fruition
last july , the @entity89 became the first solar - powered airplane ever to fly through a complete daylight cycle
the goal is to one day be able to develop a solar plane capable of carrying multiple passengers , but do n't try to book a flight just yet
@entity107 , who 's been working with @entity24 since 2003 , says that while it 's possible to make it around the world with one person on board the @entity89 now , " it will take more time for new technologies to allow passengers to fly without [ creating ] any pollution
" with a more than 200 - foot wingspan and weighing in at less than 4000 pounds -- the weight of a mid-sized car -- the @entity89 has been designed entirely with energy conservation in mind
in fact , the remarkably resourceful aircraft uses roughly the same amount of energy that the @entity126 ' illustrious flying machine required to power in 1903
its state of the art propulsion system is made up of four motors containing polymer lithium batteries and a heat management system designed to conserve heat at high altitudes
coupled with an onboard computing system that gathers and analyzes flight management procedures , the @entity89 's likeness to the @entity137 is only superficial
it 's hard to imagine what the look on @entity140 and @entity142 's faces would be if only they could see what their design has inspired
in the sixth episode of @entity150 ! series , we travel back to @entity151 , @entity152 , to talk to @entity24 about his vision for @entity89 , the impact it could have on the world and why , if we ca n't think and act sustainably , generations to come will be forced to face the growing dilemma our current way of life is creating in our increasingly fragile environment .
