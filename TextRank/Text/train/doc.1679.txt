if you have n't heard of them yet , you will soon
they are about to change something basic about @entity7 life : the sight of the mail carrier strolling up to the front door to drop off that day 's letters , magazines , bills and advertising fliers
door - to - door mail delivery appears to be a luxury that the @entity17 no longer can afford
it 's no secret that the @entity17 is in terrible financial trouble ; last year the agency lost $ 16 billion
no business can afford to go on that way without making dramatic changes
as @entity25 's @entity24 reported from @entity26 last week , the @entity17 has begun telling communities with new housing developments that mail carriers will not provide doorstep , or even curbside , delivery
instead , cluster boxes -- groupings of mailboxes at a centralized point in the community -- will be constructed
homeowners will be expected to leave their houses and go to the nearest cluster box to pick up their daily mail
and in @entity43 , rep. @entity41 , @entity42 , is proposing that door - to - door delivery be done away with not just in new developments , but at existing homes , too
he believes the @entity17 could save $ 4 billion a year this way
it 's hard to counter the argument that if something drastic is n't done , the @entity17 simply wo n't be able to operate much longer
with @entity7 relying more and more on e-mail and text messages , and with bills being routinely paid online , the @entity17 is n't bringing in enough revenue to justify the enormous costs of universal mail delivery
postmaster general @entity57 has been pushing for the elimination of saturday mail delivery , but congressional resistance made him put the plan on hold
even though @entity57 says that saturday delivery is no longer fiscally feasible , members of @entity43 are reluctant to anger their constituents -- both individuals and businesses -- by letting the plan go through
if the cluster boxes begin proliferating , though , and people are told that the mail carrier wo n't be appearing at their doors , you can expect widespread unhappiness and high - decibel frustration
it 's not that people do n't understand that the @entity17 is on the ropes
but to declare such a fundamental @entity7 tradition -- the arrival of the postal carrier at the front door -- past tense will not go unnoticed or uncontested
it 's hardly wild speculation to predict that people will not relish having to go out into the weather every time they want to retrieve their mail
some wo n't trust the security of the group mailboxes , no matter how many assurances they receive
they 'll be especially vexed on rainy or snowy days when they make the trip to the cluster boxes , only to find that the carrier has n't arrived yet
for those accustomed to door - to - door mail service , the act of picking up and sorting through the mail in front of other people may feel less private
opinion : no more saturday visits from @entity103 yet the really noteworthy thing is not what may be ending -- the noteworthy thing is what we have taken on faith for so long
if someone in government , today , were proposing to start the @entity17 from scratch , offering the amenities @entity7 are accustomed to , he 'd be laughed out of the room
" you 're saying that this service of yours would be expected to send uniformed workers to every house and business in @entity7 ? " " yes
" " how would the homeowners and business owners summon these couriers ? " " they would n't have to summon them -- the postal workers would be required to just automatically show up
" " how often ? " " every day but sunday
" " and then you say that they 'd carry the letter anywhere in the country ? door to door ? " " yes
" " so how much would it cost to take a letter from , say , @entity133 , @entity134 , to @entity135 , @entity134 ? " " forty - six cents
" " but how can you possibly do such a thing so cheaply ? " " some people will complain that it 's too expensive
" " all right -- but if it 's 46 cents to take a letter from one town in @entity134 to another town in @entity134 , how much would it cost to carry a letter from , say , @entity145 to @entity146 ? " " forty - six cents
" " what ? " " it would cost the same , no matter how great the distance
" " that makes no sense at all
what about the cost of fuel ? how can you charge the same amount for a letter to go five miles as you charge for it to go 3,000 miles ? " " because that 's what people will insist on
" it does sound impossible , does n't it ? it sounds like a plan so farfetched that it would never get off the ground
yet it has been an unquestioned part of the way we 've always lived
we no longer live that way
we expect our information to reach us instantly , on screens and phones and tablets , wherever we may be
but we expect to receive our mail the old way , too
it 's an unenviable position for the people who run the @entity17 to be in
see you at the cluster box
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .
