-- there are few philosophers whose very name provokes more violent responses than @entity5
his stern face , framed by a mass of gray hair , symbolizes for many @entity10 the costly battles of the 20th century : battles against communism , socialism , and authoritarianism fought in defense of democracy and free - market capitalism
as successive generations of @entity10 waged those fights , the philosophical disputes at the core of the conflicts embedded themselves into the @entity10 soul
so much so that when the " evil empire , " whose seeds sprouted from @entity5 's doctrine , died as a result of the revolutions of 1989 , the ideological battle did not
though the @entity31 is but a memory , and that other communist behemoth -- @entity36 -- has mutated into a capitalist autocracy , the specter of @entity5 himself remains as potent as ever in 21st century @entity10 political discourse
since 2008 especially , with the fall of financial markets and the rise of @entity42 , the charge " @entity44 " has been hurled like toxic sludge against politicians seen as ready to redistribute wealth ( to the advantage of most @entity10 ) , expand social safety nets , or ensure that all children receive a good education
critics say these steps are merely the first along a slippery slope that inevitably ends in outright state control
amid these warnings , the communist horrors of the 20th century float like dark apparitions , reminding us of the bad old days
but i wonder how many of those who invoke the name of @entity5 in order to stifle political debate actually believe their own propaganda
or are they conjuring up a convenient bogeyman at a time of great uncertainty
do they raise @entity5 's image in order to deflect attention from slightly warmer bodies ( @entity5 has been dead for 128 years ) in positions of political or economic power who are actually more pernicious ? i also wonder whether those who use @entity5 's name , and those who tremble at the thought of him , actually know much about the man
are they reacting to @entity5 or those things done in his name ? i believe it is the latter
i also believe it is time to understand @entity5 so that we are no longer made to fear him
when i began working on a biography of @entity5 's family in 2003 , i was well acquainted with his theories
i knew , as most do , the history of the governments formed to reflect the state he had supposedly envisioned
i knew of the atrocities committed by those said to be his followers
i had not , however , been properly introduced to the man himself
what i discovered was not what i expected
@entity5 was a middle - class philosopher , economist , and journalist ( whose main employer was a @entity108 newspaper )
he was also flawed in the extreme
he drank excessively , behaved shamefully in his home life , and worked obsessionally , though he produced little that earned him money or recognition during his lifetime
these flaws , however , made him more interesting because , despite being in a state of near constant personal crisis , he was able to accomplish what he set out to do -- he changed the world
@entity5 began his opposition activities as a youth in @entity122 against an absolute monarch who could not see , or perhaps chose not to see , that society was changing
the industrial revolution was spreading eastward and @entity127 businessmen were eager to expand with it
but the old system of government would not allow for such progress
the king would not allow the democratic reforms that were the handmaidens of the new industrial order
this was @entity5 's first battle , to expose the contradictions between the centuries - old monarchical system and the world as it existed in the first half of the 19th century
according to @entity5 , it was only natural that as the means of production changed -- in this case a move from an agricultural base to an industrial one -- society would be altered
and if , as he believed , a government 's sole function was to serve the people , then government must also change
@entity5 saw this social evolution as inevitable
it only became revolution when the kings and their minions refused to reform
by the 1850s , the industrialists had gained political power after revolts across @entity162 in 1848 caused kings to view proto - capitalists as allies against radicalized lower classes
the wheels of industry were humming , as were the halls of finance , where a new breed of speculator was born , addicted to risk in his quest for ever greater profit
@entity5 quickly recognized that capitalism would institutionalize social and economic instability
the system 's inherent hunger for new markets , new consumers , new and cheaper methods of production in order to increase the flow of capital would result in a destructive system of boom and bust
after each cataclysm , he predicted , the number of capitalists at the top of the pyramid would be smaller , while the base of disaffected workers grew
gradually even the middle class would be included
@entity5 believed that industrial capitalism had also created a new system of repression and exploitation
politically and socially men were no more equal under this new order than they had been under a monarchy
rights belonged to those with money and property ; those with only a strong back or skilled hands could not even vote
financially , those filling the ranks of the industrial workforce were arguably worse off
there was evidence aplenty to support @entity5 's assessment
he lived in @entity217 , the richest city in the world
and yet as great as was its wealth , much greater was its poverty
in @entity5 's neighborhood , some people rented a space in a bed and called it comfort
others paid for a few inches on a stairwell and called it home
@entity5 summed up the situation saying , " there must be something rotten in the very core of a social system which increases its wealth without diminishing its misery
" this is the field where @entity5 's ideas grew
he famously spent year after year in the @entity239 , trying to understand this new system , predict its course , and , finally , offer an alternative
throughout the 16 years before he produced his greatest literary work @entity244 , @entity5 's family lived in near continual destitution
their sole consolation was that they believed @entity5 's work was noble and important , and that their suffering was small compared with the majority of people who sacrificed their lives so someone else could live in luxury
@entity244 and @entity5 's other political - economic writings were only one aspect of his work
he was also an organizer and educator
through various small groups , he tried to teach workers , who had neither formal education nor viewed themselves as a political force
the courses included language , literature and history , but mostly politics and economics
@entity5 was convinced that the only way to successfully change society was to educate the population so that it could eventually lead itself
in 1864 , the most important of his many organizational endeavors was born , the @entity274
its goal was to connect workers and trade unions throughout @entity162 and @entity10 to protect their rights in the face of an increasingly powerful capitalist system , whose tentacles had spread beyond individual nations and were encircling the globe
@entity5 recognized the working man 's greatest power was his number
@entity5 died in 1883 , before his books gained a wide readership and before the workers he had been fighting for took their places in government as representatives of labor and socialist political parties
it had taken decades of struggle -- largely nonviolent -- for this to occur
but @entity5 knew the path to progress would be slow , and that ultimately the best way to re-balance society was through the ballot box
he also believed , however , that the working man had the right to revolt if those in power tried to deny him such political expression -- free speech , free assembly , freedom of the press -- and the vote
@entity5 's actual vision for a government of the future was vague , which no doubt is why it has produced so many variants
but he believed ultimately mankind would naturally evolve out of capitalism and socialism , and embrace a communist society in which government was no longer necessary at all
it is a utopian dream that has occurred nowhere -- least of all in the countries most associated with his name
today , many people know @entity5 only through the crimes of the former communist countries
but @entity5 's ideas also helped give birth to mainstream political parties in @entity162 -- @entity333 's @entity332 , @entity335 's @entity334 , @entity336 's @entity334 , and @entity338 's @entity337
and yet , for some reason in @entity10 , these parties are generally not considered part of @entity5 's legacy
in the @entity10 , we have been taught to fear @entity5 for so long that we have forgotten those parts of his philosophy that have become integral to our own lives -- from free education to the right to bear arms
in fact , the era in modern @entity10 history that was most " marxist " was the 1950s , when union membership was high , personal wealth spread more equitably , and the gap between the rich and poor relatively slim
i came away from my @entity5 project believing that rather than demonizing @entity5 , it is better to understand him
if his name is used in political discourse , it should be done in the manner of other great thinkers : as a source of ideas
whether or not we agree with him , there are lessons to be learned from @entity5
to believe otherwise is to ignore a man and a period of history that are crucial to understanding our own
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity374 .
