-- @entity2 's chief executive admitted he was " embarrassed " by the delay in the opening trade of @entity6 's initial public offering and revealed that the exchange was in talks with regulators over potentially millions of dollars of customer claims
@entity11 said on sunday that the 20 - minute delay in trading of @entity6 's $ 16bn offering on friday had been caused by a millisecond systems blip due to the largest ipo auction " in the history of mankind "
the exchange has found itself in the spotlight after @entity6 failed to deliver a first - day " pop " to investors , instead almost falling below its issuing price of $ 38
the shares , having risen briefly , quickly fell away to close the day with a gain of just 0.6 per cent , at $ 38.23
as a result of the trading delay , @entity2 was left with a position in @entity6 shares that it had to liquidate , according to its own rules , generating $ 10m for the group
it plans to use that money to resolve disputes related to 30m shares that may have been the subject of improper trades , and has requested approval from the @entity38 to do so , said mr @entity11
the @entity38 said on friday it would " review " the incident
the glitch , coming just weeks after @entity41 was forced to withdraw its ipo after technical problems , highlighted the fragile nature of modern equity markets , in which exchanges must handle many thousands of messages a second transmitted by high - frequency traders
mr @entity11 defended @entity2 's performance , citing its role in @entity6 's trading over the whole of the session , which saw more than 580m shares change hands , the largest ever number for an ipo
" these problems are real and we have to improve from the performance we had on friday , " mr @entity11 said
" we stand humbly embarrassed by that
but the rest of the day ... the system performed well
" @entity2 has now laid out the details of the glitch
in spite of testing 1bn in trading volumes under 100 scenarios , the exchange was caught by surprise when cancellations of trades kept interrupting the computer system 's attempt to complete the auction and produce an initial price for @entity6 's opening
@entity2 says it designed its " ipo cross " , the process of calculating the opening price , in such a way that would allow continuous trading through an auction at the behest of its customers and has used the system in previous ipos
but in processing the huge volume of @entity6 trades , it added two milliseconds to the time it took to produce an opening price
in that extra two milliseconds , orders to cancel the trades kept interrupting the auction process , or as mr @entity11 put it , " fitting in between the raindrops "
mr @entity11 said : " on a real time basis with the pressure of the world upon us ... we intercepted this cross in a loop
" he said there was no discussion at any point of cancelling the ipo
@entity6 and @entity108 declined to comment on @entity2 's description of the events of the day
as a result of the glitch the exchange decided to print the opening trade manually but was then forced to delay the process of confirming individual trades
the mechanism has now been altered to prevent continuous quoting during @entity107 auctions , mr @entity11 said
" we had a poor design for the @entity6 opening cross ipo
we recognise the design has relative merit for investors where we give them maximum optionality , but it did n't ' work in this scenario
" @entity2 has identified trading orders for some 30m shares that came in between 11.11am and 11.30am , when trading actually began
it estimates that 50 per cent of those may have been orders not executed at the ipo price , as traders may have expected them to be
but it is still investigating to determine how many grievances are legitimate
mr @entity11 said @entity2 was " working very hard with customers to make sure about the accommodations we give to respective customers "
@entity140 , executive vice-president at @entity2 , said there were no other " systematic " technical problems
@entity2 's board of directors had been informed over the weekend of friday 's events , mr @entity11 said
when asked if he thought his job was safe , he said : " i certainly hope so
i obviously serve at the pleasure of the board
" the exchange group had pushed hard to win the @entity107 from its rival @entity149 , as it seeks supremacy in listings for internet companies that make up one of the few vibrant sectors of the new issue market
mr @entity11 responded directly to arguments that @entity2 's delay played a role in @entity6 's stock failing to " pop "
some market participants have said the delayed confirmations caused confusion and prevented some buyers stepping in to the market to support @entity6 's stock price
" you want to look at whether your position is moving up or down
without that , there was a lot of pressure to liquidate , " said one trader at a market - making firm
however , mr @entity11 said that the record did not support that theory , noting that after the delayed trades were made live at 1.50pm , traders did not buy at the $ 42.05 level that was the initial print
" that would lead a reasonable person to conclude [ the opening cross print delay ] did n't have any impact on the stock price , " he said
