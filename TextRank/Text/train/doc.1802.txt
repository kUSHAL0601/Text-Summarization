-- just as there are many choices of drivers , putters , balls , and other equipment , there are just as many choices of golf instructors
the process of how you choose your golf instructor is as unique as your finger prints
however , just like there are certain things you want to know before choosing your doctor , there are certain items you should inquire of your instructor
compatibility - it is your responsibility to insure that there is a fit between you and your instructor on all levels , personality type , mutual goals , similar outlooks on the game , and your instructor 's ability to relate to your individual needs
before throwing a dart in the phone book under " golf instruction " , research the professionals in your area
one way is to ask friends and playing partners for referrals of good instructors in your area
ask them about pricing , reputation , location , and their improvement under the instructor 's tutelage
if you get along with your playing partners and the instructor does too , odds are you have found a fit
then , call the instructor and ask if they have time to talk to you about your game and improvement goals
a good instructor will be happy to talk to you about your game , and get to know you as an individual , prior to helping you with your golf game
accreditation and @entity69 - does your golf instructor have the education and experience to take your game to any level you desire ? many individuals claim to be golf instructors
many of these individuals are self - proclaimed " experts , " or had enough money to take a one to two week course on how to teach golf and make more money
in seeking a golf professional to help you with your game , insure that the individual has an active accreditation with the @entity85 or @entity86 , or , has demonstrated an inarguable ability to help players of many levels improve through many years of practice
other associations claim they produce golf instructors
however , these organizations have one focus , to make money , not to produce solid golf instructors
inquire of your instructor their accreditation , as well as their education both on and off the golf course
check with the @entity86 or @entity85 websites to confirm your potential golf instructor 's accreditation with that organization , and , how much experience the instructor possesses
inquire of the instructor 's philosophy and past success stories
if needed , ask for references of students from all skill levels that you can contact
video - video swing analysis has become a staple for all golf instruction
it is no longer an option
if you are paying for instruction that does not include video review of your game , you should reconsider why you are paying for golf instruction
video , when used correctly , is a third pair of eyes ( you and your instructor are first and second )
this is similar to a doctor using an x-ray or @entity133 , to diagnosis a health issue
your golf instructor should be using video in the same manner
@entity127 should confirm the diagnosis to you , not the instructor
a good golf instructor has the ability to see the flaw first , and use his or her knowledge of that flaw to diagnose a cure or drill for you to practice to realize improvement
if your golf instructor is relying solely on video to tell what is happening in your swing , you will eventually lose trust in the instructor 's ability to help you
you would second guess a doctor 's ability to help you if he or she did not use their ability first and confirm their thoughts with tests
then why would you rely on an instructor who is not " practicing " golf instruction in the same manner ? follow - up communication - your golf instructor should have a program available for you to utilize to ask questions , give feedback , receive follow - up instructions , schedule lessons , or make other inquiries after your lesson
some instructors offer their phone numbers after hours
others utilize the internet for follow - up and communication purposes
regardless of what form of communication is available to you after the lesson , your instructor should be available , at no extra charge , within a reasonable amount of time , to answer your questions and take interest in your concerns .
