@entity0 -- former @entity3 and cia director @entity4 will lead an outside investigation of the @entity3 's " policies , practices and actions " before the november massacre at @entity10 , the bureau announced tuesday
@entity4 , a former federal judge , conducted a previous review of the @entity3 following the exposure of double agent @entity13 in 2001
he has been asked to look into " whether there are improvements to our current practices or other authorities that could make us all safer in the future , " current fbi director @entity14 said in a statement tuesday
" we must be sure that the systems we have in place give investigators the tools they need to carry out their responsibilities , " @entity14 said
" at the same time , we must ensure constitutional protections and the confidence of the @entity31 public we serve
" the @entity3 has said that maj. @entity32 , the @entity33 psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens at the @entity37 post , came to its attention as part of an unrelated terrorism probe in december 2008
agents found @entity32 and the subject of that investigation -- identified as a radical cleric from @entity46 who had once preached at a @entity48 mosque @entity32 attended -- had been in communication , but their exchanges " raised no red flags " that would have turned agents ' scrutiny on @entity32 , senior investigative officials said in november
@entity4 , 85 , led the @entity3 from 1978 until 1987 , when then - president @entity54 named him @entity56 director
@entity4 took over the spy agency in the aftermath of the @entity59 and led it until 1991
the @entity3 already has conducted a preliminary review of the @entity10 matter
meanwhile , the @entity62 is conducting its own investigation into whether any signs that could have warned of the rampage were missed
@entity4 's investigation will be coordinated with the @entity62 to avoid interference with the @entity33 - led inquiry , and he " will have complete access and whatever resources necessary to complete the task , " @entity14 said .
