-- in 1937 , @entity1 launched the career of an up - and - coming starlet with a photo spread that , overnight , made " @entity5 " a household name
she became an a-list celebrity , top fashion houses sent jewels and dresses , and she was briefly engaged to one of radio 's biggest stars
there was just one minor catch : @entity5 was n't human , she was a mannequin -- a plaster , dead - eyed dummy
pretty , in a vacant kind of way , but a dummy
her creator , @entity23 , was a @entity25 shopkeeper 's son with dreams of a grand life in the big city
he achieved it through his uncanny skill at one of the @entity33 's quirkier national crazes -- soap sculpting
buoyed by the fame he earned as a soap sculptor , @entity23 moved to @entity37 in 1932 , where he went into fashion and retail and pioneered the design of mannequins that combined style with realism
@entity5 was his star , accompanying him to nightclubs and social events
not bad for a blonde who could n't speak a word , smile or even blink
