@entity0 -- tens of thousands of hurried passengers trying to check in at some of the busiest @entity6 airports could soon find themselves in the fast lane
the @entity8 and the @entity9 are expanding their expedited screening initiative known as @entity11 to 28 additional airports this year , it was announced wednesday
seven airports across the country have already started the procedures , which allow travelers a faster screening process if they volunteer information about themselves prior to flying
in making the announcement at a news conference at @entity23 , @entity8 officials said @entity11 will enable @entity9 to focus its efforts on passengers the agency knows less about in a more risk - based approach to screening
if the @entity9 determines a passenger is eligible for expedited screening , " information will be embedded in the barcode of the passenger 's boarding pass , " according to the department
passengers who qualify may only rarely have to remove their shoes , jackets and belts , and extract laptops or liquids from bags
" good , thoughtful , sensible security by its very nature facilitates lawful travel and legitimate commerce , " said @entity8 secretary @entity43
" the expansion of @entity11 to the nation 's busiest airports will increase our security capabilities and expedite the screening process for travelers we consider our trusted partners
" the " trusted traveler " program wo n't guarantee expedited security screening , officials say
participants will still be subject to random and unpredictable security measures
@entity11 will be implemented at the busiest @entity6 airports throughout the year including , @entity63 / @entity0 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity75 - @entity74 , @entity77 @entity76 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 @entity23 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity90 - @entity89 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93
the @entity9 says it will continue expanding to additional airlines and airports beyond those already announced
officials say more than 336,000 passengers have already been screened through @entity11 lanes affiliated with @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , and with @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity104 and @entity105
@entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 will begin operations later this year
" @entity11 moves us closer to our goal of delivering the most effective and efficient screening by recognizing that most passengers do not pose a threat to security , " said @entity9 administrator @entity113 in a written statement
" we are pleased to expand this important effort , in collaboration with our airline and airport partners , as we move away from a one - size - fits - all approach to a more intelligence - driven , risk - based transportation security system
