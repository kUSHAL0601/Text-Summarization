@entity0 , @entity1 -- the trial of an @entity1 journalist charged with throwing his shoes at @entity11 president @entity10 has been postponed , @entity1 's @entity3 and one of the journalist 's lawyers said tuesday
@entity13 protesters support @entity14 , the @entity1 journalist held for throwing his shoes at president @entity10
@entity16 was due to go on trial wednesday , but the @entity18 postponed it pending an appeal filed by his lawyers with the @entity22 , a spokesman for the @entity24 , @entity25 , said
@entity26 , who leads @entity16 's 25 - member legal team , confirmed the postponement
@entity16 threw both of his shoes at @entity10 two weeks ago during a news conference with @entity1 prime minister @entity31 in @entity0
neither shoe hit the president , and others in the room quickly knocked @entity16 to the ground before security officials arrested him
many @entity1 hail @entity16 , who faces a prison term if convicted , as a hero
more than 1,000 lawyers have volunteered to defend him , @entity26 said
the lawyers ' appeal asked the @entity22 to change @entity16 's case from assaulting @entity10 to insulting him
if @entity16 is convicted of the former , he faces a maximum of 15 years in prison , @entity26 said
the lawyers are trying to persuade the appeals court that @entity16 did not want to harm @entity10 by throwing the shoes , but simply wanted to insult him
by tradition , throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the @entity54 world
@entity55 said he met with his client several days ago but was having difficulty meeting with him again
he did not give the reason he was not allowed to see @entity16 but said many lawyers have trouble meeting with detainees in @entity1 or @entity11 custody
it will take at least two weeks for the court to set a new date for @entity16 's trial , legal expert @entity63 said
@entity2 's @entity68 contributed to this report .
