americans are told we need to have a national conversation in which we talk about race
and yet , when we have horrific crimes with white victims where the alleged perpetrators are african - american or @entity9 , we 're told that we ca n't talk about race
this is n't true when the roles are reversed
if the victims are african - american or @entity9 , and the alleged perpetrator is white , we talk about race until our throats go dry
confused ? join the club
if @entity0 do n't understand it , how are we to explain any of this to the grieving family of @entity20 , a 22 - year - old college baseball player from @entity21 , @entity22 , who was recently gunned down while jogging in a neighborhood a world away -- @entity25 , @entity26 ? according to police , the evidence suggests that the shooting was not premeditated and random
it could have been part of a gang initiation , according to a theory floated by the father of a boy who the three teenagers allegedly tried to recruit
but here 's the headline : prosecutors say that the killing was not about race , despite the fact that one alleged assailant left a long cyber trail on social media where he talked about hating " woods " ( derogatory slang for white people ) and glorified guns and violence
" at this point , the evidence does not support the theory that @entity20 was targeted based upon his race or nationality , " said district attorney @entity50
@entity56 : when racial clich√©s drive murder stories as ghoulish as it sounds , it may be that the three teenagers responsible for the shooting -- 15 - year - old @entity63 and 16 - year - old @entity64 , who have been charged with first - degree murder , and 17 - year - old @entity66 , who has been charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder for driving the car -- were simply bored and decided to kill someone
unfortunately for @entity20 , who was visiting his girlfriend and her family , he was that someone
this could have been the media 's narrative of the @entity26 slaying , just another senseless act by messed - up teenagers who were raised on video games and think life resets when you press a button or drop in another quarter
that is , except for two things : the victim and the alleged perpetrators are of different races
( @entity20 is white , and @entity63 and @entity64 -- the alleged shooters -- are @entity91
@entity66 , the alleged accomplice , is white
) and , as @entity0 , we are still living through the aftershocks of the not guilty verdict in the trial of @entity96 for shooting and killing @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99
some @entity0 are still smarting over the fact that the @entity96 verdict , and the shooting itself , were spun by grievance merchants and other social activists to be all about race
now they want to know why there is n't a similar response over the killing in @entity26
in both cases , the central question is the same : was the deceased targeted because of his race ? in both cases , we still do n't know the answer
meanwhile , where is president @entity119 's awkward statement that , if he had a friend from @entity22 , he might look like @entity121 ? @entity122 : negligent parents , lawbreaking kids some will say that the reason there has been no outcry from the activists is because authorities in @entity26 insist that this case is n't about race
so what ? the authorities in @entity99 also told us that what happened there was n't about race
a lot of good that did
some of the same folks who discounted the official explanation back then want us to accept it now
it does n't work that way
i think it 's time for that national conversation
there 's nothing wrong with talking about race
especially at a time in @entity0 history when the concept is so complicated and confusing
the nation 's 52 million latinos are n't a race , but many of them -- especially in the @entity154 -- are experiencing something that looks and smells a lot like racism
@entity119 is half - black and half - white , and yet he 's referred to as the first black president not the 44th white one
@entity96 , who is half - @entity159 and half - white , appears to have lived his life as a @entity161 until he shot an unarmed @entity91 - @entity91 teenager and the media decided it was necessary to label him a " white @entity161
" and , in an increasingly multicultural @entity0 , the census form looks like a relic from a simpler time where most @entity0 fit neatly into racial categories
what is the media supposed to do about all this ? there 's a debate over when to mention race and when to leave it out
the longstanding rule in journalism is that we should n't mention the race of someone accused of committing a crime unless it is relevant to the story
that rule seems half - baked
why would n't a suspect 's race be " relevant " -- especially when that suspect is still at large and the police need the public 's help in locating him ? it 's a human characteristic
would we leave out of a story any mention of one 's gender or age , so we 're not accused of sexism or ageism ? self - censorship is n't the answer
when a horrendous crime like this happens , we need more information not less
besides , once we sanitize the news , or manipulate it to serve an agenda , it 's no longer news
think of it as nanny journalism
too many people in my profession have strayed from the mission of reporting what happened -- or in my field of opinion writing , telling you what we think about what happened -- to massaging what happened in order to advance some greater societal good
and when journalists -- either on our own , or at the direction of the people we work for -- impersonate social workers , we ask for trouble
we also surrender our credibility
and once that 's gone , why should anyone listen to anything we say ever again ?
