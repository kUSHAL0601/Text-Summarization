-- upon being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004 , @entity4 co-founder @entity3 put off surgery for nine months against the advice of his doctors while he tried to treat the disease with a special macrobiotic diet -- a decision he later regretted , his biographer said
when asked why he did n't have the surgery right away , @entity3 said , " i did n't want my body to be opened , " according to an interview with the biographer , @entity14 , that aired sunday on @entity17 ' " @entity16
" by the time @entity3 was finally operated on , the cancer had spread to the surrounding tissue , @entity14 said
but his mortality also motivated @entity3 , who died october 5 , to create some of @entity4 's boldest products in his final years , @entity14 told @entity17 's @entity23
" he talked a lot to me about what happened when he got sick and how it focused him , " said @entity14 , in a transcript of the show provided by @entity17
" he said he no longer wanted to go out , no longer wanted to travel the world
he would focus on the products
he knew the couple of things he wanted to do , which was the @entity33 and then the @entity34
he had a few other visions
i think he would 've loved to have conquered television
" @entity14 's book , " @entity3 , " goes on sale monday
in the " @entity16 " interview , @entity14 described @entity3 as a driven , eccentric and sometimes cruel man who grew more reflective and fatalistic in his later years
" i saw my life as an arc and that it would end , and compared to that nothing mattered , " @entity3 told him in one recorded interview
" you 're born alone , you 're going to die alone
and does anything else really matter ? i mean , what is it exactly is it that you have to lose , @entity3 ? you know ? there 's nothing
" adopted as a baby , @entity3 recalled as a child once confronting his parents in tears about why his real parents had rejected him
his parents sat him down and said , " no , you do n't understand
we specifically picked you out
" " he said , ' from then on , i realized that i was not -- just abandoned
i was special , ' " @entity14 said
" and i think that 's the key to understanding @entity3
" always something of a rebel , @entity3 often thought the usual rules did n't apply to him , @entity14 said
he went through a period as a young man where he did n't bathe regularly -- his managers at @entity67 made him work the night shift because his co-workers complained about his body odor -- and drove a @entity71 with no license plate because he did n't want people tracking him
@entity3 also was a @entity74 and a spiritual person whose religious beliefs were altered by his cancer diagnosis , @entity14 said
" i remember sitting in his backyard in his garden one day and he started talking about @entity80
he said , ' sometimes i believe in @entity80 , sometimes i do n't
i think it 's 50 - 50 maybe
" but ever since i 've had cancer , i 've been thinking about it more
and i find myself believing a bit more
i kind of -- maybe it 's ' cause i want to believe in an afterlife
that when you die , it does n't just all disappear
the wisdom you 've accumulated
' " @entity14 's book is based on more than 40 interviews with @entity3 conducted over two years , as well as interviews with more than 100 family members , friends , adversaries , competitors and colleagues
@entity102 says that although @entity3 cooperated with the book , he asked for no control over what was written nor the right to read it before it was published
@entity14 , a former chairman of @entity0 and the former managing editor of @entity109 , which shares a parent company with @entity0 , has written biographies of @entity112 and @entity113
the 656 - page @entity3 book retails for $ 35 .
