" pray for me and my kids now ! they just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room , " the first tweet , posted at 6:15 p.m. , read
" she 's going to jail n i 'm pressing charges ! " two minutes later , @entity2 tweeted again
" i 'm sad my boys witnessed this mess but i warned the police department here that she was gone try n harm me and my boys
this is on my mama ! " it said

" they just saw two women jump their dad in his own house , in his room , in my room
