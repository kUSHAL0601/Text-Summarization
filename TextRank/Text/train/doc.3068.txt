-- @entity1 on wednesday said it will build 4,600 electric vehicle charging stations in nine regions of the @entity4 , funded by $ 37 million in grants
more than half of the charging stations in the program called @entity9 will go in public locations , such as overnight parking spaces , offices , or retail locations
about 2,000 going into people 's homes as part of the purchase of an electric vehicle
the goal of the charging network and others like it is to make electric vehicles more accessible to consumers , as these cars come to market in the coming months , said @entity26 , the ceo of @entity27 , @entity29 - based @entity1 during a press conference
the program differs from other electric vehicle charging networks in that @entity32 is working with @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 on the roll out , @entity26 said
@entity33 will release an electric @entity38 utility van and electric @entity40 sedan in 2011 , @entity34 plans to release the volt by november , and the electric @entity42 will begin pilot testing in the @entity4 by 2011
the stations themselves will be equipped with 220 - volt service at either 16 or 30 amps , which enables faster charging than regular home electrical service
@entity26 said that an electric car with a large battery could charge from empty in under four hours
drivers will be able to find available charging stations using either an @entity54 or @entity56 application , which can also send alerts if a car battery is running low or if a connected car is unplugged
the system includes software for station owners to set billing rates
regions are considering cheaper off - peak rates to encourage drivers to charge overnight
utilities can see available energy electric vehicles or run demand - response programs to slow charging rates during peak times if needed
" our stations are unique in that they are all networked
that allows them to support a bunch of software applications which are important to different constituents , " @entity73 said , adding that installation will begin immediately and continue for 18 months
the nine regions are : the @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity83 area ; @entity84 , @entity29 ; the @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity29
region ; @entity88 ; @entity89 , @entity90 ; @entity83 ; @entity91 ; @entity92 , @entity93 ; and @entity94 , @entity95
of the total in grants , $ 15 million will come from the @entity98 as part of the stimulus act and another $ 22 million will come from other sources , @entity26 said
as part of project , @entity32 will gather data on driver usage patterns and report it to the @entity98 until october 2013
