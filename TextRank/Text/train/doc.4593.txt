-- memo to all of the @entity3 apologists : stifle
this talented yet insufferable defensive back for the @entity5 is n't the 21st - century version of @entity7 , @entity8 or @entity9
so you should quit your hand - wringing , and between now and the @entity12 in a couple of weeks , you should remember that @entity3 put himself into this position of getting blasted in so many ways
mostly , when it comes to either screaming or whispering racism these days , you should find a more worthy cause
you should turn your attention to @entity24 , @entity25 , where authorities are claiming up is down , water is n't wet and a 17 - year - old black athlete suffocated to death after he " accidentally " rolled himself up in a wrestling mat at his high school
how about those ugly numbers involved with income inequality ? that affects people of color more than anybody
according to a study released this week from @entity41 humanitarian group @entity40 , the world 's richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 3 billion
and , goodness knows , most stop - and - frisk victims are darker than @entity45
as for this @entity3 thing , puhleeze
i mean , if you decide to look and sound like a crazy person on national television , you likely will receive a bunch of responses from yahoos that wo n't be kind
@entity3 : rant was ' immature , ' reaction ' mind - boggling ' those yahoos will view you as the yahoo
that 's not to excuse the use of racial epithets against @entity3
and to his credit , he apologized ( with a mighty push from @entity5 coach @entity64 ) for his rant on sunday after his @entity5 reached the @entity12 in the final seconds when he tipped away a potential game - winning pass to his arch - nemesis , @entity69 , a star wide receiver for the @entity70
@entity3 celebrated the moment by getting in a verbal spat with @entity69 , delivering the choke sign toward the 49ers bench and telling a @entity77 reporter on live television ... well , it was n't good
so here 's the bottom line surrounding all things @entity3 : nobody with a clue needs to watch his apologists flash frowns of concern before saying why they believe he is misunderstood
they say he really is an intelligent guy working on his masters at his undergraduate school of @entity91
they say he is doing much of his trash talking before the nearest camera , microphone or reporter 's notepad only for show
they say this is another example of why the rest of us just need to loosen up , because despite the way it appears ( you know , that @entity3 is absolutely out of control and needs a good spanking ) , he is being persecuted as a 25 - year - old black male with dreadlocks trying to keep it real
@entity3 's persona is dangerous , along with the shallow - thinking folks who support him and his ever - flapping tongue
here we are , 21 years after one of the most unfortunate commercials of all times , and many folks still have n't learned that @entity119 blew it
back then , when he was a player for the @entity121 instead of the analyst that he has become for @entity125 telecasts and other entities , @entity119 looked into a camera for @entity128 to deliver six infamous words : " i am not a role model
" well , there were lot of things wrong with that
for one , we all are role models -- regardless of intellect , occupation , age , creed , color , education , gender and social or economic status
whether we like it or not , somebody always is studying us
and the more visibility we have in life , especially when it comes to the fields of athletics and entertainment , the more responsibility we have to present ourselves in a way that will influence others for the positive
i know what @entity119 said he was trying to say
he said he was trying to say youth in general and black youth in particular should n't look at athletes as their role models
he was trying to say they should try to emulate their parents
sounds good , except as a person who has dealt up close and personal with black youngsters for decades around @entity164 -- ranging from speaking in elementary , junior high , high schools and colleges to teaching teenagers in @entity169 and leading youth groups -- many of them do n't have two parents
plus , according to statistics released by the @entity177 census in may , 68 % of black women who gave birth in the previous year were unmarried
not a lot of role modeling going on there
consider , too , that a large percentage of black youngsters raised by single women are latchkey kids , which means they come home to an empty dwelling to fend for themselves over long stretches of time
so many of those youngsters get their idea of how to survive and prosper from older folks in the neighborhood
either that , or they look toward the most visible people they see on television
actors , rappers , athletes
which is why @entity119 was a role model back then to millions , and which is why he remains one today -- whether he likes it or not
the same is true of @entity3
and on that score , he was a loser on sunday
so @entity3 deserved what he got in the aftermath
the youth watching it all deserved better , period
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .
