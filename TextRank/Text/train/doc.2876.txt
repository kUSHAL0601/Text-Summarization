-- the liberation of @entity2 begins now
@entity3 is leaving the city and you are free , dear people , to speak the truth
no longer do you have to cower
no longer do you have to worry about stern looks and furious retorts
no longer do you have to tiptoe around the mighty slugger and his ruthian numbers , fearful that he might say to hell with riverboat casinos and go elsewhere , someplace warmer
no longer do you have to mindlessly utter the @entity14 company lines about all of @entity3 ' charity work and family life and what a wonderful person he is
with thursday 's news that @entity3 has agreed to a 10 - year , $ 254 million contract with the @entity25 , @entity20 officials , players and fans are finally permitted say what has gone unsaid far too long -- that @entity3 is a pain in the rear
he is a devout @entity35 who has written , " my life 's goal is to bring glory to @entity40
" his foundation raises large bundles of money to help kids with @entity44 ( and if you do n't believe this , ask anyone associated with @entity3
he has never , apparently , drowned a dog or shot himself in the leg
over the past 11 years , @entity2 ' slugging infielder could do no wrong
and yes , it helped that he averaged 42 homers and 126 rbis while leading the club to two @entity58 titles
and yet ... for the hundreds of people who work for the @entity20 , and for the majority of the thousands upon thousands of fans who have asked @entity3 for an autograph or a handshake or the smallest of words , the three - time @entity59 is , well , terrible
having now covered sports for 17 years , i 've witnessed few professional athletes who show greater disrespect and outright disdain for loyalists than @entity3
he is a man who , during spring training , walks from station to station with his head down ; who responds to " @entity3 , we love you ! " not with a smile or a nod , but with cold nothingness
when people call his name , he almost never gazes up
when people ask for an autograph , he does n't even bother with a " not now " or " try me later
" instead , he turns to devices that men such as @entity88 and @entity89 perfected in the recent decades -- the steel - faced , how - dare - you - even - talk - to - me , ignore - the - world two - step
it 's not a problem that @entity3 does n't say much -- neither does @entity97
it 's not that @entity3 is intense -- @entity99 is certainly right there with him
no , what rubs so many people wrongly is his frostiness
or , as one longtime @entity20 usher told me last march , " how about looking up at people when they talk to you ? how about acknowledging that they exist ? " during the waning days of last spring training , i stood alongside @entity3 ' table during the annual @entity112 at @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115
admittedly , the event is one that no player enjoys ; a contrived , goofy , strictly - for - the - benefit - of - the - fans labor of torturous obligation
here is a direct , play - by - play transcript from the opening minutes : fan : " @entity3 , great to meet you ! you 're my favorite player in the world ! " @entity3 ( not looking up ) : " thanks
" @entity129 : " @entity3 , do you sign jerseys ? " @entity3 : ( not looking up ) : " no. " fan 2 : " @entity131 ? " @entity3 ( not looking up ) : " no. " @entity132 : " good luck this year , @entity3
you deserve everything you get
" @entity3 ( not looking up ) : " uh-huh
" @entity136 : " @entity3 , my daughter loves you
" @entity3 ( not looking up ) : because of his endorsement deal with @entity139 , @entity3 signed only pictures and baseballs ( every other player signed whatever was presented to him )
to call him rude would be to personify an utter lack of emotion
pujols was n't rude -- he was absent
and yet , because baseball lathers itself in mythology , and because @entity3 was @entity2 ' @entity153 , and because @entity2 clutches onto its ballplayers the way a 5 - year - old clutches her @entity149 doll , nothing negative could ever be said
truth be told , inside the @entity20 ' clubhouse @entity3 was , on his best days , pleasantly present
when asked , younger players would praise his leadership skills because , frankly , that 's what young players do
yet with last season 's arrival of the affable , open , intelligent @entity167 , members of the team were able to witness what genuine leadership looks like
now , @entity3 -- perhaps the most revered cardinal since @entity171 -- has pulled a @entity173 @entity172 , abandoning his adopted hometown when bigger bucks and a sniff of @entity177 came calling
whereas once he had a chance to stand alongside @entity179 and @entity180 and @entity181 and @entity182 as legends who spent their entire careers with one franchise , now he is but a nomad -- richer , without question , but shockingly smaller in stature
though the idea of @entity3 in an @entity25 uniform seems strange at this moment , our eyes will inevitably adjust
and in @entity2 , i believe , so will opinions
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .
