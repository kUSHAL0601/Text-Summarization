-- in the year since @entity3 ' death , @entity1 has undergone a gradual and subtle brand makeover , shaking off some of the more unpleasant characteristics associated with @entity3 and taking on bits of the personality of its new leader , @entity8
for all his brilliance at product design , @entity3 showed little interest in glad - handing with @entity1 partners or investors
by contrast , @entity1 from the outside has appeared more open under @entity8 , thanks to a number of orchestrated meetings and trips meant to appeal to the various factions -- consumers , investors and politicians -- interested in the world 's leading tech company
in may , @entity8 went to @entity26 to meet with congressional leaders to open lines of communication that were mostly blocked in previous years
@entity1 was no stranger to lobbying ( although it spends far less than some other @entity32 companies , like @entity33 ) , but sending @entity8 was a way of letting politicians know @entity1 was ready to grow its relationship with @entity37 and that the company might take a stronger interest in policy issues in the future
@entity1 also has worked harder to woo @entity42
there was a bus tour of investors that stopped at @entity1 headquarters in @entity47 , @entity48 , where they were treated to cookies and a presentation by @entity1 's chief financial officer
a more sizable act of goodwill was the cash dividend @entity1 paid out to investors -- the first in 17 years
on a call with investors in february , @entity8 answered questions , cracked jokes and was generally open and friendly
did @entity1 's fanboy fever peak with @entity3 ? after an outcry over working conditions at the factories of @entity1 's manufacturing partners , most notably @entity66 , @entity8 took swift action
he took a trip to @entity69 and toured a @entity66 plant in person
@entity1 also allowed the @entity72 to do a thorough audit of conditions at the @entity69 factories , and @entity1 vowed to improve pay and hours
the most recent display of the company 's shift in tone was its reaction to the bungled @entity82 app. the new @entity84 app crafted in - house by @entity1 to replace @entity86 on iphones and @entity88 was riddled with flaws , from missing features to misplaced businesses , landmarks and even towns
a week after the phone hit stores , @entity8 apologized for the map publicly and , with surprising humility , even pointed customers to competing products
some pundits compared his swift and contrite reaction to a terse and rare public apology from @entity3 more than a month after complaints over the @entity105 's antenna erupted in 2010
who is the next @entity3 ( and is there one ) ? @entity8 's mea culpa is just the latest demonstration of how he , and by extension @entity1 , is different from @entity3 and the @entity112 era at the company
@entity8 comes off as having a far more relaxed and approachable personality , and he is less inclined to be the center of attention
his product announcements are not one - man shows , but presentations shared with other @entity1 executives
he is still discovering his own style -- a tricky undertaking given the abnormal amounts of scrutiny that follow @entity1 's every move
a recent article by @entity127 , citing interviews with current and former @entity1 executives , employees and partners , states " the company is happier and even somewhat more transparent than it was during @entity3 ' tenure ... there are fewer frantic calls at midnight , and there 's less implicit pressure on engineers to cut short or cancel vacations in the heat of product development cycles
" @entity8 recently announced that most @entity1 employees at company headquarters will get the week of @entity144 off with pay , according to reports
unfortunately for @entity1 's soft - spoken chief executive , he has been incessantly compared to his predecessor after every presentation , successes and failures
" to simply put @entity3 on some sort of pedestal and say @entity1 could do no wrong under @entity3 's leadership is wrong , " said @entity153 analyst @entity152
remember @entity157 , @entity1 's failed attempt at a social network centered around music ? @entity8 has not launched any bold new products in the past 12 months
so far , the company has only released minor updates of popular products , like speedier laptops , the new @entity167 operating system , the refreshed @entity169 line and the new , taller @entity170
they 've all been met with solid reviews ( @entity84 app aside ) and sold well
@entity1 has gone on to become the most valuable company in history
a year ago on october 4 , @entity1 stock closed at $ 381.80 a share
on wednesday , it closed at $ 671.45
but by staying the course , @entity8 has raised some concerns that he may lack the imagination and the bold ability to conjure up mind - blowing new products , which was @entity3 ' hallmark
@entity8 's last major responsibility was decidedly left - brained : streamlining @entity1 's supply chain
some question how much credit for @entity1 's recent financial success should go @entity8 and how much is residual carryover from @entity3 ' regime
he prepared the company and its executives to carry on his vision and spent years grooming staff and setting up @entity1 to continue on seamlessly without him
is it any surprise that it 's continued to do so well ? your thoughts on the next @entity3 @entity152 says that while @entity3 gave the appearance of being entirely in control , he did not in fact design each new device single - handedly
@entity1 has about 12,000 employees in the @entity205 , not counting retail and support staff
it is a large , well - oiled machine that knows how to design and sell beautiful products that consumers want
" the company is on cruise control , " said @entity211 , an analyst at @entity212
@entity211 thinks the recent @entity84 kerfuffle could have a material impact on @entity1 and @entity105 sales down the line , but we wo n't know until 2013
early stats -- like moving 5 million iphones 5s in the first weekend of sales -- ca n't foretell what 's going to happen at the end of a model 's life cycle
" @entity1 has a huge amount of good will among consumers
they 've started eating away at that , " said @entity211 , referring to the @entity84 app problems
@entity211 believes the big decisions that will define @entity8 are still yet to come
some are decisions @entity3 never made , such as whether to drop the price of the @entity105 to be competitive in emerging markets
@entity8 has already proven that he is aggressive about international sales
the @entity170 will be in 100 countries at the end of this year -- a far speedier and more expansive roll out than previous @entity1 devices
it 's still too early for anyone to predict @entity8 's long - term success or failure , observers say
and the true impact of @entity3 ' absence wo n't be known for two years or more
" the biggest challenge @entity1 has is not product , " @entity152 said
" they are going to have to manage this legend of @entity3
