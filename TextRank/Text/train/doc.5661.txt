aboard a @entity0 -- defense secretary @entity2 stepped out of a helicopter at @entity4 in @entity5
he smiled at his staff and the cameras , raised his hands and said , " @entity9
" moments later , the " @entity12 , " his link to the @entity14 and the @entity15 from wherever he is in the world , rolled down the tarmac and climbed into a sunny sky
the 67 - year - old secretary is on his way out of government after serving eight presidents , but he has n't announced a departure date yet other than saying it will be this year
and these regular trips are intensive , long days for the former career intelligence professional -- walking the beat , embracing allies , bolstering morale and getting his own fix on the troubles of the day
gates ended his latest overseas jaunt -- a six - day trip to @entity33 and the @entity34 -- by traveling by helicopter from @entity4 to @entity5 's @entity36 for a private , no - cameras - allowed meeting with @entity39
he said privately , according to aides , what he had been saying publicly on the trip -- that the upheaval across the @entity34 was serving up challenges and opportunities , and the key was to sort them out
overshadowing his stops in @entity33 , @entity48 and @entity49 was the @entity50 and coalition military operation over @entity52
he delayed his planned departure on this trip for a day at the start of the air attacks
while in @entity33 , he found himself in the middle of a political dispute over the @entity52 mission
aides informed him when a @entity50 fighter jet and two aviators went down and were rescued near @entity63
he was briefed on every development as the @entity65 and @entity66 led the airstrikes
and while many on his plane dozed or ate their meatloaf and mashed potatoes on the flight back to @entity74 on friday , @entity2 was linked to the @entity15 and a @entity76 conference call for the latest deliberations on the military , diplomatic and political calculus of enforcing the @entity52 mission
@entity30 will make appearances on the sunday talk show circuit and visit @entity82 in the coming days to offer public and private explanations of how the @entity50 military performed
and perhaps he also will speak about his view of the future
but on the trip , in public statements , and in talking to traveling and local journalists , he was careful and diplomatic
he dispensed with each question about " the endgame " of the @entity52 missions by saying the goals are clear : creation and enforcement of the no - fly zone and protection of @entity52 civilians
about targeting @entity52 leader @entity99 , about working in concert with @entity52 rebels , about the risk of a military stalemate , @entity2 would n't bite , saying the future there is for the @entity52 themselves to decide
@entity2 told @entity50 's @entity34 allies that @entity74 stands by them
in @entity108 , he repeated his praise for the @entity48 military for keeping that country from going over the brink in the mass protests that toppled president @entity114 just last month
he arrived in @entity49 just after a bus stop bombing in @entity116 and continuing rocket attacks in the south
@entity2 repeated the standard line that the @entity50 commitment was unshakeable and used the code words for continued aid , saying that the @entity50 would ensure @entity49 's qualitative military edge
on his last day , he moved briskly from photo - op to meetings
the first stop was the old @entity128 town of @entity129 , a luxury hotel where guests gawked at the motorcade and the heavily armed , plain - clothes @entity49 agents standing watch
inside , @entity2 met with @entity49 prime minister @entity135 who promised that the recent terrorism would be answered with what he called " great force and great determination to put a stop to it
" and there was also mention of the elusive goal of a peace agreement , with @entity135 adding , " we seek to establish security for the establishment of peace
" @entity2 offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the terror attack and those enduring the rocket attacks in southern @entity49
next stop for @entity2 , after a wild convoy ride through @entity49 traffic , was the @entity158 , and a reminder of how many administrations have tried and failed to nudge the sides toward @entity34 peace
now in an armored suv , he crossed over to newly constructed @entity165 offices in @entity166
in the diplomatic game , where symbols can substitute for substance , @entity2 acknowledged that his presence alone made history
" i understand i 'm the first @entity50 secretary of defense to visit @entity166 , " @entity2 told the @entity165 prime minister @entity172
at the end of his remarks before the assembled media , before a 50 - minute closed - door meeting , @entity2 added that he looked forward to discussing the central -- but elusive -- element of @entity50 peace proposals for @entity49 and the @entity179 , a two - state solution
later , in @entity166 , crowds of people leaving a mosque at the end of friday prayers watched the @entity2 convoy glide past , as the secretary raced on to his next meeting and on to @entity74 .
