-- strontium sulfide , a material that can emit corrosive gases in moist air , was found at trace levels in testing of @entity10 - made drywall , the @entity2 @entity1 said
gas emitted from defective drywall corrodes copper wiring , turning it black , some @entity2 homeowners say
the drywall samples gave off a sulfurous odor when heated , and in at least one case , sulfide gases corroded copper coils in an air conditioner of a @entity2 home containing @entity10 drywall , said the department , which commissioned the study
but more testing is needed to determine whether strontium sulfide was causing the odor and contributing to the corrosion , the department said
and more tests are required to determine whether the drywall poses a threat to human health -- a process that probably will take at least several months , state toxicologist dr. @entity29 told reporters monday
" it 's very hard to predict when we 'll have the answers [ relating to possible health hazards ]
... we 're moving as quickly as possible , " @entity40 said
concerns about @entity10 - made drywall , which is suspected by some homeowners of ruining appliances and causing health problems , emerged in @entity2 last year but have transcended state lines , with class - action lawsuits alleging it has caused problems in at least three states : @entity2 , @entity51 and @entity52
the @entity2 @entity1 has received about 150 complaints , and the @entity54 says it is investigating the @entity2 allegations
homeowners ' lawsuits against certain manufacturers and suppliers contend the drywall has caused them to suffer health problems such as headaches and sore throats , and left them facing huge repair expenses
the drywall is alleged to emit sulfur - based gases that smell of rotten eggs and corrode piping and wiring , causing electronics and appliances to fail
the @entity2 @entity1 said complaints there generally involve homes built between 2004 and 2007 , around the time a building boom and post-hurricane reconstruction caused a @entity79 drywall shortage and spurred builders to use imports
the latest tests did not deal with air quality inside affected homes , and previous third - party testing has " not identified any concentrations of chemicals that are in the homes that are at a level ... that would pose a specific health risk , " @entity40 said
" that is n't saying we 've declared it safe , " @entity40 said
" we are continuing the evaluation and moving forward on a much more in - depth and broad scope of the investigation
" the latest testing , commissioned by the @entity2 @entity101 and conducted by private laboratory @entity102 of @entity104 , found that three samples of what the department believes is @entity10 - manufactured drywall had " several physical and chemical differences " from a fourth , @entity79 - manufactured drywall sample , @entity40 said
the samples suspected to be from @entity10 contained trace levels of strontium sulfide , and the @entity79 - made product did not , according to @entity102 's report
strontium sulfide can react in moist air to form hydrogen sulfide -- a gas that smells like rotten eggs , according to the web site of the @entity122
hydrogen sulfide is corrosive , according to a web page of the @entity124
exposure to low levels of the gas " may cause irritation to the eyes , nose or throat ... [ and ] may also cause difficulty breathing for some asthmatics , " according to the federal @entity134
two of the @entity10 samples were marked as having been made in @entity10 or by a @entity10 manufacturer
the other was unmarked , but the department believes it to be @entity10 - made because it appears to " have many of the same physical and chemical characteristics " of the other two products , @entity40 said
the @entity10 - made drywall emitted a sulfurous odor when exposed to extreme heat in testing , while the @entity79 - made product did not , according to @entity102 's report
however , the report does n't conclude that the strontium sulfide contributed to the odor
" because initial tests only detected small quantities of this substance , further tests are necessary to determine if it is the cause of odors and corrosive gases , " @entity40 said
@entity102 also found that the outer paper and core of two samples -- a piece of @entity10 - made drywall and a piece of the @entity79 - made drywall -- emitted trace levels of hydrogen sulfide and two other volatile , sulfur - containing gases when put into a chamber and exposed to 95 percent humidity
however , because the @entity79 sample came from a home that also had @entity10 - made drywall , cross-contamination could have occurred
more testing is needed , @entity40 said
one of the emitted gases was carbon disulfide , @entity102 's report said
breathing it at low levels for long periods " may result in headaches , tiredness , trouble sleeping and slight changes in the nerves , " according to the web site of @entity134 , which is part of the @entity79 @entity183
the emission tests were useful in determining what the drywall may produce , but conclusions can not be drawn about health risks , @entity40 said
that 's in part because the concentrations of emissions captured in laboratory testing are not useful to determine what concentrations would be found in the much larger volume of air in homes , he added
" we should n't interpret it for anything at this point , " @entity40 said
" these are not exposure measurements
" the @entity102 test results showed that heat and humidity play a key role in getting the drywall to emit the odors
" this may explain why the problem has developed in @entity2 first , where hot and humid conditions prevail , " @entity40 said
a @entity102 test also showed that sulfide gases in a @entity2 home that contained @entity10 - made drywall were the main reason that an air conditioner 's copper tubing corroded , @entity40 said
the report did not say whether the gases came from the drywall
earlier testing by @entity226 , a private consulting firm hired by a @entity2 - based homebuilder , found that certain drywall manufactured in @entity10 was emitting sulfur gases capable of ruining copper coils in air - conditioning systems
however , it said it found air samples in the homes showed no indication that health hazards existed
the @entity54 is " already sending additional experts from headquarters to @entity2 to further our investigation , " commission spokesman @entity237 said monday .
