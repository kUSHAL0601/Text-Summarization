-- @entity2 's @entity1 became the second player in the world 's top 10 to withdraw from the @entity6 when a viral infection ruled him out of sunday 's championships in @entity9
the world @entity10 revealed that the virus had affected him when losing to @entity14 @entity13 in last week 's @entity15
the 24 - year - old 's withdrawal follows that of world no. 2 @entity18 , who pulled out of the year 's second grand slam with a back injury
" this is a tough blow , because these are the events you dream of winning , " said @entity1 , who won the @entity21 in 2009 , on the @entity23 website
" now i must get over this disappointment and recover completely in order to prepare at 100 % for the tests to come
" the virus affecting @entity1 had prompted the tall right - hander to miss recent tournaments in @entity33 and @entity34 , and he returned in @entity35 with the hope of being able to compete at the @entity6
despite his exit in the third round , he will always remember his time in the @entity35 capital after meeting with the @entity41 , a fellow @entity2 , last week -- an experience @entity1 said he would " never forget "
@entity1 reached the semifinals of @entity6 in 2009 and the quarterfinals last year -- only to be beaten by @entity45 on both occasions
he was joined in withdrawing from next week 's event by former world number seven @entity50 , who is now ranked 41st in the world , and fellow @entity53 @entity52 -- whose absences had been expected
also on wednesday , @entity54 's terrible 2013 continued when the number one seed was beaten in straight sets by @entity59 's @entity58 at the @entity60
the former world number one from @entity62 is on a terrible recent run of form , having now added a first round exit in @entity66 to those suffered in @entity35 , @entity68 and @entity69 in the last month alone
the latest loss was all the more humbling given that @entity58 had been on court four hours earlier to see off @entity53 qualifier @entity72 in the first round
@entity54 , who had received a bye into the second round , was beaten by @entity58 's aggressive tactics with the @entity59 hitting twice as many winners as the @entity79 ( 34 to 17 )
" she 's a very tough player and fought until the last point , " @entity58 was quoted as saying by the @entity81 website
" i 'm so happy i could win this match
we 've played many times before and she 's always so tough to beat
" but she 's also a very nice person , ever since she was a junior
i 'm very proud and this gives me a lot of confidence
" @entity58 will play @entity90 of @entity91 in the quarterfinals , while @entity54 must work out how to rediscover the form that took her to april 's @entity96 @entity95 final ahead of sunday 's @entity6 .
