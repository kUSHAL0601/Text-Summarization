-- trees once looked like green panels for @entity3
he 'd have to move his head to gauge the relative closeness of objects
for most of his life , he had poor depth perception
his eyes pointed outward and did not allow him to see , in stereo , a single image with both eyes
but in february 2012 , something changed when he went to a movie theater with his wife
he put on a pair of @entity22 glasses to watch the film " @entity24 " and , to his amazement , the characters and scenery in this film jumped out at him in greater stereo vision than he had experienced before
what 's more , after returning the glasses and leaving the theater , @entity3 's perception of the real world was enhanced as well
a lamppost jumped out from the background , and the trees , cars and people looked somehow more vivid
this was the world with depth
" " suddenly , things began to jump out at me , " said @entity3 , a professor of psychology at the @entity40 , @entity41
the effect has stuck around since he saw the movie 16 months ago
it 's impossible to prove scientifically that the film itself altered his visual system , but his hope is that his story could help others with similar eye conditions who struggle through months of training to attempt to see more vividly
other experts say the vivid 3 - d movie could have indeed jolted @entity3 's visual system in this way , but that it would n't work as a quick fix for most people with eye alignment problems
it 's possible with @entity3 's unique set of circumstances , it was exactly what he needed , but it would probably help few people
" certainly immersion in a @entity22 movie could , if somebody had a marginal vision system , could absolutely improve it , " said @entity69 , associate professor at the @entity70 in @entity71 , who has not evaluated @entity3
but , he adds , " i would n't prescribe ( a movie )
" a flat world for @entity3 , the world used to be a much flatter place -- like a two - dimensional movie on a flat screen , he said
he often looked through only one eye or the other
he used other cues to help him figure out relative distances
for instance , parallax is a phenomenon in which , when you move your head , objects that are closer appear to move faster than objects that are farther away
objects also generally appear smaller when they are farther away
" you still see the world as kind of , in theory , three - dimensional , but the experience is more flat , " he said
" i did n't realize that until i began to see in proper stereo
" @entity3 recalls having his eyes examined at age 8 at a hospital in @entity104
doctors recommended against surgery , although he doubts his family could have afforded it anyway
because his eyes are n't completely well aligned , there 's a small eye movement that occurs when he shifts from looking through one eye to the other
" that had always been a social disadvantage , because people were never quite sure what i was looking at , " he said
he remembers in junior high school , his social studies teacher scolded him for giving him what the teacher thought was a disrespectful look
@entity3 had no idea what he was talking about and denied it , but still remembers this experience with anger and regret
in his early 20s , when he drove , he noticed that he could n't read signs on freeways until he had passed the exits
he went to a clinic where he found out he had myopia and other deviations of the eye
in 1983 , at the @entity134 , he collaborated with two colleagues on a study of his own vision
through such testing , it was obvious that his stereo vision was n't great , and that he had exotropic vision , meaning his eyes pointed in different directions
but he did n't know what perceptual difference it would make to view the world more in stereo , until he saw " @entity24
" now , objects that appeared to be on top of each other seem more separate , and 2 - @entity151 movies are recognizably flat -- before , they were perhaps " just as real as the real world , " he said
@entity155 it is estimated that between 3 % and 5 % of people are stereo - blind or have large deficits in stereo vision
@entity3 's case reminds experts of @entity155 , neurobiologist at @entity163 in @entity164 , who wrote a book called " fixing my gaze : a scientist 's journey into seeing in @entity169 " about how she gained stereo vision
neurologist @entity172 wrote about her as " @entity155 " in a 2006 article in the @entity175
@entity176 was cross-eyed from the first few months of life , and never learned how to point her eyes in the same direction , until she used a set of procedures to reposition her eyes over a period of a year
she believes this tapped into the circuitry in her brain specialized for binocular vision that had n't been active before
" people like me or like @entity3 who are cross-eyed , have strabismus , probably have the capacity to see in stereo if you can change your visual habits so as to point the two eyes at the same place at the same time , and bring in correlated input into the brain , " said @entity176 , who has corresponded with @entity3 but not studied him directly
several scientific studies have shown that , with training , people can recover stereo vision even if they 've never had it , said @entity205 , senior scientist at the @entity206 in @entity207
this is a recent shift in thinking
for decades , scientists believed that stereo vision could not be recovered , once lost
" it turns out that , in fact , with a lot of practice , like many other things you can recover capabilities , which is exciting , " @entity205 said
similarly , scientists once thought that there was a " critical period " of the first few years of life , during which one would either be able to see in three dimensions or not
@entity176 was 48 when she started to perceive three dimensions , and at first kept her awareness secret from other scientists out of concern that " they would think i 'm hysterical
" so what about that movie ? in his academic life , @entity3 's specialty is -- guess what ! -- the visual system
he 's working on such projects as eliminating sickness in driving simulators and exploring illusions such as why people overestimate the slopes of hills
after viewing " @entity24 , " @entity3 read up on research on the neuroscience of vision to come up with a possible explanation of what happened
@entity245 and @entity246 , who shared the 1981 @entity247 , had done research on kittens that gave @entity251 ideas about what could be going on in his own brain
the researchers studied the eyes and visual systems of young cats with misaligned eyes , showing that most cells in the brain 's visual cortex would be activated by one eye or the other
but a small group of these cells also responded to both eyes
@entity3 's hypothesis is that the analogous cells in himself got awakened during the movie , becoming newly connected to allow stereoscopic vision
" it was sort of serendipitous that i had spent my lifetime studying vision , and then this experience happened , so i could talk about it and maybe understand it in ways that most people would n't be able to , " he said
the act of watching a movie is n't going to fix someone who has an eye turned abnormally , but if someone was already at the cusp of this happening , it 's possible , @entity69 said
in @entity69 ' practice , patients with intermittent exotropia -- eyes that point outward much of the time -- typically go through a six - month process of training , involving exercises to help them focus both eyes together
@entity69 has seen patients have overpowering emotional experiences after therapy sessions , saying , " it 's the first time i 've seen the space between things
" it makes sense to @entity69 that a 3 - d movie could have had this effect on @entity3
ordinary movies do not reward the brain for bringing an outward - deviating eye in , but a @entity22 movie does
" the moment he brought his eye in subconsciously , he was like , ' oh wow , this looks cool , ' and then probably maintained the effort , " @entity69 said
the movie probably had the effect of training not the muscles of @entity3 's eyes per se , @entity69 said , but rather " the software he used in terms of how he looked at the world
" researchers have suggested that creating video games with three - dimensional information could be used to help children and adults with eye misalignment problems achieve improved stereo vision , @entity205 said
looking for more insights @entity3 's vision still is n't perfect
a few months after viewing " @entity24 , " he went to an optometrist in @entity41 who administered a test for stereo threshold , the same one @entity3 had taken at @entity134 in the 1980s
the test showed his stereo vision had improved dramatically since his earlier test , but still was n't within normal range
there still remain many unanswered questions
just how common is it for an adult to acquire stereo vision ? which specific visual anomalies might respond best to watching a @entity22 movie ? @entity3 wants to know
he 's in touch with @entity346 at the @entity134 , who led a study of five adults who went from being stereo - blind to seeing depth again through training
since a @entity353 article appeared about @entity3 last year , he 's gotten numerous e-mails from others with stereo vision problems
one man told him he had an experience similar to @entity3 's
" when it happens , it 's very sudden and pleasant , to see things in @entity22 that have been flat for all your life , " @entity3 said
