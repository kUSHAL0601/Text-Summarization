-- @entity2 prosecutors have dropped their pursuit of the death penalty for @entity5 , who was convicted of shooting a police officer three decades ago
he will instead serve a life sentence in prison , prosecutors said wednesday
" the decision to end this fight was not an easy one to make , " said district attorney @entity10
" there has never been a doubt in my mind that @entity5 shot and killed officer @entity17 , and i believe the appropriate sentence was handed down in 1982
" @entity5 was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1981 killing of @entity17
witnesses testified that @entity5 shot @entity17 in the back and head after the officer pulled over @entity5 's brother in a late - night traffic stop
once known as @entity5 , @entity5 was wounded in the encounter and later confessed to the killing
he 's been on death row at a state prison in southwest @entity30 , where he 's remained an outspoken activist from behind bars -- claiming there were procedural errors during his capital sentencing , and that too few blacks were on the jury
the case has attracted international attention , amid charges of prosecutorial misconduct
@entity5 , a onetime radio reporter and cabdriver , has been a divisive figure , with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial
others counter that @entity5 is using his race to try to escape responsibility for his actions
they say he has provoked community unrest for years with his writings and advocacy
in april , @entity5 was granted a new sentencing hearing by a federal appeals court , sparking a threat by the prosecutor to appeal the ruling to the @entity59
in its 32 - page decision , the 3rd @entity61 @entity60 accepted defense arguments that the jury instructions at @entity5 's 1982 murder trial were unclear
the court 's decision did not grant @entity5 a new trial ; his conviction on the murder charge stands
a 2008 appeals court ruling also had nullified @entity5 's death sentence and granted him a new sentencing hearing
but the @entity59 tossed out that ruling and ordered the appeals court to revisit the issue
the high court last year denied @entity5 's separate petition for a new trial .
