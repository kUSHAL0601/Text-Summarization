@entity0 , @entity1 -- the world was watching in 2006 when the @entity5 - designed @entity4 opened in @entity0 and attempted to reform education
despite having four principals , curriculum overhauls , and student technology gaps , the school graduated its first senior class last week , with every graduate having plans for institutions of higher learning
" this is n't a school about technology , this is a school about redefining the norm for urban education , " said @entity16 , director of innovation for @entity18 , who is also the liaison to the school
" we 've had this saying from the very beginning : money and technology are great , but people are better
" and everything about the state - of - the - art facility , complete with digital whiteboards and streaming video in classrooms , was created to be different from the beginning , too
the majority - minority $ 63 million school was erected with school district funds in the tough @entity41 neighborhood in @entity0
the school partnered with @entity5 on new approaches to curriculum , teaching methods and staffing
the school is made up of students chosen by a lottery of public school students , with the majority of them coming from low - income households with limited access to technology and training
the school struggled in its infancy
its first standardized test scores last year were daunting
less than 8 percent of 11th - graders scored proficient or higher in math , while just over 23 percent scored proficient or higher in reading
it 's back to basics under the watch of @entity64 , principal for the last two school years
regardless of the advancements , @entity64 says success is in the approach
" i do n't care how good the technology is , i do n't care how good the books are , the ancillary materials , if you can not create a stellar climate conducive to good teaching and learning , it 's not going to happen , " @entity64 said
" it 's about connections , it 's about relationships , it 's about caring
" test scores do n't tell the whole story of @entity4 , according to @entity16
" we wanted to take on all the challenges and still show that you could do it , " she said , adding that the school 's mission is to challenge the education status quo , all the while doing it under the same conditions as other public schools in the district
" and today , with 100 percent of these kids having college plans , i think we showed we can do it
" the original vision called for a paperless and textbook - free school
students were to be called learners
they would receive laptops for taking notes and tests and doing homework
students repeated the school mission " @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 " with ease
" things did fall apart here as far as the original vision , " said @entity113 , a senior and the school president , adding that students do use paper and textbooks now
" but we are n't broken , we 're still good , and i believe that i came out better
" @entity113 , one of the 118 students who graduated on june 15 , said she plans to attend @entity123 to study journalism
college was n't always in the future for @entity127
there were times during high school that she wanted to give up
she credits the caring staff and individual attention at school with helping to keep her on track
" when i actually grasped the concept that my future is what i make it , and my future is what i do exactly , i did n't want to fail , i did n't want to give up , i wanted to succeed , " said @entity138 , who plans to attend @entity139 in @entity140 to study climatology
" i wanted to be everything that everyone said that i could n't be
