-- nine - year - old @entity1 sat in the back of his father 's car on the cool afternoon when a sniper fired a bullet at his heart
his brother @entity8 , 15 , was seated next to him
their father sped through the streets desperate to flee shelling that was destroying their neighborhood in @entity15 , in southwest @entity16
the father saw a roadblock and decided to turn around
it was then that the sniper pulled the trigger
the bullet pierced @entity1 's chest , missing the boy 's heart by millimeters
then it careened through his left shoulder and ricocheted into @entity28
@entity1 looked to his left and saw his brother slumped over
nothing could stop him from passing into death
he did not feel his torso , only the pain that " cut my shoulder , " he said
he was rushed to the border and then to a @entity38 hospital
he had lost more than half of the blood in his body
doctors pumped him full of several units of blood and closed the wounds
the surgery took an hour
@entity1 's mother , 46 - year - old @entity47 , thanked @entity48 for her son 's survival
but in myriad ways , war had sapped her capacity for gladness
it felt like something inconceivable , physically impossible
" i ca n't be happy even if @entity58 is still alive , " she said
" i 've lost [ my other ] son and i can not be happy
" @entity16 's war is killing and maiming the youngest and most innocent members of society
according to the @entity65 , some 7,000 children , including 1,600 under the age of 10 , have lost their lives
at least one million @entity16 children are now refugees
four million of @entity16 's population of 20 million has been displaced internally
half of those are children
girl rising : no sanctuary for @entity16 's female refugees the indiscriminate shelling and bombing of villages and the destruction of schools and hospitals have forced @entity16 youngsters and their families to take flight
when they can , the wounded victims straggle across a border to a hospital
the injured , dead and dying pass before doctors and nurses in neighboring @entity38 who now have a unique understanding of how war damages and terminates human lives
" i would say that 50 percent of the injuries we see are caused by shelling
we see crush injuries from falling buildings , " said @entity97 , a @entity16 surgeon working in @entity38 whose name has been changed out of fears for his family
" the other 50 percent are from sniper fire and gunshots
" @entity105 : @entity16 's children deserve chance to be kids again dr. @entity97 becomes emotional when he speaks of young patients he has encountered
he remembers 4 - year - old @entity110 , who crossed into @entity38 from @entity16 with two broken legs , a fractured skull , two broken arms and a smashed pelvis after his home caved in during intensive shelling
like others in @entity38 , @entity97 monitors @entity119 channels posted by doctors in field hospitals in @entity16
monitoring potential arrivals allows him to prepare for incoming patients
he had seen the video of @entity110 just after his injury and thought it would be a miracle if the boy survived
after several surgeries @entity110 pulled through and now lives with his mother in @entity38 's @entity132 camp
continued existence is only a first step
@entity16 's children must learn to survive even their survival
if the removal of painful memories would bring them peace , most survivors of @entity16 's war would gladly comply
but memory is a silent intelligence that refuses exile
what can not be said becomes the shadow of that which is spoken
the recollections of children are no exception to this fact
the memory of the moment the rockets rained down on his home comes to 15 - year - old @entity157 in ghostlike fragments
he recalls that there were five rockets in total and that after the first landed his instinct was to run out of the house
@entity157 , his brother , mother , aunt and grandfather were outside of their home when the second rocket landed nearby
his 5 - month - pregnant mother held his 3 - year - old brother in her arms
the shrapnel burned through her torso and killed her instantly
@entity157 lay on the ground bleeding with shrapnel wounds in his leg
@entity157 remembers being in an ambulance with perhaps six or seven other people stacked up in bunks along the side of the vehicle
" i was in the ambulance
i thought about my family , " he said
" i did n't think about my injury at all
i was wondering when my family would come
i knew that my grandfather was there in the ambulance
i wondered where my mother was ; where my little brother was
" it is hard for @entity157 to rid himself of these images
they live inside of the wound that has forced him to live on crutches
he no longer wants to grow up to become a photographer or a teacher or a football player
" i want to be a fighter , " he tells me
" i want to join the resistance
" as much as assistance is needed for @entity16 , so too is a sense of hope
twelve - year - old @entity207 lost the lower part of her right leg after her street was shelled last october in a small village in the @entity212
her two brothers , one older and one younger , died in the incident
her older sister was injured
@entity207 cries softly as her mother describes the death of her brothers
to be sure there are times when she explodes into fits of rage after being forced to live her life without her leg
but there is a quiet resilience behind her weeping
she thinks of her brothers , sisters and other family members who have survived
" i want to be a doctor , " she says
" i want to help people who are like me
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .
