-- @entity1 walked out of a courtroom thursday a free man
how long will it take women attracted by the flame of celebrity -- even ill - gotten -- to date him ? and believe they can convert him to monogamy ? the former @entity13 presidential hopeful 's affair with @entity14 and the subsequent cover - up led to six counts carrying a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $ 1.5 million fine
federal prosecutors argued that @entity1 knowingly violated campaign finance laws by accepting large contributions from @entity23 and @entity24 to support @entity25 and their child , and keep the affair under wraps
@entity29 : juror had no intention of flirting with @entity1 a federal jury in @entity33 acquitted him on one count of violating campaign finance law thursday and deadlocked on the five other counts against him
prosecutors may still decide to retry him
politicians like @entity1 and @entity40 and celebrities like @entity42 and @entity43 seem to have no trouble attracting new girlfriends after public accusations of cheating
opinion : @entity1 jury got it exactly right it 's always possible that people who have cheated in the past will not cheat in the future
but relationship experts say past behavior is a better predictor of the future than any cheater 's promises
" denial can be really powerful in new relationships , " said divorce recovery expert @entity61 , co-founder of @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65
" people use it as a defense against knowing the truth
they do n't look at all the facts , and ultimately , that ends up being a problem
" @entity75 works wonders cheaters are usually unsatisfied about something in their lives , experts say , or they would n't stray
but it 's not always clear whether they 're truly unhappy with their partners or about something they ca n't fix in themselves
rarely does the cheater take responsibility for his ( or her ) life and getting out of it honorably
the spouses generally get the blame
the reputation of @entity92 , who separated from @entity1 in 2010 after 32 years of marriage and died of cancer in 2010 , seemed to be on trial at times
a full participant in her husband 's presidential campaign , she could be tough and blunt with campaign staffers
after reports surfaced of the affair , a witness testified , @entity92 confronted her husband and ripped off her blouse to show her mastectomy scars
" you do n't see me anymore , " former staffer @entity107 quoted her as saying
@entity1 charges : the rundown " i 've worked with countless people like this , and it 's always the same , " writes @entity111 , author of " @entity112 , " a book about rebuilding trust in relationships , in an e-mail
" the cheater says , ' my spouse is fat / stupid / mean / boring / whatever ( insert adjective ) and i need someone who is skinny / smart / nice / interesting / opposite - of - whatever
you are skinny / smart / nice / interesting / opposite - of - whatever
so we can be happy forever
' " the cheater 's flattery can be intoxicating , convincing the other person that he or she is special and protected from being cheated on in the future
" they think they 're special because they 've been told they 're special , and they want to believe it , " @entity111 said
" it 's not that people do n't think
it 's that flattery and excitement short - circuit thought
" and an @entity144 report that a juror might have been flirting with @entity1 drew a lot of attention
@entity1 flirting ? @entity149 surprise
can cheaters change ? of course , many cheaters can change if they have the desire
much has been made of @entity153 , who had an affair with @entity153 while he was married to his second wife , helping her husband convert to @entity158
it 's possible that @entity153 may stay faithful , if for no other reason than the 24 - news cycle means public figures are being constantly scrutinized for evidence of bad behavior
why politicians lie and why we want to believe them affairs with married men or women are a high - risk gamble , says @entity171 , an @entity172 psychology professor
look at the evidence : cheating is how he or she has chosen to solve relationship problems
" when you win such a man , you are winning someone who feels entitled to have his cake and eat it too and then lie about it , " @entity171 said
so @entity153 or any future @entity1 girlfriend should n't assume she can change the cheater or that he will be different with her because she 's so special
their love , and his belief in @entity188 or occupancy of the @entity190 , will not keep anyone faithful if he does n't want to be or ca n't be faithful
( former president @entity192 proved that point
) questions to ask it is possible for people in decent marriages to fall in love outside the marriage , but it 's important to carefully assess whether the couple can get beyond the fantasy to the reality of love
" i would try to look carefully at the ( cheater 's ) motivation and see what you feel is genuinely true between the two of us , " said @entity205 , author of " the wisdom of a @entity207
" " do you admire their character otherwise ? do you feel loved and seen as you are ? " there needs to be some recognition that your relationship is n't a perfect replacement of an imperfect marriage
" a question to ask yourself is , ' does my relationship include difficulty ? ' " @entity205 recommended
" are there things that bug me about this person ? if there are n't , that would send up a red flag for me
" if they seem only motivated by ambition or simply looking for brighter horizons , " delete them from your @entity233 account and move on , " she says .
