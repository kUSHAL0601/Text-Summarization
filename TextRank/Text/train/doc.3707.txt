@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 on thursday passed a bill that removes limits on financial damages that can be awarded for accidents off the @entity9 coastline , such as the explosion of the @entity12 oil rig that killed 11 workers
the bill updates maritime laws that have been on the books since the mid- 1800s and early 1920s
those laws restricted the amount of money families could obtain to compensate for lost wages and funeral expenses
the bill passed by the @entity3 thursday would allow compensation for non-monetary losses such as pain and suffering
a similar measure awaits action in the @entity27
also thursday , the @entity29 and @entity28 issued a directive to @entity31 on how the company should manage recovered oil , contaminated materials and waste recovered in cleanup operations from the oil disaster in the @entity38
among other requirements , the directive requires the oil giant to give the @entity28 and state agencies access to any waste storage site and to provide specific plans , waste reports and tracking systems for liquid and solid waste
" while the states of @entity1 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 are overseeing @entity31 's waste management activities and conducting inspections , this action today is meant to compliment their activities by providing further oversight and imposing more specific requirements , " the @entity29 said thursday
" under the directive , @entity28 , in addition to sampling already being done by @entity31 , will begin sampling the waste to help verify that the waste is being properly managed
" waste sampling to date has been done in compliance with @entity28 and state regulatory requirements , the @entity29 said
the @entity28 on thursday also released results from its first round of toxicity testing on eight oil dispersants , including @entity68 , which is being used in the @entity38
in may , the @entity28 had asked @entity31 to stop using @entity68 and to substitute other , less toxic alternatives on the market
@entity31 declined to change dispersant , arguing that it was the best one for the job
the study showed that none of the eight dispersants tested displayed significant endocrine disrupting activity , the @entity28 said
damage to the endocrine system is harmful to sea life , and can create reproductive problems
the agency conducted the testing to ensure that " decisions about ongoing dispersant use in the @entity38 continue to be grounded in the best available science , " the @entity28 said
of the dispersants tested , @entity68 and one called @entity87 were generally less toxic to small fish , and @entity87 and @entity90 were least toxic to mysid shrimp , the @entity28 said
" we want to ensure that every tool is available to mitigate the impact of the @entity31 spill and protect our fragile wetlands , " epa administrator @entity92 said
" but we continue to direct @entity31 to use dispersants responsibly and in as limited an amount as possible
" meanwhile , rough seas in the wake of @entity106 kept oil skimming boats out of the @entity38 on thursday and could keep many tied up through the weekend , the retired admiral in charge of the federal response to the @entity38 oil disaster said
@entity108 , briefing reporters in civilian garb after retiring from the @entity29 on wednesday , said seas over 5 feet hinder the effectiveness of most boats used to scoop oil
all but the largest vessels will likely be idled for another three days , he said
" in general , we 're waiting for the weather to abate so we can continue with recovery operations , " he said
a ship billed as the world 's largest skimming vessel has arrived in the @entity38 and was awaiting approval to begin cleaning , according to a spokesman for the @entity125 company that owns it
the @entity127 arrived in the @entity38 on wednesday and was anchored in @entity128 , @entity1 , about an hour south of @entity0
@entity130 , a spokesman for ship owner tmt shipping , said it is still awaiting approval to join the effort
@entity108 said the vessel -- estimated to be able to skim up to 21 million gallons a day -- is awaiting testing
that capacity is at least 250 times the amount that the modified fishing boats currently conducting skimming operations have been able to contain , the company says
built this year , the @entity127 was initially designed to be one of the largest cargo vessels afloat
it was completed at a @entity145 shipyard for transporting crude oil and iron ore
however , @entity130 said in the statement , when the disaster unfolded , @entity149 modified the vessel to become the world 's first large - scale skimmer
" we 're anxious to find out how effective it will be , " @entity108 said
he cautioned that the area of the slick in which the ship will be most effective is a " congested " site above the ruptured @entity31 well , which could make it harder to operate the 1,000 - foot - plus vessel , but added , " anything that 's effective we 're looking forward to using
" @entity106 hit the @entity165 coast , more than 600 miles from the center of the @entity38 disaster , on wednesday night with 105 mph winds
it had diminished to a tropical storm by thursday afternoon , but it continued to stir up seas of 6 to 8 feet around the site of the 10 - week - old disaster and forced the postponement of a planned overflight of the area by @entity29 rear adm. @entity177
and the system 's prevailing winds have affected the direction of the oil slick , steering it away from the western @entity182 toward the environmentally sensitive @entity51 and @entity183 sounds off the coast of @entity51 and @entity1 , @entity177 said
researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels ( about 1.5 million gallons ) and 60,000 barrels ( about 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have been gushing into the @entity38 every day since april 20 , when the @entity12 rig exploded and sank off the coast of @entity1
in other efforts , the @entity189 said thursday it was sending a silver - colored blimp to aid in oil disaster efforts
the blimp , known as the @entity194 , will fly slowly over the region in order to view the area where the oil is flowing and how it is coming ashore
it can also direct oil skimming operations
it was on the way to the @entity202 from @entity203 on thursday , the @entity189 said
in @entity205 , @entity50 , meanwhile , the official tapped to oversee the payment of claims for damages from @entity31 said he is working to speed up the process and get longer - term payments to those affected
@entity212 , the attorney who handled a similar process after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity215 and @entity216 , said after a meeting with @entity50 gov. @entity218 that " time is the enemy
" " this is life for many people , in terms of their financial instability and the need for financial certainty , " he said
" we do not have a lot of time
" @entity212 said @entity218 has suggested that affected residents get lump - sum payments for up to six months ' worth of lost income rather than month - to - month payments , and " that is what we plan to do
" @entity2 's @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .
