-- @entity1 wo n't look at video that appears to capture this week 's cargo airplane crash in @entity4
@entity1 used to be afraid to fly
he got over it by looking at flight safety data , learning that flying is way safer than driving and talking to lots of pilots and flight attendants
now @entity1 flies more than 175,000 miles per year and documents his journeys on his travel website
" since i used to be afraid to fly i do n't want to risk triggering any of my old emotions , " he said in an e-mail
" i just do n't need those kind of images in my head
" the fiery images are alarming
@entity20 - based cargo carrier @entity19 confirmed that @entity21 had just taken off from @entity22 in @entity4 en route to @entity24 when the crash occurred , killing all seven crew members aboard
an approximately three - minute video , which has not been authenticated by @entity0 , shows what appears to be the @entity30 jet climbing shortly after takeoff , stalling , rolling from side to side and crashing into the ground
while the video might trigger a fear of flying in usually calm travelers or terrify already fearful passengers , most travelers are n't flying under the kind of conditions faced at @entity22 in @entity4
here are five things to keep in mind as you head for your next commercial flight : civilian aircraft do n't fly at such a steep angle the circumstances under which military troops and cargo airplanes fly in and out of a war zone are far from the routines of commercial airlines , says @entity53 , a former @entity54 member and airline mechanic
" commercial airplanes climb at about half the angle the military climbs at , " @entity53 says
" military aircraft take off at a such a steep angle to get high enough to get away from local arms fire
they need to get over 3,000 feet as quickly as they can
" a commercial airline 's cargo hold is small ( and full ) a military aircraft carrying heavy equipment might not fill an entire cargo airplane , requiring that the cargo be secured to prevent a potentially deadly sudden shift in weight , @entity53 says
in contrast , aircraft configured for passengers have much smaller cargo compartments , which are filled with baggage and any cargo that the airline can pack into the belly of their planes
" full compartments leave no room for cargo to shift , " he says
one crash is not a trend simply watching a video of a crash is n't a problem , says @entity91 , a psychologist with the @entity92 of @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity93
it 's the interpretations people make after watching a plane crash or other disturbing news events over and over again
" i will get people up until 4 a.m. watching the @entity103 bombing story , " she says
" they think , ' this happens all the time , which means it could easily happen to me
' " monday 's plane crash in @entity4 " is compelling and very sad , " she says
" however , it 's very infrequent
airline travel is the safest form of travel
as @entity20 , we are very good at overdoing it
" an ' @entity116 ' to calm flying fears visuals can pack an intensified punch watching such a video can activate a different area of your brain than reading a story , @entity91 says
the visual stimulation can activate people 's fight or flight response , making them think they are in imminent danger
" your brain is telling you that a predator is after you , " @entity91 says
" reading about it does n't tend to cause the same reaction
" a small percentage of people worldwide suffer from fearful flying to the extent that it impairs them in some way , she says , and some people can become traumatized by watching and fixating on disturbing videos
people overestimate the threat and underestimate their ability to react , she says
@entity0 commenter @entity143 says he usually does n't suffer from fear of flying
yet one airplane crash stands out for him
ever since he watched all the 1996 news coverage about @entity147 , which blew up a few minutes after takeoff , @entity143 wrote via e-mail that he 's " acutely aware " of the early part of his flights
" now , having watched the @entity22 crash , i expect my existing takeoff anxiety to increase slightly
" we can come to terms with our fears try not to avoid or try to stop your fears , suggests @entity160 psychologist @entity159
" they are hard to stop and they find sneaky ways of reminding you they are there , " he wrote via e-mail
" instead , try to make peace with them
" his suggestions : " notice your network of fears
say the word ' flying ' or ' 747 ' and notice what else comes to mind in your network of fears
let 's say the word is ' crash
' rate your level of anxiety when you say the word aloud
repeat the word out loud for 90 seconds and notice what happens to the scariness of the word
try this exercise three times
" and remind yourself of why you 're traveling , @entity159 suggests
whether it 's a business trip or a much - anticipated getaway or a trip to see a loved one , the reasons can help you see past your fears
