@entity0 has announced plans to build new nuclear reactors in @entity3 -- a move with international repercussions as a deadline looms
the country will construct up to eight new reactors for the " peaceful use of atomic energy " in @entity3 , @entity0 state news agency @entity7 reported tuesday
the announcement came less than two weeks before @entity3 's negotiations with @entity15 powers over its nuclear activities are set to expire
it also came a day after a fresh warning from @entity20 that the regime ca n't be trusted , and a fresh promise from @entity22 that @entity3 wo n't become a nuclear - armed state
@entity0 said its agreement with @entity3 includes a plan for the spent nuclear fuel to be " returned to @entity0 for reprocessing and storage
" both @entity3 and @entity0 are under sanctions by the @entity30
the announcement suggests @entity32 is demonstrating that it has no plans to slow down its nuclear cooperation
@entity3 leader : ' annihilate ' @entity20 on monday , @entity20 prime minister @entity36 spoke out against new statements from @entity3 's @entity38 calling for @entity20 to be " annihilated
" " there is no moderation in @entity3
it is unrepentant , unreformed , it calls for @entity20 's eradication , it promotes international terrorism , " @entity36 said in a statement
" this terrorist regime in @entity3 must not be allowed to become a nuclear threshold power , " the prime minister said
" and i call on the @entity50 countries -- do n't rush into a deal that would let @entity3 rush to the bomb
" @entity50 refers to the @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity0 , @entity57 , @entity58 -- the five permanent members of the @entity60 -- and @entity61
@entity3 insists it only wants nuclear energy
and supreme leader ayatollah @entity63 , while calling for the elimination of @entity20 , said he opposes " a massacre of the @entity67 people in this region
" it says the " proper way of eliminating @entity20 " is for " all the original people of @entity71 including @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity67 wherever they are , whether inside @entity71 , in refugee camps in other countries or just anywhere else , take part in a public and organized referendum
" the " @entity67 immigrants who have been persuaded into emigration to @entity71 do not have the right to take part , " he said
it 's unclear who @entity63 thinks the " original people of @entity71 " are , given that the region 's history dates back thousands of years and includes countless waves of immigration and exile
@entity55 : @entity3 wo n't get a nuclear bomb @entity55 president @entity94 recently sent a letter to @entity63 about cooperating in the fight against @entity97 , the terror group that calls itself the @entity98
revelations about the letter have raised questions over whether @entity94 's stance on @entity3 is softening
@entity55 officials insist @entity22 is not coordinating military actions with @entity105 -- and that there is no softening in its position on the country 's nuclear program
" we will not let @entity3 acquire a nuclear weapon , period , " @entity55 vice president @entity111 vowed monday
the deadline for the current round of nuclear negotiations between @entity3 and the @entity50 is november 24
@entity94 has left it unclear whether a deal will be struck by then
opinion : on @entity3 , is @entity94 a sad negotiator ?
