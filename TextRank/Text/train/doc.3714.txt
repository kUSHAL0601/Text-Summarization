@entity0 -- as the other half of a billionaire political power couple , a mother , a doctor and philanthropist , @entity3 's name carries a lot of credibility with @entity12 women
@entity3 , an expert in drug addiction who has supported countless organizations , is seen as a champion of women 's issues and groups
so , for the @entity12 women who sat on white couches on tuesday in the pink carnation - decorated " @entity26 " pavilion at the @entity23 listening to a strategy session on using social media , they hoped that maybe , just maybe @entity3 might appear
@entity3 was a no - show yet her presence was felt
her name filled a large banner in the room , a reminder of her powerful connection and large check book
the @entity35 donated $ 5 million to the @entity36 , a super pac founded by the same former aides to rep. @entity38 who founded the @entity39
" dr. @entity3 is pretty unique , " said @entity40 , policy director at the @entity39 , a conservative think tank that put on the " @entity26 " event
" she embodies a lot of the spirit here in the pavilion
she 's a mom , a doctor ... she 's supportive of conservative causes ... she 's giving back
" as a physician , @entity3 has spent decades studying the effectiveness of using methadone to treat drug addiction
she founded a substance abuse center and research clinic at @entity55 's @entity54 and the dr. @entity3 and @entity57 in @entity58
she still dons a lab coat every day , according to a profile in @entity61 , studies the genetic connection to addiction and works with patients
" my priorities in life are my family , to be a good mother and a loving wife
money is down on the list of my priorities , " @entity3 told @entity61
" that is why i have no problem to change my expensive suit for the white ' lab coat
' ask me which one i prefer , and i will tell you that with no doubt , it is the white one
" the @entity35 have given at least $ 36 million to various organizations and candidates this campaign season according to the @entity83 , which tracks the influence of money in politics
their donations to super pacs , including $ 15 million to winning our future -- which backed @entity91 and helped to keep his candidacy alive -- and $ 10 million to restore our future , the main super pac supporting @entity12 nominee @entity95
one of @entity3 's priorities is supporting and protecting @entity97 , where she attended a speech and fundraiser for @entity95 during his trip there last month
@entity3 began her medical career in @entity97 years ago and earned a bachelor of science in @entity103 from the @entity104 and her medical degree from @entity107 's @entity106 , according to the @entity61 profile
she became the chief emergency room internist at the @entity110 in @entity55
while the couple 's donations to super pacs are disclosed , @entity111 has said some of his political activity may also be made to non-profit groups that do not have to disclose their contributors
several of these organizations are hoping for sizable gifts from the couple
@entity3 has told friends he is willing to spend up to $ 100 million this election season to not only make sure a @entity12 is elected to the @entity125 but to support @entity12 congressional candidates
political observers credit @entity3 with helping encourage her casino magnate husband to up the ante when it comes to spending money for @entity12 causes
in a year when much has been made of the so - called " war on women , " women like @entity3 add weight to @entity12 causes , said @entity137 , chairwoman of the @entity138
@entity137 said @entity3 is able to use her platform to amplify the views of many @entity12 women
" i think it 's good that women are stepping up to the plate and getting involved , " @entity137 said
" politics has always been a man 's game
" both the hue and the view were decidedly rosy at the woman 's @entity150
the @entity12 women there took time to sip iced coffee , shop for @entity12 elephant accessories and plot how they could marshal forces to educate voters about the economic crisis and voter identification fraud
in a nearby room , there were walls dedicated to the history of powerful women in @entity167 politics
women like @entity3 , said conservative activist @entity169
" dr. @entity3 ... puts her money where her mouth is , " @entity169 said
@entity1 's @entity172 contributed to this report .
