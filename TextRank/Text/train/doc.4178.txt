-- military forces used thermal imaging technology and other specialized equipment to help search for victims buried in rubble from monday 's devastating tornado outside @entity8
the government 's disaster response was led by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) with the military acting in a support role
president @entity14 has pledged a range of federal resources if requested in response to the massive twister that tore a 17 - mile path of destruction through central @entity8
at least 24 people were killed and more than 230 others hurt , authorities said
so far @entity25 gov. @entity24 has activated 241 @entity27 and @entity28 troops
" when you actually get out here and see the devastation , all the people that are affected by it , it really hits hard , " said spc. @entity29 of the @entity30
" i 've got a friend i work with that his house was leveled
" additionally , active duty firefighting crews from @entity40 near the hardest hit area in @entity42 responded
rescuers pored over collapsed buildings and homes and other devastation searching for survivors
many of the @entity25 guardsmen have night vision goggles and thermal imaging equipment and used the technology overnight
" we can get in with the thermal imagers and night vision and see in the dark and hopefully help find survivors , " said 2nd lt. @entity53 of the @entity54
at least 100 people have been pulled alive from tornado wreckage
the @entity60 base at @entity61 in @entity62 , about 125 miles southwest of @entity8 and home of the @entity27 's artillery training school , will be used to stage equipment and supplies for @entity11
no active duty troops from that facility had been deployed yet for tornado relief , @entity61 's public affairs office said
it is unlikely at this point that the region will see a large - scale military presence in the area similar to what was seen after @entity77
