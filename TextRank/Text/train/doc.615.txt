-- a @entity3 court thursday acquitted radical cleric @entity4 of charges of conspiracy to bomb an @entity8 school in the late 1990s , state media reported
@entity4 , whose real name is @entity4 , was also charged with a 2000 attempt to bomb millennium celebrations in @entity3
he will remain in jail pending a verdict on that case , according to @entity16 news agency
it did not say why he was found not guilty in the @entity8 school case
the cleric was deported from the @entity20 last year , ending a years - long legal battle to force him to leave the country
a @entity3 national , he was wanted in his home country , where he had been convicted in absentia on two charges of conspiracy to cause explosions
@entity20 had been trying to deport him since 2001 , but his legal appeals kept him there until last year
in january 2012 , the @entity30 blocked @entity20 from sending him to @entity3 over fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at trial
@entity20 authorities said he raised funds for terrorist groups , including organizations linked to @entity40 leader @entity39 , and publicly supported militants ' violent activities
videos of his preaching were found in a @entity46 apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the @entity8 , including ringleader @entity50
@entity4 has denied the allegations against him
he arrived in the @entity20 in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by @entity3 authorities
he came to @entity20 on a forged @entity56 passport , according to court documents , and claimed asylum for himself , his wife and their three children
