@entity0 -- you would n't have expected @entity3 to go quietly after his increasingly bizarre behavior prompted his tv bosses to fire him from " @entity6 , " and @entity3 would not want to disappoint you
he spewed an eight - and - a - half - minute , grandiloquent , profanity - laced tirade online late tuesday , a day after he was sacked
at first @entity3 comes across like a college student who 's read too much of the beat writers @entity10 or @entity11 , referring to himself as the " raven-wise , @entity14 - shredding napalm poet before you , alone and unshackled
" oh how they once begged to attend my perfect banquet in the nude , " @entity3 intones
" now they just beg for the keys to my gold
" he calls himself the " @entity23 " and repeatedly refers to himself as a warlock
but , clearly reading a prepared speech in video recorded live on @entity26 , @entity3 goes on long enough to make it hard for viewers to laugh off his rant
@entity30 , the creator of the program that starred @entity3 for eight years , comes in for the greatest abuse
" i see you , you little worm , i see you behind your plastic smile , your bitchy pout , and your desperate need to be liked , " @entity3 says , calling the tv executive " @entity34 , " not using @entity30 's full name
he accuses @entity30 of " narcissism , greed ( and ) hatred of yourself -- or women , " one of several moments in the video that should give armchair psychiatrists plenty of material to mine
he says of @entity52 chief executive @entity51 : " you gave me your word so you gave me nothing
it must really suck being your missus , " again mangling the name
" a high treason has occurred , " he concludes
" the scales of justice are in a state of radical disarray
together we must right this infantile wrong
stay tuned , good soldiers
i 'll see you all on the battlefield
" the video ends with helicopter sound effects and a single person clapping
" after careful consideration , @entity70 has terminated @entity3 's services on ' @entity6 , ' effective immediately , " the company said in a statement
@entity3 , 45 , has been known for his highly publicized marital , legal and substance abuse problems as much as his acting
the show was put on hiatus after he entered a rehabilitation program in january , and production was halted after @entity3 blasted @entity30 and @entity82 in a february 24 radio interview
he has followed that up with a series of interviews in which he threatened to sue @entity52 for shutting down the show , demanded a raise from $ 2 million to $ 3 million per episode and insisted he was " clean , focused and ready to get back to work
" " i feel more alive , i feel more focused , i feel more energetic , " @entity3 told @entity1 's " @entity91 " last week
" i 'm on a quest to claim absolute victory on every front
" amid his professional squabbles with @entity70 and @entity52 , @entity3 's estranged wife , @entity95 , won a court order removing their twin sons from @entity3 's home after she told authorities he had threatened to cut her head off , " put it in a box and send it to your mom
" in an interview with @entity108 's " @entity107 , " @entity3 denied making the threat and insisted the quote was fabricated
@entity3 earlier pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge involving @entity95 in august 2010 , receiving a sentence of 30 days probation , as well as rehabilitation and anger - management counseling
the following october , adult - film actress @entity116 accused @entity3 of terrorizing her during a drunken rampage in a room at the @entity119 in @entity120 ; @entity3 sued her in november , claiming she tried to extort money from him
and @entity3 's second wife , @entity122 , accused @entity3 of physically and verbally abusing her and threatening her life
she obtained a restraining order against him in 2006
the couple divorced that year , and @entity122 has custody of their two daughters
@entity70 is a division of @entity129 , also the parent company of @entity1
@entity1 's @entity130 contributed to this report .
