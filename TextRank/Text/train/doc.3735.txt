@entity1 's western black rhino is now officially extinct according the latest review of animals and plants by the world 's largest conservation network
the subspecies of the black rhino -- which is classified as " critically endangered " by the @entity10 's ( @entity10 ) @entity9 -- was last seen in western @entity1 in 2006
the @entity10 warns that other rhinos could follow saying @entity1 's northern white rhino is " teetering on the brink of extinction " while @entity15 's @entity14 rhino is " making its last stand " due to continued poaching and lack of conservation
@entity23 horn trade triggers extinction threat " in the case of the western black rhino and the northern white rhino the situation could have had very different results if the suggested conservation measures had been implemented , " @entity25 , chair of the @entity10 species survival commission said in a statement
" these measures must be strengthened now , specifically managing habitats in order to improve performance , preventing other rhinos from fading into extinction , " @entity25 added
the @entity10 points to conservation efforts which have paid off for the southern white rhino subspecies which have seen populations rise from less than 100 at the end of the 19th century to an estimated wild population of 20,000 today
where animals go before extinction another success can be seen with the @entity50 which was listed as " extinct in the wild " in 1996 but now , thanks to a captive breeding program , has an estimated population of 300
the latest update to the @entity9 reviews more than 60,000 species , concluding that 25 % of mammals on the list are at risk of extinction
many plants are also under threat , say the @entity10
populations of @entity65 fir , a conifer which was once widespread throughout @entity65 and @entity67 , is being threatened by the expansion of intensive agriculture according to the @entity10
a type of yew tree ( taxus contorta ) found in @entity15 which is used to produce @entity73 ( a chemotherapy drug ) has been reclassified from " vulnerable " to " endangered " on the @entity9 , as has the @entity75 -- a palm tree found in the @entity77 islands -- which is at risk from fires and illegal harvesting of its kernels
recent studies of 79 tropical plants in the @entity86 archipelago revealed that more than three quarters of them were at risk of extinction
in the oceans , the @entity10 reports that five out of eight tuna species are now " threatened " or " near threatened , " while 26 recently - discovered amphibians have been added to the @entity9 including the " blessed poison frog " ( classified as vulnerable ) while the " summers ' poison frog " is endangered
" this update offers both good and bad news on the status of many species around the world , " @entity96 , director of @entity10 's global species program said in a statement
" we have the knowledge that conservation works if executed in a timely manner , yet , without strong political will in combination with targeted efforts and resources , the wonders of nature and the services it provides can be lost forever
