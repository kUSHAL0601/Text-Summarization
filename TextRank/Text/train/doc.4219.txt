@entity0 -- investigators and rescue teams will continue their search friday for a missing 13 - year - old @entity6 girl , focusing near a densely wooded area and along the @entity8
meanwhile , @entity10 's mother , @entity9 , told @entity12 's @entity11 that she and her live - in boyfriend , @entity14 , both failed polygraph exams

@entity10 reportedly told @entity16 she was going to visit her father and then a friend
@entity10 's father , @entity24 , says she often came to his home but did not on that day
@entity10 said she took the polygraph test after she was informed that @entity16 had failed
@entity27 , a polygraph expert , told @entity11 that troubles him
'' that absolutely would cause major problems emotionally as she 's administered one
you want to try to minimize that as much as possible , " @entity27 said
@entity10 did not say who administered the exam , during which she says she was asked if she knew anything about or caused @entity10 's disappearance and whether she feared any questions
the night @entity10 vanished , @entity10 says she thought her daughter was sleeping over at a friend 's house
asked why she did not confirm @entity10 's location before going to bed that night , @entity10 said , '' i just do n't have an answer for that
i wish i would have called to tell her goodnight
'' @entity10 says police questioned her for more than 10 hours on wednesday
she met @entity16 on the @entity49 social networking site more than two years ago , and he moved in with her several months ago
police initially considered @entity52 a runaway , but the situation is now a missing person case
a @entity6 @entity56 has not been issued , reportedly because no one saw @entity10 being abducted
@entity10 is 5 - foot - 2 and weighs 120 pounds
she has hazel eyes and brown hair with blond streaks
when she disappeared , she was wearing navy blue sweatpants , a light colored short sleeve t - shirt , and pink and white tennis shoes .
