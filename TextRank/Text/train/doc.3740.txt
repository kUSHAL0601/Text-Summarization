-- @entity1 have taken a 1 - 0 lead in the best - of - three @entity3 after a comfortable victory over holders @entity5 in friday 's opening race in @entity7
@entity9 challengers @entity1 cruised home by a three kilometer margin despite a poor start -- and now look poised to take the title from their @entity15 opponents in the second race on sunday
the opening race had twice fallen victim to adverse weather conditions this week , and more rough weather delayed proceedings once again
but when the flag eventually came down , @entity1 stormed to victory , coming home over 15 minutes ahead of @entity5
winning captain @entity26 told the official @entity3 web site : " this was one of the hardest days i 've had on the boat with the pressure and direction changes
" but all in all it was a good day
i 'm sure there are some improvements we can make , but obviously it was great
" the @entity3 is international sport 's oldest trophy and was first competed for off the coast of southern @entity41 in 1851 .
