-- in an age when people are encouraged to collect hundreds of @entity4 " friends " and thousands of @entity6 followers , some social media users , particularly young ones , are going smaller
yes , @entity4 and @entity6 remain the juggernauts of social sharing -- facebook with more than 1.2 billion active users and @entity6 with more than 240 million of its own
but over the past couple of years , it 's been smaller social sharing and messaging tools , most of them mobile apps , that have gotten the most buzz and gained the most users
these services encourage users to target personalized messages to individuals or small groups instead of broadcasting posts to larger networks of people
that does n't mean folks are ditching @entity4 for the silly photos of @entity30 or the 6 - second videos of @entity32
but these emerging social hangouts increasingly are where young users are communicating with each other
" i think it is too early to say that they 're abandoning the larger social networks , but certainly the audience for those networks is now fragmented , " said @entity37 , a journalism professor at the @entity38 who focuses on digital media and culture
according to a @entity49 survey from last fall , the two fastest - growing apps used by teens were @entity32 , which lets users share brief video clips , and @entity53 , a @entity54 mobile text and voice messaging app. usage of @entity53 had increased a whopping 1,021 % from the beginning of 2013
among those same teens , 56 % said they were active on @entity4 , compared to 76 % at the beginning of the year
" we did see a decrease in daily users , partly among younger teens , " @entity4 chief financial officer @entity59 acknowledged during an earnings call at the end of last year
that 's no surprise , according to @entity37
" first , young people are always looking for the coolest new thing , and now that their parents and grandparents are on @entity4 , it 's certainly not a cool new thing , " she said
" some of it is social currency , in general
" second , younger people have truly embraced the move to apps that are a combination of visual , mobile and social
they carry phones that are set up to shoot photos and videos and they are quite conditioned -- perhaps by their early years on @entity4 -- to sharing experiences in a way that previous generations might not be
" as opposed to a single new destination , alternate social usage has spread to a host of tools
in 2013 , @entity30 , @entity92 and @entity32 were all downloaded from @entity94 's app store more frequently than @entity6 or @entity4
@entity95 , the messaging tool that @entity4 bought for $ 19 billion last month , has more than 450 million users worldwide
and @entity92 , a photo - sharing network that feels more intimate than @entity4 ( despite being bought by @entity4 ) , now has more than 150 million users
the most recent buzz coming out of @entity103 is small , anonymous social apps like @entity101
those apps combine the joys of scandalous water - cooler gossip with the @entity108 's ability to keep us anonymous while we do it
you 're still posting to your established social networks , but nobody knows which friend said what
that speaks to one reason some observers see a move to smaller social networks
putting one 's best foot forward -- particularly in a way that will please @entity125 , your co-workers , your drinking buddies and your high school pals all at once -- gets hard after a while
last year , the @entity131 conducted focus groups with teens who said they had become less excited about @entity4 , " disliking the increasing adult presence , people sharing excessively , and stressful ' drama
' " the report noted , though , that few of them had stopped using the site altogether
in fact , those with the largest networks on @entity4 ( more than 600 friends ) were also the most likely to retreat at times to other , smaller social media
path , launched by former facebooker @entity146 in 2010 , limits users to no more than 150 friends
( it was originally just 50
) the app has n't fully lived up to the hype it received when it rolled out , and its growth has been hampered , in part , by privacy snafus early in its existence
but it has continued to chug along and now has more than 25 million registered users
( the company has not given out more detailed information , including the number of those users who are active
) @entity164 's theory for the app was based on research by @entity168 psychologist and anthropologist @entity167
@entity167 opined that our brains only have the ability to maintain 150 stable relationships
anything above that , and the relationship becomes more superficial
" some social media sites have become so large that , ironically , the social component is now lacking , " said @entity177 , a @entity178 telecommunications professor who studies the role of social media in news and politics
" one can not maintain relationships with more than a couple of dozens of friends , online or offline
" for many , sites like @entity4 and @entity6 have become " personal broadcast tools " that allow them to inform big groups about events in their lives , but not really share much , he said
" smaller social media spaces , especially specific to an area of interest or a skill , can become an alternative , where users can create a manageable social network , where they can invest in interpersonal relationships , " said @entity177 , who teaches a course in social media analytics
some people have reported fatigue from the effort required to maintain their social presences on big sites
" @entity6 and @entity4 ... are like giant auditoriums where we put on ' public performances
' and those have grown exhausting , " @entity214 , co-founder of @entity215 , a privacy app , told @entity0
" that 's why @entity30 felt so refreshing
" @entity30 lets users exchange photo - based messages that disappear after a few seconds , easing the pressure some feel to compose posts that will be widely liked and shared
that 's a topic author and marketing consultant @entity223 was tackling back in 2011 , around the time the " small social " surge was starting
in a piece titled " @entity230 , pretend friend and the lie of @entity233 , " he quoted social media buzz phrases like " social media makes a big world smaller " and " @entity237 is for people you know , @entity4 is for people you used to know , @entity6 is for people you want to know
" " all of these chestnuts are passed around like a flu strain because they make intuitive sense , " @entity223 wrote
" but common among them is the underlying premise that interacting with more people is inherently better than interacting with fewer people
i have always believed this to be true , and in fact have delivered the lines above in presentations and on this blog
but today , i 'm no longer convinced
