fiery rhetoric accompanied the military actions
deputy commander @entity91 said , " we will turn @entity93 into a sea of flames by our strong and cruel artillery firepower , which can not be compared to our artillery shelling on @entity86

" the @entity2 and @entity21 are carrying out annual joint military drills , which @entity3 has condemned as a provocation
now , @entity14 is staging its own
