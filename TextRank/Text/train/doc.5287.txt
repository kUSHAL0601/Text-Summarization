-- the chief executive of @entity3 team @entity2 has backed recent calls for a budget cap saying that it would make the sport " more interesting
" " in my view , the future should indeed lie in some kind of budget cap under which each and every team could do what they want to , because we all have different strengths , " @entity8 , ceo of the @entity10 - based team , said in an interview with @entity3
" how much longer will it take for the big teams to understand that the smaller teams are just as important to @entity3 as the four big ones ? " prior to the season opener in @entity27 last month , @entity3 supremo @entity25 told the sport 's elite teams to cut their spending , while suggesting a mandatory budget cap could be introduced
" the teams have to learn to be competitive without tons of money
they have to refocus again on the basics -- on racing , spending on the sport -- and not on baronial motor homes and all kinds of entertainment , " @entity25 told @entity3
the division of prize money and television revenue in @entity3 is dictated by the @entity45 , a contract between the sport 's governing body , the @entity49 , the rights holders and the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) which is due to expire in 2013
@entity25 is keen to explore the possibility of restricting teams ' spending in the future
" i would welcome it , " he said
" yes , i think it could happen
we are in the middle of discussions ... they ( the teams ) want to get more money -- to be able to spend more ! " he said
@entity8 : the woman racing ahead in @entity3 @entity8 is hoping to see a " major step forward " soon
" when the current @entity45 comes to an end at the end of this season , i think it would be a good time to set some kind of rules , " she said
the @entity2 team has started the 2012 season impressively with 22 - year - old @entity76 driver @entity75 claiming second place behind @entity79 's @entity78 at the @entity81 @entity80
after what @entity8 described as " painful " second half to last season , she says the team is now settling down after the departure of manufacturer @entity87 at the end of 2009
" i certainly hope we can keep up this momentum ! i am pretty confident that we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can maintain this level , " she said .
