@entity0 -- no decision has been made on whether to change the current plan to hold the september 11 terrorist attack trial in a civilian court in lower @entity8 , @entity3 officials said sunday
last week , @entity10 mayor @entity9 and other politicians expressed concern over the costs and disruption of holding the trial of @entity16 and four accomplices at a @entity10 courthouse
@entity19 , the senior adviser to president @entity21 , and @entity3 press secretary @entity22 said sunday that @entity21 believes the trial should take place in a criminal court instead of before a military commission , as permitted for some terrorism suspects
however , @entity19 and @entity22 acknowledged that @entity21 and the @entity28 were considering moving the trial from @entity10
" we 've made no decisions on that yet , " @entity19 said on the @entity31 program " @entity32
" @entity22 , speaking on @entity1 's " @entity36 , " also said the location of the trial was under discussion , but he expressed certainty that @entity16 , the alleged mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , " is going to meet justice and he 's going to meet his maker
" @entity22 and @entity19 criticized @entity46 opposition to the plan to hold the trial in a criminal court , saying no one complained when the previous administration of @entity46 president @entity52 put terrorism suspects such as " shoe bomber " @entity55 on trial in @entity58 criminal courts
" now we have a @entity60 president and suddenly we hear these protests , " @entity19 said
" what has changed between now and then that would cause people to reverse positions ? " senate minority leader @entity66 , @entity67 , told the @entity1 program that the @entity52 administration was wrong to hold terrorism trials on @entity58 soil
instead , trials for dangerous terrorism suspects should be held by military commissions at the @entity76 , @entity77 , detention facility where they currently are held , @entity72 said
@entity21 intends to shut down the @entity76 facility by transferring the roughly 200 suspects to the @entity58 to stand trial or face indefinite detention , or to third countries
@entity72 said sunday he would fight that plan by trying to withhold federal spending for it
" ' i think that will be done on a bipartisan basis , " @entity72 said of congressional opposition , adding that " whatever domestic support they had for this is totally collapsing
" @entity3 officials say the decision about any possible alternate sites to try @entity16 and the others will come from the @entity28
@entity10 police estimated that the cost to the city would be more than $ 200 million per year in what could be a multi-year trial and that more than 2,000 checkpoints would need to be installed around @entity8
police commissioner @entity103 said additional protection would have to be deployed for the city , not just " the core area of @entity8
" @entity9 initially supported the move , saying " it is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the @entity110 where so many @entity10 were murdered
" however , @entity9 used different rhetoric last week when asked about a community agency 's proposals to relocate the trial , saying he would prefer the trial be held elsewhere , perhaps at a military base where it would be easier and cheaper to provide security
" it 's going to cost an awful lot of money and disturb a lot of people , " @entity9 said
on thursday , several @entity10 @entity60 politicians urged the @entity21 administration to thoroughly re-examine locating the trial in downtown @entity8
@entity127 , chairwoman of a city community advisory agency , proposed four alternative locations for the trial within the @entity131 : @entity132 , @entity133 in @entity134 , the @entity135 at @entity135 , and the @entity137 jail complex at @entity138
the latter three are in @entity141 , @entity10 , less than an hour from @entity10 , county executive @entity139 told @entity1
@entity142 thinks the trials should not be held anywhere in @entity10 , and definitely not in @entity141 , which lost 44 residents in the terror attacks , he said
" i 've contacted my legal department and i 'll tell you i 'll do whatever it takes to stop those trials from coming here , even if it means closing down our roads , " @entity142 said
" i 'll sue the federal government if need be
" @entity142 said he 'd be worried about the safety of @entity141 residents if the trial comes there
@entity142 , who shot down an offer from @entity134 to host the proceedings in their new courthouse , said the suspects should not be tried in civilian courts
but @entity134 mayor @entity165 said the boost in media presence and police funding during the trial would help his " very poor , very urban " city
@entity134 's new $ 22 million courthouse is safe and has " every security you could want , " @entity165 said
an alternate proposal at the @entity135 location has not been fully reviewed
a @entity135 spokesman said no one has officially requested a review of demands for such a trial , which would require in - depth study of legal and security concerns
@entity184 spokesman @entity183 said the @entity28 " can safely prosecute this case in the @entity131 while minimizing disruptions to the community to the greatest extent possible , consistent with security needs
" @entity10 gov. @entity191 will meet with the @entity192 on monday to discuss possible 9/11 trial locations in the state , @entity191 spokeswoman @entity190 told @entity1
@entity1 's @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report .
