@entity0 -- in the hours after the 1995 @entity4 bombing , law enforcement officials were searching for a dark - skinned @entity6 man in connection to the attack that killed 168 people , including 19 children
meanwhile , @entity11 , the real bomber , was getting away
following the 1996 bombing at the @entity13 , investigators and the media initially focused on a local security guard named @entity17
the real terrorist , @entity18 , who later admitted to planting the pipe bomb that killed two and injured 111 others , remained free until he was caught in 2003
and even in 2011 in @entity22 , when a bomb went off outside the prime minister 's office , killing eight people , followed by the shooting deaths of 69 people at a @entity29 youth camp , police immediately started looking for @entity30 or radical @entity31
days later , @entity32 , a white @entity22 , was arrested
he claimed the attacks were necessary to protect @entity22 from multiculturalism
in each case , the initial rush to judgment by law enforcement and the media may have distracted officials from the real perpetrator and caused unnecessary harm to individuals and ethnic groups who had nothing to do with the attacks
after monday 's bombing at the @entity50 , which left three dead and more than 170 others hurt , there had been initial reports of a @entity54 national being questioned
on tuesday , a @entity56 official told @entity1 that , " as of now " there was no foreign or @entity59 connection , but the investigation is ongoing
the @entity54 male in question was a spectator at the race , the official said
the man was injured and was running away because of his injury
he was stopped and authorities questioned him , but " it came up empty
he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time
" @entity69 , @entity1 contributor and former @entity56 assistant secretary for homeland security , cautioned against putting too much stock in the early reports of @entity76 involvement
" i 'm pretty cautious about stuff like this , remembering the @entity81 bombing when it was famously reported that four men in @entity76 garb were responsible for it , " said @entity69 on @entity77
" so that 's why i think it 's important to sort of be cautious on who are they interviewing yet , because the rumors tend to all merge together
and it 's important to just sort of let the story line figure out where it 's going and then let the forensics sort of lead to the suspects , " she said
the media has been guilty of making quick assumptions about possible culprits , especially in the aftermath of the @entity4 bombing and the @entity22 massacre
@entity104 , after the @entity4 bombing , bemoaned in the @entity105 the lack of commitment from @entity109 governments to stop @entity6 terrorism , saying it was essential " these @entity113 leaders and their public know that their countries will be held directly responsible for all attacks carried out by terrorists whom they help or harbor -- and that this decision has no expiration date , no statute of limitations
" in the @entity125 , @entity124 quoted others to help link the attacks in @entity22 to so - called @entity31 radicals
she pointed to @entity131 of the @entity132 who said , " there has been a lot of talk over the past few months on how we 've got @entity59 on the run and , compared with what it once was , it 's become a rump organization
" but as the attack in @entity143 reminds us , there are plenty of @entity59 allies still operating
no doubt cutting the head off a snake is important ; the problem is , we 're dealing with global nest of snakes
" but after the bombings in @entity154 , most major media so far have been cautious in reporting on who perpetrated the attacks , and federal officials , including the president , have been especially reluctant to blame the attack on foreign or domestic elements
" what we do n't yet know ... is who carried out this attack or why , whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization , foreign or domestic , or was the act of a malevolent individual , " president @entity164 said tuesday
" they want to be absolutely sure what they 're dealing with before kind of getting ahead of it " said @entity1 analyst @entity168 on @entity77 .
