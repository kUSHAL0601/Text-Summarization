during a recent visit to @entity2 , a traditional market in @entity4 , the @entity5 capital , a fresh meat refrigerator sat empty at a grocery
many consumers looking for beef , poultry or fish had to go home empty - handed
the produce section looked well stocked with plenty of fruits and vegetables
but consumers shopping at @entity2 complained that prices , even for basic products , had skyrocketed
@entity19 , a housewife and resident of @entity4 , went to the market looking for cornmeal to prepare hallacas , a traditional @entity5 dish , especially this time of the year
" it 's fundamental , because other than pork it 's the main dish for us during december , " @entity19 said
" it seems there 's a shortage
" @entity33 , another @entity4 resident doing her grocery shopping , complained that she could n't find powdered milk
" it 's regulated and you can only get a can per person
and so what people do is that they bring along a friend and another and yet another and that 's how they get enough for their family , " de @entity33 said
there 's also a shortage of coffee
as soon as new supplies arrive , shoppers say , they have to run to the store to get some because it runs out very quickly
@entity5 has the highest annual inflation in @entity54
it soared to 27.6 percent in november
in an effort to curb this inflation , the government set price caps on as many as 15,000 goods in late november
the price of 18 products , including toothpaste , soap and diapers , which are considered " basic , " was immediately frozen
@entity65 is in charge of the government agency that advocated for consumers
she says they 're doing everything possible to improve the situation
" the @entity75 government is working in coordination with all of the agencies responsible for food distribution to guarantee that there will be food available , " @entity65 said recently in an interview for @entity5 state television
@entity75 is a reference to the country 's official name , @entity84 of @entity5
@entity5 authorities blame the shortages on some producers who have allegedly hoarded regulated products
according to officials , in a raid conducted in november , they found more than 200 tons of powdered milk hidden in a warehouse
president @entity94 says this is an example of what his government has to deal with and places the blame on what he calls " speculators and hoarders
" " we have to get to the bottom of this
this is not about half measures or quick fixes
we have to apply the @entity110 to the root , the way it should be done , " @entity94 said , reacting to the case of the hidden powdered milk
@entity5 is not a poor country
it 's the thirteenth largest producer of oil in the world and an important producer of minerals
but @entity120 , director of the @entity121 at the @entity122 in @entity123 says the country is paying for the centralization of the government and a socialist agenda pushed by president @entity94
" his goal that he has stated is to deepen the revolution , to deepen and expand socialism and to show , i think , the country his vision of his socialist experiment , " @entity120 said
@entity136 , vice president of @entity137 , a @entity5 association that pulls together businesses , including many producers of basic goods , blames the new government price caps and regulations for the shortages
" people are doing panic buying
with these price caps , people are buying more than they need because they know many factories are not going to be able to produce their products
production has gone down because there are price caps , production is not cost - effective and we have these conditions that discourage investment , " @entity136 said
it 's not just ordinary people who are worried about the situation
under government guidelines published last month , producers of basic products , including foreign companies , must now register with government regulators and disclose how they produce , distribute and market their products , a move that has caused great concern among domestic and international companies operating in @entity5 .
