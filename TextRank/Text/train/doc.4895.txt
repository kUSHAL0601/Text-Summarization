-- the president of the @entity2 , one of the world 's most popular honeymoon destinations , resigned tuesday after a revolt by police officers , his spokesman said , leaving the normally idyllic chain of islands in chaos
@entity11 was the first democratically elected president of the @entity13 nation in three decades
" this morning , about 500 opposition supporters along with some @entity17 hardliners protested outside the army headquarters , shouting slogans , and some police officers mutinied and joined them , " @entity11 's spokeman said
" and so , the president was in a situation where he could either tell the army to forcibly crack down on the protesters or he could step down
" this is a situation where the first democratically elected president in the @entity2 is taken down by a former dictator and his supporters , " the spokesman said
@entity11 said in a nationally televised address that he was stepping down because he did n't feel he was able to maintain security and peace in the country , which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year
strategically located in the @entity13 but extremely poor , the country is threatened by rising sea levels
@entity11 once held a @entity39 meeting underwater , with ministers wearing scuba gear , to highlight the problem
vice president @entity43 was sworn in as president shortly after @entity11 resigned
but journalist @entity45 , who is at work on a book about the @entity2 , suggested @entity43 is a puppet who would not last
" he comes from a very small political party
he 's respected as an academic " but has little support of his own , @entity45 said
" i doubt how long they will allow this man to remain in power
" @entity45 said he felt the coup was " the end of democracy in the @entity2
it throws the whole notion of democracy out of the window
" and that is a cause for international concern , he said
" here was the country 's first democratically elected president and he was forced to resign by a cocktail of religious extremists , the brother of the former president ... forces like businessmen who are also members of @entity73 , and then the police force , which was always loyal to the former dictator , " he said
the police officers appeared to have sided with the @entity79 , which is loyal to former president @entity80 , who ruled @entity81 for 30 years before @entity11 defeated him
@entity11 had faced strong criticism in recent months from opposition groups calling for @entity17 to play a greater role in the running of the country , spurred in part by the supporters of @entity80
the country is more than 98 % @entity17 , according to a 2011 @entity91 report on the global muslim population
the coup signals a rise in extremism , @entity45 said
" it 's going from being one of the most moderate @entity17 nations on @entity99 towards extremism , " he said
the different political parties in the country , an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands south - southwest of @entity105 , planned to meet tuesday afternoon to discuss the next step , said @entity107 , a spokeswoman for the @entity79
in 2008 , @entity11 became the country 's first democratically elected president in 30 years
the nation was rocked by violent protests last year that @entity11 accused @entity80 's supporters of orchestrating
but demonstrators said at the time they were protesting economic conditions , created by reforms imposed by @entity11
the government also clashed with opposition groups in december over the issues of massage parlors and the sale of pork and alcohol in resorts
tuesday 's events unfolded after about 200 policemen gathered in @entity128 in the capital , @entity130 , according to @entity131 , an executive producer at the state tv station
a peaceful standoff with members of the @entity81 defense forces in the square turned violent early tuesday morning , he said , describing the situation in @entity130 as " chaos
" the policemen took over the state tv station later tuesday morning
they changed its name from the @entity144 back to its old name , @entity2
@entity80 is still considered a hero by many in @entity2 who credit him for transforming a fishing culture into a tourist nation
during his long rule , @entity11 was among his fiercest critics , alleging that @entity80 ruled with an iron fist , crushing dissent , amassing wealth and stacking his administration with friends and relatives
@entity11 was arrested as a journalist several times and held as a political prisoner
until his defeat by @entity11 , @entity80 won six previous elections as the only candidate on the ballot
he had sought a seventh five - year term , saying that he would need a few more years to see through the reforms he has put in place
@entity81 is also grappling with a very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels
most of it lies just 4.9 feet ( 1.5 meters ) above sea the @entity178 ' @entity177 has forecast a rise in sea levels of at least 7.1 inches ( 18 cm ) by the end of the century
male is already protected by sea walls
but creating a similar barrier around the rest of the country will be cost - prohibitive
soon after his election , @entity11 raised the possibility of finding a new homeland for the country 's approximately 400,000 residents
he is the subject of an upcoming documentary , " @entity197 , " that tells the story of his efforts to raise awareness of climate change
@entity0 's @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this report .
