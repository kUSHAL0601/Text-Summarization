-- @entity1 scored twice on his @entity3 debut as @entity5 's men thrashed @entity6 4 - 0 in their @entity8 opener monday
the @entity9 international had just come on as a second half substitute when he struck the second for @entity3
causing havoc in the @entity6 defense , @entity1 then cleverly set up @entity15 for the third
a thumping shot for the fourth rounded off a spectacular first match for @entity1 and completed a miserable night for promoted @entity6
@entity18 opened the scoring for the home side just before the hour mark after a goalless first half
the victory takes @entity3 joint top with @entity25 in the early standings as they attempt to wrest the @entity8 title from city rivals @entity29
@entity5 was delighted by @entity1 's performance , but warned he will improve
" i think he needs to recover as he only finished the @entity33 three weeks ago , " he told @entity31
" he needs another two to three weeks to be 100 % , maybe
for me he`s a fantastic striker , young , and he`s going to be a fantastic player for us
" the result was a little harsh on @entity39 ' @entity6 , who played neat and containing football in the first half , but their goalkeeper @entity43 was kept busy and @entity44 was denied by the woodwork as the home side pressed
in other @entity8 news monday , @entity48 striker @entity47 is to join @entity50 at @entity51 on a two - year deal
@entity47 , who is the the 10th - leading goal scorer in the history of the @entity8 , has been capped 110 times by the @entity55
he has fallen out of favor at @entity48 and spent the end of last season on loan at relegated @entity60
" i am delighted , honored and very excited to be joining the @entity51 , " @entity47 told their official web site
" i have always wanted to come and play in @entity63 so it 's the perfect combination for me and a dream come true
