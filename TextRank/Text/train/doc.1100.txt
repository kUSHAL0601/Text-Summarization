editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5
his new book , " @entity8 : the @entity9 -- from @entity11 to the @entity12 , " will be published in december by @entity10
@entity2 writes widely about current events
president @entity14 is taking a huge step in his presidency
after weeks of careful deliberation , the president has sided with military officials who have been pushing for an escalation of @entity22 forces in @entity23
explaining his objectives and exit strategy , @entity14 is expected to announce that he will be sending 30,000 troops , and possibly more , into the region
with this decision , @entity14 inches closer to becoming a wartime president
even though the @entity32 insists that they will continue to work hard on their domestic agenda , historically , presidents who become involved in protracted ground wars find that their presidencies are defined by their military conflicts
the politics that surround a military operation play an enormous role in the political success or failure of an administration
speaker @entity42 and many congressional @entity43 realize the human and political risks that come from this war
as news broke of president @entity14 's decision , @entity42 said : " the @entity22 people believe that if something is in our national security interest , we have to be able to afford it
that does n't mean that we hold everything else " stagnant because of those operations
but war sucks the political oxygen out of almost any presidency
there have been several modern presidents who started their term with an ambitious domestic vision and who ended up with their presidencies totally consumed by war
president @entity67 , who served from 1945 to 1953 , pulled off a historic upset in his reelection bid against @entity70 in 1948
in the campaign , @entity67 castigated a " do - nothing " @entity72
when he returned to the @entity32 after the election , @entity67 fought for an ambitious domestic agenda in 1949 and 1950 , which he called the @entity75 , which included national health care , civil rights , fair housing and more
while a conservative coalition of southern @entity43 and @entity81 in @entity72 defeated most of his proposals , it was the @entity83 , which began in the summer of 1950 , that brought down his presidency
when the military operations against @entity87 bogged down into a stalemate by 1951 , republicans ripped into the administration for refusing to use enough air power against the communists
@entity67 , whose approval ratings plummeted to 23 percent by 1952 , decided that he should not run for reelection
" if we had been less trusting , if we had been less soft and weak , there would probably have been no war in @entity87 ! " @entity81 candidate and military hero gen. @entity97 said on the campaign trail
republicans focused their campaign on @entity87 , @entity102 and corruption
the @entity43 nominee , @entity104 , lost ; republicans gained control of @entity72
president @entity107 was on the verge of becoming a transformative president in the winter of 1965
since taking office , @entity107 had presided over the passage of a sweeping body of domestic measures unequaled by almost any president in @entity22 history other than @entity117
his accomplishments included @entity119 and @entity120 , federal education assistance , civil rights and voting rights , environmental regulations , immigration reform and much more
yet all those accomplishments seemed to disappear in the political psyche after the " @entity128 " of the war in the spring of 1965 , when @entity107 authorized a vast increase of ground troops to @entity132
by 1968 , public opinion had turned against the war , with anti-war protesters organizing against " @entity136
" in the history books , @entity132 has swamped our memory of @entity107 's presidency and eclipsed much of what he accomplished in those early years
" that bitch of a war , " @entity107 lamented toward the end of his life , " killed the lady i really loved -- the @entity145
" most recently , there was the experience of president @entity152
during the 2000 campaign and in the early months of his presidency , @entity152 pushed for a type of " compassionate conservatism " that sought to extend certain kinds of government programs and establish the framework for a broad @entity81 coalition that captured the center and right
the @entity163 extended the reach of the federal government into the nation 's grade schools
after 9/11 , @entity152 led a successful operation to knock the @entity169 out of power in @entity23 and dramatically reorganized homeland security
but once @entity152 sent troops to @entity174 to bring down @entity175 in 2003 , the war came to dominate everything else
as the reconstruction of @entity174 proved to be much more difficult than the @entity32 anticipated , @entity152 's popularity plummeted
in 2006 , @entity43 took control of @entity72 and in 2008 @entity14 , on a platform defined by his opposition to @entity174 , was elected president
there are modern presidents who have balanced their agendas and preserved domestic policy as an integral part of their political identity even after having sent troops to war
this was the certainly the case with @entity117 who protected many of his domestic programs and even expanded government into new areas at home as the war unfolded
but @entity117 is an exception to the rule
soon @entity14 will be significantly expanding an existing military operation , making this war his own
in doing so , he will be risking a huge amount of his potential impact as a president
to make matters even worse , unlike @entity107 , @entity14 has had more trouble pushing much of his domestic agenda through @entity72
while he will very likely walk away from this year with a victory on health care , most of his agenda remains bottled up
it is easy to see how @entity23 can quickly grow in scale and scope
it would be a tragedy if a politician who headed a historic campaign based on the promise of extracting the @entity22 from a very unpopular war would wind up bogged down in a quagmire of his own
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .
