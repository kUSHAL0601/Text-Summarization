@entity0 -- a retired @entity3 general said thursday that the @entity5 policy of allowing openly gay soldiers to serve in its military led , in part , to its failure to halt the massacre of @entity11 in the @entity13 town of @entity14 in 1995
after the collapse of the @entity33 in 1991 , " nations like @entity25 , @entity26 , the @entity5 , et cetera , firmly believed there was no longer a need for an active combat capability in the militaries , " @entity15 , former supreme allied commander - @entity16 , told a @entity19 hearing on the do n't ask , do n't tell policy under which gays are not allowed to serve in the @entity3 military openly
" as a result , they declared a peace dividend and made a conscious effort to socialize their military , " he said
" that includes the unionization of their militaries
it includes open homosexuality demonstrated in a series of other activities , with a focus on peacekeeping operations , because they did not believe the @entity51 were going to attack again or the @entity33 were coming back
" that led to a force that was ill - equipped to go to war
the case in point that i 'm referring to is when the @entity5 were required to defend @entity14 against the @entity58
the battalion was under - strength , poorly led , and the @entity58 came into town , handcuffed the soldiers to the telephone poles , marched the @entity11 off and executed them , " @entity15 said
" that was the largest massacre in @entity65 since @entity66 " asked whether @entity5 leaders had told him that the @entity5 military 's performance was linked to its gay soldiers , he said , " yes
... they included that as part of the problem
" he was referring to the incident that began july 11 , 1995 , when @entity77 forces overran the @entity83 " safe zone " of @entity14 and systematically executed men and boys while expelling the rest of the @entity11 population
in all , 8,000 @entity13 muslims were killed
asked which @entity5 officers had told him that the debacle at @entity14 was in part due to the fact that gay soldiers serve in the @entity5 army , @entity15 cited a " @entity91 , " whom he described as " the chief of staff of the army who was fired by the parliament because they could n't find anybody else to blame
" a spokeswoman for the @entity100 in @entity0 said @entity5 officials did not know to whom @entity15 was referring
a former general , @entity102 , is identified in news reports as having served as @entity5 chief of defense staff from 1994 - 1998
@entity1 was not able to reach him
in a statement issued after the hearing , sen. @entity109 , @entity110 , chairman of the @entity111 , said , " @entity14 was an unconscionable massacre , but it 's way off the mark to attribute it in any way to the fact that gays can serve openly in the @entity5 military , which failed to protect @entity14 's citizens
" i know of no historian or commentator who has attributed this massive failure to protect the citizens of @entity14 to @entity5 policy on gays serving openly in their military
the @entity3 military serves side by side with the @entity5 in @entity131 without any difficulty whatsoever
" in a written statement , the @entity5 ambassador to the @entity3 , @entity133 , said of @entity15 's comments , " i could n't disagree more
" i take pride in the fact that lesbians and gays have served openly and with distinction in the @entity5 military forces for decades , including in leading operational positions , such as in @entity131 at the moment , " she said
" the military mission of @entity5 @entity83 soldiers at @entity14 has been exhaustively studied and evaluated , nationally and internationally
there is nothing in these reports that suggests any relationship between gays serving in the military and the mass murder of @entity153
" @entity15 , who retired from the military in 1997 , told the @entity111 that he opposed a proposal to let gays serve openly in the @entity3 military
the @entity157 submitted testimony to the committee that said " scientific research has demonstrated that ending the ban on openly gay people serving in the military is unlikely to reduce military readiness or unit cohesion
" it said the gay ban was suspended during the @entity168 with no apparent detrimental impact on military readiness
