-- the @entity2 on saturday quarantined an international flight in @entity4 after a passenger became ill on the plane , authorities said
@entity7 from @entity8 , @entity9 , touched down at @entity10 at 12:15 p.m. @entity2 quarantine officers met the plane after one of the 255 passengers was vomiting on the flight , officials said
the passengers were released at 1:50 p.m. and permitted to go through customs , said @entity19 , a @entity20 and @entity4 spokesperson
the sick passenger and his daughter were taken to a hospital for evaluation
passengers said it took another two hours to clear customs and retrieve their luggage
the incident comes amid heightened concerns after @entity32 , who had recently arrived from @entity33 , on tuesday was confirmed as the first case of the deadly ebola virus diagnosed on @entity37 soil
@entity32 arrived in the @entity37 after a connection in @entity8
the possibility of a new case was knocked down later saturday by the @entity4 @entity41
in a statement , it said that @entity48 " in coordination with federal , state and local public health officials evaluated two individuals who arrived " saturday afternoon
" the symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another , minor treatable condition unrelated to @entity54 , " the health department said
" the second individual , who was traveling with the patient , was asymptomatic
" the health department said that both passengers will be let go and " self - monitoring , " meaning they 'll be in charge of gauging their health
this statement appears to close the book on this situation , from the health department 's perspective
but it was a very different story just a few hours earlier
@entity2 officials removed the man and his daughter while other passengers remained on board
the two passengers were escorted by @entity2 officials in hazmat gear
@entity75 said the response was standard procedure with sick passengers , but it was unclear how long the protocol has been in place
" they were wearing masks and gloves on the plane , " said a passenger from @entity83 who identified himself only as @entity84
they came with whole suits like you see on tv everyday in @entity94
" passenger @entity95 told @entity0 he was sitting next to the sick man
" he nudged me and asked me to get the flight attendant , " @entity95 said
the man told him , " i need a flight attendant
i 've never felt this way before
" according to @entity95 , a flight attendant asked the man where he was traveling from
" immediately they both left and some time passed and they came back and asked him for his name , " @entity95 said of the flight attendants
" he handed them his passport
they came back with white masks and asked [ the man and his daughter ] to put them on
" the sick passenger and the girl were taken to the back of the plane , @entity95 said
the plane landed about an hour and a half later
an announcement was made about a sick passenger
people were asked to stay in their seats
more than an hour passed
" they told us they were waiting on the @entity2 and everyone realized the gravity of the situation , " @entity95 said
nearly two hours after the flight landed , @entity95 said , an announcement was made : " everyone can leave
" passengers were given forms to fill out so that the @entity2 can follow up with them
they were handed an information sheet with @entity54 symptoms
" we did get an announcement from a representative of the @entity2 that we were held as an abundance of caution , " @entity95 said
@entity95 and other passengers were critical of the response
" my concern is , if this were something that were highly contagious , we did not seem to have a very good reaction plan , " he said
" we seemed very uncoordinated at the airport
i hope we learn from it
" passenger @entity157 , a talk show host from @entity160 , @entity161 , said the man did not initially show signs of illness
" he did n't seem sick and then all of sudden i saw them taking him out , " he recalled
" he looked strong but they say he was vomiting
" @entity157 said he had spoken with the man and his daughter before the flight left @entity33
" he was lively , " @entity157 said
" his daughter was very inquisitive
she asked so many questions
apparently , it was her first time flying
" the man and his daughter were taken to @entity48 , where the emergency room will not accept anyone else for four hours , @entity0 affiliate @entity173 reported
in a statement this week , the @entity2 said quarantine inspectors meet arriving aircraft and ships reporting ill passengers or crew to assist them in getting appropriate medical treatment
the agency @entity2 has a network of quarantine stations at 20 ports of entry and land - border crossings
" if the flight crew of a commercial aircraft arriving in the @entity37 becomes aware of an ill person on board which may include a person with @entity54 symptoms , the captain is required required by law ... to report the illness to the nearest @entity37 quarantine station , who will arrange the appropriate medical response at the flight 's destination airport , " the statement said
can you catch @entity54 on a plane ? on saturday , @entity2 director dr. @entity205 addressed the growing concerns about the deadly disease
" we have already gotten well over 100 inquiries of possible patients , " @entity205 told reporters
" we 've assessed every one of those ... and just this one patient has tested positive ... we expect that we will see more rumors or concerns or possibilities of cases , until there is a positive laboratory test , that is what they are
" how the ebola virus spreads @entity0 's @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .
