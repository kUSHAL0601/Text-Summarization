@entity0 -- two @entity4 flags that were taken from the @entity5 are now in the @entity4 and are expected to be returned to the @entity6 friday , a law enforcement official tells @entity1
the @entity6 said they believe a pair of @entity10 artists took the flags and replaced them with two white flags late on july 21 , the official added
the white banners were spotted early in the morning on july 22 by construction workers
at the time of the stunt , many @entity0 wondered whether it represented an act of terrorism or an anti-american statement
but the artists , @entity21 and @entity22 , said the replacement of the @entity4 flags with two massive white flags last month was nothing more than an " art project " by the two performance artists meant to deal with " questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere
" the investigation into the incident is ongoing , and it 's still unclear what , if any , charges the artists will face , according to the official
the artists dubbed the project " @entity40 , " saying that " like an empty canvas , @entity40 invites many readings , multiple interpretations and projections
" @entity21 and @entity22 also stressed they " were careful to treat the bridge and the flags with respect and followed the @entity48
" " @entity40 " was meant in part as a tribute to the @entity10 - born @entity4 architect of the @entity5 , @entity54 , who left @entity10 in 1831 " in search of a better future in the land of freedom and opportunity , " the artists ' statement said
as part of the investigation after the switch , intelligence analysts looked into any possible significance of the day that was chosen to see whether that would yield clues
the date turned out to be the 145th anniversary of @entity54 's death
the @entity5 opened in 1883 and at that time was the longest suspension bridge , according to the @entity0 @entity73 .
