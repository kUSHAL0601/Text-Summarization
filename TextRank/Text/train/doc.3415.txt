-- two stories of @entity2 -- one about its sometimes perverse capacity for reinvention , the other about the most tragic period in the country 's history -- were among the leaders thursday for the nominations for the @entity12
" @entity13 , " a story about con artists based loosely on the late 1970s @entity17 scandal , tied for the lead with 10 nominations
the movie was nominated in several major categories , including picture , director ( @entity23 ) , actor ( @entity25 ) , actress ( @entity27 ) , supporting actor ( @entity28 ) , supporting actress ( @entity29 ) and adapted screenplay
and " 12 years a slave , " based on @entity36 's 19th - century narrative about being taken from freedom into slavery , earned nine nods , including picks for best picture , best director ( @entity39 ) , best actor ( @entity40 ) , best supporting actor ( @entity41 ) and best supporting actress ( @entity42 )
" this has been an amazing ride , and to receive nine nominations from the academy is testament to all of the hard work
and for that i am truly grateful , " @entity39 said
the complete list of nominees " gravity , " about a space mission gone wrong , also received 10 nominations , including picks for best picture , best director ( @entity55 ) and best actress ( @entity53 )
" i am particularly moved by @entity53 's nomination , " said @entity55 in a statement
" she is the heartbeat of our film
i thank her for her grace , her trust and her dedication to finding the truth of this character
" the academy nominated nine films for best picture overall
they are " @entity13 , " " @entity74 , " " @entity75 , " " gravity , " " her , " " @entity78 , " " @entity79 , " " @entity80 " and " @entity81
" @entity0 @entity83 ballot : make your choices , share your picks " @entity81 of @entity94 " had divided critics -- and , more to the point , industry audiences -- with its relentless depiction of hedonism among financial traders in 1990s @entity93
in one instance , according to a story that quickly gained currency in @entity98 , an academy member heckled director @entity100 after a screening
but @entity83 sided with the film , giving it five nominations , all in big categories : best picture , best director , best actor ( @entity109 ) , best supporting actor ( @entity111 ) and best adapted screenplay ( @entity113 )
5 things we learned from @entity83 nominations love for ' @entity75 ' there was also good news for " @entity75 , " the story of an hiv - positive man in the 1980s who rallies others to battle the @entity123 crisis
the low - budget film , which cost $ 5 million , received six nominations , tying it with " @entity78 " and " @entity74
" @entity126 , who won a @entity127 for a performance that required him to lose 45 pounds , was among the best actor nominees
the film was also nominated for best supporting actor ( @entity132 , another @entity127 winner ) and best original screenplay , along with best picture
the academy also smiled on director @entity137 , a two - time oscar winner whose films include " @entity139 , " " @entity140 " and " about @entity141
" his " @entity78 , " the story of a curmudgeon and his son who make a trip to the @entity153 in the possible vain pursuit of a sweepstakes prize , included nominations for picture , director , original screenplay , supporting actress ( @entity146 ) and best actor
the last went to 77 - year - old film veteran @entity156 , whose only other nomination was for 1978 's " @entity158
" another sleeper , " @entity79 , " received nominations for picture , adapted screenplay and star @entity162 as well as music ( original score )
as expected , @entity165 also was nominated for best actress as a modern - day @entity167 in " @entity169
" she already has won the @entity127 ( drama ) , @entity171 and @entity172 for her role in the @entity175 film
the tireless @entity176 was recognized yet again by the academy , receiving a best actress nomination for " august : @entity179
" it 's @entity176 's 18th nomination
she has three wins , for " @entity182 , " " @entity183 " and " @entity184
" @entity185 , @entity187 missing but not everyone ended up touched by @entity83 's golden glow
perhaps the biggest shocker was the lack of a nomination for @entity185 , who pretty much carries " @entity74 " as the titular seaman
the film did receive nominations for best picture , best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor ( for former limo driver and @entity199 native @entity198 ) , but neither @entity185 nor director @entity200 ended up with nods
( it also was nominated for film editing , sound editing and sound mixing
) @entity185 ' other major film , " saving mr. @entity209 , " was almost entirely snubbed
though @entity211 was nominated for a @entity127 for her portrayal of " @entity214 " author @entity213 , the academy overlooked her in the best actress race , and the film failed to earn a best picture nomination
@entity187 and the film she starred in , " @entity220 , " also came up empty
and @entity221 was expected to make a run at best actor for his almost wordless performance in " @entity225 , " about a lone sailor lost at sea when his boat is damaged
but the 77 - year - old actor did n't get a nomination
@entity231 , which once a sure thing in the animated feature category , was left off the nominations list again
the nominees for best animated feature are " @entity237 , " " @entity238 , " " @entity239 , " " @entity240 " and " @entity241
" @entity242 promises fun again as @entity83 host the @entity83 race now shapes up as a battle between " @entity247 " and " 12 years
" both have their critics
for all the praise " @entity247 " has received -- including a @entity127 for best musical or comedy film -- it 's been called slick and hammy
@entity39 's " 12 years " ( which received the @entity127 for best drama ) has fewer naysayers , but even those who liked the film noted it 's difficult to watch
@entity258 's @entity257 described it as " overpowering , " and admitted she was having a hard time finding critical distance from the film 's portrayal of brutality
awards season : does diversity matter more than wins ? " @entity267 " could sneak in
like " 12 years , " it has a high - minded subject the @entity83 tend to like , and @entity126 and @entity132 have been widely touted for their performances
" gravity " may be a longer shot for best picture , but @entity55 's amazing direction -- juggling state - of - the - art , computer - generated imagery with moving performances by @entity53 and @entity278 -- has been greatly admired
of course , as much as the @entity83 is about designating the best of @entity98 , it 's also supposed to be an entertaining show
this year , @entity242 returns as host , and given a short ad shown just before the nominations announcement -- which featured @entity286 dancing through a back lot accompanied by a growing army of tuxedoed dancers -- it could be a lot of fun
the 86th @entity83 will air march 2 from @entity98 's @entity291
the show will be on @entity293
