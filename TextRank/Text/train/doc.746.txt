-- a rising @entity3 folk singer was killed by coyotes this week in a national park in @entity6 , a park spokesman said thursday
@entity7 , 19 , was at the beginning of the @entity9 in @entity10 on tuesday afternoon when she was attacked , according to @entity12 , the @entity14 field unit superintendent for @entity10
@entity12 said hikers saw the coyotes attacking @entity7 and called 911
she was airlifted to a hospital in @entity19 , where she died about 12 hours later , he said
@entity7 was recently nominated for @entity22 honors by @entity23
she was touring the @entity26 and had a break between gigs to go hiking tuesday , her manager , @entity24 , said in an e-mail
" she loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity , " she wrote
" words ca n't begin to express the sadness and tragedy of losing such a sweet , compassionate , vibrant , and phenomenally talented young woman , " @entity24 said
" her warmth , loving nature , astounding artistry , and infectious enthusiasm will be so missed and forever remembered
" read more about who @entity7 was @entity7 , who was originally from the @entity45 in @entity46 , lived in @entity47 , @entity24 said
@entity12 said the area where the attack occurred is popular and well traveled
it remained closed , and park authorities had shot one coyote believed to be involved
a pathologist will test the animal 's body for diseases that might have triggered the attack , he said
searches for other aggressive animals in the park continue , he said
" public safety is our primary concern , " he said
he said no other coyote attacks had ever occurred in the park
" we 've had coyotes approach people too closely , " he said , and about six years ago one nipped a person
that animal was killed because of " lack of fear , " he said
but tuesday 's attack is " unprecedented and a totally isolated incident , " he said
in a written statement , @entity74 described her daughter as " a seasoned naturalist and well versed in wilderness camping
she loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity
tragically it was her time to be taken from us so soon
" we take a calculated risk when spending time in nature 's fold -- it 's the wildlife 's terrain , " @entity74 's statement continued
" when the decision had been made to kill the pack of coyotes , i clearly heard @entity7 's voice say , ' please do n't , this is their space
' she would n't have wanted their demise , especially as a result of her own
she was passionate about animals , was an environmentalist , and was also planning to volunteer at the @entity105 in the coming months
" send your stories , photos of @entity7 @entity109 , @entity7 's producer for her debut album , " @entity7 , " said the singer was a " brilliant and beautiful light that people were naturally drawn to
" " she was so young and talented
her big dreams were a perfect match with her big , kind heart
" he said he and his family would soon be organizing a celebration of her life
coyote attacks on humans are extremely rare , said @entity124 , wildlife manager of furbearers and upland game for @entity6
it is " not expected or normal behavior , " he said , although he said there had been aggressive incidents in @entity6 before , but no deaths
illness , injury and familiarity with humans can affect an animal 's behavior , he said .
