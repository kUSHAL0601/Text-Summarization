@entity0 -- at the stroke of midnight friday , the good music and bad jokes of @entity4 fell silent
@entity7 broadcasters who pumped out tunes , wisecracks and information to their fellow @entity13 military personnel in @entity4 formally turned off their microphones after eight years
" this is the radio station for our troops , and you know we are sad to see it go , " said @entity7 staff sgt. @entity15 , one of the station 's disc jockeys , before the final broadcast
" but at the same time , this piece is part of the big transformation that is going to happen over here -- so some sadness and some excitement as well
" so exciting that @entity15 , from @entity30 , was up even earlier than usual -- 3:30 a.m. -- ready for a long day with his listeners
" this station has been in @entity4 for the troops the entire time , and this is their outlet to back home , " he said
the closing of the station is just the latest visible evidence of the deliberate , phased withdrawal of @entity13 troops from @entity4 , all pointing toward an end - of the - year deadline
with the withdrawal clock ticking , the @entity13 continues to talk with @entity43 about leaving some @entity13 forces behind for training and security
but @entity47 is over and out
" the security agreement reached back in 2008 calls for all @entity13 forces to be out of @entity4 by december 31 , and we are operating consistent with that guidance , " said one of the officers in charge , lt. col. @entity51
" so tonight will be our last night as @entity56 here in @entity58
" the unit 's motto is " serving those who serve , " @entity51 said
" we all ca n't wait till the 31st of december to board planes , so some of that transition has to start now
the soldiers of @entity58 have certainly done their part in bringing to a close this chapter
" the station went on the air in december 2003 , and the first song was @entity73 's " freedom
" the transmitters will stay in place for now , but music and news will come from @entity78
@entity15 said he thought long and hard about exactly how to sign off
" i 'm just going to say my thanks , " he said friday by video link provided by the @entity80
" i 'm not going to make it too complicated
" in recent weeks , the station 's djs asked their listeners for how to end the final broadcast
a @entity88 poll narrowed it down to five songs : @entity91 : " @entity92 " @entity93 " @entity94 : " @entity95 " @entity96 : " home " @entity98 : " @entity99 " the final selection was revealed at midnight : @entity91 's " @entity92
" @entity15 and his fellow radio jocks know they are part of a long line of other broadcasters in uniform
they have a special place of honor for " @entity111 " radio dj @entity110 , who came on friday 's show for an interview
" absolutely ! there is not a military broadcaster who does n't know who @entity110 is and the things he was able to accomplish and the lasting impact he had on military journalists and @entity47 radio stations around the world , " @entity15 said
@entity110 's signature sign - in " @entity111 " became part of that era , and the movie inspired generations of broadcasters like @entity15 to sign up
" i feel like we are part of an evolved set of broadcasters throughout the years , " @entity15 said
" we really do think we are part of that military journalism corps , i would say , passed down from those folks in @entity136 all the way back to @entity138 so we know we are just part of that legacy just as much as anyone else
" part of that legacy , reinforced by @entity110 and others , is to go right to the brink
" my morning show , we push the limits as far as we possibly can to make the troops laugh , and if we do n't get a complaint from somebody , you know , with some real rank on them every now and then , we do n't feel we are pushing the envelope far enough to give the troops a real sense of a real radio station they would be listening to back in the states , " @entity15 said
both he and the brass were counting down to the goodbye friday
said @entity15 , " to be here at the end of that chapter -- too surreal
