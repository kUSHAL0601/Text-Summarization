-- speculation has been rampant over what exactly has happened to @entity4 leader @entity3
after all , @entity3 has n't been seen in public in over a month , and the country 's media took the unusual step of admitting that @entity3 is in an " uncomfortable physical condition
" some commentators believe this suggests @entity3 might be more seriously ill than the country is letting on
but others have speculated something more dramatic might have occurred -- namely a coup
does the evidence back this up ? the short answer is , no. for a start , there have been no unusual military or troop movements inside @entity4 , particularly tied to the @entity23 defense command or other key military units
on top of this , just this past weekend , @entity25 - so -- political director for the @entity27 , and widely seen as the second most powerful man in @entity4 -- and former @entity27 political director @entity28 made a surprise visit to @entity33 for the end of the @entity35
the visiting officials brought with them a surprise : an informal offer from @entity3 to immediately resume high - level talks between @entity40
it is difficult to imagine that a regime facing an intense internal crisis or power struggle would dispatch two top political and military figures to @entity33 , and make an offer in @entity3 's name , if there really were a silent power struggle going on back in @entity23
finally , it was reported that all the achievements of the @entity4 athletes at the recently concluded games were attributed to @entity3 , with lectures given to workers on october 4 titled " the faith and consideration of marshal @entity3 for the athletes and workers
" clearly , the regime is still placing @entity3 at the center of its propaganda
is @entity3 's sister in charge ? absent any sort of evidence of military upheaval or unusual political activity , the only way this could be a coup is if it were completely invisible , a very unusual sort of coup indeed
true , talk of coups against successive @entity3 regimes has been a staple of @entity4 - watching for decades
but the legitimacy of @entity4 's rulers has been centered on the @entity3 family since the country was founded , some seven decades ago
a coup would therefore not only have to physically replace @entity3 , but provide some sort of justification and legitimation for such action to the @entity4 people
the role of the @entity3 family in @entity4 is typically misunderstood as a " cult of personality , " but the reality is more complex than that
in fact , one reason the @entity4 regime has proved so durable is that it is grafted onto deep @entity4 social and cultural roots
in contrast to many other communist regimes that attempted to wipe away the past , the @entity4 regime built its legitimacy on the basic idea that @entity100 is the " true " @entity4 , the only defender of the @entity4 nation from its enemies
is @entity3 still in charge of @entity4 ? with this view in mind , the @entity3 family did not try to wipe out many of the existing cultural or social features of @entity4 life , but instead embraced them ( in an admittedly warped way )
for example , the @entity111 adopted the @entity115 scholar 's brush -- perhaps the most obvious representation of traditional @entity4 -- as part of its official iconography
the party also encouraged its women to wear traditional @entity4 dress as often as possible , another link to its past
but most important of all has been the use of the traditional @entity4 extended family as the basis of @entity4 political rule
@entity4 is a clan - based , familial society , and @entity100 simply melded himself -- and his son and grandson -- onto the entire country as patriarch
@entity3 's son and grandson have continued this patriarchal approach : activities such as " on the scene guidance , " and other personal interventions by @entity3 have emphasized the personal link between the @entity3 family and their citizens
of course this effort at legitimation is warped and repressive
but it has also resonated with many @entity4
all this suggests that while internal collapse is quite possible -- even likely -- if the @entity3 family itself should come apart , a coup by someone outside the family appears unlikely to succeed
@entity3 's absence from celebrations marking the founding of the @entity111 on october 10 would certainly raise eyebrows
but right now , without any kind of concrete evidence , speculation that there might have been a coup looks misplaced
@entity3 may be sick or even have had surgery
but he is also almost certainly still in power .
