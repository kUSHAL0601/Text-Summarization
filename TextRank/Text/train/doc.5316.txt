-- the last time you flew , did you wonder what 's really going on behind that closed cockpit door ? who 's actually flying the plane ? is it a human being , or capt. @entity9 ? based on its record , @entity10 leads the commercial airline industry in safety
and for most passengers , that information alone provides all the confidence in the world
but there will always be nervous fliers who need to know : who are they trusting with their lives , human or machine ? " there are millions of people out there who are under the impression that the airplane is flying itself and the pilots are only there in case something goes wrong , " says @entity25 , a 22 - year veteran commercial pilot who blogs about airline issues
this , says @entity25 , is the big lie
it 's true that airline computers and electronic control systems allow pilots to fly " hands off " beginning soon after takeoff , continuing through the flight route and -- in very rare cases -- all the way through touchdown
but @entity25 says that does n't mean the planes fly themselves
one day , @entity25 was flying as a passenger when that false impression really hit him square in the face
the airliner glided to a particularly smooth landing , and a " smart @entity55 " seated a few rows behind @entity25 shouted , " @entity54 job , autopilot ! " " everybody around us started cackling , " @entity25 said
" while it was funny , it was wrong
and i knew that he meant it
" even capt. @entity63 enjoyed the backup of computer autopilot during his famous " miracle on the @entity68 " emergency landing three years ago
@entity63 was in the pilot 's seat when his @entity71 collided with a flock of geese and lost thrust 2,700 feet over @entity74
computer - assisted flight systems were active , @entity63 said , but there was no need for them
" we never got to the extremes where [ flight control computers ] would have protected us " from pointing the plane 's nose too high , or going too fast or too slow , he told @entity0 last week
" we did n't need any of it
" in fact , flight control computers actually hindered the landing , said @entity63 , who 's now a @entity89 aviation and safety consultant
flight software prevented him from keeping the plane 's nose a little higher during the last four seconds before he ditched @entity93 in the icy @entity68
" so we hit harder than we would have , had we been able to keep the nose up , " he said
" that was a little - known part of the software that no airline operators or pilots knew about
" of course , most passengers never experience that kind of emergency
during a normal flight , there 's no way to know when your pilots are using computer - programmed automatic flight systems
@entity25 described what goes on behind the cockpit 's closed door
hands - on flying has n't disappeared , he said -- it 's just different
for example , setting up and executing an automatic descent has changed
" in the old days , you had your hand on the wheel and you pushed the nose down and adjusted the power accordingly , " he said
" now , you 've got to hold a different set of buttons and dials and switches , but in the end , you 're still doing the same thing -- you 're still flying the plane
" " none of it is easy , " he said
" in a lot of ways , it 's more difficult because airplanes are so much more complex now
" sure , there 's a lot of " hands - off " time , but there are also many tasks that surround the management of the airplane and its computerized systems
" you 're utilizing a different skill set
" some fear that airliner pilots rely too much on autopilot technology , saying that such a reliance leads to lack of practice and infrequent use of manual piloting skills
experts have suggested this may have been a factor in the mysterious @entity154 crash of @entity155 from @entity156 to @entity157 , which killed 228 passengers and crew
as technology becomes more and more sophisticated -- and trusted -- an expert at the @entity162 says commercial airliners could one day be piloted by remote control
" we fly many unmanned air vehicles around the world today , mainly for military or small airplane applications , " said @entity165 , a professor of aeronautics and astronautics , and head of the @entity169 , at @entity162
" at a technical level , there 's no reason why we could n't do that with a commercial airplane
" far - fetched ? @entity165 is n't the only one in the airline community talking about this
at an aeronautical conference last august , @entity180 , a @entity181 president and ceo , announced that a " pilotless airliner is going to come ; it 's just a question of when
you 'll see it in freighters first , over water probably , landing very close to the shore , " according to @entity190
the idea wo n't be widely accepted until at least a couple of generations from now , said @entity165 , who 's also a licensed private pilot
but experts are already planning how it might work
there are two basic academic models
in one , pilots would fly airliners by remote control from " cockpits " on the ground -- just as pilots currently fly predator military drones over @entity205 and along the @entity10 - @entity207 border
" there 's another model where you might have a flight attendant sufficiently trained , " said @entity165 , to act as a backup pilot on automated or remote - controlled airliners
yes , you read that right
there 's an idea out there to have backup pilots who also serve passengers peanuts and tomato juice
" there are people who discuss that , " @entity165 said
" i do n't know if that 's particularly realistic
" frustration is the word @entity25 uses to describe this kind of talk from " aerospace academics , researchers , professors , consultants and other smart people who often have a very limited grasp of the day - to - day operational realities of commercial flying
" that 's not to sound arrogant , @entity25 said , " but it 's a theoretical discussion for researchers and scientists , and it 's not anything with any practical application at this point
" " it 's wrong on so many levels that it 's hard to get my arms around it and explain , " he said with exasperation
" and for what ? you 'd still need human beings to operate these planes remotely
thus , i 'm not sure what the benefit of this would be in terms of cost
" cost might actually be an argument against it
building necessary infrastructure would cost hundreds of billions of dollars , @entity25 said
it 's like saying we should get rid of surgeons in the operating room because of advances in medical technology , he said
" i think there 's something about flying that brings out this remote - control fantasy in people , " said @entity25
" i do n't exactly know where it comes from
" as @entity162 's @entity165 explained it , pilotless airliners would simply be the end result of the current evolution of flight deck staffing
here 's what he means : improved technology has contributed to shrinking cockpit staff
according to @entity165 , before the @entity181 757 began service in the 1980s , most large airliners had a standard flight deck staff of three
they were the pilot , co-pilot and a flight engineer who managed pressurization , heating , fuel and pneumatic systems
then , @entity165 said , " those systems became automated , and the standard flight deck crew went from three to two
" going from two to one pilot would be a difficult threshold for the airline community to cross
two onboard pilots allow for a safety net -- a redundancy , he said -- to ensure sound judgment calls and to protect against possible incapacitation of the pilot -- for example in case of sickness or an accident
but going from two to zero is another thing altogether
" it 's not clear that anybody would want to ride on an airplane that does n't have a crew on board , " @entity165 said
would @entity165 ? no. " not at this point , " he said
no matter how trustworthy the technology becomes , @entity165 said remote - controlled airliners will never become reality without widespread public acceptance
but he does n't rule out that possibility
" you have to remember , nobody thinks twice about getting onto an automated train , for example , at the airport
" this is n't all conjecture , though
to be sure , unmanned aircraft are coming soon to airspace near you
in fact , it may not be long before you see remote - controlled drones flying over your neighborhood
the @entity335 plans to begin flight testing and writing rules aimed at integrating unmanned aircraft into the national airspace system as soon as 2015
some of these might include flying drones with sophisticated cameras like the @entity343 , which can be used for police search and rescue , or unmanned crop - dusters
by 2018 , the nation 's unmanned aircraft could number more than 15,500 , according to industry projections
aerospace contractor @entity350 is developing an unmanned combat jet the size of a fighter plane
if successful , the @entity354 would claim two firsts for an unmanned jet : in - flight fueling capability , and launch and landing aboard @entity361 aircraft carriers
for @entity63 -- perhaps the nation 's most famous pilot -- the idea of remote - controlled airliners triggers a lot of critical questions
he speculated about what might have happened to @entity93 after it collided with the geese if the plane had been controlled by a remote pilot
" what if the geese damaged whatever forward viewing devices there were -- such as cameras or infrared or radar ? what if the damage prevented the operator from seeing the river ? or seeing the plane 's height above the river ? " how would the operator be able to land the plane safely ? " on every airplane i 've ever flown , i tend to use the technology to its full capabilities when it 's appropriate , " @entity63 said
" but looking as far into the future as i can see , every airplane -- no matter how sophisticated -- really needs to be flown , and flown very well , by a human pilot
