@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge has delayed the preliminary hearing for dr. @entity5 , charged in @entity7 's death , until early next year because more investigation is being done and some prosecution witnesses wo n't be available until then
the hearing , in which prosecutors will try to convince the judge there is probable cause to hold a trial , was expected to start in october
@entity5 sat silently in front of the judge at monday 's court appearance , while @entity7 's elderly parents watched from the second row
judge @entity19 said he " wanted to expedite " the case , but he understands it will take more time for each side to prepare
the preliminary hearing , which is estimated to take two or three weeks , is now scheduled to start on january 4 , @entity19 said
dozens of @entity7 fans , angry about the pop star 's death , gathered outside the courthouse monday
a handful of them were allowed inside to witness the proceedings
@entity5 is charged with involuntary manslaughter in @entity7 's death , which the @entity37 coroner ruled was from an overdose of propofol , a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep
@entity5 , hired as @entity7 's personal doctor while the singer rehearsed for his comeback concerts , admitted giving him propofol as a sleep aid
but @entity5 's lawyer said the amount was much smaller than what was found in @entity7 's body during the autopsy
" the fact [ of the way ] that he died was a mystery a year ago , and still is , " @entity53 attorney @entity51 told @entity2 in an exclusive interview recently
members of @entity7 's family have attended each hearing since @entity5 's arrest in february
when brother @entity62 left the last hearing in june , he indicated some of them were not satisfied with the case against @entity5
" dr. @entity5 's the fall guy , " @entity62 said after the hearing
" this is bulls -- t. " @entity1 authorities announced last month that seven other doctors and a nurse who treated @entity7 will not face criminal prosecution in connection with the singer 's death
pastor denied a request by the state medical board to order @entity5 to stop practicing medicine as a condition of his bond while he awaits trial
his lawyer said he has no @entity1 patients , although he continues to treat patients in @entity89 and @entity90
@entity7 fans have organized protests at each hearing , taunting @entity5 as he enters and departs the courthouse
one fan website said they would follow @entity5 " into the streets " after monday 's hearing with banners on an overpass of the @entity99 .
