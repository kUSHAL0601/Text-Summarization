-- they traded in their coveralls for suits , but many of the 33 miners who were trapped for 69 days in a gold and copper mine still sported their protective sunglasses when they appeared at the @entity10 presidential palace monday to accept awards for their ordeal
@entity10 president @entity13 invited the miners , known as " the 33 , " to a special ceremony in @entity16
the rescuers involved in the operation were also honored
the rescue earlier this month captured the attention of the world , as one by one the trapped miners were pulled to the surface in a custom - made capsule that was lowered through a hole drilled into the rock
the men survived underground for longer than anyone in history
" if anybody doubted before this accident that faith moves mountains , if anybody doubted that when us @entity10 get united we are capable of reaching great goals , if anybody doubted our ability to make great achievements , i think that your example has dissipated those doubts , " @entity13 said , referring to the miners
" all of those doubts disappeared with what is known today as the miracle of @entity47 , which is the miracle of this story
" the miners have garnered much attentions since their rescue , and many of them still wore the $ 400 @entity55 sunglasses they were given to protect their eyes as the exited the mine
hundreds of people gathered outside of @entity59 , the presidential palace , and cheered the miners as they arrived
some wore hard hats and waved flags and posters with the miners ' photos
the successful rescue operation was seen as a boost to @entity10 's image
" when we found out that the company working the mine did n't have the ability to do the proper search - and - rescue effort , we made a decision
the decision was to assume in its entirety 100 percent of the responsibility , " @entity13 said
the president continued , " we searched for each one of you as if you were our children , finding you with the help of @entity81 , and rescuing you with the support and contribution of thousands upon thousands of heroes , some known , some others anonymously , who gave themselves entirely to the task while you were [ trapped ] in the depths of the mountain
" the rescue efforts were proof that @entity10 is committed to doing things right , the president said
" that day [ of the rescue ] was a triumph of life over death , hope over pessimism , unity over division , courage over fear , and decisiveness over hesitation , " he said .
