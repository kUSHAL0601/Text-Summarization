-- police on tuesday scoured the area in @entity3 where @entity4 was last reported seen , searching for any signs of the missing 2 - year - old girl
@entity4 was reportedly traveling with her father in a 2004 silver @entity8 on friday when they were carjacked , said sgt. @entity10 , a spokeswoman with @entity3 police
" the suspect took off in the car with her in it , " she said , citing what the father told authorities
the vehicle was subsequently recovered , but the girl remains missing
however , @entity3 police chief @entity20 said in a statement over the weekend that the " authenticity and credibility of the original version of events is under intense scrutiny by our investigative team , " seeming to suggest that police do not believe what the father told them happened
" at this time , we 're looking at everything , " @entity10 said
@entity4 is described as @entity33 , 2 feet , 5 inches tall , 25 pounds , with brown hair and brown eyes
she was last seen wearing a pink dress , pink tights , pink shoes and a purple coat , according to an @entity40 issued last week by the @entity41
her father , @entity42 , spoke to @entity44 's @entity43 on tuesday night , begging whoever took his daughter to bring her back
" i do n't care about anything else that 's going on right now but my daughter 's safe return home to her family , " he said
" i just want my daughter back home
" @entity42 appeared alongside his attorney , @entity55 , who said his client gave police permission to enter his home and has fully cooperated in the investigation
@entity10 declined to say whether police have searched @entity42 's house
" my daughter is a beautiful little girl
she has a bright personality
she 's the type of person that lights up a room when she walks in it
she 's very intelligent , " @entity42 told @entity44 's @entity43
" she 's just a wonderful little girl to be around
" about 150 volunteers turned out on monday to help look for @entity4 , said @entity10 , who also declined to comment on whether they or police had found anything useful
she urged anyone with information on the possible whereabouts of the little girl to contact @entity3 police .
