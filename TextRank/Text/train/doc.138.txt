it seems that @entity1 's has finally realized how tone - deaf its internal employee resource website was
it has shut it down
the final straw ? a tip on the site to employees to avoid @entity1 's fare
a graphic on the site shows a meal with a cheeseburger , fries and drink under the caption " unhealthy choice
" next to it is a picture of a sub , a salad and water under the caption " healthier choice
" the latest embarrassment is among a string that 's cropped up since the @entity27 website went live
a @entity27 budget - planning guide for its employees was ridiculed in july for being out of touch
" for starters , it did n't account for food and gasoline , " @entity31 reported
" the second line on the sample budget leaves room for income from a second job , which many called an admission by the fast food giant that its workers ca n't live on its wages alone
" and then earlier this month , @entity45 reported that the site offered a guide on how much one should tip a pool cleaner , housekeeper , and even an au pair
the only problem : the @entity52 and @entity53 released a study in october that said 52 % of families of fast food workers receive assistance from a public program like @entity59 , food stamps , the @entity61 or @entity62
the fast food giant found itself again having to deflect unwanted attention from its internal site this week after @entity66 reported that @entity27 ostensibly advises @entity1 's employees to not eat at @entity68
" fast foods are quick , reasonably priced , and readily available alternatives to home cooking
while convenient and economical for a busy lifestyle , fast foods are typically high in calories , fat , saturated fat , sugar , and salt and may put people at risk for becoming overweight
" visitors to @entity27 on wednesday were greeted with this statement : " we are temporarily performing some maintenance in order to provide you with the best experience possible
please excuse us while these upgrades are being made
" @entity1 's confirmed the site had been taken down in a statement posted on its website
" a combination of factors has led us to re-evaluate and we 've directed the vendor to take down the website
between links to irrelevant or outdated information , along with outside groups taking elements out of context , this created unwarranted scrutiny and inappropriate commentary
none of this helps our @entity1 's team members
" @entity106 and @entity1 's : let 's forgo the fries and fight the fat
