@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 has agreed to @entity1 's offer for working - level talks on reopening the suspended joint industrial complex at @entity8 , the @entity3 said
the talks are scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. saturday ( 9 p.m. friday et ) at @entity11 , an administrative building on the @entity14 side of the neutral border village of @entity11
@entity8 , which is a bellwether of @entity18 ties , was closed this spring -- a casualty of increasing tensions between the two @entity21 after the @entity14 warned that war could erupt
each side will have three - member delegations , @entity1 's @entity23 said , citing the @entity0 government
" the agreement came after @entity14 , revising its earlier stance , did not insist that @entity1 businessmen should be allowed to visit their plants in @entity8 at the same time or ahead of the government contact , " @entity23 reported
" @entity1 maintained that government contact should precede any visit to @entity8 by @entity1 businessmen
" the @entity34 wanted the talks to be held at @entity8 and with @entity1 businessmen permitted to accompany the delegation , proposals the @entity18 rejected
@entity0 's proposal for talks came a day after @entity14 invited businessmen from @entity1 companies to return to the zone to check on their facilities and equipment
the talks " were in consideration of the damages to the companies operating in @entity8 after three months of suspension and the beginning of monsoon season , " @entity45 , @entity1 's @entity3 spokesman , said in a briefing
" the @entity8 issue can only be resolved through dialogue by government authorities
" the operation was completely shut down in may when the last remaining @entity1 workers left the facilities , but work had been winding down for about a month amid heightened tensions
in april , @entity14 restricted @entity1 workers ' access to the zone
workers had to leave when supplies such as food , water and raw materials were cut off
the @entity18 tensions seemed to be easing somewhat after @entity4 agreed to high - level talks with the @entity18 in june
those talks were called off at the eleventh hour after disagreements over the level of the delegates who would represent each side
on wednesday , @entity14 also restored the @entity11 communication hotline with the @entity18 , which had been cut off repeatedly over the past four months
" @entity14 is probably feeling an unprecedented level of diplomatic isolation with pressures coming from the international community
it is also fully aware of the value of the @entity87 , which provides a considerable amount of hard foreign currency , " said @entity83 , former president of the @entity84
" but stirring tensions , then going back to dialogue , is part of @entity14 's usual tactics
we do n't need to attach too much weight to this easing of tension , " he added
@entity14 already had barred @entity1 workers from entering the complex before may
in 2008 , access was restricted after a human rights group distributed propaganda leaflets via balloon into @entity14
@entity1 workers were blocked again in 2009 during an annual @entity106 - @entity1 military drill
some $ 2 billion worth of goods have been produced in @entity8 between initial operations in 2005 and the end of 2012 , according to the @entity3
the average wage for @entity14 workers in @entity87 is $ 134 per month , according to the @entity1 ministry
@entity14 authorities take about 45 % of their wages for various taxes
@entity2 's @entity116 and @entity117 contributed to this report .
