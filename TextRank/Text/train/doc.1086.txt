@entity0 -- @entity3 intelligence now believes @entity4 did not gain access to the " crown jewels " of @entity8 programs that secretly intercept and monitor conversations around the world , @entity1 has learned
the @entity12 administration is reviewing what the admitted leaker of classified information actually got his hands on and what damage he may have caused
the ongoing damage assessment indicates he did not gain access to what is called @entity21 or " extremely compartmentalized information , " according to a @entity3 official familiar with the review
@entity4 fled to @entity25 after his leaks in june and has been stranded at the @entity25 airport awaiting a response to his request for temporary asylum
he faces espionage charges in the @entity3
with @entity4 still at large and the publication of agency surveillance secrets publicized , the intelligence community may have good reason to downplay the impact of what he has revealed
however , the official said the intelligence community remains adamant that @entity4 caused serious damage
the administration believes it knows the extent of the material that was downloaded
" we are not downplaying it , " the official said , explaining that assessing the matter over weeks has enabled authorities to focus more directly on the impact of @entity4 's actions
court renews secret @entity3 surveillance program the official spoke to @entity1 on background because the assessment is not fully completed
@entity1 can not independently verify the statements made either by the administration or @entity4
officials do not dispute that @entity4 had critical information about how @entity8 programs worked
" but just because you have the blueprints does n't mean you have the manual , " the official said
a key question is whether @entity4 , a former @entity8 contractor , really knows how the programs work at a detailed technical level
@entity4 did leak sensitive documents about anti-terror programs , detailing secret telephone metadata and e-mail surveillance
@entity3 officials have said that terror groups are aware of the @entity4 leaks and are responding internally , like adjusting communications and security
@entity8 director @entity77 said last week the @entity3 has concrete proof terrorists are making changes and taking actions that are going to " make our job harder
" other officials are less resolute about the extent of the exposure
the top lawyer for the @entity86 said it is not clear how much @entity3 adversaries will adjust based on what is known already
ex-cia chief : what @entity4 did " it 's too early to tell yet whether it is going to have an impact , but there 's no question that they have sat up and taken notice of specifically what has been released here and the impact it has on their communications , " @entity92 , general counsel for the national intelligence office said last friday
the assessment also has concluded that @entity4 took advantage of knowing that a good deal of information was concentrated in one portion of the @entity8 's computer system
" what he had was information that was centralized so it could be shared broadly , " the official said
this is similar to the assessment reached in the case of @entity119 pvt. @entity118 where information was stored in ways that large numbers of personnel could access it under certain circumstances
@entity118 is accused of leaking documents to @entity127 in the largest case of its kind in @entity3 history
he is currently on trial before a military court
deputy defense secretary @entity134 said last week that @entity4 exploited a weakness that came from a desire to make the information more accessible to those in the intelligence community
" in an effort for those in the intelligence community to be able to share information with one another , there was an enormous amount of information concentrated in one place , " @entity134 said during a panel at the @entity141
" it creates too much information in one place
" as such , the government has accelerated efforts to better secure classified information , improvements that had begun even before @entity4 went public
the government believes @entity4 was aware that upgrades were being made to @entity8 systems tagging data and users so that downloads were recorded , but @entity4 accessed portions where that work had not been completed
in addition , system administrators like @entity4 and others will be subject to more stringent rules
downloads will require a second more senior employee to " watch , log and observe " what material is being accessed the official said
access codes and passwords also have been changed .
