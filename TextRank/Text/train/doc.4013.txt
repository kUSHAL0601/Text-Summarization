" " dreaming in @entity29 " is the verbally and emotionally dazzling story of @entity45 's passage to @entity46 , where she tried to master an intricate foreign tongue -- and became fluent in the language of human possibility
@entity0 : read the prologue " @entity52 " by @entity53 288 pages ; @entity56 a terrifying memory unites two very different women -- a wry and ingenious young @entity59 refugee newly sprung from a @entity13 detention center , and an editor of a fashionable @entity64 women 's magazine -- in @entity53 's hauntingly original novel , " @entity52

but " @entity105 and @entity106 , " his memoir of the year in which they both died -- is universal in its evocation of loss
