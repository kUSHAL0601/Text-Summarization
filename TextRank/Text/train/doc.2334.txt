-- a computer hacker who calls himself " @entity3 " claimed responsibility for the cyber attack which took down the @entity7 site sunday , shortly before it started posting hundreds of thousands of classified @entity9 diplomatic cables
@entity3 , who describes himself as a " hacktivist for good , " said he took the controversial site down " for attempting to endanger the lives of our troops , ' other assets ' & foreign relations
" he normally attacks @entity18 websites , announcing " @entity22 " on his @entity20 account when claiming to have attacked a site
" @entity26 " is @entity24 jargon for having eliminated a terrorist
over the past few days , the @entity3 has targeted a handful of websites for reasons including " online incitement to cause young @entity30 to carry out acts of violent jihad , " " distributing jihadist instructional materials , " and " for the online radicalization of young @entity30 in @entity9 and @entity35
" the @entity3 describes himself as " an ex-soldier with a rather famous unit , country purposely not specified
" " i was involved with supporting @entity24 , i have served in ( and around ) @entity40 amongst other places , " he told the website threatchaos.com early this year
@entity7 said in september that it had prepared an unspecified " insurance policy " against its site being taken down
" this annoyed me ... so i got busy , " the @entity3 wrote on his blog in september
cyber security expert @entity46 of @entity48 believes the @entity3 was really behind the hack , he told @entity0
@entity7 was down for several hours sunday , spokesman @entity50 said monday
he said he did not know who was behind it , and he seemed surprised when @entity0 told him an @entity54 hacker was taking credit
@entity7 excites " a lot of strong emotions , " @entity50 said
the hacker did not immediately respond to @entity0 requests for comment
@entity7 posted that it was under attack at about 11 a.m. et sunday , not long before its latest and largest leak
