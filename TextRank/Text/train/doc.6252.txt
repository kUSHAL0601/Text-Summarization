-- despite acknowledgment from the @entity3 a day earlier that a peace deal between @entity5 and the @entity6 is unlikely before a new @entity8 president takes office , secretary of state @entity1 said friday she is confident that ongoing efforts would produce success
@entity5 foreign minister @entity12 , right , and @entity8 secretary of state @entity1 speak thursday
" carried to its state of conclusion , it will produce a state of @entity24 , " @entity25 , referring to negotiations in the wake of last year 's @entity8 summit on @entity5 - @entity16 peace in @entity30 , @entity31 , said at a joint news conference with @entity16 president @entity15 in @entity17 , @entity18
@entity25 is on her eighth trip to the region since the @entity28
on thursday , @entity3 spokeswoman @entity35 said the @entity41 administration does not " think that it 's likely that it ( a peace agreement ) would happen before the end of the year
" @entity25 said friday that she realizes the lack of a peace agreement in the months following the @entity30 summit had caused some concerns that talks had stalled or might fail , but " it 's quite the opposite -- the @entity30 process has laid the foundation for the eventual establishment for the state of @entity24
" the purpose of her current trip , @entity25 said , was " to advance the @entity30 process , " and while she did not speculate on a timetable for the future of the process or offer specifics on peace talks , she added , " i 've seen them move forward a great deal in the past year
" both @entity5 and @entity16 officials have expressed doubts about achieving a peace agreement before president @entity41 leaves office , but until this week @entity8 officials had been more optimistic in their public comments
speaking in @entity5 on thursday , @entity25 blamed part of the inability to secure a deal on recent political changes in @entity5 , which she noted is " in the midst of elections
" with @entity15 on friday , she emphasized that the commitment expressed by @entity15 and @entity5 prime minister @entity73 when they signed an agreement to work toward a peace deal by the end of 2008 is still strong
" i hope that the tremendous commitment ( by both sides ) is fully understood , " @entity25 said
while @entity25 did not discuss any impact a new administration in @entity82 might have on the process , she said , " the @entity8 really does understand why the @entity16 people want unity
" @entity5 in recent months has seen political upheaval
@entity73 resigned in september amid allegations of corruption
@entity90 leader and @entity5 foreign minister @entity12 gave up efforts to form a new coalition government late last month and is seeking to hold early general elections , which could be held in february , @entity12 's spokesman has said
@entity73 will continue to lead as @entity5 's interim prime minister until a successor assumes power either by forming a coalition in the current @entity99 or through general elections
however , it is unclear whether he will be able to strike a deal with the @entity6 before @entity5 forms its new government
last month , @entity25 postponed a trip to a @entity105 conference because of the global crisis in financial markets .
