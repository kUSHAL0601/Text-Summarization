-- @entity1 will probably be incarcerated for the rest of his life for child sex abuse convictions , but the former @entity6 assistant football coach is making sure he has his say outside the prison walls
documentary filmmaker @entity9 interviewed @entity1 , 68 , for a project he calls " @entity11 of @entity12
" on monday , @entity14 's " today " show aired a portion of a phone conversation between the two men
in the broadcast excerpts , @entity1 questioned the credibility of prosecution witness @entity20 , another former @entity6 assistant coach , who testified that he walked in on @entity1 raping a child in the showers at a school facility
" i think there 's a lot of things that transpired
i think these investigators , the way they went about business , you know , his story changed a lot
i think he said some things , and then it escalated on him , " @entity1 said
" i do n't understand how anybody would have walked into that locker room from where he was and heard sounds associated that was sex going on
( laughter ) you know , like he said that could 've been , i mean , there was ... that would have been the last thing i would have thought about
i would 've thought maybe fooling around or something like that
( laughter ) " @entity1 also discussed what @entity12 , the legendary @entity6 head coach who was forced out as a result of the scandal , knew -- or did n't know
@entity12 family : @entity59 report ' factually wrong ' " if he absolutely thought i was ( a pedophile ) , i 'd say no. if he had a suspicion , i do n't know the answer to that , " @entity1 said
@entity9 wrote an open letter to the media on sunday , and said on the " today " show that " the media , in this particular case , has an agenda
they do n't want to hear what the truth is
this has been a rush to judgment from the very beginning
" " @entity1 had his day in court
i am trying to get @entity12 , effectively , his day in court , " @entity9 said , later adding , " this is all about @entity12 's alleged culpability , which i do n't believe the facts back up
i think he was railroaded
" both @entity6 and the @entity12 family lambasted @entity1 and the release of his audio
" @entity1 's statements today continue to open wounds for his victims , and the victims of child sexual abuse everywhere
we have tremendous respect for the men who came forward to tell their stories publicly , " said @entity6 spokesman @entity89
' the @entity1 8 ' describe seduction , molestation and betrayal and @entity12 family attorney @entity98 released a statement saying , " the release of the audio recording of @entity1 is a sad and unfortunate development
@entity1 had the opportunity to speak , under oath , during his trial and he chose not to do so
releasing a recording at this time , nearly a year after he was found guilty on 45 counts , is transparently self - serving and yet another insult to the victims and anyone who cares about the truth in this tragic story
" the @entity12 family would prefer to remain silent on this matter , but they feel it is important to make it clear that they had no role in obtaining or releasing this recording
moreover , they believe that any attempt to use this recording as a defense of @entity12 is misguided and inappropriate
i encourage anyone who wants to understand the facts of this case to go to @entity129 and read the reports of former attorney general @entity131 , former @entity133 profiler , @entity134 , noted pedophilia expert , dr. @entity136 and the @entity137 and @entity139 legal team
" from the beginning , the family has been committed to due process and a careful , objective examination of the facts
this is the path they will continue to follow
" @entity1 was sentenced in october to 30 to 60 years in prison for abusing 10 boys during a 15 - year period
on february 21 , he filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence with the @entity153 , according to court records
letters by @entity1 , wife blame everyone else @entity0 's @entity158 and @entity159 contributed to this report
