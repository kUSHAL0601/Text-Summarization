-- a judge in @entity2 , @entity3 , on monday sentenced @entity4 , a former middle school math teacher , to 10 years in prison for having sex with two underage students in 2008
" as parents , we place our trust in teachers to provide a safe environment in which our children can learn , " @entity9 circuit judge @entity8 said in handing down the sentence
" you violated that trust in the worst imaginable way
" @entity8 also sentenced @entity4 to 15 years of sex offender probation following her prison time
@entity4 , 31 , pleaded guilty in april to three counts of lewd and lascivious battery in a march 2008 case involving a 14 - year - old boy , and two counts of having unlawful sex with a minor in an april 2008 case involving a 16 - year - old student
@entity4 has been in jail since she was arrested in 2008 leaving one of the victims ' homes
monday 's sentencing included testimony from the victims ' families , who depicted @entity4 as a sexual predator who caused severe emotional distress for their sons
" miss @entity4 maliciously and intently preyed on my son and the other boys , " said the mother of the 14 - year - old victim
" she had access to their charts as far as their emotional behaviors
... i feel that she was very conniving ... in picking these boys out and preying on them and using that to manipulate them and seduce them
" prosecutor @entity56 also played a phone conversation between @entity4 and the younger victim that police recorded with the 14 - year - old 's consent
in the tape , @entity4 can be heard urging the teen to keep their encounters secret
" it 's ... one of those things you have to take to the grave , " @entity4 says on the tape , explaining that sex crimes involving minors have no statute of limitations
in arguing for the maximum sentence , @entity56 portrayed @entity4 as a " master manipulator
" " she is the one that goes in and looks at their weaknesses , " @entity56 said
" she knows exactly what she has to do to get into their lives
" in a statement before her sentencing , an emotional @entity4 -- wearing an orange jumpsuit and shackled at her hands and ankles -- expressed remorse for her actions
" i 'm sincerely sorry for the pain and aggravation i have caused to the victims and their families , " she said
her attorney , @entity94 , asked the judge to sentence her to probation with time served , saying she has spent more time behind bars than other people who have faced similar charges
a psychiatrist for the defense also testified that @entity4 has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder
but @entity8 issued the maximum sentence and did not hold back in his final statement to @entity4 , calling her a " danger to the children in our community
" " you not only have disgraced yourself , your family , but also the teaching profession , " @entity8 said
" and one thing that i have gleaned out of this sentencing hearing this afternoon is you 're a very selfish person
" he added that he remained unconvinced that @entity4 had accepted responsibility in the case
" you stopped only because you got caught and put in jail , " @entity8 said
as part of her probation , @entity4 must abide by a mandatory nightly curfew , enroll in an outpatient sex offender treatment program and will not be allowed contact with the victims
she also will not be allowed to live within 1,000 feet of a school , day care , playground , park or any other area where children congregate , nor will she be allowed unsupervised contact with children under age 18
the defense said after the hearing that it was disappointed with the sentence
" i was not expecting that harsh of a sentence and i think this case did not warrant that , " @entity94 said .
