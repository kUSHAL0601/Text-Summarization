@entity0 spoke to @entity1 about the impact of @entity4 ' march through northern @entity5 , and the militant group 's control of some oil fields
he explained how they used the oil fields to raise funds , and how it could impact global prices
this is an edited version of the conversation
how much of @entity5 's oil market do @entity4 control ? @entity4 control just a few marginal fields in @entity5 's north , but they are enough to fund the terrorist group 's self - sufficiency
a month ago , the @entity4 -- controlled oil market in @entity5 was reported to be worth $ 1 million a day
now , with expansion , further control of oil fields and smuggling routes , the market is believed to be raising at least $ 2 million a day
this could fetch them more than $ 730 million a year , enough to sustain the operation beyond @entity5
isis have been battling over @entity33 and the refinery is still under siege
however , if @entity4 succeed in capturing it , the refinery would be very difficult to operate without capable and technical staff
one important factor for the stability of global markets : @entity4 is not yet in the south of @entity5 , where the country 's true oil bounty lies
capturing the southern assets of the country would be mission impossible for the group
the territory is far from fault lines , and is dominated by @entity50 , which makes dominating the region difficult for the @entity53 militant group
what do @entity4 do with the oil they get ? isis smuggle the crude oil and trade it for cash and refined products , at a reduced price
they also have their own small and rudimentary refineries in @entity63
refined oil is returned to @entity4 for selling locally , in @entity5 and @entity63
@entity4 also use the oil in their own warfare
@entity4 controls smuggling routes and the crude transported by tankers to @entity71 via @entity73 province , to @entity74 via @entity75 , to @entity76 via @entity77 , to @entity63 's local market and to the @entity5 of @entity5 , where most of it gets refined locally
@entity76 has turned a blind eye to this and may continue to do so until they come under pressure from the @entity84 to close down oil black markets in the country 's south
@entity4 ' oil will remain limited to these black markets , and the group will have no chance to establish a sophisticated pipeline network
fixed distribution networks are complex , require investment and can become targets by the @entity96 and @entity97
what is @entity4 ' ultimate aim and how does oil wealth play into it ? at present , @entity4 are trying to establish a self - sufficient state and a capital in what is known as the " sunni triangle " ( west and north @entity5 ) , and oil production will be part of this
they want to be self - sufficient , expand their territorial control , recruit more jihadists -- with focus on extremists with foreign passports -- and extend their operations , to eventually launch attacks on @entity118 countries
@entity4 declared its caliphate by turning @entity5 and @entity63 into a hub to attract extremists
they are aiming to take over the @entity122 as their epicenter to launch attacks globally
if this happens , they will be in control of a region that holds 60 % of world 's conventional energy reserves and produces 40 % of global oil and gas production
and the only way to do it is by attracting the masses of jihadists and extremists from all over the world to eventually outnumber the locals , which will endanger global security and economies
how is @entity4 ' control of some of @entity5 's oil fields impacting the global economy ? in the short to mid-term , the impact will be minimal as @entity5 's south is its dominant producer
however , there are enough rich assets in the midlands and the north part of @entity5 that @entity4 could reach out to , a potential capacity that could ramp up to a million barrels a day -- from its current 30,000 barrels a day -- should they seize control the oil - rich city of @entity158 and its surrounding districts
if they succeed in controlling those assets , cash inflow could stretch their empire of terrorism beyond imagination
but so far , @entity4 oil trading has remained local with buyers in @entity71 , @entity76 , @entity63 and @entity74 via middlemen network and truck owners
however , the instability created by @entity5 effectively being broken up would have a ripple impact , in terms of hindering investment prospect in the country
in turn , that could prevent @entity5 from reaching its 2020 target of 9 million barrels of oil production per day , which is three times @entity5 's current oil supply and 10 % of global demand .
