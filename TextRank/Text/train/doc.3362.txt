@entity0 -- @entity2 is a retired government worker in @entity0
she is one of the lucky homeowners who bought her place long before the housing sector galloped out of reach for the average @entity10 salary worker
" it is ridiculously high , " she says pointing to apartments in her neighborhood
" these homes near the school here are cny 70,000 ( usd $ 11,400 ) per square meter
it 's not even worth 7000 yuan ( usd $ 1140 ) per square meter because it 's not even good quality
" her concern is on the radar of the central leadership that is expected to discuss economic reforms at the plenary session starting saturday
for @entity10 leaders , the property sector is an emotional and political hot potato
the dream to own a home is a far out of reach for tens of millions of @entity10 citizens
in the latest housing data , new home prices for september rose at the fastest pace in almost three years
in @entity0 , new home prices were up 16 % , @entity39 17 % and @entity40 20 % from a year ago
" the problem is @entity10 people have very few investment vehicles
they 've lost trust in the stock market so they turn to real estate , " says @entity44 , @entity10 director of the @entity45
@entity44 says the central leadership needs to make bold steps in financial reforms to give citizens more options to invest their money
one measure @entity10 is considering is to allow banks to set their own interest rates , creating more competition
i was in @entity0 two weeks ago and visited a luxury villa compound
it was a large site with tens of dozens of completed but mostly empty villas
a worker in the sales office told me the average home was priced at cny 23 million ( usd $ 3.8 million ) and most were sold
he said half were owner - occupied ( though i saw very little sign of residents ) and the other half purchased as investments
i was told the supermarket in the center of the compound was open and often used by residents
it was clearly still under construction
when i pointed this out , i was then told the grand opening would be next year
message : the bubble is alive and growing
these villas are a pretty -- and by most appearances , empty -- place to park money
@entity88 shakes her head at the dilemma facing the government
she does n't believe recent curbs will work like a ban on third home loans in @entity39
" i do n't think home prices will drop sharply because our economy is still doing okay , " she says
" our child bought a home in the @entity101 recently
the price was about the same as a flat in @entity0 , but the area is a lot bigger and the quality is much better
