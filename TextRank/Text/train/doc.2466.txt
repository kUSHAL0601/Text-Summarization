" on friday , more details emerged about the alleged attack may 14 in @entity103 of the @entity22 hotel
a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case said a room service attendant entered the suite a short time before the 32 - year - old @entity111 maid arrived
the room service attendant did n't think anyone was in the suite of rooms and used a pass key to let himself in to retrieve some room - service items , the source said
he told police he left the door ajar while inside , according to the source
when the maid showed up at the door about noon , the room - service attendant told her to enter , then departed , the source said
once inside , the maid parked her cleaning cart in the doorway , as dictated by hotel policy
a short time later , @entity5 emerged naked from a room and attacked her , the victim has alleged
prosecutors allege that @entity5 chased her through his suite , sexually assaulted her and tried to rape her
a criminal complaint states @entity5 shut the door at one point during the alleged attack
the law enforcement source said the maid escaped about 1:30 p.m. about an hour before his 4:40 p.m. flight was to take off from @entity140 for @entity141 , @entity5 called the hotel to say he had left his cell phone
he asked security to look for it in his room and to have it delivered to the airport , the source said
by then , police had been called to the hotel
though hotel staff never found the phone , they followed police orders , telling @entity5 they had found it and would deliver it to him , the source said
@entity160 police took over from there , walking a compliant @entity5 from his first - class seat to a squad car at the airport , the source said
at the time , @entity5 was in the fourth year of a five - year term with the global financial institution and was paid $ 441,980 in 2010 , according to the most recent annual report
he also got $ 79,000 and first - class travel for him and his family while he was on company business
on friday , the @entity2 said that @entity5 will receive a $ 250,000 separation payment and a " modest annual pension " thereafter
we do n't disclose pension payments , " said @entity2 spokesman @entity174
" but it is well below the separation payment figure
" the dean of the @entity180 , @entity181 , announced friday that the institution adopted a procedure to select its next managing director
in a statement , @entity185 said the board will meet with final candidates in @entity189 " with the objective of completing the selection process by june 30 , 2011
" @entity5 proclaimed innocence in a resignation letter to the @entity180 late wednesday
" to all , i want to say that i deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me , " he said
his next court appearance is set for june 6
the judge granted the bail thursday on condition that , in addition to posting $ 1 million in cash and a $ 5 million bond , @entity5 surrender his travel documents and submit to home detention
a criminal court judge denied him bail monday , saying the fact that he was taken into custody aboard an @entity211 jet made him a flight risk
@entity5 's lawyer argued thursday that his client had bought the ticket on may 11 , and that he was not fleeing anything
the maid testified before a grand jury wednesday , according to her attorney
defense attorney @entity220 has disputed her allegations , saying " forensic evidence , we believe , will not be consistent with a forcible account , and we believe there is a very , very defensible case
" @entity1 's @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report .
