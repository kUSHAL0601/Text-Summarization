-- it is that time of the year , again
come january , as soon as the @entity5 trees are taken down and the winter sales flood the shops , the world of business starts thinking about the @entity8 -- better known as @entity9
for the past three years @entity9 has been consumed by the eurozone sovereign debt crises
as it worsened the speculation became ever more frantic
the questions were endless : will @entity13 leave the euro ? will the eurozone even survive ? was this all just a big @entity18 trick to run @entity19 ? the speculation became more extreme , more dramatic , more nonsensical
and so questions were asked of other economies : can @entity23 be the biggest engine of growth for the global economy ? round and round in circles we have gone on these subjects
frankly , i was starting to wonder if there was anything else to say short of " it 's a horrible mess ! " this year there is a new bogey man
the @entity37 , and in particular the sorry state of the country 's political and budgetary process , will , i have little doubt , be the center of attention
read more : more ' cliffs ' to come in new @entity45 not just because @entity45 fluffed its big test on the fiscal cliff , but because in doing so it created many more deadlines , any one of which could be deeply unsettling to global markets
there are the $ 100 billion budget cutbacks postponed for two months by the recent agreement ; delayed to the end of february
at exactly the same time , we have the @entity58 's ability to rob @entity59 to pay @entity60 on the debt ceiling crisis coming to a head
read more : both @entity64 , @entity63 set for tough talks ahead the @entity58 's " debt suspension period " is an extraordinary piece of financial chicanery
if we tried it with our credit cards , we 'd get locked up
then there is the expiration of the latest continuing resolution , the authority by which @entity45 is spending money
there is the terrifying prospect that all these budget woes will conflate into one big political fistfight as the @entity37 faces cutbacks , default or shutdown
most rational people believe that the worst sting will be taken out of this tail
but not before we have all been to the edge , and back
and that is what the attendees of @entity9 will have on their minds
people will be speculating about how dysfunctional the @entity37 political process has become and whether it is broken beyond repair ( if they are not asking that then they should be )
they will be pondering which is more serious for risk ; the @entity37 budget and debt crises or the eurozone sovereign debt debacle
a classic case of being between the devil and the deep blue sea
the official topic this year is @entity106
i have absolutely no idea what this means
it is another of @entity8 's ersatz themes dreamt up to stimulate debate in what @entity114 has beautifully termed " @entity117 language
" in short , everyone interprets it as they will
what i will enjoy , as i do every year , is the chance to hear the global players speak , and the brightest and best thinkers give us their take on global problems
the atmosphere becomes febrile as the rock - stars of finance and economics give speeches , talk on panels and give insight
of course nothing comes of these musings , it never does at @entity9
that 's not the point
this is a chance to take stock and see where the political and economic landmines are in 2013
i like to think of @entity9 as the equivalent of @entity146
it allows us to reboot
we leave , at least , with an idea of where people stand on the big issues -- provided you can see through the panegyrics of self congratulatory backslapping that always takes place whenever you get like minded people in one place
and this year , i predict the big issue being discussed in coffee bars , salons and fondue houses will be the @entity37 and its budgetary woes .
