-- friendship is not defined by the length of time two people share together
one defining moment is all it takes for two individuals to call each other friends
@entity9 's life , short as it was , taught me that lesson
his death , sudden as it was , taught me that lesson
coroner : mix of heroin and alcohol killed ' @entity20 ' star the defining moment of our friendship happened the third time i joined the cast of " @entity20 " for yet another memorable shooting experience as @entity27
at the set , @entity9 was cool
like his character @entity29 , @entity9 was so cool that everything seemed alright with him
i remember the last time i shot for " @entity20 , " it was may 9 , 2011
it was a long shooting day that swelled into the wee hours of the following morning
i was a tad emotional when the clock struck 12 midnight -- not because i was tired -- but because may 10 was my birthday
and i , a girl from the barrio of @entity38 in the far - flung @entity39 , was alone in @entity40
my family was not there , my friends were not there , i did n't have my loved ones there to celebrate my birthday
it did n't help that we all still had a long way to go on that day at the set of " @entity20
" how will ' glee ' handle the death of @entity9 ? but @entity9 came to the rescue , just in time , with his sweet greeting : " happy birthday , @entity56 ! " a big smile crossed his handsome face
there was sincerity in his tone as he gave me a tight hug
he became family to me at that moment
in the remaining hours of our shoot , @entity9 told me he had googled me and found my date of my birth
@entity9 's act of kindness
he told other members of the " @entity20 " cast that it was my birthday and i was floored at how many of them greeted me with their warm birthday wishes
my body felt cold when i learned about his death
too soon , too early , too young
i never thanked @entity9 enough for that one moment in time when he made me feel like family
i never thanked him enough for making me happy on that lonely day
@entity9 has many fans in the @entity39
in my silence , i mourn with so many of them
addiction : the disease that lies @entity29 was big in my country because " @entity20 " was big among the many young people in the @entity39
the @entity91 people love him because we are a musically - inclined nation and we know how to appreciate real talent
we know how to love real talent
many of my @entity91 friends ask me what will happen to " @entity20 " now that @entity29 is gone
i have no answer to their query
but i lovingly ask them to pray for him -- for his peaceful passing
i am confident he 's singing with the angels now
i am more than confident that his suave style , his cool attitude about everything will endear him more to his new - found winged friends in the afterlife
to his fans around the world who mourn his passing , i am with you
i know how it feels
let 's hold each other 's hand
let 's remember @entity9 and continue to celebrate his music , his craft , his life
he will forever be in our hearts
i wish i could also embrace @entity9 's loved ones -- his family and friends , his girlfriend @entity130
i will pray for all of you , too
thank you , mr. cool
my grateful heart will always miss you -- especially so on my birthday
@entity137 : remembering @entity20 's @entity9 the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity56 .
