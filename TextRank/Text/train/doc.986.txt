@entity0 -- so @entity2 now moves to the next generation
one of the @entity2 juniors , 10 - year - old @entity5 , is appearing in the @entity7 2013 campaign
he 's in a raincoat , of course , featuring in the brand 's typical threads
@entity7 has lately been putting non-models in their campaigns , using well - known @entity15 people to underscore the that @entity7 is @entity15
@entity16 , of @entity18 fame , had the spotlight in 2011
@entity5 is a clever hook
did @entity2 project succeed in @entity22 ? he already is one of the most photographed children in the world
his parents have not shied away from showing the boys off at @entity28 ' basketball games , or just walking through airports
just last week they were in front of a @entity32 theater for the launch of the @entity35 musical ( no comment )
so two @entity15 brands now merge , though i suspect it has more to do with @entity40 than @entity0
more : @entity41 wins again in @entity2 's last @entity22 game @entity43 is of course a global icon , just like @entity7
@entity46 is the main thrust for @entity7 as it continues to upgrade its image and its stores and its prices to be a bigger luxury brand --- most others remain niche
@entity7 stores are getting bigger while the company continues to buy out former joint venture partners in order to take full control of the brand in every country in which it operates
it was interesting a few months ago when @entity7 lowered expectations for 2012 on the back of a slowdown in @entity46 and the shares dropped like a stone
so , having a recognizable face ( or at least a recognizable name ) in @entity40 should be a plus , come spring
end it like @entity2 not least because @entity7 does children 's clothing
i can remember interviewing @entity75 , the creative director , a few years ago at @entity7 's new headquarters
we walked through the children 's section and that 's when i realized they dressed well - off children as well
i had no idea ( none of my three have worn a stitch of @entity7 )
so , @entity5 hits the nail on the head in multiple ways
has n't @entity7 come a long way ? a decade ago the @entity7 check pattern was used by teenagers ( and i 'm told some soccer hooligans ) as a " chav " look , a trend where people who could not afford a label would wear a knock - off version
@entity7 fought back , cracking down on knock - offs while moving the brand even more upscale
like @entity101 or @entity102 , @entity7 has been reborn but remains proudly @entity15
looks like @entity2 is doing the same .
