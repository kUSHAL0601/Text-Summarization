-- he was the " @entity2 , " the miracle man and the @entity5 athlete that could take on the very best able - bodied competitors
it was a high - profile career that inspired millions , earned lucrative sponsorship deals and bridged the gap between @entity10 and @entity5 competition
yet those remarkable sporting triumphs and the fame and fortune it brought @entity2 receded into the distance as the @entity17 stood motionless in the dock in @entity19 as he received a five - year sentence for the fatal shooting of his girlfriend @entity23 on @entity24 2013
in the most favorable scenario for @entity2 , he could be released from prison in 10 months under house arrest
but even then , former athletes , officials and marketing experts believe a full comeback will be extremely difficult
the competition ban a dramatic return in time for the 2016 @entity5 is out of the question after the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) stated that @entity2 would be banned from competing for five years
the @entity35 had previously stated that the @entity17 would be allowed to compete in @entity36 if he was not in jail
while there is a possibility @entity2 may be out of prison before the @entity42 begin in @entity43 , the @entity35 has since clarified that this will also include any period that @entity2 serves out under house arrest
" we 've been quite clear throughout this process we would respect what sanctions the judge put down , " ipc director of media and communications , @entity46 , told @entity0
" @entity2 can resume his career if he so wishes once he 's served his sentence in full , " @entity46 added , before clarifying that the @entity35 's position may change should the sentence be reduced or lengthened
since bursting on to the scene at the @entity42 of 2004 , @entity2 has been the @entity5 movement 's poster - boy
@entity46 acknowledged the huge impact @entity2 has had but he pointed to the wealth of talent and inspirational athletes competing at the @entity64 to emphasize the strength and depth that now exists in para sports
" @entity68 showed for us all is that the @entity5 movement is more than one athlete
there were lots of athletes that made the headlines in @entity76 ... and the @entity5 movement has continued to go from strength to strength since ( then )
" the @entity80 , meanwhile , refused to be drawn on whether today 's sentencing meant @entity2 would be able to compete in future events
" we take note of the court 's decision , " said the @entity80 in a statement
" this is a human tragedy for the family of @entity23 and also for @entity2
we hope very much that time will bring comfort to all those concerned but at this stage we have no further comment to make
" the sporting condition @entity2 will be 32 in 2019 when his five - year sentence is up
the @entity94 of 2020 could still offer a shot at sporting redemption but there will clearly be a question mark on whether @entity2 ' athletic powers will be on the wane by then
former @entity5 athletes like @entity103 's @entity102 have previously stated that even making the @entity104 having missed months of training and competition would have been difficult for @entity2
members of the @entity2 family also recently told @entity0 's @entity109 that the athlete 's future career is not part of his immediate plans
instead , he would focus on his life in jail , potentially starting a running or gym club whilst behind bars
his uncle , @entity119 , told reporters earlier tuesday that " @entity2 will embrace this opportunity to pay back to society
as an uncle , i hope @entity2 will start his own healing process as he walks down the path of restoration
as a family , we are ready to support and guide @entity2 as he serves his sentence
" the sponsors and the brand even if @entity2 does manage to make a miraculous sporting comeback , it is highly unlikely he will be as big a draw to sponsors and fans as he has been in the past
the athlete 's image was pulled from billboards across @entity17 after his arrest in 2013 and sponsors suspended their deals
" this is the end of his brand , " said @entity144 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity147 , who added that @entity2 ' transgression was very different to the indiscretions of sports stars like @entity151 or @entity152 , who lost sponsors
" none of those people actually killed anyone
it 's going to be very , very difficult and very risky for a commercial partner to associate with @entity2 , " @entity144 said
" it will reflect too negatively for ( anyone ) to make a commitment to @entity2
i think as a global and an international property , this is it , it 's over , it 's the end
" however , there are commercial options potentially still available to @entity2
" if he comes out of prison and seeks in some way to redeem himself -- maybe if he was to become a very high profile campaigner for women 's rights or for ending violence against women -- and was seen to be taking what has happened ultra-seriously , certain types of brands could be interested , " @entity144 said
" that 's a real outside chance and @entity2 would have to work very , very hard
" the second option would be if he was able to attract lots of small sponsor
" he was a trailblazer in the sense he put the @entity5 movement on the map and in short he 'll be cheap , " added @entity144
" small brands trying to raise awareness might choose to associate with the athlete , " but any campaigns would likely be " very low key and possibly domestic
" another option is for @entity2 to cash in on giving his side of the story
" the third way back for him would inevitably be book deals , maybe a deal for tv -- commercially it may well be he makes money that way , " @entity144 said
" what @entity2 needs right now is very careful advice from representatives who really do know what they 're doing
" on the one hand there are commercial opportunities there for him but they need to be handled very gently and very thoughtfully
if he 's seen to be making too much money it will undermine efforts at redemption
" for his agent , business managers , communications consultants this is a huge and very tricky job , " added @entity144
" i 'm really not sure there will be a way back for him
unless he goes straight into the next @entity5 , breaks a world record and makes all the right noises on redemption
" @entity226 : @entity23 , @entity2 @entity0 's @entity109 and @entity227 contributed to this story .
