-- investigators for the @entity3 began asking questions about @entity6 's business practices involving digital music at least three weeks ago , multiple music industry sources told @entity0
@entity3 investigators have interviewed numerous executives at record companies and digital music stores and according to those with knowledge of the discussions , it is clear that investigators are interested in learning whether @entity6 has employed anticompetitive tactics
the sources said that the department 's inquiry is just in a fact - finding stage and that there is nothing to indicate investigators have found any wrongdoing or would file a complaint against @entity6
representatives from @entity6 and the @entity3 did not respond to interview requests
this is what we know about the investigation so far
@entity3 investigators have interviewed executives from the four major music labels and several digital music retailers about how @entity6 wields its @entity37 influence
part of what investigators are interested in is whether @entity6 used its market dominance to discourage two of the top record companies from participating in a special @entity45 music promotion called the " @entity46
" @entity6 has a history of throwing its weight around the music sector
@entity6 's @entity37 accounts for 70 percent of all digital song sales and wields huge power
@entity6 has often used that clout to dictate terms to suppliers -- that is , the major labels
here are just a few examples : the major labels wanted variable pricing on songs and albums and for years @entity6 resisted
in 2005 , @entity6 ceo @entity60 said the top recording companies were " getting greedy " after music execs considered a music price hike
last year , @entity6 finally gave the labels some additional control over song pricing
the big record companies wanted the ability to sell albums that were unbundled , meaning they wanted @entity6 to sell hot lps as a full package and refrain from selling individual songs from these works
again , on this issue @entity6 has n't given much ground
to @entity37 ' fans , @entity6 was a freedom fighter
the perception was that @entity6 was standing up for consumers
@entity6 's refusal to force customers to buy full albums saved them from having to shell out money for songs they did n't want
to them , @entity6 's reluctance to raise the 99 cent song price was another way the company kept music costs down
and the government never made a peep about these practices
@entity95 ? but what may not seem as consumer - friendly is the accusation that @entity6 tried to squash a competitor 's effort to offer discounted music
@entity45 's " @entity46 , " is a promotion that involves slashing prices on specific music titles and pushing them heavily on the day of their release
@entity45 sometimes negotiated to get exclusive access to the music for a period of time , and the labels and their artists would often support the @entity112 by promoting it on their web sites
@entity6 managers informed the labels that any music included in @entity45 's promotion would receive no promotion at @entity37 , music industry sources told @entity0 in april
in one case , @entity6 complained to @entity121 after seeing material from @entity123 touted as part of the @entity112
in march , @entity125 , from @entity126 , broke the news about @entity6 's attempts to make the labels " rethink " their support for the @entity112
he wrote that @entity6 contacted @entity132 executives with similar gripes about such albums as @entity136 's " @entity135 , " @entity138 's " @entity137 , " and ke $ ha 's " @entity139
" when it comes to tracing @entity37 ' potential @entity3 troubles , one has to start with @entity6 's success
during the last decade , with its @entity146 digital music players and @entity37 music store , the company completely remade the way people across the globe listen to , store , and buy music
@entity6 's @entity151 accounted for 28 percent of all music purchased by @entity156 consumers in the first quarter of this year , research firm @entity153 said wednesday
two years ago during the same period , @entity37 ' market share was 19 percent
companies that dominate a market as much as @entity6 rules digital music often are accused of anti-trust violations
when companies are up against similar - sized competitors , then aggressive tactics are seen as just good business
but the same practices from players holding hefty market share can raise eyebrows in a hurry
during the same period that @entity6 saw double - digit growth , @entity45 also was grabbing greater market share in digital music
@entity45 's share grew from 6.8 percent in the first half of 2008 to 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 2010
what @entity3 investigators must be asking now is how much did the " @entity112 " help propel that growth and did any of @entity6 's actions slow it down ? Â© 2010 @entity183 all rights reserved
