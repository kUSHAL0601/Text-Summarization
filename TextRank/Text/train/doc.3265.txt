-- @entity2 leg - spinner @entity1 has announced he will quit international cricket at the end of the ongoing second test against @entity6
@entity1 will retire after 10 years of @entity7 , in which he has taken 207 wickets
the 37 - year - old made his test debut against @entity12 10 years ago and has since gone on to take 207 wickets at an average of 28.28 over 43 @entity7 matches
" unfortunately now my time is up , " @entity1 said
" i am incredibly lucky that as well as providing me with amazing opportunities off the field , my job allows me to test myself in one of @entity2 's most highly scrutinised sporting environments
" bowling with some of crickets all time greats such as @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 has made my job a lot easier
i want to be sure that exciting young bowlers like @entity29 enjoy the same privilege , " he added
@entity1 took the only wicket to fall on a rain - interrupted third day of the @entity7 in @entity32
he had @entity33 brilliantly caught at slip by @entity35 for a well - constructed 65 , but otherwise drew blank on a frustrating day for the tourists
the ever dependable @entity37 ( 55 not out ) and @entity38 ( 29 not out ) took the @entity6 to the close on 255 for four wickets
they were replying to @entity2 's 479 for seven declared and with only two days remaining a draw looks the likely outcome in @entity1 's farewell appearance
@entity2 won the first test in @entity46 by 95 runs .
