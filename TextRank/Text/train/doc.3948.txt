-- the year was 1890
@entity1 premiered his @entity3 ballet in @entity4
@entity5 ended his life , apparently by shooting himself
and @entity7 and @entity8 became the 43rd and 44th states of the @entity10
1890 is also the year @entity11 was born , or at least , that 's what his family and the @entity15 government claim
the @entity15 man , who lives in the town of @entity19 , in the arid highlands of @entity15 , showed @entity0 government documents that seem to confirm he 's 123 years old
the documents include a birth certificate showing his birth date as july 16 , 1890
there 's also a national identity card with the same birth date
several media outlets published stories about @entity30 calling him the oldest man alive
but there appear to be several problems with this claim
for starters , neither the birth certificate nor the national identity card is original
" we were skeptical from the beginning , " said @entity38 , a professor of gerontology at the @entity40 at the @entity41 in @entity42
he 's also the director of the @entity45 , an independent organization that tracks , monitors and verifies claims of longevity
" he 's not the real thing
@entity50 is not 123 years old despite the documents his family has shown
he was not born in the year 1890
" @entity38 said the first red flag was the fact that @entity30 is a man
the gerontologist said more than 90 % of cases of what his organization categorizes as supercentenarians are women
@entity61 from @entity62 lived to the age of 122
her case is the longest human lifespan that has been verified with several documents
according to @entity68 , there are 57 documented and verified cases of people over the age of 110 around the world
fifty - five are women and two are men
four other cases are still pending final verification
the @entity45 has found a document that purportedly shows @entity30 is actually 107 years old , and not 123
the document is a baptismal certificate
back in 1890 , the @entity15 government did n't record live births or any other demographic data , so it was up to the @entity84 to register births , deaths and marriages
in any case , the fact that @entity11 has lived for more than a century in the arid highlands of @entity15 at an altitude of more than 12,000 feet is striking
not only does he walk on his own , but his voice is still commanding
his son @entity30 , who 's 65 years old , has to speak loudly in his ear to communicate with him , but his memory seems to be in perfect shape
he does n't speak @entity97 , but his native @entity98 , an indigenous language in @entity15
" i was born here in the highlands , " @entity30 told @entity0 in @entity98 , with his son translating into @entity97
" i was not a mischievous child
i arrived as a young man in @entity19 and worked as herder and farmer
i was very happy with my wife
i never cheated on her and we were both very happy
" @entity111 ' wife lived to be over 100 years old
according to family tradition , the secret to a long life is drinking the water that flows down the @entity116 , located not far from @entity19
their diet includes no packaged or processed foods , but locally grown plants like barley and quinoa
they hunt a local fox that lives in the @entity15 mountains known regionally as " zorrino
" 80 year old becomes oldest to climb @entity127 before you get any ideas , the @entity45 has found that no particular diet , geographical location or kind of water makes people live longer
@entity38 said it 's the genes
" people who have extreme old age have virtually nothing in common
they do n't share the same religion , nutrition or exercise routine
they only have one detail in common : they have relatives who have lived a long time and children ( who ) also tend to live a long time , " @entity38 said
@entity30 said his supercentenarian father had five children , 16 grandchildren and 39 great - grandchildren
" i constantly congratulate my father , " he said
" he took care of me when i was little so i 'm now taking care of him
now it 's my turn to make sure he 's taken care of
" @entity30 is the only child of @entity162 still alive
no one in the @entity30 family doubts that the patriarch is 123 years old
there seems to be no doubt either when it comes to officials
in fact , the government of @entity15 plans to honor @entity30 by declaring him " a living heritage " of the @entity15 people .
