@entity1 chief @entity0 said his trial , which wrapped up friday , was the first time his side of the aggravated pimping case against him has been fully heard
he 'll learn june 12 whether investigative magistrates accepted his version
a verdict by the @entity10 court will be read on that date
the onetime contender for the @entity14 presidency has denied investigators ' accusations that he organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes
" for the first time , throughout these last hearings , i felt i could explain myself and i have the feeling i have been listened to , " @entity0 said
@entity0 appeared to get a boost earlier this week when the @entity10 prosecutor told the court that the defendant should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence
@entity10 prosecutor @entity28 's statement conformed with what his office said more than a year ago : that the evidence did n't support the charges
but investigative magistrates nevertheless pursued the case to trial , which began two weeks ago
investigators alleged that the sex parties , in locations such as @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , stemmed from a prostitution ring , organized from the @entity42 in @entity10
@entity0 , who was married to @entity14 tv journalist @entity43 until their divorce in 2013 , has never denied that he took part in the parties
but the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved
in testimony last week , he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda , but he denied organizing them or asking anyone else to do so for him
" i do n't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever , " he said last week
in @entity14 , prostitution is legal , but pimping is not
prosecutors allege that two other defendants , businessman @entity63 and @entity64 , a businessman friend of the former @entity66 director , picked up the bills for the sex parties
@entity0 saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in @entity38 in 2011
he was later cleared of the @entity38 allegations
before that scandal erupted , he had been on track to run for the @entity14 presidency -- an election that his @entity78 later won with @entity79 as its candidate
the @entity10 prosecutor 's office in late 2013 asked for @entity0 's case to be dismissed , citing a lack of evidence
however , the investigating magistrates did not follow its recommendations
a judgment in the case could come " within months , " @entity28 's spokeswoman , @entity88 , said tuesday
@entity2 's @entity91 contributed to this report .
