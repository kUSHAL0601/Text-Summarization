the @entity0 is preparing to be swaddled in a paralyzing blanket of ice and snow that could leave huge chunks of the region cold , slick and in the dark
" this is one of @entity12 's worst kind of storms that can be inflicted on the @entity14 , " @entity8 gov. @entity7 told reporters tuesday afternoon
it is our biggest enemy
" winter storm warnings stretched from @entity21 through @entity8 , parts of eastern @entity23 , the @entity24 and @entity25 on tuesday
a separate ice storm warning extended from the @entity8 - @entity28 state line to just west of @entity29 , @entity30 , with forecasters warning of " potentially catastrophic " accumulations in @entity8
@entity34 will suspend some of its rail service in the @entity37 , @entity14 and @entity38 regions due to the winter storm forecast , the company said in a statement
at least five people have been killed in weather - related incidents , including three people who died when an ambulance driver lost control on an icy patch of road outside of @entity48 , @entity49 , according to the state 's @entity50
the ambulance slid off the roadway into a ditch , where it rolled over , caught fire and burned , the department 's spokesman , @entity52 , said
a patient , a paramedic and one other passenger were pronounced dead on scene , he said
in @entity64 , where the northern part of the state could see up to four inches of snow , authorities blamed two traffic deaths on the storm
residents of @entity71 , @entity72 , were looking at up to a foot of snow , while mountainous southwestern @entity25 could see up to 14 inches
roads were expected to ice up early , making them impassible
" if you get even a tenth of inch of ice on a road , it 's like a skating rink , " said @entity77 , a @entity78 meteorologist in @entity79
and in @entity8 , the state 's largest utility warned that hundreds of thousands of customers could be out of power " for days " when ice - laden tree limbs crash onto electric lines
" this has the opportunity to be a huge event when you 're talking about the amount of ice you 're looking at , " @entity94 , the emergency operations chief for @entity95 , told reporters
the company expected between half an inch to an inch of ice in some parts of the state , he said
the new storm is the first test for a 32 - member severe weather task force that @entity7 created after the january 28 snowfall that brought @entity114 to a standstill and led to blistering criticism of state and municipal leaders
@entity7 said his administration has brought in an additional 180 tons of salt and sand in an effort to keep roadways open , but he urged his citizens not to put themselves " in jeopardy or danger
" a ' very unpredictable ' storm deal and his fellow governors in @entity21 , @entity64 , @entity28 , both @entity24 and @entity25 issued emergency declarations ahead of the weather
in @entity72 , gov. @entity131 said the storm was " very unpredictable " as storm warnings were extended northward early tuesday , forcing state agencies to shift their footing to face the elements
" even within the last hour , we 're seeing changes in the weather predictions , which makes it very difficult to work on logistics , " @entity131 told reporters in @entity138
but he said he was happy with how his government dealt with the late january snowstorm , " and we expect the same type of coordination , activity and teamwork
" @entity30 gov. @entity152 dispatched additional @entity154 officers to help with the expected accidents and stranded motorists on state highways , her office announced
state workers and volunteers from the @entity160 and @entity161 prepared to open shelters if needed
@entity78 forecaster @entity163 said the storm " certainly looks like it could be of historic proportions , especially in the last 10 to 20 years
" meteorologists will keep an eye across the @entity24 on tuesday evening as the temperatures there will largely dictate @entity114 's fate , he said
low temperatures are expected to sink southwest out of the @entity24 , so if the mercury drops precipitously there , it could mean trouble for @entity114 in the form of an inch of ice , he added
" you 've got to get right around 30 and ideally into the upper 20s ( for significant ice accumulation )
that certainly could happen with this system , " he said
" as for how much ice , that 's the uncertain part
" there is also a possibility of snow falling on the " backside of the system " thursday , which would further complicate matters , and once the ice starts melting , travel could be further hampered by chunks of ice breaking off overpasses , something that happened during the recent winter storm in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity163 said
" that 's going to create travel headaches as well , even after the storm is gone , " he said
travelers get another winter wallop a run on supplies as the skies turned heavy , @entity206 cleaned stores out of loaves of bread , gallons of milk , bundles of firewood and cans of beans and beer
in some stores , all that was left were the apparently less - popular corn and asparagus
after the ninth - largest @entity224 metropolitan area was humbled by january 's two inches of chaos , residents said they are n't taking any chances
@entity114 's city government announced its offices would be closed wednesday , with only essential employees expected to report to work
the @entity231 and other systems across @entity8 announced they would be closed tuesday and wednesday
and local leaders urged people to stay off the roads
" as of midnight tonight , wherever you are , you need to plan on staying there for a while , " @entity114 mayor @entity236 said tuesday afternoon
even before the first raindrops fell , @entity240 had decided to throw in the towel
" i will work from home and keep my kids home , too , " the software developer said
" it was not fun , especially with family members stranded for more than 24 hours in different places during the last storm
" @entity250 also opted for a similar strategy
" my wife and i decided a few days ago that we were going to get groceries early in the day , and we 're going to stay in , " he said
" we 're going to stick around for the next two or three days
" it took @entity250 more than seven hours to get from @entity256 near downtown @entity114 to his home in @entity258 , a northwest suburb , during the earlier storm
not going to happen this time : lessons from stranded snow survivors flights affected throughout @entity14 the system was taking its toll on air travel across the region
airlines announced more than 2,400 flight cancellations tuesday ahead of the storms
the greatest concentrations , according to @entity270 , are in airports in @entity114 , @entity71 and @entity138 - @entity272
@entity273 said tuesday that some employees at @entity114 's @entity275 would sleep on planes because there were n't enough hotel rooms for them
on wednesday , though , a @entity273 spokesman said employees did not end up sleeping on planes after all
@entity284 , sleet and rain are in the forecast through wednesday morning , with temperatures in the 30s
by wednesday , ice on the roads could make driving " hazardous or impossible , " forecasters from the @entity78 warned
the storm already dumped sleet and snow in @entity49 and @entity294 , and could bring snow as far north as @entity296 and @entity297 later in the week
@entity298 is bracing for nasty weather wednesday and thursday
when the last storm struck two weeks ago in @entity8 , roads were gridlocked almost instantaneously as commuters fled @entity114 en masse
thousands of children across northern @entity8 spent the night in schools , and countless motorists endured commutes of more than 20 hours , if they were lucky enough to get home at all
snowed out @entity114 , the @entity310 group where @entity311 asked for and offered help during the last storm , was ramping back up monday
the forum posted alerts about school closings and the possibility of power outages and tips on how to prepare for the storm
and there were also -- shall we say -- more practical tips
one featured a drift packed with a variety of brews
says the caption : " the best part about snow is that it keeps my beer extra cold
" there 's nothing like a silver lining .
