-- to most owners of the new @entity3 , the voice - activated feature called @entity4 is more than a virtual " assistant " who can help schedule appointments , find a good nearby pizza or tell you if it 's going to rain
she 's also a she
@entity4 answers questions in a part - human , part - robot voice that 's deep , briskly efficient and distinctly female
( at least in the @entity16 and four other countries
in @entity14 and the @entity15 , @entity4 is male
) people describe the app using female pronouns
her gender has even prompted some users to flood blogs and online forums with sexually suggestive questions for @entity4 such as " what are you wearing ? " ( @entity4 's baffled response : " why do people keep asking me this ? " ) the fuss over @entity4 's sex also raises a larger question : from voice - mail systems to gps devices to @entity4 and beyond , why are so many computerized voices female ? one answer may lie in biology
scientific studies have shown that people generally find women 's voices more pleasing than men 's
" it 's much easier to find a female voice that everyone likes than a male voice that everyone likes , " said @entity44 professor @entity43 , author of " @entity45 to his laptop : what @entity53
" " it 's a well - established phenomenon that the human brain is developed to like female voices
" research suggests this preference starts as early as the womb , @entity43 said
he cites a study in which fetuses were found to react to the sound of their mother 's voice but not to other female voices
the fetuses showed no distinct reaction to their father 's voice , however
another answer lies in history
according to some sources , the use of female voices in navigation devices dates back to @entity77 , when women 's voices were employed in airplane cockpits because they stood out among the male pilots
and telephone operators have traditionally been female , making people accustomed to getting assistance from a disembodied woman 's voice
when automakers were first installing automated voice prompts in cars ( " your door is ajar " ) decades ago , their consumer research found that people overwhelmingly preferred female voices to male ones , said @entity96 , a @entity97 analyst and president of @entity99 this may explain why in almost all gps navigation systems on the market , the default voice is female
one notable exception has been @entity105 , where @entity106 was forced to recall a female - voiced navigation system on its @entity109 cars in the late 1990s after being flooded with calls from @entity105 men saying they refused to take directions from a woman
" cultural stereotypes run deep , " said @entity43 , who details the @entity106 episode in his book
voice casting most companies that produce automated voices hold auditions for voice actors and collect recordings of them speaking
then they invite focus groups to listen to the recordings and rate the voices on how well they convey certain attributes : warmth , friendliness , competence and so on
" it 's casting , " @entity43 said
" it 's something @entity134 has known for a long , long time
" look no further than examples of automated or artificial - intelligence voices in sci - fi movies and tv shows
voices of authority or menace tend to be male : the homicidal hal 9000 computer in " 2001 : a @entity144 , " the computer program in " wargames , " or @entity147 , the spaceship 's autopilot function in " @entity150 " more subservient talking machines , such as the onboard computer from the " @entity155 " tv series , skew female
@entity96 , the @entity97 analyst , believes that more computerized voices would be masculine if not for the associations with @entity143 , whose malicious intent in the 1968 @entity162 film was made even creepier by his soothing tone
" a lot of tech companies stayed away from the male voice because of @entity143 , " he said
" i 've heard that theory tossed around multiple times
" ( one prominent exception : the chipper " you 've got mail ! " voice from @entity172 's dial - up days
) when it comes to consumer applications of computerized voices , the sex of the voice is usually determined by what service or product is employing it
for example , transit systems such as the @entity185 's @entity184 often use higher - pitched voices because they are easier to hear over the clatter of the train cars
@entity190 , a @entity191 - based company that develops speech technologies for @entity196 vehicles ' @entity194 system , @entity198 e-readers and other clients , creates both male and female voices
it 's then up to the client to choose which voice , and gender , best fits their product , said chief creative officer @entity206
" as these products become part of our everyday lives , there 's a huge opportunity for personalization , " added @entity207 , the company 's director of advanced speech design
" i could have an approximation of my wife 's voice read me a text message in my car
" siri : brilliant or sexist ? @entity4 , the @entity223 's voice , grew from a five - year research project that was funded by military agency @entity225 and led by @entity226 , a @entity227 research institute
the project spawned a company , also called @entity4 , that launched an @entity3 app in february 2010 and was acquired by @entity231 two months later
that original @entity4 voice - to - text app -- powered in part by @entity190 's technology -- also worked by people speaking commands into their phones , although it did n't talk back
and it had no gender
in fact , the app was originally conceived to speak in a gender - neutral voice , said @entity243 , vice president of @entity226 and a co-founder of @entity4
" what @entity231 did is absolutely brilliant , " said @entity243 , who calls speech " the most natural of all human interfaces
" " they took @entity4 and gave it more of a personality , " he said
" it 's the first real artificial intelligence working in millions of people 's hands
" an @entity231 spokeswoman declined to comment on why the company gave @entity4 a female voice in the @entity16 nor would she say why @entity4 speaks like a man in the @entity15 , where @entity223 owners have swarmed online forums to request a female voice instead
" eww ! ! @entity263 gets female voice soon , " wrote one commenter
" i do n't think anyone in the @entity16 cares about male voice option
" many gps devices and computer text - to - speech programs now offer multiple voice options
and someday soon , voice - technology experts say , @entity4 will probably speak in a variety of voices , too
until then , some bloggers have wondered : are computerized female " assistants " sexist ? not necessarily , said @entity276 , director of the @entity277 at the @entity279 's @entity278
" i think they have to be understood in a broader context in which they 're one small piece , " she wrote in an e-mail to @entity0
" voices intended to convey authority ( such as voice - over narration in films ) tend to be male
so yes , probably these compliant female robot voices reinforce gender stereotypes , not just because they serve the user but because the technology itself is about communication and relationships ( areas that women are presumed to be good at )
" i would n't automatically claim any sexism in individual companies ' choices , though
most such decisions are probably the result of market research , so they may be reflecting gender stereotypes that already exist in the general public
" @entity276 listened to some sound clips of @entity4 online , then e-mailed back again
" what 's interesting to me is how they seem to intentionally make her speech sound artificial -- they could choose to make her speech more seamless and human - like , but they choose instead to highlight the technology , " she said
" that makes you aware of how high - tech your gadget is
