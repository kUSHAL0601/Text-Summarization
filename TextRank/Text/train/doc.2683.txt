@entity11 , in a phone interview with @entity1 wednesday , said she called her son last month to say she needed $ 25,000 to pay off her mortgage , but his assistant called back and told her , " @entity3 would do a one shot deal of $ 2,000
" " i was so upset , i told her to tell @entity3 ' thank you , but no thanks
i am not some person on the street asking you for a handout , i am your mother , ' " she said
" and that was the end of that
" his sister , @entity24 , said their mother needs his help soon " so she does n't end up on the streets
" their mother lost her job last year , reducing her income to $ 600 a month and causing her to fall behind on her $ 400 monthly mortgage on her @entity36 , @entity37 , home , her daughter said
" if her mortgage is not paid by february 23 , 2012 , her home will go into foreclosure , " she said
@entity3 , meanwhile , released a statement to @entity1 wednesday night saying he was " saddened that these untrue stories about me have people questioning my commitment to my family
" the one - paragraph statement continued , " for reasons that are between us , i have not seen my mother in 11 years and outside of a random call here and there have had little to no contact with my sister
we all have personal family issues that we have to deal with in life , but i choose to deal with mine in private and not through the media
" in her interview with @entity1 , @entity11 said her son offered to pay her mortgage after she was laid off from her job last year
" i faxed him my account number and my mortgage papers , " @entity11 said
" i thought he was paying it , but after a few months i realized he did n't pay it off
" his mother said she heard through another relative that her son was angry about publicity given to the story
" my nephew said that he spoke to @entity3 and that @entity3 said he was n't going to pay me because i gave an interview , " his mother said
" i never talked to anyone
" @entity11 has five children with @entity11 's late father , @entity24 said
" she has asked all of her children for help , but we are no in a position to do so , " she said
" we all have jobs , but @entity3 is the only one in a position to help
" their mother , now 62 , says she has trouble walking , has diabetes and her unemployment benefits just expired
" it took me 30 years or more to buy a home , " she said
" at times i worked two to three jobs to support my children
they always got what they wanted , including @entity3
no one took care of them but me
" @entity3 , 43 , grew up in @entity97 , but his mother moved the family to @entity36 in 1995 , a decade after he left home , his sister said
he rose to fame as a " @entity100 " cast member and now stars on @entity103 's hit sitcom " @entity104
" " we have tried to get in contact with my brother @entity3 , but he changes his phone number all the time , so we have no way of talking to him , " she said
his mother said she did not understand why @entity11 " chose himself not to be with the family
" " no one did anything to him , " she said
" ... i am not trying to hurt @entity3
i love my children to death
