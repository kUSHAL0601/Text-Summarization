" the entire cast and crew are extremely upset and feel taken advantage of by the producer , " they said in a statement to @entity0 about the movie , " @entity13
" " we are 100 % not behind this film and were grossly misled about its intent and purpose , " continued the statement , which was sent to @entity0 by a member of the production staff who asked not to be identified for security reasons
" we are shocked by the drastic rewrites of the script and lies that were told to all involved
we are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have occurred
" mystery swirls around anti-islam film four americans , including @entity33 ambassador @entity32 , were killed tuesday in @entity34 amid a regional furor over the film , which mocks @entity6 's prophet
a casting call published in july 2011 in @entity39 and in other publications for actors identifies the working title of the movie as " desert warrior " and describes it as a " historical @entity46 adventure film
" an actress in the film who asked not to be identified said the original script did not include a @entity51 character
she added that she and other actors complained that their lines had been changed
the actress said she spoke wednesday with the producer , who is identified in the advertisement as @entity13
" he said he wrote the script because he wants the @entity59 to quit killing , " she said
" i had no idea he was doing all this
" " i would never be involved in a film to ever hurt or bring harm to anybody , " she told @entity0
" this makes me sick to my stomach to think that i was involved in that movie that brought death to somebody else
" the actress said the character of @entity51 in the movie was identified as @entity75 when it was shot , and that she returned afterward and read other lines that may have been dubbed into the piece
@entity78 restricts video access over @entity34 violence a member of the production staff who worked directly on the film and has a copy of the original script corroborated the actor 's account , adding that it mentions neither @entity51 nor @entity6
the @entity89 identified the filmmaker as @entity91 , an @entity92 - @entity33 real estate developer
the @entity89 reported that , in its telephone interview with @entity91 , he characterized his film as " a political effort to call attention to the hypocrisies of @entity6
" " @entity6 is a cancer , " he told the newspaper
" the movie is a political movie
it 's not a religious movie
" @entity0 has not been able to contact @entity91 and can not verify that he made the movie
a @entity0 search of public records on @entity91 came up empty
@entity92 's @entity107 said it does n't know who @entity91 is
reaction : @entity34 , @entity111 condemn killing " this guy is totally anonymous
at this point no one can confirm he holds @entity92 citizenship and even if he did we are not involved , " ministry spokesman @entity114 said
" no @entity92 institution , government department or office has any involvement in this
this guy acted on his own behalf
" in @entity125 and @entity34 , mobs targeted @entity33 missions and blamed @entity33 for the film
in the end , @entity32 and three other @entity33 in the @entity34 city of @entity129 were dead , although it was not clear whether that attack was solely incited by the film
consultant @entity134 told @entity0 he worked with @entity91 on the movie and said the filmmaker had gone into hiding
" he 's very depressed , and he 's upset , " @entity134 said wednesday
" i talked to him this morning , and he said that he was very concerned for what happened to the ambassador
" @entity134 , however , said it was not the film 's fault that protests had turned bloody
casting further doubt on the filmmaker 's identity , the @entity144 quoted @entity134 as saying @entity91 is a pseudonym and " he did not know @entity91 's real name
" @entity0 could not immediately reach @entity134 for his response to that report
an online trailer for the film depicts @entity6 as a fraudulent religion bent on getting rid of nonbelievers
cartoonish scenes show @entity51 as a womanizer , child molester and ruthless killer
other scenes show security forces ordered to do nothing as rampaging @entity59 destroy @entity165 homes , and a donkey anointed the first @entity59 animal
many @entity59 find any depiction of @entity51 to be offensive -- a @entity171 newspaper 's publication in 2005 of @entity51 caricatures triggered riots -- and derogatory depictions of the prophet are considered by some to be worse
" the film is offensive to the prophet and immoral , " said @entity125 prime minister @entity176
" we call on the great people of @entity125 to exercise restraint when expressing their anger
" @entity59 sensitivities around @entity51 the prime minister called on the @entity33 to take legal action against the makers of the film , though it was not clear that it violates any @entity33 law
according to @entity89 , @entity91 said he raised $ 5 million from about 100 @entity191 donors to make the two - hour movie in @entity193 last year
based on the trailer , the movie appears to have been produced on a low budget
the movie , which was posted in july on @entity78 , got more notice after @entity125 television recently aired segments and anti-islam activists , including @entity125 - born @entity202 , promoted it online
@entity203 , the @entity204 pastor whose @entity205 - burning last year sparked deadly riots in @entity207 , said he had been contacted to help distribute the film
" the film is not intended to insult the @entity59 community , but it is intended to reveal truths about @entity51 that are possibly not widely known , " @entity203 said
" it is very clear that @entity217 did not influence him ( @entity51 ) in the writings of the @entity205 , " said @entity203 , who went on to blame @entity59 ' fear of criticism for the protests , rather than the film
gen. @entity220 , chairman of the @entity221 , called @entity203 on wednesday to ask him to withdraw his support for the film , according to col. @entity224 , @entity220 's spokesman
" @entity203 ' support of the film risks causing more violence and death , " @entity224 said
tensions mounted wednesday as the @entity33 deployed @entity230 to @entity34
@entity125 's @entity231 -- the former party of @entity125 president @entity232 -- has called for peaceful protests against the film on friday , @entity6 's day of religious observance
in @entity207 , the @entity236 charged that the movie was made with the permission of the @entity33 government
the @entity240 prohibits the government from interfering with free expression
president @entity242 condemned the film as abhorrent and an act of desecration
" there could be many deaths once news of this video and pastor @entity203 ' comments get out , " said @entity242 's deputy spokesman
the issue is sensitive in @entity207 , where throngs of people this year protested @entity256 's burning of @entity257 at @entity258
@entity33 president @entity259 said the act was unintentional , but the uproar nonetheless was huge
in @entity33 , a @entity59 advocacy group called the movie " trashy " and said its producers represented neither the @entity33 nor the @entity165 faith
" we urge that this ignorant attempt to provoke the religious feelings of @entity59 in the arabic - speaking world be ignored and that its extremist producers not be given the cheap publicity they so desperately seek , " said the @entity266
@entity272 sprouted several pages dedicated to condemning the film , including one called " israelis , @entity191 & @entity33 against @entity91 's ' @entity276
" a post on that page simply said : " @entity279
" witnessing protests in @entity34 or @entity125 ? share your photos on @entity283
