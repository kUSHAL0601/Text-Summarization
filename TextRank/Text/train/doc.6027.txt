-- protesters carried a @entity3 flag stained with fake blood in the country 's capital this week -- a symbol , they said , of president @entity9 's six - year term
just a few hours later , @entity3 television broadcast video of the outgoing president brushing his hand across a pristine flag as triumphant music played in the background
the images showed two drastically different interpretations of @entity9 's legacy : a fed - up public that has grown weary of a brutal drug war ; and a president who maintains that his fight against organized crime was necessary and , by some measures , successful
" i leave having accomplished my duty and responsibility to serve @entity3 , " said @entity9 , whose term ends this week
" i have worked to leave a stronger , healthier country , with a better justice system and a solid economy
" but activists offered a much harsher assessment , staging a protest in @entity34 dubbed " a @entity35 : a six - year term of death
" " @entity9 leaves as a traitor to the country , as the president of devastation and contempt , " the @entity39 said in a statement , slamming @entity9 's " clumsy attempt to reduce crime
" @entity3 's new leader to @entity0 : the key weapon in drug war @entity9 : we had to make ' difficult decisions ' in his farewell address , broadcast wednesday night , the president thanked the country 's public officials , military and police for " defending @entity3 families
" @entity9 noted that his government had passed universal health care and kept @entity3 's economy stable in the face of the global financial crisis
but he did not explicitly mention the controversial six - year crackdown on drug cartels that began in 2006 , when he deployed federal troops to fight organized crime
the battle became a hallmark of his tenure , and has sparked mounting criticism in recent years
government statistics estimate that 47,500 people have died in drug - related violence since @entity9 took office
more : how the drug war started the @entity3 government has not released official figures since january , and others estimate a much higher death toll
officials have repeatedly said that brutal battles between rival cartels fueled the violence
and in earlier speeches , @entity9 has noted that 25 of the country 's 37 most - wanted drug traffickers were killed or captured during his tenure
" thanks to all @entity3 for your understanding before the very difficult decisions that we had to make in order to face so many complicated challenges , " @entity9 said in his address
" beyond my capabilities and limitations , i assure you that i have put all my willingness and understanding to work toward the common good of @entity3
" a recent national survey by the @entity3 firm @entity100 ( @entity101 ) revealed that nearly 66 % of @entity3 questioned believe that drug traffickers were winning the organized crime fight
in that same survey , 52 % of the 2,000 - person sample questioned said they approved of @entity9 's approach to combating cartels
analysts offer different assessments of whether @entity9 's drug war strategy worked
some have argued that the president entered the battle without realizing the enemy 's capabilities
" i think the adversary was larger and more harmful than we thought , " security expert @entity117 told @entity0 en @entity118 in 2010
" it was much more capable of responding to the government 's strategy , and getting stronger
" others have said @entity9 had no choice but to move forward
" when @entity9 came to power , it was already going on
the only option was to use the army and the federal police
if he had n't done it ... in no time you would have organized crime controlling the country , " @entity131 , who studies security at @entity3 's @entity133 in @entity134 , said last year
" if he had waited until the army and police were prepared , @entity3 would have more kidnappings , more extortion
he had no other option
it was a bad option , but the others were worse
" defiant former @entity3 mayor assassinated but critics , like the peace movement that protested wednesday , have said @entity9 's administration has n't done enough to help the drug war 's victims
and activists have accused his government of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses committed by police and troops fighting the drug war
in his september state of the union address , @entity9 defended his approach , and said abuses by authorities combating cartels were the exception , not the rule
" and far from hiding them , " he said , " in all the cases that were brought to light , action was taken against those responsible
" this week , in his home state of @entity172 , where @entity9 first announced his crackdown on cartels , banners with farewell messages addressed to him hung from prominent bridges
they were purportedly signed by the @entity178 , a splinter cartel that surged in the state last year
@entity9 heads to @entity180 president - elect @entity181 , who takes office saturday , has said he plans to take a different approach , focusing on reducing violence
he has offered few specifics about how his security policies will differ from @entity9 's strategy , but he 's said that change is coming
" we will keep the policies that i think work , " @entity181 said this week , " including cooperation with the @entity193 to effectively fight organized crime
" as @entity181 prepared to take the reins this week , @entity3 learned the answer to a question that has been the subject of much speculation : where will @entity9 go , now that his term is ending ? @entity180 's @entity201 announced wednesday that the outgoing @entity3 president will spend the next year as a global public leaders fellow at the school
" president @entity9 is a vivid example of a dynamic and committed public servant , who took on major challenges in @entity3 , " @entity205 , the school 's dean , said in a statement
hours after the announcement , a @entity3 researcher who is studying ethics and corruption at @entity180 this year said university officials should reconsider the move
" i am alarmed that @entity180 will protect a person as unethical as @entity9 , " @entity219 wrote in a @entity221 post
@entity223 , who is a fellow this year at @entity180 's @entity224 and also heads a corruption and transparency research laboratory at @entity3 's @entity227 , said she was hoping others at @entity180 would join her in protesting @entity9 's appointment
the outgoing president , she told @entity0 , does not deserve the one - year fellowship
" he is handing over a country in flames , " she said
at the end of the video released by the @entity3 president 's office wednesday , @entity9 strides down the steps of his official residence
" as a citizen i will continue serving the country passionately until the end of my days , always grateful for the privilege i have been given to be @entity3
many thanks , and see you soon , @entity3 , " the president says
he looks up toward a flag , fluttering in the sky
@entity0 en @entity249 's @entity248 and @entity250 , and @entity252 's @entity251 contributed to this report .
