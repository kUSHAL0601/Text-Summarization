@entity1 , @entity0 -- members of a @entity6 leftist rebel group released two more longtime prisoners wednesday afternoon , bringing the total released since february 9 to six , the @entity3 said
the @entity10 , known by the @entity12 acronym @entity10 , freed police maj. @entity13 and @entity16 cpl. @entity15 on wednesday afternoon in a rural area located in the departments of @entity19 and @entity20 in southwest @entity0 , the @entity9 said in a news release
@entity13 had spent three years and eight months in captivity ; @entity24 had been held for two years and eight months , it said
both men were handed over to former sen. @entity26 , @entity3 representatives and a member of the group @entity29 , the @entity9 said
the freed men were being taken to the city of @entity33 in a helicopter donated by the government of @entity36
from there , they were to travel to @entity1 to reunite with their families
" it pleases us that the relatives can be with their loved ones whom they have been waiting for for a long time , " said @entity40 , the @entity3 's chief in @entity0
" we are very satisfied that , in the end , the agreements assumed by the sides , as much by the @entity6 government as by the @entity10 , have been carried out
" with the handover , the number of people freed by the @entity10 since february 9 rises to six , the @entity9 said
the releases came three days after an initial attempt to retrieve the hostages failed when coordinates for their location proved to be inaccurate
@entity13 , @entity24 , and police patrolman @entity58 were to have be released sunday , but only @entity58 was freed
@entity6 authorities were upset at what they said were wrong coordinates given by the @entity63 guerrilla group
in december , the @entity10 pledged to release five hostages as a humanitarian gesture
wednesday 's releases surpassed that number by one
some have suggested the hostage releases could fuel renewed negotiations between @entity0 's government and the rebels
one of the freed hostages called for dialogue between the government and insurgents
" humanitarian exchange is the first step toward a friendly understanding , which permits the return of our brothers deprived of their liberty , " politician @entity77 said last week after his release
but @entity6 president @entity86 has sharply criticized the @entity10 , accusing the group of having a " double standard " and creating an " absurd media show " in order to draw sympathy to its cause
he said last week that he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the @entity0 company had been kidnapped the night before in southwestern @entity0 .
