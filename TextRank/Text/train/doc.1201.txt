an operation targeting @entity1 is under way in @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity5 , a high - level @entity5 government official who is being briefed on the strikes told @entity8 on monday
the official said that the scale of the strikes against @entity1 is " massive and unprecedented " and that at least 30 militants have been killed
the operation involved @entity5 commandos who are now " going after high - level @entity1 targets , " the official said
a day earlier , suspected drone strikes targeted @entity1 fighters in @entity5 for the second time in two days , killing " at least a dozen , " the government official said
the predawn strikes targeted a mountain ridge in the southern province of @entity3 , the official said
it 's the same area where scores of followers of @entity1 had gathered recently to hear from @entity28 , the head of the terrorist network 's @entity5 branch and the global organization 's " crown prince , " the official said
" it 's too early to tell how many militants were killed , but the number is at least a dozen , " the official said
the targets included " foreign nationals , " the official said , but he provided no details of what their nationalities were
nor was it clear whether any high - value targets were among the dead and wounded , he said
@entity5 's state news agency @entity47 said three strikes targeted an @entity1 training camp in the village of @entity51 , about 450 kilometers ( 280 miles ) south of the capital @entity53
the fighters were " preparing to launch attacks against @entity5 and foreign interests in the area , " according to a statement from the country 's @entity58
" these strikes destroyed the training facility completely and killed both @entity5 and foreign members , " it said
the official said sunday 's raid was a joint @entity68 - @entity5 operation
he would not confirm whether drones were used in the attack , but the @entity68 is the only country known to have conducted drone strikes in @entity5 -- and as a rule , @entity68 officials do n't comment on those strikes
but the official said the area is so rugged and mountainous that @entity5 troops would have faced heavy losses in any ground assault
@entity81 operatives had fled to the area after a 2012 push by government troops , backed by the @entity68 , he said
the high - level official said it would take time to fully clarify the details of the weekend 's strikes -- whether the raids targeted camps , vehicles on the move or both , the full death toll among the militants , and whether there were any civilian casualties
a saturday drone strike in a neighboring province killed at least 10 suspected @entity1 militants , but also killed three civilian day laborers
but other @entity5 officials , who asked to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak to the media , said there was growing frustration within the government about the lack of clarity and expressed concern that some of the information being reported by the military may be propaganda
" i 'm worried this is an attempt to convince @entity5 that the @entity68 and @entity5 have turned a corner and are in the process of destroying @entity1 , " one of those other officials said
" at this hour , the numbers of militants being reported as being killed keeps changing , and we still are n't sure if any civilians have been killed or wounded in these strikes
" " @entity5 are smart enough to doubt initial reports of this type , " he added
" if this does turn out to be exaggeration , it will make the people here trust their government even less than they do and fuel growing anger over the drone program
" the @entity68 first used armed drones to pick off an @entity1 operative in @entity5 in 2002
strikes on suspected @entity1 figures resumed in 2009 , with more than 100 reported since then , according to the @entity139 , a @entity68 - based think tank that tracks the raids
those strikes have killed somewhere between 700 and 1,000 people , including at least 81 civilians , the foundation says
did the @entity68 miss top @entity1 meeting in @entity5 ?
