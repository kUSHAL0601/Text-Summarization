@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's wireless network will face major challenges " in the short term " unless the carrier is able to begin integrating @entity8 's infrastructure , said @entity4 ceo @entity10
he did n't specify an exact timeframe for when his company 's problems could compound but acknowledged that the network 's needs must be addressed in less than three years
@entity4 announced plans to acquire the @entity18 @entity8 unit from @entity19 on sunday in a $ 39 billion transaction
" with this deal , we 're set " for both the short and long haul , @entity10 said in a brief interview on tuesday
analysts predict that @entity4 could see major scrutiny from the regulating bodies that must approve the deal
however , it 's unclear how long that process might draw out
" one of the key drivers ( for the deal ) was the need for additional spectrum , " he said on a panel at the @entity34 conference
" it resolves the pending spectrum challenges that we 're facing in major cities
" wireless spectrum is the airwaves on which cellular signals travel
without enough spectrum , phone calls can get dropped and internet surfing can slow to a crawl when too many gadgets are trying to connect at the same time
people in the industry talk of an impending " spectrum crunch
" @entity56 chairman @entity55 dedicated a large part of his speech at this week 's mobile conference to the topic
" unleashing more spectrum must be a national priority , " he said
" every day we are not freeing up spectrum for mobile broadband is a day with real costs to our economy
" the @entity56 is one regulator , along with the @entity68 , that will review @entity4 's acquisition proposal
@entity55 declined in his speech to comment on the deal
he promoted the idea for broadcasters to auction their spectrum -- something he 's championed but has n't succeeded in implementing
however , @entity76 cto @entity75 is n't feeling a spectrum crunch
he said @entity76 secured ample airwaves at the @entity56 auction in 2008 , when the company spent an estimated $ 9.6 billion
" we bet pretty big with the 700 megahertz spectrum that we bought , and we feel that that gives us a very good path forward for @entity85 , " @entity75 said
" there is not a @entity76 spectrum concern in the short term
" at that same auction , @entity4 paid $ 6.6 billion , analysts said then , in addition to the $ 2.5 billion spent to acquire @entity92 earlier that year
@entity4 is positioning the @entity8 purchase as a proactive move to alleviate overflow in major cities
poor service quality in cities such as @entity99 and @entity100 has been a criticism lobbed at @entity4 over the past several years
@entity102 , the @entity4 executive , said he expects @entity76 will face issues down the road if it does n't continue to aggressively buy spectrum
" you wait and see , " he said
@entity76 's forecast determines that its network will be stable until 2015 before it will need to buy more or free up spectrum from its own holdings , @entity75 said
that 's despite @entity113 data usage being " a little bit higher than what we had expected , " he said
" we feel we 're in pretty good shape for the next three to four years
" @entity75 was also unimpressed with @entity4 's pledge to expand the rollout of its faster @entity85 network to 95 % of the @entity18 population from 80 % if federal regulators approve the @entity8 merger
" from my view , that 's old news , " @entity75 said of @entity4 's promise
@entity76 had set a deadline in 2013 for when its own version of that network technology will match its 3g coverage , which blankets about 97 % of @entity18
@entity76 's @entity85 began deployment in december , currently covers 59 cities and will add 88 more by the end of the year .
