president @entity1 's upcoming budget plan , which according to senior administration officials will include proposed changes to @entity4 and @entity5 plus some new tax increases in an effort for the president to reach a deal with @entity10 on deficit reduction , quickly drew criticism from liberal groups on friday
the progressive group @entity14 labeled the president 's proposed changes to @entity4 as " unconscionable " and @entity17 called the cuts " profoundly disturbing
" " millions of @entity14 members did not work night and day to put president @entity1 into office so that he could propose policies that would hurt some of our most vulnerable people , " read a statement from @entity20 , executive director of the group
boehner blasts reported @entity1 budget as ' wrong direction ' the budget will include an offer @entity1 made to house speaker @entity34 in december , officials said
that proposal included $ 400 billion in savings to @entity5 over 10 years
@entity1 follows up on past call to bolster @entity39 infrastructure " the president 's budget to be presented on wednesday will show how we can invest in the things we need to grow our economy , create jobs and strengthen the middle class while further reducing the deficit in a balanced way , " a senior administration official said
but @entity34 said he and the president were never able to reach an agreement because @entity1 's " offers never lived up to his rhetoric , " a reality he said still exists
" when the president visited the @entity58 last month , @entity56 @entity10 stated a desire to find common ground and urged him not to make savings we agree upon conditional on another round of tax increases
if reports are accurate , the president has not heeded that call , " @entity34 said in a statement
for @entity4 , @entity1 plans to propose a switch to a key @entity10 request called " chained @entity70 , " which is an inflation formula
@entity1 seeks $ 100m to unlock mysteries of the brain proponents say chained @entity70 is a more accurate way to measure inflation than the way it 's done now , which they say overstates growth in consumer prices
some critics have said chained @entity70 is not a better way to measure inflation for @entity4 recipients , because they spend so much on health care , which rises faster than inflation
the geeky debt fix that might work other highlights : - the new budget would lead to $ 1.8 trillion in savings in 10 years and replace the forced budget cuts that took effect on march 1 , also known as the sequester
- the budget includes funding for initiatives that @entity1 outlined in his @entity98 address , including universal access to prekindergarten education
that move would be paid for by increases to cigarette taxes
so far , forced spending cuts not as bad as advertised - the plan would also close a current loophole that allows people to collect disability and unemployment benefits at the same time , a move that could create savings for the government , officials said
@entity1 's budget was due in february
previously @entity56 officials would only say the budget was coming the week of april 8 , without revealing a specific date
republicans were sharply critical of the delay , which came after protracted negotiations over spending cuts and tax rates
opinion : @entity1 's slow growth economy is n't good enough
