with two days to go before the @entity1 open in the @entity3 city of @entity4 , more than half of @entity6 think a terrorist attack on the @entity8 is likely , a poll shows
the results of the @entity12 / @entity11 poll come a day after @entity6 officials said they had specific reasons to worry about security in @entity3
meanwhile , @entity3 state media reported wednesday that the suspected mastermind of twin bomb attacks in the city of @entity20 was killed in a police operation in the restive @entity23 republic of @entity24
the man died in a shootout at a house in the town of @entity31 , the official @entity26 news agency said
the attacks on @entity20 's public transit system in late december left 34 people dead and about 100 injured -- and sparked wide concern about security in @entity3
of those surveyed for the @entity12 / @entity11 poll , 57 % said a terrorist attack on the @entity38 was likely
that compares with the 51 % who believed before the 1996 @entity41 started in @entity42 that a terrorist act would occur
sadly , the latter prediction proved true
the survey of more than 1,000 @entity6 , carried out on friday and sunday , also revealed some wider negative views about @entity3 and its leader , president @entity47
it found that 54 % have an unfavorable view of @entity47 , making him one of the least popular foreign leaders among @entity6
currently , 55 % of those polled also have an unfavorable view of @entity3 -- representing a downward turn from 2011 , when more than half those surveyed viewed the country favorably
a controversial " anti-gay propaganda " law passed by @entity3 lawmakers last summer may be a factor in that shift
only 13 % of @entity6 think the @entity6 should have a law similar to the one in @entity3 -- which makes it illegal to make positive comments about gays and lesbians within children 's earshot -- with 86 % opposed , the survey indicated
supporters of gay rights group @entity70 are staging events wednesday in 20 cities across 14 countries to call on @entity76 sponsors to denounce @entity3 's anti-gay laws
@entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , @entity3 , are among the cities where demonstrators will gather
by contrast , a survey by @entity3 's independent @entity87 found that 53 % of @entity3 think their country did " the right thing " by bidding to hold the @entity38 , the state - run @entity84 news agency reported
but only about a third said @entity3 should seek to hold the @entity41 as well , compared with 43 % who disliked the idea , the survey indicated
respondents highlighted concerns about opportunities for graft and corruption
@entity76 torch reaches @entity4 concerns about security , human rights issues and the readiness of @entity4 accommodations have dogged media coverage leading up to the @entity8
but for many @entity3 , the chance to hold the @entity1 for only the second time on @entity3 soil is a source of great pride
the @entity76 torch arrived in @entity4 on wednesday , the culmination of a 123 - day relay that has seen it cover nearly 35,000 miles ( 56,000 kilometers ) , held aloft by some 14,000 people
along the way , it has been carried to the top of @entity118 's tallest mountain , @entity119 , and to the bottom of the world 's biggest freshwater lake , @entity123 in @entity124
back in november , the torch was also taken on its first spacewalk , after blasting off for the @entity127 from @entity3 's @entity128
two cosmonauts carried the torch -- unlit for safety reasons -- through the space station and outside in space
having reached @entity4 , it will be used to light the cauldron in the opening ceremony friday evening
then , @entity3 authorities hope , the focus should shift to the feats of sporting excellence performed by athletes from around the world
one @entity6 medal hopeful , two - time olympic gold medalist @entity143 , has announced he is withdrawing from the slopestyle competition , according to the official @entity38 website
the champion snowboarder said he wants to focus on winning a gold medal in the halfpipe competition
just over half of @entity6 say it is important to them that the @entity6 wins more medals than any other country , according to the @entity12 / @entity11 poll
the @entity87 poll of @entity3 found that 57 % expect the host country to rank in the top three in the overall medal count , @entity84 said
specific threats @entity3 has worked hard to reassure the athletes , officials and spectators converging on @entity4 that they will be kept safe
a " ring of steel " has been in place around the @entity166 resort city for almost a month
@entity3 security forces have also cracked down on suspected militants in @entity24 and elsewhere in recent weeks , after the december bombings in @entity20
but not everyone is convinced
speaking at a @entity175 hearing tuesday , @entity172 , director of the @entity173 , highlighted concern about the @entity8 and whether @entity178 fundamentalists in disputed regions of @entity3 -- or other groups -- could launch deadly attacks on selected targets
" there are a number of specific threats of varying degrees of credibility that we 're tracking , " he said
" and we 're working very closely with the @entity3 and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those
" officials in @entity191 said tuesday that two female members of its @entity1 team had received a threat
greater danger outside @entity4 ? @entity196 said the primary threat came from the @entity198 , or @entity198 , which he described as probably the most prominent terror group in @entity3
" it 's made its intent clear to seek to carry out attacks in the runup to the @entity8 , " he said
" we think the greater danger from a terrorist perspective is in potential for attacks to occur outside of the actual venues for the @entity8 themselves , in the area surrounding @entity4 or outside of @entity4 in the region
" @entity6 president @entity214 was briefed tuesday on @entity6 efforts to support security in @entity4
" he was assured by his team that they are taking all appropriate steps regarding the safety of @entity6
he directed them to continue to work closely with the @entity3 government and other partners toward a secure and successful @entity38 , and to review carefully and act on any new information that might affect the security of the @entity8 , " a @entity221 statement said .
