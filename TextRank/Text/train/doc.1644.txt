-- a baseball tradition is about to end
this week , @entity2 announced it would no longer allow the use of chewing tobacco when fans are present
if you 've got it , says the league , you 've got to conceal it
since baseball became a professional sport in the mid- 19th century , players and coaches have been tucking tobacco between their gums and cheeks and spitting out brown saliva
it 's a ritual that has permeated the game
@entity21 coach @entity20 remembers the first time he was offered a " chaw " of tobacco , as they call it
it was 50 years ago when @entity20 left his junior year at @entity28 to sign a deal to play shortstop for the @entity32 ' minor league team
he got a $ 20,000 signing bonus
" everyone was chewing tobacco in the minors , " @entity20 says
" it was almost like an initiation
you knew the major leaguers did it
" and everyone in the minors dreamed of the majors , including @entity20
@entity20 ' first day on the team , an older player offered him some tobacco
why did so many players use it ? " i do n't know
maybe they thought it would help you be a better ballplayer
or maybe it just made you feel like a better ballplayer , " @entity53 recalls
it made me sick right out of the chute
" @entity20 played with the @entity32 farm team
just like his father , who played more than a decade in the minors , @entity20 dreamed of playing in the majors
he recalls a story about chewing tobacco that his father passed down that may shed light on the roots of that baseball tradition
" it was a couple years before i was born : around 1937 or ' 38 , shortly after they built the old ballpark in @entity71 , @entity72 , " @entity20 said
" my father was in the bullpen a lot
the ballpark 's right field wall backed up to the @entity78
young ladies who lived near the stadium would flirt with the guys in the bullpen and occasionally throw ' em tobacco
" could that be where the term bullpen derived ? @entity85 chewing tobacco ? the story sounds like good old - fashioned folklore
" this is a story i 've lived with , " says @entity53
" you hear stories in your family so much they become true
" @entity20 ' father left home during the @entity95 and became a minor league player by 16
during @entity97 , @entity20 ' father was playing for the @entity98 in aa baseball
then he was drafted by the @entity100
after the war , he signed up for the @entity102 , which periodically interrupted his 13 - year baseball career
@entity20 ' father had combat infantry badges from @entity97 , @entity105 and @entity106
he did n't chew tobacco
" when he came back from @entity106 , he quit , " @entity20 said
" he never smoked or drank again
" @entity20 ' grandparents raised him warning him that the men in the family had problems with alcohol
" i was afraid to start drinking
i did n't want to become an alcoholic
i had a great desire to excel
i did n't have my first drink until i was 30
" and so , @entity20 , without chewing , without smoking , without drinking , played the minors and dreamed of the majors
after playing for 10 years , he realized , the @entity32 were never going to call him up from the farm league
they told him , ' we do n't want you to be a major league player
we want you to be a major league coach
' that meant coaching for a long time in the minors
so he honed his skills in the minors , developing young talent the way he wishes he 'd been developed , learning from the mistakes that the men who should have been his mentors made
" i was 30 - something
i had n't made it to the majors
a minor league manager for @entity32 was a lonely job
you did n't have a staff of coaches
by then , i thought i could handle anything
so i started having a few beers to relax after the game
" before he got too deep into drinking , @entity20 made a call for a new job , a new route to the majors
the @entity21 answered the call
@entity20 became the team 's third - base coach
but his ascent hit a very big roadblock
the one his family warned about
in 1988 , upper management realized he had a problem with alcohol
he was determined not to be derailed
" i found myself in a rehab center in @entity164 , just in the nick of time , " @entity20 said
" i 'd spent a lot of time trying to get to the top of this game , so i was gon na get help
it 's not like it 's going to go away
but i 'll always be an alcoholic
" @entity20 made it back to sobriety
and he made it back to the majors
he 's been coaching with the @entity21 for the past 37 years , with over half a century working in baseball
a number of years were as a pitching coach , in the bullpen , where his father had spent so much time as a catcher
even before @entity2 announced this week that there would be no more tobacco chewing within sight of the fans , teams would bring in well - known players such as @entity189 , a former @entity190 outfielder , to tell players about his tobacco chewing days and the throat cancer he battled
the league was committed to advising players on the dangers of smoking and drinking
@entity20 has continued to follow in the tradition of his father
like his father , @entity20 writes books
his latest is " @entity201
" like his father , he did n't chew tobacco
like his father , he quit drinking and is proud to say he has n't had a drink in 25 years
unlike his father , @entity20 made it to the majors and remains with the @entity21
at 71 , @entity20 still goes to spring training and coaches all the home games
" i help coaches if they have questions -- if i can help them -- through my experience
" @entity20 dreamed of the majors
he kept dreaming , until he got there .
