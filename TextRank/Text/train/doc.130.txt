@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is an @entity1 programmer and entrepreneur who is regarded as one of the fathers of modern internet security
he got his first job writing software at the age of 12 , and by 1993 , at the age of 24 , he formed the internet security company @entity12 with two business partners and a borrowed computer in his associate 's grandmother 's apartment in @entity0
@entity12 created the first firewall using " stateful inspection " -- the second - generation of firewall technology widely used today
in the years since , hacking has become big business -- one of the fastest growing areas of crime , according to @entity28 , with an estimated global cost of $ 1 trillion a year
read : materials that magically mend themselves as a result , his company @entity12 now has grown to boast nearly 3,000 staff and accounts for one third of the global security software market , with its security software used by every @entity40 company
" in 1993 , most people did n't know what the @entity41 is all about , " says @entity3 , who sensed the @entity41 would be big but had no idea it would grow to become as central to modern life as it has
" i never imagined the @entity41 to have such a huge effect on the world or for @entity12 to be a company that sells for nearly a billion - and - a - half dollars today , " he said
but as vital as the @entity41 -- and by extension , cyber security -- has become to our lives , few of us really have a handle on how it works
here , @entity3 explains of some of the basic concepts
what 's a firewall ? a firewall is a piece of software or hardware that protects the security of a computer network -- be it a home or business network -- by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic between the network and the rest of the @entity41
some form of security is necessary to protect computer networks from hackers
" basically , a simple system connected to the @entity41 , every hacker can break in in a few seconds
you put some layers of security ; the efforts required to break in are becoming bigger
" a firewall works by analyzing incoming data packets and determining whether they should be allowed through

" it knows how to analyze the traffic and basically classify each type of connection
" today , firewalls are becoming increasingly complicated , says @entity3
" there are multiple layers and you need to provide ... many different types of protection , many different types of the system , " he says
" today , the firewall does probably ten more things : it knows how to encrypt your traffic when you communicate with mobile devices , it knows how to scan the data for potential leakage ... it knows how to look for very sophisticated attacks ; it knows how to look for bots
" what are bots ? also known as web robots , bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the @entity41 , and are often used for malicious purposes
" bots are small software agents that sit on our personal computers
they hide there , they communicate with their operator which tells them what bad things to do , " says @entity3
bots can often be disguised in legitimate - looking content to infect vulnerable computer networks

" computers infected with malicious bots can be by directed by the third party controlling them -- known as a " bot herder " -- to perform tasks en masse , such as a distributed denial of service , or @entity147 attack
in a @entity147 attack , massive networks of infected " zombie " computers are directed to target a system with traffic , overloading and effectively crashing the targeted network
how has the threat environment changed ? " twenty years ago , the typical hacker was like a student trying to show his technical skills with no bad intentions , " says @entity3
" today it 's governments , sophisticated organizations
" he said that " every business today is facing hundreds , if not thousands of attacks everyday
and these attacks can go from small things that slow you down to bad things that will stop your business right away immediately
" that motivation can be political , it can be financial -- stealing data or things like that
" the extortion could take the form of a threat to take down a network if a sum was not paid , or a more subtle approach
" we 've seen several cases where somebody calls an organization and says ' i 'm a security researcher , i 've found that your company is being targeted
i 'll let you know how to block it if you pay me my consulting fees
' it can start from small amounts , $ 5000 , $ 15000
" but while large companies and governments were obvious and attractive targets , home computer users were just as vulnerable , as general attacks were aimed at security vulnerabilities , rather than specific targets
" the general break - ins are not happening by targeted attacks , by somebody trying to attack you or your organization
the general attacks ( come through ) tools that scan the @entity41 and find the place to break in -- and wherever they can break in , they 'll break into
are there any new approaches to the problem ? @entity3 's company has a new product called @entity219 , which it bills as the first collaborative approach to fighting cybercrime
" one of the things we realized about two years ago is that today every company , every person in the world fights cyber threats individually
we all install systems , we 're all being attacked , in many cases , by the same people , thousands of times a day
" so what we came up with was that idea of a threat cloud
and @entity219 is like a collaboration network -- whenever a customer network sees an attack or sees something suspicious , it reports to the @entity219 service ( which ) analyzes threats from multiple sources
" if it finds out that it 's actually an attack , it can automatically update the rest of the world and let everybody enjoy that intelligence , that know - how that some attack has been happening and everybody should block that source
