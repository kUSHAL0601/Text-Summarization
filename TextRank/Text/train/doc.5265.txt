-- for much of the next 10 days , the center of the baseball universe will not be @entity3 or @entity4 but @entity5 , where the scrappy , longshot @entity6 will be playing in the @entity8 for the first time in 29 years
that 's right , doubters : @entity5
@entity5 ! @entity12 , part " @entity5 , " to cite just two of its nicknames
to snooty coastal @entity18 , it 's a flyover city , an indistinct heartland burg famous for ... well , nothing
but take a closer look and its humble @entity23 charms come into focus
like a yoga master , @entity5 sits perfectly centered in @entity18 's midsection , surrounded on all sides by subtle prairie beauty
it straddles the @entity30 , and not one , but two states
even its people are decent -- if @entity33 is @entity34 , @entity5 is @entity35 , the trusted newsman who lived in the @entity30 city as a boy and later started his journalism career there
here are just some of the reasons @entity5 is already a winner
from last to first everyone loves an underdog , and @entity5 is a big one
for the past three decades , while baseball 's elite ( @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity3 ) were racking up championships , the @entity6 toiled in the murky depths of the @entity51 cellar
over one horrific span of 18 years , they had one winning season
each miserable spring , @entity6 ' fans ' hopes were dashed before the last snowfall melted
5 reasons to love the @entity6 but now , despite a roster of no - name players -- most @entity18 would n't know @entity60 from @entity61 -- the @entity6 are good
they staged a wild comeback to top the @entity64 , swept the star - studded @entity65 and have now won a record eight playoff games in a row

three coins in the fountain ( s ) sure , we hear @entity77 is lovely
but folks in @entity5 will happily tell you they have more fountains , for one thing
inspired by the grand cities of @entity84 , planners in the late 1800s filled @entity5 with parks , boulevards and public squares teeming with decorative water displays -- more than 200 in all
one of the first fountains even had basins for horses and dogs to drink from -- how cute is that ? visitors to @entity5 will find cascading fountains , waterspout fountains and fountains punctuated with statues
even @entity99 , where the @entity6 play , has a fountain display beyond its right - field wall
exuberant fans have been known to jump in them , which will get you thrown out of the ballpark
this year , it 's hard to blame them
royals , meet ' @entity6 ' yes , @entity109 's smash hit " @entity6 " refers mostly to historical monarchs
but there 's a surprising @entity5 tie , too
the young singer has said the tune 's lyrics were also inspired by a 1976 @entity117 photo she saw of young @entity6 star @entity118 signing baseballs
" baby i 'll rule , i 'll rule , i 'll rule , i 'll rule , " she sings in the song
" let me live that fantasy
" yes , please , agree hopeful @entity5 fans
for the love of meat this city knows its meat and more
with joints like @entity130 and @entity131 's ( an @entity133 favorite ) , @entity5 's barbecue can go head - to - head with any of its @entity136 brethren and come out on top
( @entity138 's is the classic must - mention : you decide if it 's better than @entity133 's pick
) after all , it 's home to the @entity144 , the governing body of the competitive barbecue circuit
( note to barbecue novices : different spots spell the word differently
polite people people in @entity5 are nice
@entity152 , @entity151 grew up there
and witness that likeable actor and @entity5 native @entity154 , inviting fans back to his mom 's for a celebratory kegger after wednesday night 's pennant win
he almost seemed to mean it
even the @entity5 cops seem like polite , reasonable fellows
after the @entity163 - clinching win they tweeted , " we trust you 'll channel your 29 years of pent - up excitement into a safe and classy celebration , # @entity5 ! see you at the @entity8 ! " 6
all that jazz @entity168 gets more music hype , but @entity5 was a hotbed of hard - swinging jazz in the early half of the 20th century
legends like @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 all jammed frequently in clubs such as the @entity179 and the @entity180 , where players traded competitive solos deep into the night
@entity183 celebrated this scene in " @entity5 , " his 1996 crime drama set against a backdrop of 1930s jazz , and the @entity188 is located in -- you guessed it -- @entity5
@entity191 's tallest water slide want an acrophobic thrill ? climb 264 steps and then plunge down the world 's tallest water slide at @entity196 in @entity5 , @entity5
the @entity198 - certified water slide , called @entity199 , is 168 feet 7 inches tall -- a longer drop than @entity201
even the steps , with their 25 turns , made @entity205 's list of the world 's scariest staircases .
