@entity0 -- @entity2 returns to @entity0 on monday after a monthlong summer break to jump right into debate and votes on a resolution giving president @entity7 the authorization to strike @entity9
how this all will unfold over the coming week is far from certain , but here 's how things could play out : monday the @entity13 and @entity14 are in session at 2 p.m. senate majority leader @entity16 is expected to take the first procedural steps to overcome an anticipated filibuster over whether to officially take up the @entity9 resolution
@entity20 sen. @entity20 of @entity21 , who filibustered @entity23 's confirmation as @entity25 director earlier this year to protest @entity7 's drone policy , told @entity27 on sunday that he was weighing his options on how to stall the resolution
@entity30 : @entity7 is losing support on @entity32 @entity7 will give a preview of his address to the nation when he does a round of interviews with major tv and cable outlets
@entity1 's @entity40 will report on his interview with the president on " @entity43 " at 6 p.m. et. @entity44 : @entity7 faces big hurdle convincing public on @entity9 all @entity13 members get an intelligence briefing from secretary of state @entity49 , secretary of defense @entity50 , national security adviser @entity52 , @entity54 chairman @entity53 and director of national intelligence @entity55 at 5 p.m. et. @entity57 will also brief members of the @entity59
tuesday debate expected in the @entity14
@entity7 goes to @entity32 to meet with @entity61 on @entity9
@entity7 takes his case for a strike on @entity9 to the @entity65 people when he addresses the nation at 9 p.m. et. @entity68 @entity67 says @entity7 should withdraw request for authorization wednesday should opponents filibuster whether to take up the @entity9 resolution , the first critical vote in the @entity14 could come today , requiring 60 votes to break the filibuster and move on to debate
if opponents lose the vote , they could still demand an additional 30 hours of debate on whether to take up the resolution
@entity49 , @entity79 and other administration officials will brief all members of the @entity14
@entity82 : this is not @entity84 or @entity85 after that ? what follows could be dictated by complicated parliamentary rules , the legislative strategy of supporters and opponents and other unforeseen variables that could influence the timeline of the debate
it 's not clear how long the debate could last , but at some point @entity16 would move to end it if he thinks he has the necessary 60 votes
that could be the most significant vote of the week , because if it passes , it would send a strong signal that the resolution would ultimately succeed because final passage requires only a 51 - vote simple majority
and in the @entity13 ? @entity20 leaders who control the @entity13 have said they will act after the @entity14 but have been vague on a schedule
it 's unclear whether the @entity13 would vote on the language in the @entity14 resolution or take up its own version
majority leader @entity112 signaled in a memo to rank - and - file @entity20 on friday that debate could slip beyond next week
" members should expect a robust debate and vote on an authorization of use of military force pertaining to @entity9 in the next two weeks , " he wrote
@entity7 has steep hill to climb in the @entity13 but @entity13 @entity20 leaders are leaving open the possibility the @entity13 wo n't bring up the resolution if it fails in the @entity14
house speaker @entity125 's spokesman signaled that the burden for getting enough votes in the @entity13 is on @entity7
" only a president can convince the public that military action is required
we only hope this is n't coming too late to make the difference , " @entity125 spokesman @entity131 said in a statement .
