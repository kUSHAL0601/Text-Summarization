@entity0 -- @entity2 checked into a @entity4 rehab center early friday , ending -- at least for now -- a drama that has had more twists and turns than a high - speed car chase
@entity9 , the lawyer who guided @entity2 through years of legal turmoil until the actress abruptly fired her in january , helped her avoid jail once again by brokering a deal , her father told @entity1 friday
" i am so thankful to @entity9 and @entity15 , her manager , for doing this , " @entity14 said
while he would n't name the @entity4 facility his daughter entered , he noted it is a rehab program she 's been in before
the actress underwent three months of court - ordered substance abuse rehab at the @entity24 at the end of 2010 , but she was in legal trouble again weeks later -- facing a shoplifting charge that led to her current woes
@entity2 , 26 , " wants to settle in " for a few days while arrangements can be made to transfer her to the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , which bills itself as a " luxury rehab center , " @entity14 said
" the @entity31 is where she wanted to go all along -- a place she will get the right treatment and finally get better , " @entity14 said
@entity39 city attorney @entity38 , who must approve any transfer , has not responded to @entity1 calls for comment
the actress was supposed to start a 90 - day stint in a " lockdown " rehab center thursday , an alternative to a three - month jail term for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in march
but she abruptly left the @entity4 facility where she had gone thursday morning because " she was not happy with the place , " her father said
@entity14 said he was not happy with it either because of the revelation that the facility -- @entity56 in @entity57 -- ca n't provide alcohol and drug rehab treatments because @entity4 officials revoked its license
" if a 24 - hour residential facility is providing treatment or services to promote the recovery of alcohol and drug abuse then they must possess a license , " said @entity62 , deputy director for the @entity63
none of @entity56 's several locations in @entity4 are licensed , @entity62 said
the company previously had three licenses , but all were revoked
the state 's licensing agency is in litigation with @entity56 's unlicensed @entity57 facility , she said
it 's unclear whether @entity84 judge @entity83 knew @entity56 was unlicensed when @entity2 's lawyer , @entity85 , informed him in court thursday morning that she would spend her rehab sentence there
@entity38 objected at thursday 's hearing , saying @entity85 did n't get prior approval for @entity2 to go to @entity56
@entity38 said he needed time to investigate it
" @entity2 had no idea that @entity56 was n't approved , " @entity14 said
@entity85 has not respond to several @entity1 requests for comment
the judge ordered the treatment after @entity2 entered pleas of no contest on charges relating to a traffic accident and , with those convictions , she was found in violation of her shoplifting probation
her six years of legal troubles trace back to two drunken driving arrests in 2007 and include other incidents in which she was behind the wheel
@entity2 was charged with reckless driving and lying to a police officer about a june 2012 car crash in which her @entity111 hit a dump truck on the @entity113 in @entity39 , @entity4
her arrest triggered the probation violation charge
the police report said @entity2 denied being behind the wheel , but the prosecutor was expected to call witnesses who say she was driving
@entity2 acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances
she 's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since january 2007 , including one long court - ordered stint after a failed drug test
the actress has appeared in court at least 20 times before four @entity0 judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail
@entity2 has spent about two weeks behind bars in six trips to the @entity0 jail , served 35 days under house arrest and worked about 67 days of community service at the county morgue .
