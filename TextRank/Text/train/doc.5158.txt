-- prepare to meet the young apprentices to @entity3 's masters sensation @entity2
the 14 - year - old stunned the golfing world when he made the halfway cut as the youngest player to enter the prestigious major , finishing as @entity9 's leading amateur
but @entity2 is likely to be just the start as @entity3 prepares to unveil its next crop of golfing prodigies at this week 's @entity13 in @entity14
@entity3 's brat pack is led by 12 - year - old @entity16 , who tees off as the youngest player in the history of the @entity19 on thursday
alongside him will be15 - year - old @entity20 , who earned his place in the field after winning the @entity23 , as well as qualifier @entity24 , a relative old - timer at 16 years of age
that trio will all be hoping to follow the headline - grabbing example set by @entity2 at last month 's masters
" we 're always all helping each other out , and turning to one another for advice , " explained @entity16 , who at 12 years and 242 days will beat the record for the youngest competitor at the @entity13 set by @entity2 last year
" i think the main reason for the success of young @entity3 players is that we pick up the game at an early age , and we practice really hard
hopefully that practice can pay off this week
" the @entity3 youngsters will be up against the likes of @entity48 's @entity47 captain @entity46 and @entity50 's @entity47 player @entity49 at the @entity52 course , but if @entity16 finds that youth is not quite a match for experience he has a secret weapon to hand
" i always wear my lucky hat out on the course , because it helps me shoot lower , " @entity16 , who lives in the industrial city of @entity59 in @entity61 province , explained
" i played really well the first time i wore it , and have worn it ever since
hopefully the luck continues this week
" i 'm very happy to be the youngest player on the @entity19 , and also a little nervous at the same time
" my main aim this week is just to go out there and enjoy it ; i do n't really want to think too much about the result
" @entity16 is coached by @entity73 @entity72 , who as a junior played alongside future @entity47 players @entity76 and @entity77
@entity72 has been coaching in @entity3 for the last decade and has been working with @entity16 since he was nine , describing the teenager 's potential as " limitless "
" at the moment , i do n't believe that @entity16 has too many close rivals of the same age , " @entity72 told the @entity19 website
" the @entity13 will be tough for him , but we will be ready
" @entity20 is aiming to be around for the whole weekend at the @entity13
" hopefully i can make the cut this week -- that is my goal
i 've played many practice rounds on the course , and it 's very difficult
some holes against the wind will be very tough to make par on , but all i can do is try my best
" @entity95 's defending champion @entity94 , who tied for 18th in the masters , is only 24 but is in awe of @entity99 ' burgeoning talent
" it 's amazing , " he said
" i only started playing the game at 11 , so i would n't like to think what handicap i was playing off when i was 12 ! " i spoke to [ @entity16 's ] coach and he told me he 's been winning almost every amateur tournament he 's played in this year
" so i 'll be looking out for his results here this week , as i 'm sure will most other people
it 's a great story , great for him and for the game of golf in general
" reprieve for @entity113 meanwhile , the @entity114 ( @entity114 ) has cleared three - time major winner @entity113 of infringing the @entity19 's anti-doping policy
the 50 - year - old admitted earlier this year to using deer antler spray which contains small extracts of growth hormone @entity120 , a substance listed on the @entity114 's list of banned products
the @entity114 sanctioned @entity113 but the @entity125 golfer appealed , saying he did not know the product contained banned substances
the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) has since said it no longer considers using deer antler spray to be prohibitive unless it resulted in a positive test
that statement led the @entity114 to rule that @entity113 should no longer face a ban , ruling : " based on this new information , and given @entity128 's lead role in interpreting the prohibited list , the @entity19 deemed it only fair to no longer treat @entity133 's use of deer antler spray as a violation
