@entity1 president @entity0 and @entity3 president @entity2 committed themselves to the quest for peace sunday during a meeting of key figures in the @entity10 peace process
but unlike previous attempts to achieve a resolution to the region 's turmoil through traditional means , there would be no negotiating nor any political talks at sunday 's summit
this appeal would be made to a higher calling : @entity0 and @entity2 prayed for peace together sunday at the @entity24 home of @entity25
the meeting comes two weeks after the @entity25 invited the two leaders to do so during his visit to the @entity29
" in this , the birthplace of the @entity35 " the @entity25 said in @entity31 's @entity30 following a may 25 @entity32 , " i wish to invite you , president @entity0 , together with president @entity2 , to join me in heartfelt prayer to @entity40 for the gift of peace
" sunday 's meeting was a first for the @entity44 , which had never hosted a prayer gathering of two leaders engaged in conflict
however pious the agenda , the day was n't totally free of political subtext
after prayers read in @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 by figures from different religions , each leader offered his own invocation
" without peace , we are not complete
we have yet to achieve this mission of humanity , " @entity2 said
" even when peace seems distant , we must pursue it to bring it closer
" " we ask you , @entity68 , for peace in the @entity29 , @entity70 and @entity71 , " said @entity0 , according to a @entity66 translator
" together with its people , we call on you to make @entity70 and @entity71 , in particular , a secure land for all believers , a place of prayer and worship
" the @entity25 said the meeting is the response to people who want to live as brothers and sisters and not as enemies
" i hope that this meeting will be a journey toward what joins us , to overcome what divides us , " @entity25 said
the groundbreaking meeting -- which was the result of the @entity25 offering an olive branch two weeks ago -- concluded with the two men exchanging kisses on the cheek before they broke ground themselves for the planting of an olive tree
only time will tell if today 's prayers will go answered
" the metric that @entity25 would be using to measure the success of this event is much longer term
i do n't think anyone is expecting an immediate result , " said @entity66 senior @entity44 analyst @entity109 " now that said , you could also argue that the success of tonight could be measured by the simple fact that it happened
