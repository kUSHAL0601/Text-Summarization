-- the former head of @entity3 's military was sentenced to life in prison monday in the controversial @entity7 case

" @entity36 , a spokesman for the opposition @entity37 , called the sentences hostage - takings
" our friends are hostages , they are not arrested , " he said
" they are not convicts
" the case underscores the divide in @entity3 between secularists in the opposition and the military and prime minister @entity51 's @entity50 - oriented government , dominated by his @entity52
prosecutors have accused hundreds of suspects of being part of a covert ultranationalist organization that wants to overthrow the government and sow unrest
they allege that the group created dozens of websites disseminating propaganda aimed at bringing down @entity51 's government
supporters of the process say the once - dominant military has a half - century history of overthrowing at least four governments in @entity3 and meddling in civilian political affairs
but opponents of the government say the evidence has been fabricated by a government witch hunt intent on weakening and discrediting his secular and military political opposition
tensions outside the court the @entity7 case had its origin in an investigation that began in 2007 after the discovery of a stash of grenades and bomb - making materials in @entity87
the name is a reference to a mythical story about the origins of the @entity3 people

as the court began reading the sentences , police intervened in a crowd of roughly 1,000 people protesting the proceeding
police tried to disperse crowds with water cannons , paint balls and tear gas
sparks from tear gas canisters on dry grass started a fire
one protester who would identify herself only as @entity132 said she was at the gathering for two reasons : to protest a lack of justice and to exercise her right of protest
" those of us who were here , we had no weapons , nothing
just my body , that 's my weapon , " she said
" they are treating us like criminals , but it is our constitutional right to protest , and they are not allowing us even that

" we will not pretend not to see this injustice , to not see how unfair this is
this is just the beginning for us
they will not silence us , and we will prevail
" @entity204 , one of @entity157 's attorneys , told @entity0 that defense lawyers proved their clients do n't belong " to this fictional organization , " a reference to @entity7
" i began representing my clients because i believe that they are not being tried for what they did but because of their political affiliations , " she said
" right now , in the conclusion of this case , i am sad , i am disappointed for @entity3
because i know that when the truth comes out about the faked and made - up evidence , that the younger generation will be ashamed
" deputy prime minister @entity219 told reporters that " whether we like it or not , we all have to obey the court 's decision
" " no one has the privilege to commit a crime
the judiciary made the decision it saw fit
we will all see what the next step brings together
we are not people that are personally happy to see anyone convicted or arrested , but there is a court decision and everyone must respect that , " he said
