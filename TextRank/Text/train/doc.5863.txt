-- an @entity3 delegation plans to travel to @entity5 to hold talks with one of the founding members of the @entity9 , the @entity3 president 's office said wednesday
the planned visit plays into efforts to pursue peace in war - torn @entity3 , where @entity15 and @entity3 troops have been fighting the @entity9 for more than a decade
the delegation of the @entity17 will hold talks with mullah @entity19 , a former @entity9 leader who was released last month from detention by @entity5 authorities
a date for the trip has not yet been announced
@entity19 , who had been held in a secret location , used to be the @entity9 's second - in - command , after @entity26
he was captured in 2010 in @entity27 , @entity5 's largest city , which is known to be a haven for many militants from across the country and its bordering regions
@entity3 president @entity32 has long pushed for @entity19 's release -- his government was suspected to be in secret talks with the militant when he was captured
@entity19 had been under @entity39 sanctions since february 2001 , with his assets frozen and travel banned
the @entity39 had forbidden selling weapons to him
the agreement for the @entity3 delegation to meet @entity19 was made tuesday in @entity45 where @entity47 prime minister @entity46 held talks on the @entity3 peace process and other issues with @entity32 and @entity5 prime minister @entity51
it is the latest gesture by @entity51 's government , which took office this year , to improve ties with neighboring @entity3
on september 7 -- before @entity19 's release -- it freed seven @entity9 figures to facilitate the peace process
two weeks earlier , @entity32 had visited the @entity5 capital of @entity59 and stressed the importance of @entity5 's assistance in any path to peace .
