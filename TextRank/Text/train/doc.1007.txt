-- you might have heard the @entity2 is about to start
turn on any television set in any country and it wo n't be long before you 're being bombarded by a relentless stream of @entity2 adverts as manufacturers seek to cash in on football 's greatest sporting event , which is held every four years
" there seems to be a new one every day , it 's relentless , " @entity15 ceo @entity14 told @entity0 , reflecting on the advertising drive
" it seems every time you turn on the tv there 's a @entity2 advert , " added @entity14
" it 's called the @entity2 for a reason and it tends to cut across all countries and all markets
" the danger for a lot of brands jumping on the bandwagon is they 're not part of it , but i think there 's a very savvy audience now that knows who 's jumping on the bandwagon and who is n't
" here is @entity0 's guide to 10 @entity2 - related adverts
@entity45 ' $ 84 million advert replicates a @entity47 movie trailer with the likes of @entity50 's @entity49 and @entity52 's @entity51 filmed in a range of locations from the @entity56 beach to a @entity58 forest
@entity49 and co. are depicted preparing for the @entity2 , before they eventually arrive in @entity60 and take to the field for a game of football
" i do n't think the bigger companies ( like @entity45 ) shy away from making more touching adverts ( than just a game of football ) , but i just think because they are pure football brands , pure sports brands , they have to take an approach that falls in line with that , while doing so in an entertaining way , " said @entity14
@entity75 broadcaster @entity74 's inspiration derives from @entity76 , with its short film showing four football figures -- one voiced by @entity80 great @entity79 -- escaping from a toy box and attempting to reach the @entity2 in @entity60
divided into separate installments , the ad attempts to reawaken that little child in all of us that struggles to sleep at night due to the sheer anticipation and excitement as the greatest show on earth edges ever closer
" there 's nothing bigger than the @entity2 , it transcends everything and all audiences , " @entity14 says
" i think it 's an opportunity for brands to be part of that conversation to get the very big audiences
the majority of advertising campaigns look to please as many people as possible with the aim of convincing them that their brand is the be-all and end - all
@entity109 , however , has gone for a more confrontational approach
" @entity115 " -- " the 1950 ghost is in @entity60 " -- plays on the host 's darkest sporting hour when they failed to win the 1950 @entity2 , with @entity52 winning the event
in less than a minute , a @entity118 ghost manages to frighten half of @entity120 , and in the process adds further fuel to an already heated rivalry
strong stuff , but has @entity109 succeeded in alienating @entity60 's 200 million inhabitants ? 7
supporters adore their players and the players themselves have a mutual love for their fans -- or so we are led to believe
@entity133 's three - minute film depicts the @entity135 ' squad messing about -- think @entity136 on triangle and @entity138 on cowbells -- and generally having a whale of a time with their fans
the advert 's payoff comes in the shape of @entity145 and @entity146 playing a practical joke on @entity148
conjured up on a similarly - grand scale to the @entity45 offering , @entity149 treats us to a game of football played out by a bunch of very good players
sound familiar ? the match starts off as a kickabout between friends , before morphing into the more familiar game taking place in front of thousands of screaming fans
@entity165 's girlfriend and the @entity166 are on hand to inject some humor
" it 's become this great on - pitch battle , the battle of the brands around the @entity2 and everybody looks forward to it from a brand perspective , " said @entity14
" it 's really interesting territory as everybody almost ca n't wait to see what 's around the corner from all the brands
the beautiful thing about the beautiful game is that it can be played by anyone , anywhere , as long of course , you have a ball
fast food company @entity189 has picked up the theme for its @entity2 offering , showing -- in various locations around the world -- people from all walks of life presenting their footballing tricks to the camera
so rather than allowing the usual big - name players to take all the glory , we have the likes of a young boy , an old man and a woman in high heels playing the starring roles
what 's more , there 's not a single @entity210 in sight
@entity149 and @entity45 may battle it out each year for the title of who can produce the biggest football advert on the grandest of scales , but they now have a new challenger -- beats by @entity219
you could be forgiven for thinking you had stumbled upon a @entity60 cinematic thriller as this advert -- entitled " @entity223 " -- gets underway
@entity60 star @entity225 's father opens proceedings by handing down some advice to his son on the eve of the @entity2 , while we are treated to some jaw - dropping shots of @entity120
with the big kickoff fast approaching , players and fans alike are shown preparing in a brooding film that suggests half the battle of a football match is won in the head
" you expect it from the big brands , but i think we 're going to see some more clever and more imaginative work coming out over the next few weeks , " said @entity14
" more and more companies are now getting involved
@entity245 beer @entity243 goes for the horror genre in its advertising campaign
with @entity245 up against it in @entity60 2014 's " @entity248 " -- also featuring @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 -- @entity243 tries to offer the nation a helping hand
over three different adverts , an opposing supporter is given the creeps in the comforts of their own homes , before the slogan " @entity245 is scary " appears
assuming that @entity245 will advance to the knockout stages , a fourth advert has been created , with fans of such nations from @entity80 to @entity265 the next to be started up
mobile phone company @entity266 goes one step further than @entity133 in attempting to break down that barrier between players and supporters
@entity249 stars @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 and @entity276 are all given a makeover to disguise themselves before they go off to work with ordinary people in a range of differing professions
we see @entity273 working in a restaurant kitchen , @entity272 helping out at a hospital and @entity274 working as a gardener in a film made as a tribute to the population of @entity249
backed with the motto " we will make an effort for you , " @entity288 's @entity272 touchingly shaves an aging man in hospital
" i like the idea a lot , and it 's a clear example of getting it spot - on , " said @entity14
" you can get it spot on like this one , or it can easily be a hit - and - miss. the ones that are more creative and have a bit more of a storyline to them are more real
the miners of the 2010 @entity305 mining accident are @entity307 's inspiration for its offering as " @entity309 " -- a member of the original " @entity305 " was actually @entity311 -- rally the troops ahead of the @entity2
@entity314 ' spokesman @entity313 offers a rousing call to arms and urges his compatriots not to fear @entity245 's " @entity248
" pathos is added with images of the miners ' time trapped underground and their eventual rescue , not to mention an epic soundtrack and setting
" you 've got to be smart , you 've got to be creative and you 've got to be able to tap into people 's passions in a credible way ( when making an advert ) , as opposed to just throwing ideas and content out there which can turn you off very quickly , " said @entity14
" but do it right and you can make people buy into it and make them feel very emotional about the content that they 've seen , like this advert does
" what 's nice about the @entity245 advert is it adds real emotion and a human touch to things that are n't fantasy land , while it remains pretty grounded
and as a result it gives you goose pimples when you watch it
