@entity0 -- @entity3 bulldozers demolished part of a hotel in @entity0 on sunday , prompting swift condemnation from @entity7
the building plan , which was given final approval last year , was met with disapproval from the @entity11 at the time which called for the @entity3 government to put off any demolition
@entity3 demolished part of the hotel as part of a plan to build 20 housing units for @entity19 in a predominantly @entity7 neighborhood of @entity0
the chief @entity7 negotiator , @entity21 , denounced the action
" the state of @entity3 is demolishing one @entity7 property after another in an effort to cleanse @entity0 of its @entity7 inhabitants , heritage and history , " he said in a statement
he said such actions " undermine the two - state solution and negotiations process
" the @entity11 had called on @entity3 to halt the housing project , but prime minister @entity35 responded by saying " our sovereignty ( over @entity0 ) can not be challenged "
the project was given final approval last march
the @entity39 was built in the 1930s by a prominent @entity7 family and was purchased from the state of @entity3 in 1985 by @entity11 millionaire @entity43 , an avid supporter of @entity19 building in @entity0
@entity43 developed plans for the 20 housing units that sparked the hotel 's demolition on sunday .
