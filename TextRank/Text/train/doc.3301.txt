deadly flames licked all around her , but a heroic dog in a suburban @entity5 basement refused to leave her owner
now that dog , a 9 - year - old boxer named @entity9 , has a team of vets fighting around the clock to save her life
@entity9 was injured thursday when a fire broke out in the basement of the home where she lived with her owner , @entity19 , in @entity20 , @entity21
first responders on the scene found @entity9 , a 9 - year - old boxer , on top of @entity19 , trying to shelter his face from the heat , smoke and flame , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity29
@entity19 , 33 , was taken to a hospital where he later died
@entity9 ended up at @entity5 's @entity31 , a critical care veterinary hospital , where the vets there have placed her on a ventilator
" she 's doing ok
considering what @entity9 has been through we think she 's doing as well as can be expected , " dr. @entity36 , a vet at the hospital , told @entity29
@entity36 said @entity9 is battling severe lung damage and is not strong enough to breathe on her own yet
the doctors had hoped to get her off the ventilator by now , but as of sunday night , it just was n't happening
" it 's not unexpected that she 's not ready to come off ( the ventilator )
it 's just that in our best case scenario ( we thought ) maybe we could 've hoped to get her off ( sunday ) afternoon , " @entity36 told @entity29
" whenever they put a patient on a ventilator they 're looking at a 50 - 50 chance of getting them off breathing on their own
the smoke ventilation cases are often the hardest to manage off the ventilator
" despite her breathing problems , @entity9 has shown improvement in other areas
she is mentally alert and showing no signs of neurological problems , the vet said
she 's very heavily sedated so that she wo n't fight -- you know , that she 's got a tube down her trachea or windpipe
" @entity19 's family and friends , while mourning the loss of his life , are still doing what they can to help @entity9 save hers
they 've turned to crowdsourcing website @entity75 to raise funds to help pay @entity9 's hospital bills
on the site , they thanked the doctors and expressed gratitude at the " generosity being offered to help @entity9
" the hospital is also providing updates on @entity9 through social media , using @entity86 to post pictures of the dog resting on a pink blanket and keeping company with a pair of stuffed animals
dr. @entity93 , another vet at the hospital who is caring for the dog , told @entity29 she was not at all surprised that @entity9 tried to save her owner
" a lot of dogs instinctively know when there 's a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go to try to protect their owners , so she very well may have been trying to protect him , " she said .
