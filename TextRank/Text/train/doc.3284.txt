-- the church where @entity3 's family worshiped was filled with mourners for the slain @entity7 math teacher 's funeral monday
" you can see the effect she has had and how the community has bonded together to commemorate and celebrate @entity3 's life , " @entity3 's cousin , @entity8 , said in her eulogy
about 400 @entity16 students were among the estimated 1,000 people who gathered to pay final respects to @entity3 , who was killed allegedly by one of her own students -- 14 - year - old @entity19 -- a week earlier
" @entity3 loved her brother and sister very much and always did her best to be a sister , friend , and mentor to them , " @entity8 said
" she is the daughter that every parent hopes their children will become once they grow up
" many mourners wore pink clothing -- @entity3 's favorite color -- and pink flowers decorated the outside of @entity36 's @entity35
" @entity3 's gift was that of inspiration , " @entity8 said
" in such a short period of time , one person has made a world of difference
" the rev. @entity45 , in his homily , offered advice on how to approach @entity3 's death
Ã‚ " perhaps we should ask not why , or even how she died , but rather why and how did she live , " @entity45 said
@entity3 's parents , brother and sister followed the hearse to a private burial for family and close friends
@entity3 , 24 , was found dead in woods near the campus where she taught tuesday morning
authorities are still investigating the motive for her killing
documents filed in a @entity64 court 12 years ago may shed light on @entity19 's past
the documents showed that @entity19 's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son , who was then 2 , because of " prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse
" the documents , however , said the parents were attempting to reconcile
@entity19 's uncle , @entity77 , told @entity0 that the boy 's parents are now separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in @entity81
@entity77 told @entity0 affiliate @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity64 , last week that something may have provoked his nephew
" might could have been upset , " @entity77 said
" you know -- teenagers go through that
he 's 14 , he 's growing up still
that 's the only thing that i can imagine
i ca n't imagine anything else because he 's like a storybook kid -- a perfect family
" @entity19 's mother , @entity95 , released a statement through her son 's attorney saying her " heart is broken for the @entity3 family and the loss of their daughter and sister @entity3
" " her son was born in love and is dear to her , very dear , " the statement said
" she is struggling to understand this
" @entity0 's @entity108 and @entity109 contributed to this report .
