-- the lead singer of the metal band @entity3 has been arrested and charged with seeking to have his wife killed , the @entity1 said
authorities said tuesday that @entity6 tried to contract an undercover detective posing as a killer for hire to murder his estranged wife , who lives in @entity11 , @entity12
arraignment was set for thursday afternoon at @entity14 in @entity15
the department said it learned on may 2 that @entity6 , 32 , had asked someone to carry out the killing and an investigation was initiated
the investigation culminated tuesday afternoon , " when @entity6 solicited an undercover detective to kill his wife , " it said
he was arrested without incident at a business in @entity25 and taken to the @entity26 and booked into the @entity27
last september , @entity28 filed with @entity29 to have the marriage dissolved
the band issued a statement wednesday through its record label , @entity34 , to its fans saying : " as we post this , the legal process is taking it 's course and we have no more information than you do
there are many unanswered questions , and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks
we 'll keep you informed as best we can
" our thoughts right now are with @entity6 , his family , and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation
" @entity3 was nominated in 2008 for a @entity48 for best metal performance
during the decade since it was formed , the band has released seven studio albums and a live cd , according to its website
asked last year in an interview with @entity55 about how his time on the road affected his home life , @entity6 said , " if there was a way to be home but still make a living playing music , i would do that in a heartbeat
" but the catch is that , as a profession , this is what i 'm passionate about
and then my personal life , what i 'm passionate about is my loved ones back home
so , you know , those two have a conflict with each other
the only thing i can do is find a balance where , if i am gone a month on tour , then i find a month to be home and just kind of even it out that way
" asked in january about whether his group was a christian metal band , he told @entity82 that the band had decided not to discuss " the spiritual topic " so that listeners would focus on their music
" we did n't preach at our shows , our goal has always been to just write the best music we can write , " he said
" of course religion has some influence on the things that we write about just like all of our life experiences do but as a band , we want to be judged on the music rather than what our personal beliefs are
