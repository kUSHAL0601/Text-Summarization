@entity0 -- while most sitting @entity4 justices refuse to comment about current and future nominees to that bench , one member says she ca n't wait to welcome judge @entity7 to that exclusive club
justice @entity9 her views occasionally are ignored by the male justices
justice @entity9 , the only women on the nine - member court , told a group of lawyers and judges this weekend she was " cheered " at the nomination of @entity7
@entity9 said the 54 - year - old federal appeals court judge brings " a wealth of experience in the law and in life
i am glad to no longer be the lone woman on the court , and look forward to a new colleague well - equipped to handle the challenges our work presents
" her remarks were made at a semi-private conference in @entity32
the justice has made no secret of her desire to see greater gender diversity on her court
she has lamented the departure of her friend and colleague @entity39 in 2006
she told @entity41 just weeks before justice @entity42 announced his retirement that more women should join her
" women belong in all places where decision are being made , " she said
" i do n't say [ the split ] should be 50 - 50
it could be 60 percent men , 40 percent women , or the other way around
it should n't be that women are the exception
" @entity7 has drawn controversy with her remarks at a 2001 speech : " i would hope that a wise @entity60 woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life
" she has echoed the sentiment in related talks she has given over the years
@entity9 spoke weeks before @entity7 was tapped for the high court about observations she and @entity39 had made in the past that were similar to @entity7 's
" you know the line that @entity39 and i keep repeating ... that ' at the end of the day , a wise old man and a wise old woman reach the same judgment ' ? " she told @entity41
" but there are perceptions that we have because we are women
it 's a subtle influence
we can be sensitive to things that are said in draft opinions that [ male justices ] are not aware can be offensive
" @entity9 used the word " same " to describe the outcome , @entity7 used the word " better , " a wording she has told senators privately she now regrets
@entity9 noted gender differences are " seldom in the outcome
" but then , she said , " it is sometimes in the outcome
" @entity9 expressed frustration in that interview with how her male colleagues view her role , and how they view certain cases
she said in closed door conferences where all the justices gather to decide cases and pending appeals , her views occasionally are ignored
" when i will say something -- and i do n't think i 'm a confused speaker -- and it is n't until somebody else says it that everyone will focus on the point
" the same thing can happen in the public setting of oral arguments , the 76 - year - old justice said
a case from april dealt with whether school officials abused their discretion by conducting a strip search on a 13 - year - old female student who was suspected of carrying ibuprofen medicine , in violation of the school 's anti-drug policy
in arguments , she asked a lawyer for the school , " after @entity126 [ the student ] was searched and nothing was found , she was put in a chair outside the vice principal 's office for over two hours , and her mother was n't called
what was the reason for ... putting her in that humiliating situation ? " her colleague justice @entity135 had noted , " i 'm trying to work out why is this a major thing to , say , strip down to your underclothes , which children do when they change for gym , " @entity135 said
" how bad is this , underclothes ? that 's what i 'm trying to get at
i 'm asking because i do n't know
" @entity9 countered that the girl was told by female staffers " to shake [ her ] bra out , to shake , shake , stretch the top of [ her ] pants
" in another case this term , the court ruled time off given women decades ago for pregnancy leave can not be counted when deciding pension eligibility
@entity9 dissented strongly , noting , " certain attitudes about pregnancy and childbirth throughout human history have sustained pervasive , often law - sanctioned , restrictions on a woman 's place among paid workers and active citizens
" the appeal had parallels to a similar workplace discrimination claim involving @entity170
the former tire company manager alleged she was paid less than her male counterparts for equal work for about two decades , but did not find out about the discrimination until she was about to retire
the high court in 2007 ruled against her , saying existing federal law did not allow such lawsuits to be filed so late
most workers had 180 days to file a claim after the first discriminatory pay decision
but president @entity184 , in the first bill he signed when taking office in january , made law the @entity186
it nullified the high court decision and said every new paycheck received over the years based on a discriminatory act -- regardless of when the first discrimination occurred -- would extend the statute of limitations 180 days
@entity9 told reporter @entity194 that oral arguments in the 2009 pregnancy case were , " just for me , @entity170 repeated
" @entity9 is still recovering from surgery and post-operation chemotherapy after an early diagnosis in january for pancreatic cancer
@entity9 has had no outward signs of complications , and has kept up with her busy schedule , both on and off the bench
she has told friends and colleagues privately she is doing well , and plans to be back on the bench for the start of the fall term
@entity7 's @entity211 confirmation hearings will begin july 13 .
