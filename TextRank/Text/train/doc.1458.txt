-- i peered over the shoulder of the flight engineer and studied the pressurization gauge on his panel
the needle indicated that the cabin was climbing , and the slow popping in my ears confirmed it
the flight engineer swiveled his seat away from the panel and turned in my direction , brow furrowed , eyes wide
" should i tell the captain ? " he asked
the question seemed foolish , but i understood
the flight engineer was brand new , having completed his training with the airline a week earlier
i was a seasoned veteran of six months , observing from the jump seat for the purpose of monitoring co-pilot procedures
i had just upgraded from the flight engineer position to a " window seat " on the 727
" yes , " i replied with raised eyebrows
" i would tell the captain ... like right now
" the captain had already begun to swivel in his seat
he squinted at the array of switches and indications on the panel
a conference with the flight engineer ensued
all four of us in the cockpit focused momentarily on the cabin rate needle
it was still indicating a climb
for some mysterious reason , we were slowly losing cabin pressurization
the captain turned toward me in a silent gesture to obtain confirmation
without hesitation , he instructed the co-pilot to request an immediate descent to 10,000 feet from our altitude of 37,000 feet
i reached for the oxygen mask and strapped it to my face
the rest of the crew followed my lead
ten minutes later , and after the completion of the appropriate emergency checklist , we reached 10,000 feet
our 152 passengers had to endure a lack of air conditioning because of the pressurization problem , but other than that , the experience was a non-event
this should have been the same outcome for the single - engine @entity73 turboprop that crashed , tragically , in the waters off @entity76 on friday
the @entity73 had departed @entity77 , @entity78 , bound for @entity79 , @entity80 , with two occupants on board : @entity83 , the pilot / owner and his wife , @entity84
but the pilot became unresponsive while the airplane cruised at 25,000 feet over @entity87
instead of landing in @entity79 , the autopilot system allowed the turboprop to continue flying off the eastern @entity92 coastline , crossing over @entity93 before , with its fuel supply exhausted , it crashed into the sea about 12 miles north of the @entity76 coastline
two @entity92 - launched f - 15s confirmed through observation that the pilot appeared unconscious
the @entity99 - made @entity73 is a sophisticated piece of technology , far superior to the old @entity102 airliner i described above
it is a great representative of the new generation in privately - owned cabin class airplanes , competing with traditional twin - engine turboprops and even small , corporate jets
composite material , finely tuned aeroengineering design , a reliable and proven @entity112 engine and advanced cockpit displays and controls all combine to make the $ 3.7 million airplane a respected machine
more than 1,000 of these airplanes are operating today ; the 900 is the most recent version
according to an @entity121 and @entity122 ( @entity123 ) report , this was the third @entity73 owned by @entity83 ; he had logged 5,000 hours in the model
one would think that such experience would have produced a positive result and not a crash into the ocean
what happened exactly ? @entity131 , lack of oxygen to the brain , would appear to be the most likely culprit
depending upon the health condition of an individual , the time of useful consciousness at 25,000 feet is n't much more than about a minute
but that 's if a depressurization occurs as a catastrophic event with some type of major hole in the fuselage , allowing air to escape explosively
but in this instance , judging by 30 minutes of @entity149 audio recording , it was not a catastrophic occurrence , but rather a slow event
news reports say the pilot asked to descend to 18,000 feet because " we have an indication that is not correct in the plane , " according to a stream of that transmission posted on liveatc.net
after about one minute , the airplane was cleared initially from 28,000 feet to 25,000 feet where it eventually remained until fuel exhaustion
while descending , @entity149 gave further clearance to 20,000 feet but the pilot responded with an unintelligible transmission
it 's possible he was already suffering from hypoxia
a slow loss of oxygen to the brain is insidious ; most people not familiar with the symptoms do n't recognize the danger
a depressurization problem is a traumatic event that it is easily managed -- but only if the problem is recognized
like the captain of the 727 , a pilot facing such a situation would have to don an oxygen mask the minute he suspected the issue
the next objective would be to descend the airplane to a habitable altitude -- 10,000 feet is a typical procedure goal
for this to occur , a sense of urgency has to be stated or an emergency declared
apparently , none of this happened
at the airline level , we train for such a depressurization event from day one
it is an emergency that is etched into our muscle memory
i am certain this emergency was part of the training for this particular @entity73 pilot
whether it was part of his muscle memory , we ca n't know
the airplane is equipped with an emergency oxygen bottle attached to quick - donning masks for just such circumstances
it is possible that the system may have malfunctioned
perhaps a closed valve not noticed on the preflight inspection ? an undetected leak ? or maybe the system that had been causing the malfunction released the cabin pressurization in one final event
regardless , if indeed a pressurization malfunction had been observed , the prudent decision would have been to descend immediately and head off a tragedy
sad as this outcome was , we can be thankful for small favors
the airplane 's sophisticated automation system steered it away from populated areas and a tragedy of even greater proportions .
