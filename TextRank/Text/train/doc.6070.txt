-- for more than three decades , @entity1 represented the pinnacle of business travel -- the ultimate status symbol for the jetset executive
considered a marvel of aviation technology , the distinctive droop - nosed aircraft traveled at twice the speed of sound , flying from @entity10 to @entity11 in about three and a half hours -- half the time of commercial airliners
but even before an @entity1 crashed in 2000 , killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board , the luster was beginning to wane
battling high operating costs and low passenger numbers , @entity1 and @entity21 grounded their small , aging fleet a mere three years later
but the dream of supersonic flight has not disappeared
aviation manufacturers such as @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 are working on supersonic technology -- with the latter predicting it could have a supersonic business jet in service as early as 2020
industry expert @entity32 , the director of aerospace and defense consulting in the @entity35 for @entity36 's , says it 's likely that a next - generation supersonic commercial aircraft will emerge
high demand from passengers , historic profitability on the routes and significant technological improvements have combined to make supersonic flight all the more viable , he said

" faster flights consume fuel faster which makes the flight more expensive , " he said
" but this is a premium route , and premium prices will be charged
" crucial to the efforts to restore supersonic aircraft to the skies is the work of national aerospace programs such as @entity59 and @entity61 's @entity60
@entity62 is the supersonics research project manager for @entity59 's fundamental aeronautics program
while the agency is not working on a specific supersonic aircraft , he said , " we are working on technologies we feel represent barriers to bringing back successful supersonic aircraft
" those barriers include high atmosphere emissions , noise produced when taking off and landing , and the sonic boom -- the sound associated with the shockwaves created when objects travel faster than the speed of sound , which has prevented supersonic aircraft from flying overland routes

" @entity59 has been collaborating with @entity26 and @entity27 on systems - level design studies , with each manufacturer producing models that have been subjected to wind tunnel testing to gauge their effectiveness
@entity62 said phase one testing had successfully validated the basic design techniques
reshaping the aircraft , the designs -- @entity26 's two - jet configuration with engines mounted above the wing , and @entity27 's tri-jet configuration , with two engines below the wing and a third mounted in the tail -- had been proven to significantly reduce the sonic boom to a " thump , " dropping the noise from @entity1 levels to close to what is considered the level of acceptability
@entity62 said he expected to see a next - generation " son of @entity1 " in the marketplace by around 2030 , while a supersonic business jet " could happen sooner
" " the boom is the barrier and if we can get past that , i think we 'll see people giving supersonic flight a lot more serious consideration , " he said
the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) also hopes to develop a supersonic passenger aircraft that is quiet , economical and environmentally friendly , and expects to achieved it some time this century
spokesman @entity128 said that while the agency currently had no aircraft in specific development , along current projections it predicted a supersonic business jet to enter the market some time after 2015

" it will herald a return to supersonic civil flight without @entity1 's environmental and economic drawbacks , " said @entity28 spokesman @entity143
he said development of a joint venture with aircraft manufacturers to produce the @entity141 had been slowed by the recession , but once a deal was struck he anticipated a six - year development program to bring the aircraft to market
" we believe the @entity141 will be certified , and enter service around the end of the decade -- 2020 , " he said
but not everyone is convinced that a return to supersonic passenger flight is just around the corner
@entity165 , head of market analysis with aviation experts @entity167 , was skeptical that there would be much progress before at least 2030
" i think there 's so many issues to be considered that i certainly ca n't see it happening in the next 20 years , " he said
@entity165 believes that although technological barriers will likely be overcome , the key factor in whether it will become a reality is whether a market exists that is prepared to pay a premium for the ultimate status symbol in business travel -- particularly in an air - travel market that is focused on low prices
" will you have enough passengers willing to pay higher fares to fly more quickly ? " he said
" if you look at @entity1 , that was n't the case
it came along at a time when the 747 also came in , which carried more people for lower fares
that 's where the market was
" @entity198 , director of @entity199 , also believes that a return to supersonic flight is further off than some are making out
" there seems to be multiple technological and commercial obstacles that will need to be cleared , " he said
but he conceded : " i 'm sure that when the original plans for @entity1 , the @entity208 and the @entity209 were announced , the same questions about whether it could be achieved were asked
i think time will tell
