@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 is overhauling its rules on how it handles accusations of sexual abuse by priests , it said monday , without giving any details
the powerful @entity11 body that handles such allegations has been working on updating the 2001 rules " for some time , " the @entity4 said
it published a new summary of its procedures on sexual abuse cases monday , as it fights the perception that it has tried to hush up abuse in the past
the summary said the overhaul is taking place
the church has been badly shaken by allegations of widespread child abuse by clergy in deeply catholic @entity27 , and hundreds of people who say they were abused have come forward in @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity31
@entity33 documents have surfaced in the @entity34 which critics say link pope @entity37 personally to attempts to cover up abuse
the @entity4 says the letters in question , about a @entity44 priest accused of molesting hundreds of deaf boys over two decades , were not written to @entity0 until long after the abuse took place
the one - page document published monday outlines the official steps diocese should take if a priest is accused of abuse , how to escalate complaints to @entity0 , and possible punishments for those found guilty
it does not appear to contain new guidance -- only to consolidate existing practices into one document
it is designed primarily to help the media understand @entity11 procedures , father @entity62 of the @entity4 press office told @entity2
the summary , produced by the @entity65 , says local diocese " investigate every allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a cleric
" if the allegation " has a semblance of truth , " the local diocese refers it to the @entity65
local diocese should also report the allegations to the appropriate civil authorities if local law requires , the guidelines say
the pope was head of the @entity65 , as cardinal @entity37 , before being enthroned as @entity37 in 2005 .
