cringe and propitiate : that 's the @entity3 administration 's response to the hucksters who have seized on a dopey @entity7 trailer to enflame crowds across the @entity10 world
administration officials have deplored and condemned the video , sometimes remembering to add a mention of the right of free speech ( as incumbent secretary of state @entity16 did ) and sometimes omitting it ( see for example , sunday 's performance by @entity20 ambassador to the @entity21 and potential future secretary of state @entity22 on @entity24 's " @entity23 " )
blaming the video is convenient for the @entity3 administration
blaming the video obviates questions about inadequate security at the @entity31 consulate
even better , from the administration 's point of view , the more we talk about the video , the less we talk about whether the administration made the right choices in its @entity38 and @entity39 policies
opinion : @entity42 nations do n't yet grasp freedom of dissent but blaming the video also imposes some ugly costs
self - selected @entity48 leaders exploit incidents like this to pose demands that threaten human freedom in the @entity53 and around the world
even under the prior secular regime of @entity56 , @entity39 regularly used blasphemy laws to persecute religious minorities and independent thinkers
that country 's new @entity61 government has already shown itself even more aggressively intolerant of dissenting speech , suppressing newspapers that print criticism of president @entity66
@entity68 's record is even worse , with courts pronouncing death sentences on supposed blasphemers , most recently a mentally impaired @entity73 girl accused of burning pages of the @entity75
( she was released on bail friday after it was established that her accuser , a local imam , had faked his evidence
) western countries , too , are targeted by demands for the regulation of speech deemed objectionable by certain @entity48
from " @entity89 " uproar of 1989 , through the @entity91 cartoon incident of 2006 , to this latest video , @entity87 and @entity20 governments and media institutions have compromised their most cherished values to appease angry mobs
@entity96 - eyed observers will notice that these periodic uproars are rarely , if ever , spontaneous
they are almost always contrived by political actors for political purposes
@entity101 's issuance of a fatwa against @entity103 helped distract attention from the bitter decision to end the war with @entity107 with a compromise peace he could have had six years earlier , sparing hundreds of thousands of @entity111 lives
the @entity91 cartoon incident was the work of freelance @entity87 imams , hoping -- like @entity115 in the @entity117 case -- to promote themselves through a manufactured controversy
( the most provocative of the @entity91 cartoons were apparently fakes
) and this latest video uproar has been used by the @entity61 government of @entity39 to rally support against the last of the old leaders of the @entity39 army and security services
opportunistic leaders use these incidents in this way for one reason : they work
they gain results at low to nonexistent cost
and unfortunately international institutions have lent legitimacy to these outrages
opinion : should @entity139 censor an anti-islam video ? again and again over the past dozen years , the human rights bodies of the @entity21 have adopted resolutions to condemn " defamation of religion " as a violation of human rights
the first of these resolutions , introduced in 1999 by @entity68 , specified the " defamation of @entity10
" more generic language was substituted , but everybody understands that only one religion is meant
these resolutions are in no way legally binding on anybody
yet they are very far from harmless
they allow persecution - minded governments and clerics to tell their citizens and adherents that they are not attacking human rights when they pronounce death in the name of religion
oh no : they are upholding human rights
the violence threatened against those who say things that displease some mullah has distorting effects on @entity173 societies too -- and not just on low - life provocateurs such as the so - called " @entity175
" this month , @entity176 's @entity177 broadcast a new documentary on the historical origins of @entity10 , written and narrated by the distinguished classicist @entity180 and based on @entity180 's previous book on the subject
@entity180 's book and documentary presented in accessible form the fruits of recent scholarship , widely accepted by leading academic authorities
that research points to @entity10 originating in @entity191 , not @entity189 ; points to parts of the @entity75 being translated from other languages , especially @entity194 ; and points to the probability that @entity10 coalesced as a religion after the conquest of @entity198 and @entity111 rather than beforehand
as i mentioned , these are not new insights , but to date they have been published mostly by academics in books written for academics
when this knowledge was made available to the broader public , however , it generated more than 1,000 complaints to @entity176 tv licensing authorities and death threats against @entity180
last week , a scheduled public screening of the documentary was canceled because of security concerns
by threat of violence , @entity173 intellectual life is policed and corrupted
the @entity7 video " @entity217 " is no monument to either art or scholarship
it 's a shabby piece of hack work
but it is as protected by the right to speak as the work of @entity103 or @entity180 -- because if it is not , their rights will be truncated too , as indeed they have been
the @entity3 administration 's response to date to the video incident has been depressing and shameful
it 's not too late to change course
opinion : extremists and leaders incite violent protests president @entity3 delivers his annual address to the @entity21 on september 25
let him take time in that speech to refute and repudiate blasphemy laws
let him say that he upholds and vindicates free speech as an @entity20 right and that he respects and endorses free speech as a universal human right
let him say that @entity20 will be protected in their speech rights against threats of violence from anyone , anywhere
let him say that if freedom of speech means anything , it means first and foremost the right to criticize orthodoxy , political or religious
let him say that freedom of speech includes the right to mock , to be rude , to be stupid and to be wrong -- because we know that speech that is stupid and wrong will be rebutted , refuted and mocked in its turn
not everyone shares the @entity20 regard for free speech
but the leaders of the @entity20 will not be bullied into compromising their most cherished values -- and their most solemn constitutional obligations -- by inciters of mobs , by would - be dictators and by overweening street preachers
let him say that , too
