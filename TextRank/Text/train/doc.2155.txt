leaders in @entity1 say they found a way to get around the government shutdown
@entity1 will reopen its five national parks by saturday , as well as three other nationally run locations
@entity1 's governor @entity6 made the announcement thursday , saying a deal had been reached with the @entity9 @entity11 secretary @entity10
" @entity1 agrees to pay the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) up to $ 1.67 million — $ 166,572 per day — to re-open eight national sites in @entity1 for up to 10 days
if the federal government shutdown ends before then , the state will receive a refund of unused monies " an official press statement explained
the deal would reopen arches , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity25 national parks
the other three locations that will be opened are @entity27 and @entity28 national monuments , as well as @entity30
" @entity1 's national parks are the backbone of many rural economies and hard - working utahns are paying a heavy price for this shutdown , " @entity6 said in the released statement
" i commend @entity38 for being open to @entity1 's solution , and the world should know @entity1 is open for business and visitors are welcome
" october is an especially profitable month for @entity1 's national parks , since optimal weather attracts a high volume of tourists
typically , officials estimate a $ 100 million yield for the month , so the parks ' closures would have had an especially high impact on the state
the @entity11 is now awaiting a transfer of funds from @entity1 , at which point it will notify " site - specific " personnel to return to work
the process of opening the parks after receiving the money should take some time , but in a statement from the governor 's office , the state anticipates all sites should be " fully operational by saturday "
in the event that the federal government shutdown drags on longer than the 10 days that have been accounted for , the state of @entity1 insists it would be able to make additional payments to keep the parks operational
the agreement between @entity6 and @entity10 stipulates that the money spent by the state can be reimbursed with @entity72 approval
however , as with other funds spent during the shutdown , @entity72 is under no obligation to refund the bill
it seems @entity6 is quite intent on pursuing repayment , with his office telling reporters " the governor has engaged @entity1 's congressional delegation to actively pursue timely repayment to state coffers
