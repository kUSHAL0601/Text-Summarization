-- @entity3 has canceled its planned live coverage of the may 11 jump off @entity6 by a @entity8 daredevil in his wingsuit , the @entity2 cable network announced
it was unclear monday night whether climber and parachutist @entity11 still planned to leap off the top of the world 's highest peak after his guides died in last week 's avalanche that killed 13 people
at first , the stuntman told his fans on @entity21 that he was sticking with his plans even though his sherpas were killed
@entity11 wrote sunday that he and his team " are staying on the mountain to honor our friends and complete our project
" but the post appeared to have been deleted monday
friday 's avalanche was the single deadliest incident on @entity6
three other people were missing and at least half a dozen were hurt in the slide , which occurred just above a base camp more than 20,000 feet above sea level
all 50 - plus climbers engulfed in the slide were @entity40 locals and @entity23 who were taking food and supplies to base camps on the the 29,000 - foot peak , authorities reported
@entity11 reported afterward that he was safe and mourned his lost team
" these men were the @entity47
far better men than me
my heart is broken , " he wrote
on sunday afternoon , the @entity3 announced it was pulling the plug on its planned live coverage of @entity11 's jump " in light of the overwhelming tragedy " and out of respect for the families of the dead
" our thoughts and prayers go out to the whole sherpa community , " the network said in a written statement
@entity11 's father told @entity0 that his son was aware of @entity3 's decision
@entity11 , who has scaled @entity6 years ago , planned to hurl himself off the mountain in a wingsuit -- a flying squirrel - like outfit that allows skilled jumpers to glide long distances before deploying a parachute for a safe landing
he used one to fly past the mountain on a 2010 test flight
" i 'm hoping to be up there for a while and enjoy the flight , " he told @entity0 in march
" this will be a chance of a lifetime for me
i wo n't probably have it again
" @entity40 's sherpas have been guiding climbers up @entity6 for six decades
the avalanche occurred at the busiest time of year , when would - be climbers arrive to acclimate themselves to thin air of the @entity90
before friday , the worst accident on @entity6 was in 1996 , when eight climbers disappeared in a storm
it was documented in the book and film " @entity96
" though hundreds of climbers now reach the summit each year , about 1 % of those who attempt it die -- " and as a workplace safety statistic , that 's pretty much off the charts , " @entity98 senior editor @entity97 told @entity0
