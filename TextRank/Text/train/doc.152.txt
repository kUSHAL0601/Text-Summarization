-- @entity1 was a source of misery for @entity5 's impoverished people and of fear for a world wary of his belligerent rhetoric -- but as an enduringly bizarre presence on the global stage , he was also an unexpected source of entertainment
while the reputedly ruthless leader was revered by a population weaned on propaganda , outside the hermetic @entity16 country what were seen as grandiose attempts at myth - making were seized on by popular culture
online , @entity1 's death generated @entity26 trends that referenced the movies or shows that caricatured him as a villainous clown trapped in the bathos of his own cruel isolation
@entity1 did little to help his own international image
his eccentric appearances sporting bouffant hair , over-sized sunglasses and a succession of drab boiler suits were frequently viewed as comical counterpoints to the rights abuses of his regime
meanwhile , as his country 's nuclear activities sparked diplomatic tensions , his media mouthpieces -- such as the @entity45 -- created their own unintentional humor as they swung wildly between angry invective and surreal flatteries of their " dear leader
" @entity1 's defining moment in recent popular culture appears to have been his portrayal in the 2004 film " @entity58 : @entity59 , " a satire on @entity63 president @entity62 's foreign policy
the film 's creators @entity64 and @entity67 paint the dictator as a foul - mouthed but misunderstood @entity70 villain whose plans for global chaos are constantly frustrated by incompetent underlings or bothersome international officials
in the hours after his death , " @entity58 " references were trending on @entity26 , particularly " @entity77 , " a nod to puppet @entity1 's mispronunciation of @entity77 , a real - life @entity81 weapons inspector who , in the film , is fed to @entity1 's man - eating sharks
another key " @entity58 " moment , when @entity1 ruefully bemoans his isolation in an opulent palace by singing about how he is lonely -- or " ronrey " -- was also being heavily referenced on social media
@entity64 and @entity67 were no strangers to @entity1 - based satire
their " @entity93 " cartoon series cast him as part of a villainous gang that included @entity96 , @entity97 and , incongruously , magician @entity98
in an appearance on media satire " @entity102 , " comedian @entity99 played @entity1 as a @entity5 weatherman , delivering the disingenuously upbeat forecast : " @entity5 , everything sunny all the time always , good time , beach party
" fellow comic @entity107 plays the dictator as host of the " @entity110 " on @entity111 , shooting dead audience members who fail to cheer and delivering punchlines such as : " do n't cry because i kill your wife and enslave your children
" @entity119 , there was renewed interest in websites that have sought to highlight the strange picture of @entity5 created by its propaganda machine
" @entity1 looking at @entity128 , " is an online gallery of photographs showing the dictator staring at banal objects
the images draw unintentional bleak humor from their repeated and blatant misrepresentation of life under a dictatorship
among recent entries , @entity1 can be seen looking at a pink sweater , pointing at a persimmon tree in full fruit , glumly inspecting a statuette of knights on horseback and grinning at a supermarket shelf packed with sausages
another website has trawled news bulletins on the official @entity45 to create a " random insult generator " that neatly encapsulates the peculiar version of the @entity147 language favored by @entity1 's regime
as regular @entity45 watchers can confirm , typical generator exhortations such as " you bourgeois stooge , " and " you reckless human scum , you will be dealt a thousandfold retaliatory blow ! " are eerily close to the real thing .
