@entity0 -- it should come as no surprise that prominent union leaders are among the first group president @entity6 courts as he seeks support for overhauling immigration policy
it was organized labor that helped ensure defeat of a bipartisan effort to reform the nation 's immigration laws five years ago
at that time , the @entity15 and other prominent union groups came out against the initiative , fearing a proposal for a temporary guest worker program for seasonal workers would weaken union membership and bargaining clout
that led to a handful of liberal - leaning @entity25 to vote against the bill , including sens. @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29
mindful that a potential split in the @entity25 coalition this time around could again prove fatal to the passage of an immigration bill , @entity6 met on tuesday with more than a dozen labor leaders
they included @entity15 president @entity36 , @entity37 of the @entity38 , and @entity39 of @entity40
@entity41 : five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform the purpose of the hour - long , closed - door meeting was to engage in a " dialogue " about " immigration reform and how it fits into his broader economic agenda , " the @entity45 said
in comments to reporters following the meeting , there was evidence the president had sought to ensure that the union leaders were in his corner before he unveils an immigration proposal
" it was an excellent conversation , " @entity36 said outside the @entity45
" i think we are all on the same page
" the @entity45 has long been hopeful that the labor movement get on board
despite a contentious relationship at times with labor , the president 's agenda has largely been supported by the major union leaders
@entity36 also notably attended @entity6 's immigration speech last week in @entity73
nonetheless , the same sticking points that turned labor against immigration reform five years ago remain
' now 's the time ' to move on immigration , @entity6 says conservatives , including @entity81 sen. @entity80 , are again pushing a temporary guest worker program that is favored by the business community and agricultural interests that depend on seasonal employment
but the major unions remain opposed to such a measure
in 2009 , both the @entity15 and the @entity38 jointly released guidelines on an immigration reform package they would support
those guidelines called for " improvement , not expansion " of temporary worker programs
@entity6 has so far not mentioned a guest worker program in his broad outlines of an immigration reform plan
the burden of attaining citizenship is another trip wire
both the @entity15 and @entity38 are lobbying for an easier path to citizenship than was proposed by the 2007 effort
that is in part because union membership has declined significantly over the past two decades along with contraction of @entity109 manufacturing
a surge of new citizens , many of whom will seek unionized jobs , could boost their numbers
" we were talking about trying to fix a broken system , " @entity36 said after the @entity45 meeting
" we were talking about commonsense reform that has an inclusive and broad path to citizenship that allows us to bring people in and take advantage of that
" @entity109 's brain drain dilemma : immigrant students who leave @entity36 declined to specify the kind of path to citizenship the president suggested he would support
another leader said she thought there was agreement between the labor groups and @entity6
" there was joint agreement by everybody in this room and the president that there must be a pathway to citizenship and it must be meaningful and real , " said @entity134 of the @entity135 , also a participant in the meeting
" it 's our job to get the kind of solution that will reflect that meaningful path
