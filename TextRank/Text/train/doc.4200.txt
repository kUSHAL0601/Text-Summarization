-- in court , the @entity2 neo-nazi couple seemed remorseful for the 2013 murder of a sex offender , but they changed their tunes when their life sentences were handed down
" child molesters do not deserve to live , " @entity8 said as he was led out of a @entity10 courthouse tuesday wearing handcuffs and striped prison scrubs
" had to do it over again , i 'd kill more
" as his wife , @entity16 , was placed into a police car for transport to prison , she added , " i have no regrets
killing that pedophile was the best day of my life
" the couple was charged in the murders of @entity26 , 59 , and his wife , @entity27 , 51 , in july
the @entity29 went to their @entity31 home pretending to have car trouble , entered the home and killed the couple , @entity10 chief deputy @entity28 said at the time
@entity8 , 31 , told police he killed the @entity36 because @entity26 was on the @entity2 sex offender registry , @entity28 said
he was convicted in 1991 of sexual assault on a child and again in 2003 of third - degree criminal sexual misconduct involving a 31 - year - old woman , @entity0 affiliate @entity38 reported , citing police and court records
@entity45 was not a registered sex offender , @entity28 told @entity0
the @entity36 were found dead july 22
they 'd been stabbed and shot with a .380 handgun , @entity28 said
police used images from the @entity36 ' home surveillance system to track down their killers , he said
@entity52 to identifying @entity8 , police said , were his tattoos : in addition to the words " white power " atop his bald head , he also has the word " skinhead " tattooed almost ear to ear beneath his chin
in bond court , @entity16 , 37 , called @entity26 a " demon , " and she and her husband claimed to be part of a white supremacist group called crew 41 , @entity38 reported
the pair pleaded guilty tuesday to two counts of murder , two counts of kidnapping , two counts of possession of a firearm during a violent crime and first - degree burglary , the station said
prior to their sentencing , both @entity29 expressed remorse for their crimes , as @entity8 told the court , " not a day goes by that i do n't regret the incident that happened , and i know that what i 've done is a sin
" @entity16 also feigned contrition , reading from the @entity88 and saying , " i truly believe @entity89 has forgiven @entity8 and i. i hope you do , too
" they told the court they suffered from mental problems and had a history of sexual abuse in their families
the @entity29 ' defense attorney asked for 30 - year sentences , @entity38 reported
but circuit judge @entity102 was n't buying it
" i saw you smiling at each other in court , " he told them , handing down life sentences
and with that , so went the @entity29 ' remorse
" see you perverts later , " @entity8 said as he was escorted out of the courtroom
" that 's what child molesters get
" outside the courthouse , @entity16 told reporters that she and @entity8 have " a love that will withstand " their life sentences , and if given the opportunity , they 'd kill @entity26 again
reporters challenged her about her apparent change of heart : was she lying when she told the court she had repented ? " no , it 's not true
my lawyer made me say it , " she said
and did she have anything to say to @entity36 ' families ? " may they die also , " she said before officers placed her in the back of a squad car
family members told @entity38 they were pleased with the @entity29 ' sentences and unsurprised by their vitriol
that does n't mean @entity26 's sister was happy about being taunted
" it made me mad
they was laughing about what they did , took somebody 's life the way they did it , " @entity138 told the station
" nobody should die like that
