" everyone around me , except me , was shot , " he said
" i was pretty fortunate to get away
" @entity1 , 33 , a photojournalist , was at the second - line parade when gunfire broke out at the corner of @entity13 and @entity14
second - line parades , which involve dancing and brass bands , are a @entity7 tradition
they happen most every sunday , except during the hottest months in summer , according to @entity1
" we turned off of a main thoroughfare to a smaller residential street , and that 's when the shots rang out
i was standing , i believe , right next to the shooter
i saw muzzle flash , but unfortunately i did n't get a chance to see who the shooter was , " he said
@entity1 , who has worked in the @entity30 , started taking pictures
he sent those images to @entity33
" it 's a little jarring when you see these types of things on the home front , " he said
we 're plagued by crime , and it 's just not getting better no matter what we do
" according to police , 19 people were injured in the shooting , including two children
ten men and seven women were among the victims
the children suffered graze wounds
other injuries ranged from minor to severe
shots were fired from different guns , and officers saw three suspects running from the scene , police said
one of the suspects was described as an @entity63 male , approximately 18 to 22 years old , wearing a white t - shirt and blue jean shorts
no one is in custody
" this is an extremely unusual occurrence , and we 're confident that we will make swift arrests , " said @entity68 , a police spokeswoman
police superintendent @entity74 told @entity0 affiliate @entity76 that it appears " two or three people just , for a reason unknown to us , started shooting at , towards , or in the crowd
" he asked anyone with information to call authorities
@entity7 mayor @entity84 echoed that request , challenging the community to get involved
" it 's important for us , as i have said , to change the culture of death on the streets of @entity7 to a culture of life , and it 's going to take an all - hands - on - deck approach , " he said
" these kinds of incidents are not going to go unanswered
we 're going to be very , very aggressive
there were hundreds of people out there today , so somebody knows who did this
