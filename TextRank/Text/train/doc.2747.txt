-- tractor - trailer drivers , if you text while driving in the middle of the freeway , then the future may belong to you
if you can afford a @entity9 truck , that is
the @entity11 vehicle maker sent an 18 - wheeler barreling down the @entity12 recently , while the driver surfed the internet for food recipes on tablet computer -- at least that 's how media photos told the story
its test drive was brief , covering about three miles , @entity11 media reported
the trucker 's hands did n't touch the wheel and his eyes were fixed on pork cutlets
but that could be the way some drive in the future , perhaps in the next decade or so
that 's the message of the prototype " @entity31 , " which @entity9 says is the first self - driven freight vehicle
it may seem illogical right now , but the hands - off idea is aimed at eliminating human error
special cameras and multiple radar systems watch the road , the sides of the road , and cars and trucks behind the vehicle
@entity31 is also envisioned to communicate with other vehicles and connect to growing sources of online information as @entity49 balloons on the road
its computerized controls will also make it more fuel efficient , @entity9 boasts
once the truck merges into traffic , it wo n't accelerate to @entity57 breakneck speeds
the system will throttle it to a meek 50 mph , @entity9 says
many of the component parts to put a vehicle like this into production are already available in trucks on the market : systems that help drivers keep their distance from other drivers , active braking assistance , guidance and mapping systems , and fine - tuned cruise control and tons of other hi - tech tchotchke
if a puttering slowpoke pulls out in front of @entity79 , it will slow down automatically to keep off of its bumper , but the 18 - wheeler wo n't pass it by itself
that 's when the driver will have to turn off the ball game , put down the @entity87 or lay away the knife and fork , then take the wheel
but he 'd be ill advised to goof off too much , because two cameras and a sensor under his seat will monitor his activities
@entity9 says that the trucker will still be expected to be responsible for controlling the vehicle
but by then they wo n't be called that anymore
in 2025 , they 'll be promoted to " transport managers
" holographic staff and no lost luggage : how you 'll travel in 2024 this helicopter flies itself
