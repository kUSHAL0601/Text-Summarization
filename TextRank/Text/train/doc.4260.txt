@entity1 gov. @entity0 has named a 32 - member " severe weather warning and preparedness task force " that will recommend how the state can better respond to storms like the one that paralyzed @entity9 last week
@entity0 came under fire for his slow reaction to the storm that dropped 2.6 inches of snow on the @entity9 area that seemed to catch authorities off guard
the exodus of drivers from @entity9 clogged the highways , stranding thousands of students in schools and forcing numerous commuters to spend extra hours inside their cars on icy roads
the governor apologized to the public and promised to handle things differently next time
" i 'm the governor , the buck stops with me , " he said
the task force , composed of four local television meteorologists , other experts and school and state agency leaders , will meet in public and report to the governor 60 days after its first meeting , which has yet to be scheduled
state agency heads are scheduled to deliver an internal report to deal in 10 days , the governor 's office said
other changes will happen right away
" effective immediately , a storm warning will trigger a message to cell phones in targeted areas , as in the @entity46 system , and advise against road travel , " @entity0 said monday
" we will go one step further with school superintendents by emailing them weather condition updates , so that they have the most up - to - date information when determining whether to close schools
" the state also will overhaul its " state emergency app , " which will now include information such as alternative traffic routes and shelter locations , he said
on january 28 , as the storm approached , people working in @entity9 started driving home to the suburbs
a massive traffic jam gripped the city , leading to commutes of more than 20 hours for countless motorists
more than 2,000 cars were abandoned on roadsides
some employees spent the night at their workplaces , and commuters gave up trying to get home and slept in emergency shelters or even on the floors of roadside businesses
students who were n't picked up by buses or their parents slept in their schools
the public lashed out at @entity83 and @entity9 mayor @entity84 for not acting quickly enough
journalists sharply questioned @entity0 and @entity84
" @entity86 " and " @entity87 " mocked @entity1 and @entity9
@entity84 , who works closely with deal , also said he 'll respond more aggressively when bad weather strikes
" we 're going to be as prepared as we can to be ready for the next storm , " @entity0 told reporters
timeline : 2 inches of chaos in @entity9
