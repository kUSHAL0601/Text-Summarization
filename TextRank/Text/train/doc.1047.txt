@entity0 -- following an investigation , @entity3 apologized to @entity5 this week over an august incident in which five @entity5 border guards were killed , the @entity3 @entity2 said
the apology , issued tuesday , was overshadowed by news that a deal had been reached for the release of @entity3 soldier @entity12 , who was captured by the @entity14 group @entity13 more than five years ago
however , it was largely seen as an olive branch to the transitional @entity5 government , as relations between @entity3 and @entity5 have become strained in recent months
on august 18 , militants crossed into @entity3 from @entity5 territory to attack @entity3 civilian targets
eight @entity3 citizens were killed in the attacks , which @entity3 has said were the work of a jihadist group based in @entity26
responding to the attacks , @entity3 troops killed five @entity5 border guards while in pursuit of the militants
the investigation into the incident was conducted by senior @entity34 officials and @entity5 army officials , the @entity2 said
for security reasons , the ministry said , the results of the probe remain sealed
@entity3 issued a rare statement of regret three days after the incident , after @entity5 suggested it was recalling its ambassador in protest
the overture , however , was deemed insufficient by many in @entity5 and days later , angry protesters ransacked the @entity3 embassy in @entity47
the entire staff was hastily withdrawn after @entity50 president @entity49 personally intervened with the @entity5 to secure their safe passage , but the sequence of events dealt a blow to @entity3 - @entity5 relations
in the wake of the embassy incident , @entity3 prime minister @entity56 said @entity3 would stick to its 1979 peace agreement with @entity5
in the tuesday statement , @entity3 defense minister @entity60 said the august militant attack was " despicable " and " meant to murder as many @entity3 citizens as possible and destroy the peaceful relations that are strategically important between @entity3 and @entity5 , " the tuesday statement said
but " based on the findings of the investigation , the defense minister decided to express his apology to @entity5 over the death of every @entity5 policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of @entity3 fire
" @entity56 , meanwhile , spoke thursday with the head of @entity5 's @entity78 field marshal @entity77 and thanked him for the " central role " @entity5 played in the agreement for @entity12 's return , the prime minister 's office said
" your assistance warms the cockles of the heart of all @entity3 citizens , " @entity56 told @entity77 .
