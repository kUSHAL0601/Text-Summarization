-- @entity2 's football duopoly of @entity3 and @entity4 has become so dominant that sponsors have lost interest in backing other @entity2 clubs
" having two monsters like @entity3 and @entity4 , the world 's leading concert in football , overshadows the other clubs , " financial expert @entity8 told @entity0
" sports sponsorship companies are more inclined to be the third or fourth sponsor of these two great clubs , @entity4 and @entity3 , rather than be the first sponsor of a club without universal screening , " he added
@entity8 told @entity0 that the apparent advantage of having global brands in the top tier of @entity2 football -- known as @entity24 -- is in fact a serious detriment to many clubs
according to @entity29 's 2012 rankings , @entity3 is the richest club in the world by revenue -- $ 695 million -- and second only to @entity33 in market value
@entity35 meanwhile , @entity4 -- widely recognized as the best football team in the world with a pedigree of stars such as @entity40 and @entity41 -- is the second richest club in the world by revenue
gay de @entity8 says the presence of these two football behemoths combined with billions of euros of debt - estimated at $ 4.5 billion for @entity24 teams -- and liabilities has meant @entity2 football clubs can no longer cope with this burden
traditionally local governments in @entity2 have had a role to play in the financial management of football clubs
in the past , teams such as @entity57 and @entity3 , as sporting institutions , have received subsidies from local authorities , according to @entity2 football expert @entity60
but in the current economic climate , state investment in football clubs is not a high priority for many politicians as the central government in @entity3 grapples with a spiralling national debt and chronic unemployment of over 25 %
@entity2 -- the eurozone 's fourth largest economy -- is likely to be the next bailout casualty of the debt crisis in the 17 - nation currency union
the government in @entity3 has already requested a rescue package for its ailing banks , which require almost 60 billion euros ( $ 76.4 million ) in support following an audit in september
@entity79 's plea further down the feeding chain of @entity2 football the financial situation is even more dire -- so much so that one @entity2 club in the third division -- @entity79 -- has turned to football fans for help
earlier this month the @entity88 - based team launched a campaign , whereby fans could effectively buy shares at approximately 11 euros [ $ 13 ] each in exchange for a token stake in the club
word of @entity79 's plight went viral on @entity97 and football fans across the globe responded by purchasing shares and raising more than one million euros ( $ 1.2 million ) in nine days
@entity8 argued that the current state of @entity2 football clubs is the result of poor financial regulation and supervision
when asked whether other teams might also stand on the precipice of extinction , he said : " i absolutely know it will happen ... the next few months -- and i hope i am wrong -- will be tragic for some clubs
