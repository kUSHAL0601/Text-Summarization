@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 accorded a red - carpet welcome tuesday to the top leader of @entity6 's military junta , currently on a five - day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties between the neighboring countries
gen. @entity10 received a ceremonial reception in the sandstone presidential palace in @entity0 before he drove to the shrine to @entity1 's independence leader @entity14 to pay homage
@entity1 president @entity19 , prime minister @entity20 , members of his cabinet and several top bureaucrats greeted the junta leader as a state guest
the military ruler 's trip underscored the close relationship between the two nations -- one seen as one of the world 's most vibrant democracies and another despised by the @entity30 as a repressive regime
in 1951 , the two countries signed what they called a " treaty of friendship , " and over the past few years , bilateral trade has soared to almost $ 1 billion , according to @entity1 officials
several @entity1 companies have invested in @entity6 's energy sector
and @entity1 's main space agency has helped set up a data - processing center in @entity42 for remote - sensing applications , authorities in @entity0 say
@entity10 's visit began on sunday with a tour of sacred @entity48 sites in eastern @entity1
it came days after @entity51 secretary of state @entity50 urged @entity1 and other countries in the region to push @entity6 , formerly known as @entity6 , to comply with @entity55 human rights resolutions and nuclear nonproliferation agreements
" it is critical that @entity6 hear from you , its neighbors , " she said in a speech at the @entity59 meeting
@entity63 described life in @entity6 as " dangerous " for the country 's inhabitants and called upon other nations to push for democratic reforms there
" we would encourage @entity1 and other countries to send a clear message to @entity6 that it needs to change its course , " @entity71 spokesman @entity70 said last week
the @entity6 general 's itinerary also includes tours of @entity1 's information - technology hub in @entity81 and the industrial center of @entity83
his visit is the second by a top junta administrator in a year .
