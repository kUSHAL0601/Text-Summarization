" truly inspiring to be able to come here
@entity1 was a great girl
hopefully she would have been a belieber , " @entity0 wrote

he told fans on @entity32 it was a " chill day

@entity0 : from tween sensation to adult icon @entity1 's story @entity52 was 13 when she and her family began hiding in a dark and damp " secret annex " of the house to escape the @entity57 roundup of @entity58 in @entity59 in july 1942
she never left the house for two years , spending much of her time writing in her diary , until she and her family were found and arrested by @entity63 in august 1944
@entity65 man reintroduces his cousin : @entity1 's letters @entity1 died of typhus in the @entity69 in march 1945
her diary survived to tell her tragic and inspiring story
@entity0 's representatives did not immediately respond to @entity40 's request for comment sunday , but visitors to the @entity1 facebook page had plenty to say
a sample of reactions : " glad he went , but , the last sentence is very self serving
he missed the lessons of @entity1 totally
" " she would 've been a what ? that little idiot is way too full of himself
she 's an important historical figure so show some respect
" " @entity88 to turn an inspiring moment into something about yourself
" " lets hope she would have never been a belieber " " here i thought it was nice of him to go and see the history of her until i read what he wrote
have some respect mr. @entity0 for she will be famous long after your fame fizzles
" " ' despite everything , i believe people are really good at heart ' - @entity1 i think before everyone goes bashing @entity0 we should take a moment to think about these words and why @entity1 said them
" @entity0 spat on me , neighbor charges
