@entity0 -- the @entity3 government has affirmed that $ 29 million from its budget for post-earthquake and tsunami reconstruction is going toward extra security measures for the country 's whaling fleet , angering environmental activists like @entity11
the whaling industry is " siphoning money away from the victims of the march 11 triple disaster , at a time when they need it most , " @entity13 , executive director of @entity14 , said this week , referring to the earthquake , tsunami and nuclear crisis that struck @entity14 in march
but @entity22 , an official from the @entity23 , said thursday he funds would help " support the reconstruction of a whaling town and nearby area , " which was devastated by the natural disasters
" many people in the area eat whale meat , " he said
" they are waiting for @entity14 's commercial whaling to resume and it is their hope for recovery
" the government had said earlier this year , after it passed the tsunami reconstruction budget , that it would strengthen " measures against acts of sabotage by anti-whaling groups , " @entity22 said
the government earmarked a total of 498.9 billion yen ( $ 6.4 billion ) of the reconstruction budget for spending on fisheries
of that , 2.28 billion yen has been put into extra security measures for the whaling fleet , which left port for its annual hunt tuesday
@entity14 's whale hunts are conducted by the @entity50 , a nonprofit research organization overseen by @entity14 's @entity51
an official from the @entity53 said the deployment of guards this year to protect the fleet from obstruction by anti-whaling activists was the largest yet , but declined to give exact numbers
the @entity53 had previously provided protection to the fleet for its 2007 - 08 and 2010 - 11 hunts
last season 's whale hunt in the @entity65 was cut short when anti-whaling activists from the @entity67 blocked strikes on the animals
@entity67 said its actions saved 800 whales , and the organization has promised to be back in force this season
@entity14 has faced international pressure to curtail its whaling activities
in 2010 , @entity77 initiated proceedings in the @entity79 to stop @entity3 whaling
@entity1 's @entity81 contributed to this report .
