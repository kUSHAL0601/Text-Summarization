a humpback whale has become tangled up in a synthetic line attached to a buoy off the coast of the island of @entity6
maritime officials are trying to find the right opportunity to unsnarl the roughly 45 - foot - long mammal as it swims around the @entity10
" we want it to come back to an area that is safe
it is not too easy to detangle a 40 ton animal , " said @entity13 , the @entity14 in @entity6 for the @entity15
the humpback was first spotted friday
it has since been sighted several times by people as it moves around the island counterclockwise , dragging the red buoy with it
" we know that these situations are not immediately life threatening , but the animal will eventually succumb to this if we do n't rescue it , " @entity13 told @entity1 on tuesday
weather conditions and the whale 's shifting location appear to have complicated the task
" we are standing by waiting for certain things to come together , " @entity13 said
whales regularly get caught up in lines around the @entity38
" in the past year , 13 large whales have been reported entangled in gear and we cut one free successfully maybe two , " @entity13 said
" the second one , we were n't sure because the line did n't shed away
" he said the response network he runs manages to free on average two to four whales each year but does n't always find them when they are reported
