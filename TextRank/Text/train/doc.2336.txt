-- a group of hackers in @entity3 says it has found a way to bypass the fingerprint - sensor security system on the new @entity6
the hackers claim they fooled the @entity9 biometric security of the @entity6 by photographing a fingerprint left on a glass surface and using the resulting image to create a fake " finger " which unlocked the phone
they demonstrated their exploits in a video posted sunday to @entity18
" we hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics
it is plain stupid to use something that you canÂ ´ t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token , " said @entity24 , a spokesman for the group , the @entity25 , in a post online
in the post , the hackers said they snapped a high - resolution photo of a fingerprint , inverted it and laser - printed it with extra toner onto a transparent sheet
then they smeared pink latex milk or white woodglue into the fingerprint pattern , lifted a thin latex sheet from it and placed it onto the sensor to unlock the phone
" as we have said now for ... years , fingerprints should not be used to secure anything
you leave them everywhere , and it is far too easy to make fake fingers out of lifted prints , " said a hacker , who goes by the nickname @entity50 , on the @entity25 's site
@entity57 did not respond to a request from @entity0 for comment
@entity60 and the @entity25 are being rewarded for their efforts
they were named the winners of an online contest offering a bounty of cash and other prizes to the first person or group to successfully hack the new @entity6 's @entity9 system
the contest , @entity71 , was created by @entity72 , an independent computer security researcher known for demonstrating hacks of smartphones , and @entity76 , owner of @entity77 , a cybersecurity firm
it invites donors to contribute to the bounty , which so far includes an assortment of cash , bitcoins ( a form of digital currency ) , several bottles of booze and " a dirty sex book
" " it 's official
@entity60 of the @entity25 has been declared the winner of # istouchidhackedyet congrats ! video to come soon , " @entity72 posted on @entity90 monday afternoon
the total cash bounty topped $ 16,000 at one point , although one donor has since reneged on a promised $ 10,000 donation , according to the site
according to terms @entity72 posted on @entity90 , to collect the bounty a hacker had to lift a fingerprint from the phone or elsewhere and reproduce it in such a way that will allow the hacker to unlock an @entity6 in less than five tries
all the steps had to be documented on video
" the whole point of # istouchidhackedyet was to put up or shut up with regards to criticisms of @entity57 's @entity9 security and implementation , " @entity72 said saturday on @entity90
the @entity6 , which went on sale friday , has a fingerprint sensor in its home button for added security
@entity57 calls the new security system @entity9
phone owners must " register " their print with the device , after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button
other users ' fingerprints will not unlock the phone , which protects it from thieves
how secure is your @entity6 fingerprint ? the @entity9 system is meant for human fingerprints , of course , but it apparently works with animals , too
a @entity137 man posted a video friday to @entity139 that showed him using the paw of his pet @entity142 to unlock his new @entity6
@entity72 and @entity76 are so - called " white hat " hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems
tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues , which they can then patch before users ' personal information is compromised .
