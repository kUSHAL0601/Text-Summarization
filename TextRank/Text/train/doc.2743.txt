-- so people are either surprised or snarky about @entity2 going onto @entity3 to find a guy
what did they think she was going to do : make a man out of paper @entity8 or cookie dough ? stars and celebrities are no different from anyone else
when they get over a certain age , they stop meeting eligible partners
if a woman does meet someone compelling at a party , she does n't know if he 's available or just wants to play
if she meets him at the office , it might be too complicated
but in general , when men and women get over 50 , the odds of just bumping into @entity27 or mr. @entity28 are n't in their favor
so the really committed ones go hunting where the odds are better , and that 's online
@entity35 famously responded to the question of why he robbed banks by stating , " because that 's where the money is
" well , that 's why boomers are flocking to the web : other 50 plusers who are looking for love are there
by the way , i do n't use the verb flocking loosely ; just about every site , @entity52 , @entity53 , com , ok @entity55 and more , report the biggest jump in new people joining their sites are in the 50 and over crowd
but let 's not stop at the rise in numbers on the @entity63
let 's go to the more interesting fact : they are going online to find love , passion and sex
there , i 've said it : middle - aged men and women and people old enough to be thanked by @entity75 on the " today " show still want it all
they want to cuddle , kiss , hold hands , get touched in erotic zones and have intercourse
and they do n't want you to think that 's cute or optional
their sexual and emotional needs do n't die before they do
in fact , a lot of medical evidence indicates that if they do have physical affection , love and sex they will live longer
but if most of these men and women waited for their friends to fix them up or for someone to approach them on the street , they 'd most likely be alone forever
and they do n't want to be
at 50 they could have another 50 years together
or they could have 10 rewarding years
i have friends that have been together for four years , since she was 83 and he was 86
they go back and forth and stay with each other in their assisted living apartments
they are in love and no less in love , and in no less fabulous a manner , than when they were with their late spouses
so do n't sneer at @entity2 , at least not for online dating
applaud her for her bravery and knowing what she wants , without letting pride get in the way
i hope she serves as a role model for all those older men and women whose amorous and romantic ambitions have been stifled for fear of ridicule
" ' what will my friends say , " they ask me , " if they see me on senior friend finder or @entity132 ? " my answer is : they will say " good for you
" at least that 's what my friends said when i went online
and then they said , " congratulations , " when i fell in love and got engaged
