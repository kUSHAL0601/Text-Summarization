with an estimated 30,000 @entity30 fans packed into the stadium , @entity28 set off the @entity33 celebrations by netting a 69th minute winner
that strike unleashed a carnival atmosphere around the streets of @entity27 as @entity13 became the first team from @entity39 to win the competition since 2006
@entity13 : craziest fans in the world ? " we played a high quality match , " a delighted @entity13 coach @entity43 told reporters
each player performed their own role and were able to do well in their position
" the @entity39 side , who won the @entity55 in july , rode their luck at times with goalkeeper @entity58 making several important stops
the crucial moment came with 21 minutes of the contest remaining when @entity28 headed in from close range after @entity64 's shot was blocked
@entity26 , which recently became the first ever defending holder to exit the @entity66 at the @entity67 , had its chances to equalize but failed to hit the target

@entity26 cruise into @entity11 final " this is the final of the @entity11 for the @entity39 teams , " @entity26 's interim manager @entity82 told reporters
" you could see this from the first minute
our players have some quality but , physically , some of them are n't so strong
" we knew it would be a tough game against a good team
i think they had one ( clear cut ) chance and they scored and we did n't take our chances
" we had four very clear chances
their goalkeeper was man of the match ( sic ) and for me that means a lot
" the defeat left @entity26 's @entity109 , a boyhood supporter of @entity13 , in tears at the final whistle
