-- @entity1 , the celebrated screenwriter whose punchy dialogue propelled @entity4 's " @entity3 " and the @entity6 movie " @entity7 , " will write and direct an upcoming film on the life of @entity11 co-founder @entity10
@entity12 has confirmed that @entity1 will adapt " @entity10 , " the in - depth biography of the tech icon that was written by @entity15 and released shortly after @entity10 ' death last year
" @entity10 ' story is unique : he was one of the most revolutionary and influential men not just of our time but of all time , " @entity17 , co-chair of @entity12 , said in a written release
" there is no writer working in @entity26 today who is more capable of capturing such an extraordinary life for the screen than @entity1 ; in his hands , we 're confident that the film will be everything that @entity10 himself was : captivating , entertaining , and polarizing
" @entity1 won an @entity34 for adapting " @entity7 , " which in 2010 propelled @entity6 founder @entity35 to household - name status
his other work includes " @entity38 , " " @entity39 , " " @entity40 , " " @entity3 " and " @entity41
" the yet - unnamed @entity10 film will be @entity1 's first movie - directing gig
@entity12 reportedly wanted @entity1 for the film and began courting him immediately after securing the rights to @entity15 's book late last year
@entity1 actually knew @entity47 and wrote a piece for @entity49 about his memories of @entity10 after his death
he wrote that he and @entity10 had developed a " phone friendship " that led @entity10 to invite him to write a movie for @entity54 ( the animation studio @entity10 ran ) and to tour @entity11
" i told him i 'd take him up on it and i never did , " @entity1 wrote
" but i still keep thinking about that @entity54 movie
and for me , that 's @entity10 's legacy
that , and the fact that i wrote this on a @entity61 that i loved taking out of the box
" another @entity10 movie is also in the works
an independent film starring " @entity66 " alum @entity65 is scheduled to begin filming in may .
