@entity0 -- in many ways , @entity3 's childhood came to an abrupt halt at 10:49 a.m. on august 10 , 1999
that 's the moment a man named @entity8 entered the front door of the @entity10 in @entity0 and started shooting
five people were wounded , including three children
@entity3 , who was attending summer camp there , had the bad luck to be in the lobby
he took two bullets to his left leg and hip
he was 6 at the time , and is among few people who witnessed the horrific sights and sounds of a mass shooting as a very young child
like the children of @entity26 , @entity27 , he saw blood , he heard screams and he was scared for his life
shooting triggers ' mind battle ' for @entity34 victims the schoolchildren in @entity27 , in the wake of the mass shooting at @entity38 , have a long road ahead of them , says @entity3 , now 19
he was traumatized for years
" if we heard helicopters , sirens , loud noises -- anything that would startle me -- the house was on lockdown , " he said
" i locked every door
" even when things were quiet , walking around the house could be stressful , as @entity3 thought a killer like @entity52 might be hiding behind every corner
" it 's not just , ' i 'm scared something might pop out at me , ' it was , ' i 'm scared for my life , ' " @entity3 remembered in an interview from his parents ' home in @entity0
@entity38 victim 's dad praises her short life @entity65 , who was 5 when he was shot just a few feet away from @entity3 13 years ago , said he felt scared at school even five years after the shooting , and sleeping at friends ' houses was out of the question
" i could n't be an average child , " he said
the intensity of the trauma has dulled with time , the young men say , but the shooting still affects them
for example , both of them chose to go to college in @entity0 so they would n't be far from home when they had a bad moment
" if i did run into those times , i did n't want to be a plane flight away , " @entity3 said
" i did n't want to be a six - hour car ride away
i wanted to be five minutes away from my home , my safety zone
" @entity3 and @entity65 have insights and advice for the parents of @entity38 children , which can also apply to families whose children have suffered other types of trauma
shooting victims range in age from 6 to 56 let them talk -- or not " if i said i did n't want to talk about it , we did n't talk about it , " @entity3 remembers
" if i wanted to talk about it , we talked about it
" expect your life to be disrupted when @entity3 was a young boy and put his house on lockdown , his parents could n't leave , even if they had to get to work
if they were eating lunch at a restaurant and police officers walked in to dine , the family would have to get up and go , because police reminded him of the shootings
" my parents were great , " he said
allow your child to find his way as a teenager , @entity3 decided to do work with the @entity119 , and found solace in talking to other victims
@entity122 , the third child injured in the @entity0 shooting , took refuge in nature
he was also 6 at the time of the shooting
" in nature you are surrounded by love and beauty , " he wrote in a high school @entity129 paper he shared with @entity1
" bad people can not get me
" repeat comforting thoughts @entity122 's mother , @entity137 , remembers telling her son over and over that @entity52 was in jail and could n't hurt him anymore
" that seemed to be what he needed to hear , " she says
tell your child how strong he is @entity65 says one of the most helpful things his parents did was to tell him how strong he was to survive such a horrendous event
" my slogan was , ' you 're @entity65 and you can do anything , ' " he remembers with a smile
support crucial for kids after trauma
