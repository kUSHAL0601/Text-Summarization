-- authorities are investigating what happened to a @entity6 teenager whose body was found along a flight path in @entity2 with " trauma that was consistent with a fall from a significant height , " a @entity2 district attorney said
" it appears , more likely than not , that ( @entity17 ) @entity16 was able to breach airport security and hide in the wheel well of a commercial jetliner without being detected by airport security personnel , " @entity12 , district attorney for @entity13 , @entity2 , told reporters friday
the mystery started november 15 , when 16 - year - old @entity17 was last seen by a sibling at their home in @entity26 , @entity6 , according to @entity12
later that day , his family discovered @entity17 was n't home and reported him missing
" about 7 p.m. , a @entity30 - 400 aircraft was boarded and took off from @entity6 's @entity31 , en route to @entity35 's @entity34 , " @entity12 told reporters
" at approximately 9:30 p.m. that same evening , a group of area college students came upon a severely injured body " in the town of @entity40 , @entity12 said
" this was directly below a flight path
" the body was later determined to be @entity17 's
the autopsy on @entity17 's body " did not reveal any knife or gun wounds , but did show trauma that was consistent with a fall from a significant height , " @entity12 said
he said a toxicology test turned out negative
investigators examined two planes that had originated in @entity26 and followed a similar flight path , @entity12 said
they found " what appeared to be physical evidence of someone having been in a left wheel well of one of the planes was located and documented -- including hand prints visible in greasy areas and scuff marks in the area that would accommodate a person
" on friday , @entity40 police and other authorities conducted a search of the wooded area along the flight path , @entity12 said
" they recovered two dark @entity73 sneakers with white stripes , consistent with those that the @entity16 family describe as belonging to @entity17 , " @entity12 said
during the investigation , @entity12 said , one local resident described hearing a loud , crashing noise shortly before 9 p.m. the night @entity17 's body was found
state police have ruled out motor vehicle homicide as a possible cause for @entity17 's injuries
" the theory that the death may have involved a fall from a passing airplane -- as has happened in other parts of the country and other parts of the world -- began to be explored , " @entity12 said
fingerprints lifted from @entity17 's body were run through a national database , but no matches were found
" but investigators released a handwritten note found in the pocket of the jeans he was wearing , and a member of the family recognized the name and made contact with @entity40 police , " @entity12 said
last week , @entity2 state and local police traveled to @entity6 to take samples of grease used in maintaining aircraft to see if the grease found on @entity17 's pants could be matched to that grease , @entity12 said
forensics tests are still pending .
