-- @entity2 's @entity1 was n't the first superhero with bad habits and a bad attitude
@entity6 , the protagonist of " @entity7 : the @entity7 , " has a bit of the devil in him : his skin is red ; he has two shorn - off horns on his head , a gargantuan club fist and a long , slippery tail
@entity17 returns in the title role in " @entity7 : the @entity7
" he also has a down - to - earth side : a fondness for @entity23 cigars , @entity25 beer , tv and candy
he has a short fuse and he 'd like a little appreciation for his efforts , please
he deserves it , too
this rank outsider is n't a billionaire like @entity34 or @entity35
he 's not even a scientist like @entity37
he 's more of a working stiff , a slugger with a gruff manner and a stogie in the side of his mouth -- but he wants to bat for the right team
( according to writer - artist @entity46 , the character was inspired by his father , a cabinetmaker
) hellboy -- or " @entity49 " to his friends -- has switched studios since his 2004 big - screen debut , from @entity53 to @entity54
writer - director @entity56 is still pulling the strings , and the key creative personnel are all back , including @entity17 in the title role , @entity60 as the pyrokinetic @entity61 ( now mrs. hellboy ) , @entity63 as the piscine @entity64 ( the brains to @entity49 's brawn ) , and -- behind the scenes -- cinematographer @entity68 , and art whizzes @entity70 and @entity71
between them , they conjure up one hell of a creature feature
" @entity7 " boasts a dazzling multitude of imaginary beings : the deceptively delicate tooth fairies ( so called because they eat bone , with a fondness for teeth in particular ) ; the elfin king whose antlers grow out of his head to form a crown ; the plantlike forest god that collapses into a strangely beautiful floral mulch right under the @entity87 ; the magnificent @entity88 , an old crone who unfurls her wings to reveal a sparkling set of eyes ( an avian variation on the creepiest creation in the acclaimed " @entity95 , " del @entity56 's last movie )
then there 's the redoubtable @entity98 , an officious but in many ways admirable @entity100 who only exists as a vapor trail -- except when he 's bottled up in an ingeniously modified , but still splendidly archaic , deep - sea diving suit
when a filmmaker can invest even a puff of smoke with so much chutzpah you know he 's on to something
it 's wonderful to see del @entity56 let his imagination run rampant like this
ireport.com : did you see " @entity7 " ? share your review the plot concerns an ancient race that 's determined to wage war on humanity , but it 's secondary to del @entity56 's amazing characters
the @entity25 director 's first @entity124 movies ( " mimic " and " @entity126 " ) were far less distinctive than his spanish - language films : " @entity128 , " " @entity129 " and " @entity95
" you could n't really call " @entity7 " an advance on the latter -- " @entity136 's " was nominated for six @entity132 and won three -- but it 's obvious he relishes this material
it 's pulpy and hammy and unashamedly lowbrow , and @entity138 has the confidence and power to make it his own
the film feels very free , loose and ( unusually for a special - effects picture ) improvisational
an outsize personality such as @entity17 is in his element here
even when the wisecracks fall short -- there are an awful lot of " ass " gags -- they are closer to the grubby , subversive impulses of the comic books than the over-hyped , market - tested , industrial - strength blockbuster adaptations @entity124 churns out
it 's not for nothing that the central tension running through this movie is @entity49 's anarchic streak , his sometimes irresponsible need to be his own man in the @entity162 ( the " x-men " - like institution where he works ) and in his marriage
scratch the surface , and this is a film about love and loyalty , figuring out where your deepest bonds lie
@entity170 may damn " @entity7 " as a " comic book movie , " though even they would have to grant that its wonderful idiosyncrasies indicate brilliance
but it 's more than that
hellboy does so much growing up over the course of these 110 minutes , we may have to call him " @entity180 " from now on
let 's hope @entity54 stays the course and gives us that opportunity
people as creative as del @entity56 and his gang need all the support we can give them
" @entity7 : the @entity7 " is rated @entity187 and runs 110 minutes
