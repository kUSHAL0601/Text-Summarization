-- @entity2 scientists have dated a star thought to be the oldest yet discovered , and it 's right in our neighborhood -- astronomically speaking
the star , which has been given the name @entity9 , is thought by a team of astronomers at the @entity12 to be 13.6 billion years old
the star itself is not a new discovery -- it is faintly visible on existing photographic maps of the southern sky
but the recent dating places it as older than any other celestial body previously found
the star is part of our @entity25 galaxy and only around 6,000 light years from @entity27 , relatively close in astronomical terms
@entity29 , a research fellow at @entity12 's @entity30 , published the findings in the scientific journal nature
" stars act as time capsules , " @entity29 told @entity0
" this one took a little sample of the universe at the time that is was formed ... and means we can study [ what the early universe was like ] in great detail
" the discovery of the star 's age -- which dates it at only a hundred million years younger than scientific estimates of the age of the universe itself -- is significantly older than any previously dated stars
the oldest celestial bodies discovered thus far have been 13.2 billion years old
@entity29 and his team used the @entity54 telescope to find ancient stars as part of an ongoing project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky
the team used a technique for imaging stars to ascertain how much iron was present -- the younger a star , the greater the amounts of iron it had
the @entity54 telescope is unique in its ability to find stars with low iron , which uses sophisticated filters to measure the color of the stars , a key indicator of iron levels
" the stars we are finding @entity80 , " said team member @entity76 on the @entity12 's website
the team looked at 60 million stars and narrowed down potential candidates to a shortlist of 200 , which were examined using the @entity86 telescope in @entity87
it is an important cosmological discovery , as it tells researchers a great deal about the origin of the elements that make up the universe
@entity29 said that most stars created in the early stages of the universe died in " extremely violent explosions , " and that it is unlikely that more stars of a similar age will be found .
