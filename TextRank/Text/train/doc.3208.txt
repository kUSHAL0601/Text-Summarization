@entity0 is cracking down on the illegal ivory trade
several tons of confiscated elephant tusks and carvings were crushed in a ceremony in the city of @entity7 on monday -- just two months after the @entity8 destroyed its own ivory stockpile
conservationists have welcomed the move as a monumental shift in the government 's approach to the ivory trade , and a crucial first step for @entity0 -- the world 's largest ivory market -- to tackle illicit wildlife trafficking
some 6.15 tons of ivory were destroyed on monday -- equivalent to one - sixth of the illegal ivory confiscated worldwide in 2012 -- according to may @entity22 , the @entity0 chief representative of wildlife protection group , @entity22 , who attended the ceremony
it 's the first time @entity0 , which accounts for around 70 % of global demand for ivory , has destroyed any of its stockpile
the fact that @entity0 is taking a public stance against the practice is an encouraging sign , says @entity31 , special assistant to the @entity32 at the @entity33 ( @entity33 )
" with the government taking such a symbolic action , it sends out a very strong message to the potential consumers that the government wo n't allow any illegal trade in ivory , " he said
@entity41 is known as " white gold " in @entity0 and tusks with intricate carvings can fetch almost $ 3,000 per kilogram on the black market
one of the biggest challenges remains dampening demand among consumers , say animal welfare campaigners
according to a 2013 @entity22 report , many @entity0 residents have little awareness of how ivory sales contribute to the poaching that has caused the world 's elephant population to dwindle in recent years
" this event in itself is not going to solve these issues , " said @entity56 , @entity58 program director at the @entity59 , " but that does n't mean it does n't have any value
" " it needs to be welcomed , if only to embolden those within the @entity0 government who are pushing for more substantive action on this issue , " @entity56 said
" it could really have an impact on the conservation of @entity75 and @entity58 elephants
" a report released by the convention on @entity78 on endangered species last year found that the global illegal ivory trade has tripled in the last decade , in spite of 1989 - ban on the international trade of the product
according to the @entity33 's @entity31 , a rise in demand from @entity58 , and especially @entity0 , in recent years has fueled the black market and put increasing pressure on @entity75 elephants in the wild
the elephant population in @entity75 has now shrunk to around half a million , from 1.2 million in 1980
nearly one hundred @entity75 elephants are killed for their tusks every day , according to the @entity59
to help wipe out the demand for ivory , conservation groups have called on governments to destroy confiscated ivory stockpiles , which often require substantial resources to keep secure
on november 15 , the @entity8 destroyed its entire 6 - ton stockpile of ivory " to send a clear message that the @entity8 will not tolerate ivory trafficking and the toll it is taking on elephant populations , particularly in @entity75
" similar events have taken place in the @entity104 , @entity105 , and @entity106 in the last three years .
