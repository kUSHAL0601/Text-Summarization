-- @entity1 is a nasty illness
people infected with @entity3 develop diarrhea , a fever and abdominal cramps that usually last for four to seven days
the dangerous bacteria is found in the food we eat , usually chicken , beef or eggs that have been contaminated with animal feces
and a new report from @entity15 says the @entity16 @entity18 's @entity17 ( @entity17 ) is n't doing enough to keep our food @entity3 - free
" when more than 500 people get sick from two outbreaks associated with chicken that meets federal safety standards , it is clear that those standards are not effectively protecting public health , " @entity20 , director of @entity15 's food safety project , said in a statement
every year , approximately 42,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the @entity16 , according to the @entity32 , but the actual number of infections may be much higher
the majority of outbreaks over the last two decades have been linked to live poultry
@entity15 researchers specifically looked at two recent outbreaks that were connected to chicken produced by @entity42 in @entity43
between june 2012 and may 2013 , 134 people became infected with @entity45 -- mostly in @entity46 and @entity47 , according to the @entity32
tests identified the outbreak strain in four samples of chicken that were traced back to two @entity42 slaughterhouses
then in the summer and fall of 2013 , 389 people in 23 states and @entity55 became sickened with varying strains of @entity57
@entity32 investigators determined consumption of @entity42 chicken was the likely source of the outbreak
" in neither instance did fsis ask @entity42 to institute a recall or stop shipping potentially contaminated chicken to market , " the @entity15 report authors wrote
no deaths were reported in either outbreak
the second outbreak is ongoing , according to the @entity32 , which updated its numbers thursday
an additional 27 people have fallen ill since november
the @entity17 acted as aggressively as possible under the authority they had during the @entity42 outbreaks , said @entity74 , @entity18 's deputy undersecretary for food safety
he said the @entity18 " appreciates " @entity15 's report since it " supports the efforts we already have under way
" the government agency has a proposal under department review now that would require all poultry slaughterhouses to prevent contamination by conducting microbial testing at two points , @entity74 said
it would also authorize inspectors to suspend operations in slaughter facilities that can not demonstrate they are controlling salmonella
in a separate paper , @entity93 said it found " worrisome " levels of bacteria in tests conducted on 316 chicken breasts , including 64 from brands that use no antibiotics in raising chickens and 24 organic samples
" every one of the four major brands we tested contained worrisome amounts of bacteria , even the chicken breasts labeled ' no antibiotics ' or ' organic , ' " @entity93 said
the most common bacteria found was enterococcus , a fecal contaminant , in 79.8 %
@entity113 was @entity114 , in 65.2 %
campylobacter , salmonella and staphylococcus aureus were also present , according to the report
in response to @entity93 , the @entity119 said poultry producers spend tens of millions of dollars each year researching food safety , which has helped significantly decrease food - borne pathogens
" americans eat about 160 million servings of chicken every single day , " the council said in a statement , " and 99.9 % of those servings are consumed safely
" the @entity18 does not require poultry plants to treat the presence of salmonella as a significant risk , according to the @entity134 , and has no standards for chicken parts , which are purchased more widely than whole chickens
@entity17 notifies facilities before conducting an investigation
even if tests show unsafe amounts of salmonella , the authors wrote , @entity17 can not close down the facility
@entity3 is estimated to cause more than 1 million food - borne illnesses every year , according to the @entity134 , and health - related costs run as high as $ 11 billion yearly
the @entity15 report makes several recommendations for improving @entity18 's " @entity151 , " which the agency posted earlier this month : -- change salmonella performance standards so they are updated regularly , enforceable and tied to public health outcomes
-- consider establishing limits on the amount of salmonella that can be present in chickens as they enter slaughterhouses
-- conduct unannounced testing in poultry producing facilities
-- close plants that are under investigation and keep them closed until " adequate control measures are in place
" " the contaminated product is n't supposed to reach consumers -- that 's the point , " @entity20 said
" you see this is a very complicated bacteria
it 's a challenge , and we have n't gotten it right yet
" @entity74 could not offer a time frame for when the @entity17 food safety proposal may go into effect
he said it 's important for consumers to remain diligent about food safety practices , including washing their hands and cooking food to the right temperatures .
