-- forty - four years after the rev. @entity3 was gunned down on the balcony of a @entity6 hotel , the @entity2 city is overcoming what some call protracted guilt and embarrassment , and naming a street in his honor
a nearly 1 - mile stretch of @entity14 will be renamed dr. @entity15 on wednesday , the anniversary of the civil rights leader 's assassination
the honor has been a long time coming
more than 900 @entity22 cities have streets named after @entity3
the largest concentration is in the @entity25 , led by @entity26 , which has more than 70 roads named after the @entity29 native , according to an article by @entity31 of @entity32 in the @entity33
but in the city where he died , the omission has been , to many , glaring
" we never wanted to address losing dr. @entity3 's life here , " said former @entity38 councilman @entity37 , who helped lead the street - naming effort
born and raised in @entity6 , @entity37 , 34 , said he always wondered why there was no official street tribute for @entity3
during his brief five - month term in a vacated council seat -- from august to january -- @entity37 decided to get the ball rolling
" i had the opportunity to do something , and we got it done , " @entity37 said
the east - west @entity14 , while less famous than @entity51 with its many blues clubs and restaurants just a block north , was selected because that was where @entity3 marched in support of striking sanitation workers
the avenue also was a pivotal location during the strike
a photo shows the civil rights leader on @entity14 , @entity37 said
the council proposal was approved earlier this year by a land - use control board
" he marched along this street ; we wanted something that had a real nexus to this city , " said mayor @entity67
one of dr. @entity3 's associates during the 1968 sanitation workers ' march was the rev. @entity76 , a former city council member
netters advocated for an intersection in honor of @entity3 in the early 1970s ; the council decided to rename a portion of @entity83 as a substitute , he said
" @entity14 is better than nothing , " @entity77 said
the downtown thoroughfare is close to the historic @entity87 , a focal point for many meetings of the sanitation strikers
@entity3 was scheduled to speak there on april 3 , 1968 , but , because of a large crowd , the rally was moved to @entity94
it was there that he delivered his famous " @entity98 " address
@entity14 is a busy downtown thoroughfare and is on one side of @entity100 , home of the @entity103 's @entity102
the area around the street is undergoing a significant transformation , @entity67 said
" this is the right time " to rename the street , the mayor said
demolition of a public housing project is making way for a mixed - use development , and other projects will change the landscape
long - term plans include naming up to 5 miles of @entity14 for @entity3
@entity3 was killed april 4 , 1968 , by @entity117
the @entity118 , located at the @entity118 where he was killed , will sponsor a commemoration on the anniversary date
the rev. @entity121 , who was with @entity3 at the @entity122 , said the assassination left @entity6 with a deep sense of pain and guilt
he contends the city could " do more to memorialize dr. @entity3 's legacy
" for the city , the street naming is a large symbolic step in honoring @entity3
" there is no way we could do enough for him ... that would measure up to what he gave up the @entity22 , " @entity67 said .
