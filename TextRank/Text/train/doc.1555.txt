@entity0 , @entity1 -- two suspects charged with having served as deep - cover @entity4 agents living in the @entity5 have told investigators they are @entity4 citizens and have been living under false identities , according to a court document released friday
a letter from prosecutors opposing bail for the suspects said that the man known as @entity14 is really a @entity4 named @entity15
the government also said the woman known as @entity18 is a @entity4 citizen named @entity19
prosecutors said that the couple waived their rights to remain silent and made the admissions soon after being arrested at their @entity23 , @entity1 residence over the weekend
the two were living as a married couple and have two small children
the government document also said searches of the couple 's home and two safe - deposit boxes they rented revealed that they contained cash , passports and other identity documents bearing their false identities
investigators said they found $ 80,000 in one of the safe - deposit boxes
it was divided into eight unmarked envelopes , each of which contained $ 10,000 in what appeared to be new $ 100 bills , they said
the document said another safe - deposit box rented by the two held $ 20,000 along with passports and other documents bearing their fake identities
prosecutors said a laptop found in the couple 's home had been brought from @entity4 to the @entity5 by a co-conspirator and given to @entity56 , as court papers referred to him , in march
the revelations are contained in a letter from federal prosecutors opposing bail for the couple and for another suspect named @entity64
the pair and @entity64 remain in custody in @entity1
they waived their rights to ask for bail in hearings at @entity71 in @entity0 , @entity1 on friday afternoon
@entity14 and @entity18 , as court papers called her , appeared in court wearing dark - green jail jumpsuits emblazoned with " prisoner " on the back of each
they did not speak to each other in court
they spoke only to give their assent when the judge asked if they realized they were waiving their rights to ask for bail
prosecutors had hoped to get the suspects moved quickly to @entity90 to stand trial with seven others arrested in the case
but attorneys for the three requested a preliminary hearing a judge scheduled for july 7
@entity64 appeared at a separate hearing afterward
he too was dressed in a green jail jumpsuit
he spoke quietly with a slight @entity4 accent when asked if he understood he was relinquishing his right to ask for bail
magistrate judge @entity102 ordered that the three continue to be held in jail and cited the government 's contention they are dangers to the community and a flight risk
following the court proceedings , @entity110 asked @entity64 's attorney @entity112 why he wanted a preliminary hearing for his client
" he 's entitled to a preliminary hearing , " replied @entity112
the defense attorney indicated the government would be expected to reveal more of its case against his client at the preliminary hearing on wednesday
@entity110 's @entity120 contributed to this story from @entity0
