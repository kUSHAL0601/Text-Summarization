-- with the @entity2 going on for 3Â½ hours sunday night , @entity1 thinks the telecast could 've spared a few extra minutes for his performance
the @entity6 rocker was part of the final closing act at the @entity2 -- a set that included @entity10 , @entity12 's @entity11 and @entity13 -- but fans did n't get to see the entire number
the producers decided to cut the group off before they were done and start rolling credits
" music 's biggest night ... to be disrespected , " @entity1 tweeted after the show
" a heartfelt f * * * y * * guys
" even one of the night 's big winners , @entity25 , was n't happy with the @entity26
winner 's list the artist , along with collaborator @entity30 , took home four @entity2 , including the award for best rap album
that was one honor many predictors thought would go to @entity36 for " good kid , @entity38 , " but @entity36 was completely shut out at the ceremony
it turns out that @entity25 , too , thought @entity41 should 've won the prize
on his @entity44 account , @entity25 shared a text he sent to his friend
" you got robbed , " @entity25 texted @entity41
" i wanted you to win
it 's weird and sucks that i robbed you
" @entity25 told his @entity44 followers that that while he 's " honored and completely blown away to win anything , much less four @entity2 ... in that category , he should have won @entity54
" guess we 'll have to add " good kid , @entity38 " to our list of classic albums that the @entity2 ignored
what do you think ? any other big wins that you want to contest ? 5 things about the 2014 @entity2
