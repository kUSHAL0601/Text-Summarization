-- @entity2 world heavyweight champion @entity1 has branded his @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 counterpart @entity9 a " robot " and said the @entity4 will " malfunction " in their unification bout in @entity7 on saturday
@entity1 , 30 , was talking at the final press conference ahead of the duo 's highly - anticipated face - off , with tensions clearly running high between the two fighters
" it 's going to be fun to watch this big robot start malfunctioning , " the @entity19 native told reporters
the pair were due to get in the ring in 2009 , before @entity1 was forced to withdraw with a back injury , and the @entity26 said he is happy the fight did not take place two years ago because he is now in much better shape
" i 'm healthy , my speed is ridiculous , punch power is there , and i 'm just in a really good place , " he said
" i 'm happy the fight 's happening now and did n't happen a couple of years ago because i am so much more of a better fighter now
" @entity9 acknowledged his opponent was in fine physical condition , but the 1996 @entity40 winner said @entity1 will be the 50th knockout victim of his professional career and that the experience will make him " a better person
" " i will knock your butt out back into reality , which is good for your future life , " said @entity9
" you 're going to become a better person , a better man , with better behavior and you 'll be on time
" the @entity54 - born boxer was referring to the fact that @entity1 was 30 minutes late for the press conference , and @entity9 went on to say : " he was late for half an hour today , we 've all been waiting for you princess
" the tension rose further when @entity9 's brother @entity61 , the @entity62 heavyweight champion , stood up and asked @entity1 whether he would be attending the post-fight press conference
" please , promise , in front of many journalists , that you 're coming to the press conference after the fight ? " @entity1 responded : " i 'm coming for you [ @entity61 ] after the fight , make sure you 're there
" @entity61 famously faced a @entity71 fighter in 2003 , when he lost to @entity72 by technical knockout after the end of the sixth round
former world amateur championships silver medallist @entity1 has previously said he will retire before turning 31 in october , but " @entity1 " has also expressed a desire to defeat both @entity9 brothers before hanging up his gloves
@entity71 cruiserweight @entity81 defeated @entity1 in their fight in 2004 , his only career loss in 26 professional clashes
@entity9 will be looking to avoid a fourth defeat of his pro career , having won 55 of his 58 bouts
the fight will take place at the @entity91 , home of @entity93 football club @entity7 , on saturday .
