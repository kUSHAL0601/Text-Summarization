-- former @entity3 freedom fighter - turned - president @entity1 made a rare public appearance thursday as the nation 's parliament met to honor him on the 20th anniversary of his release from prison
" president @entity1 united this country behind the goal of a nonsexist , nonracial democratic and prosperous @entity3 , " president @entity10 told lawmakers
@entity1 , 91 , is known in the country as @entity1 , his clan name
he and his wife , @entity17 , were present to hear @entity10 speak
his former wife , @entity18 , also attended
" we should reflect on how far we have traveled as a country , " @entity10 said
" @entity22 members , we recall the words of @entity1 on his release when he said , ' i stand before you not as a prophet , but as a humble servant of you , the people
your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today
i therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands
' " these words inspire us not to rest until we achieve the ideals of a society free of poverty and deprivation
in the two decades since the release of @entity1 , our country has changed fundamentally
" @entity1 was already in prison when he was convicted of treason in 1964 and given a life sentence
he was a living symbol of the struggle against @entity3 's racist apartheid system , enacted when he was 30 years old
@entity1 was imprisoned for 27 years for opposing @entity3 's government , which enforced its strict segregation laws through brutality
following his release , he worked with @entity3 's white president , @entity51 , to end those policies
@entity53 also was in attendance thursday
the @entity55 -- once again legal after being banned in 1961 -- elected @entity1 as its president , and he won @entity3 's presidential election in a landslide in 1994 , the country 's first black president
in his last public words before he was jailed , @entity1 said , " i have fought against white domination , and i have fought against black domination
i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony , and with equal opportunities
it is an ideal which i hope to live for , and to see realized
but if need be , it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die
" @entity10 said thursday , " as we celebrate @entity1 's release today , let us recommit ourselves to building a better future for all @entity3 , black and white
let us pursue the ideal for which @entity1 has fought his entire life : the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities
" @entity1 is not remembered simply for ending apartheid
he also was behind reconciliation , a painful and lengthy process that attempted to hold those responsible for the brutality accountable for their acts without alienating other white @entity3
he also was instrumental in bringing soccer 's @entity86 to @entity3
it will be held there this year , six years after soccer 's world body awarded the event .
