the militant group @entity2 represents a " very significant potential threat to homeland security , " and officials have a " good sense " of the individuals from the @entity6 who are trying to travel to @entity7 and fight with the terrorist group , the secretary of @entity1 said monday on @entity11
" they are a dangerous organization that has acquired territory in @entity15 and @entity7 from which they could launch attacks , train , command and control , " @entity21 said on " @entity22 with @entity23
" " they 've demonstrated a depravity and a willingness to kill @entity6 because they are @entity6 , " he continued
" so we 've got to take the fight to this organization
" his comments come as the group has released a new online video in which its leader specifically calls for lone wolf attacks in the @entity6 and @entity35 -- two countries that have been conducting airstrikes against @entity2 in @entity15
western allies reject @entity2 leader 's threats the group has beheaded two @entity6 journalists and a @entity44 aid worker
separately on monday , the @entity35 government said one of its citizens was abducted in a mountainous region of @entity49
a video claim of responsibility was later released by the @entity53 militant group , @entity55 fi @entity54 , or @entity56 in @entity49 , whose leader recently pledged allegiance to @entity2
@entity21 said monday that @entity2 " represents a very , very dangerous organization and a very significant potential threat to homeland security
" asked which group is a bigger threat -- @entity65 or @entity2 -- @entity21 said the @entity6 should carefully watch both
" we 've got to continue to keep our eye on all of this , " he said
" we 're in an environment now where these groups are competing for recruits , for fundraising and probably attention
so i 'm focused on all of it
" the anatomy of @entity2 : how the ' @entity77 ' is run at least 100 @entity6 have either left or attempted to leave to go to @entity7 and help @entity2 , @entity21 said
" from various records and our capability to track the travel of these people through intelligence efforts , we have a reasonably good sense of who we 're interested in , who the individuals of suspicion are , " he added
" there have been some arrests made already
and we 've got to stay focused on it
" such " foreign fighters " are a new concept for counterterrorism efforts , he continued
" it 's not something , for example , that we faced in 2001 on 9/11
this is a new phenomenon , " he said , adding that their social media capabilities are also a new tactic .
