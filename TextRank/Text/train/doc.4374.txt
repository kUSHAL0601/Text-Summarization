-- the author of the @entity3 series of supernatural thrillers and inspiration for @entity7 's popular drama " @entity9 , " @entity8 , is putting her eye for suspense toward an equally arresting subject : video games
produced for @entity15 , the fruit of her labor , downloadable pc puzzler " @entity26 , " features an original tale starring @entity20 , a wisecracking , fashion - forward vampire hunting for a potion that lets vampires survive in sunlight
a hidden - object game designed for casual play by both women and men , it aims to bridge the gap between paperback readers and gaming fans , leveraging @entity36 ' gift for crafting clever characters and scenarios
now that she has contributed to one of a growing range of collaborations between the gaming and publishing industries , we asked @entity36 why critics have n't written the final word on interactive entertainment 's potential to craft compelling narratives yet
@entity0 : how do video games compare to books and tv as a storytelling medium ? @entity36 : video games are visual like tv , but involve a certain amount of comprehension that tv often does n't
it 's a refreshing change from both books and tv , i find
@entity0 : what key differences are involved in writing for passive and interactive formats , e.g. novels vs. games ? @entity36 : for me , writing books is about the progression of the characters as they change to meet circumstances on their way to the climax of the book
games seem to have a more clearly cut goal and to require little change on the part of the character you 're maneuvering through the stages of the game
since i have discovered i 'm really linear , the one step forward , one step back structure of games was at first very frustrating ; you do n't keep going forward but are having to go back to get this item or that item
perhaps it 's more like real life in that respect ! @entity0 : many authors , such as @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 have dabbled with gaming in the past
will we see more embracing the format going forward ? @entity36 : i 'm sure more will , simply because it 's another way to publicize your books , after all
and it 's a fresh and fun market for many writers ; the chance to do something different is always interesting
@entity0 : @entity106 seems to be the watchword for authors these days
do you believe games and interactive fiction , like @entity112 , ebooks and other virtual platforms , may someday reinvent publishing ? @entity36 : i 'm certain digital will permanently alter the publishing industry
i hope that books will not completely go by the wayside , but i fear they will
i love to hold a book in my hands , but i ca n't deny it 's much more convenient and green to have all my books on one device and to be able to take that device with me when i travel , instead of bulky and heavy books
for that time alone , ebooks are worth it
and the same thinking applies to all the other uses
portable is the way the world is going
@entity0 : knowing this , are games becoming a better medium both artistically and commercially than typical channels such as books , essays and short stories for writers to make their mark ? @entity36 : no , not yet
short stories put your name in the path of the reading public , and therefore publishers
publishers will take you much more seriously if you 've had several short stories in reputable markets like magazines or anthologies
i do n't know how much credence they 'd put in a book proposal by a writer who 'd written games , but i 'm willing to believe that is mounting
i think any way you can get published is good though , as long as you 're getting paid for it
i do n't know if games have the power to create a career , but they certainly could add to one
@entity0 : what do titles like " @entity26 " allow you to do that you could never accomplish with print media ? @entity36 : i 'm hoping that people who enjoy playing the game will decide to read my books , naturally
this is a chance to reach out to a whole new audience
also , it 's simply fun for me
@entity0 : how do you foresee the worlds of literature and gaming continuing to collide in the future ? @entity36 : i 'm sure that mystery , with its defined structure and clear goal , is a great genre for gaming
science fiction , with its " quest " structure , also adapts well
i think more and more of the big names in those genres will come to the adventure of gaming with good ideas and i look forward to seeing that .
