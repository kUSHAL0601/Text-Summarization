-- defending champions @entity1 salvaged a large chunk of pride when beating runaway @entity5 leaders -- and city rivals -- @entity7 2 - 1 to register consecutive wins at @entity9 for the first time in 41 years
the game was played on the day that former @entity13 prime minister @entity12 died at the age of 87 , with @entity5 officials choosing not to hold a minute 's silence in her honor
after a difficult season in which they failed to build upon their first title since 1968 , @entity1 will treasure a victory , with strikes from @entity23 and @entity24 either side of a @entity27 own goal , that will make coach @entity29 sleep a little easier
" i think we showed we do n't deserve to stay 15 points behind , " the @entity30 told @entity31 after the game
" they have had more consistency in this championship because they won more games
" instead we lost points when we probably deserved to win
we showed we deserved to stay closer to the title but it is finished
" the @entity30 had claimed before the game that @entity7 were no better than his side , even if he did concede that they will deserve their title when it arrives , and will feel that the win justified his comments
however , he may still have to appease some fans after saying that his failure to land his top five transfer targets before the season - including @entity7 's very own @entity53 , @entity55 's @entity54 , @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity60 of @entity61 - had cost his team its chance of glory this year
the defeat means that the earliest @entity7 , whose lead at the top was reduced to 12 points by second - placed @entity1 , can wrap up the title is monday 22 april , when @entity72 's men host @entity73
having been crushed 6 - 1 at home by their long - standing rivals last season , @entity7 had been expected to not only avenge that humiliation but also confirm with a convincing display that the balance of power had definitively shifted back in their favor
prior to the game , former @entity7 defender @entity81 had told @entity84 media that @entity1 's handsome derby victory and dramatic title had led to erroneous claims in the media
" reports of [ a power shift ] misunderstood @entity7 , " said the former full back
" here is a manager and players who do n't understand phrases like ' power shift '
they just make them more determined to ram such phrases back down people 's throats
" disregarding monday night 's disappointment , @entity7 -- who can no longer break the 100 - point barrier -- certainly have shown an emphatic desire to reclaim a title they have already won 19 times
in fact , there is a direct parallel with two other major @entity112 leagues where traditionally dominant powers have rebounded from league failures to reclaim the title in convincing fashion
on saturday , @entity57 -- who were pipped to the @entity119 championship by @entity120 last year -- beat @entity121 1 - 0 to mark the earliest clinching of the league title in @entity125 history , 20 points clear with six games still left to play
in @entity129 , @entity128 hit the magical 100 - point mark when beating great rivals @entity131 to the 2011 - 2012 title -- a failure which has focused the latter to such extent that they lead @entity136 by 13 points with eight rounds left
with @entity140 way off the pace in the @entity143 league , the only one of the top five @entity112 leagues where the champion looks set to defend their trophy is in @entity30 , where @entity148 boast a nine - point lead with seven games to go
monday night 's anticipated @entity152 derby was overshadowed by pre-match violence , with two @entity155 supporters stabbed -- an incident which prompted @entity152 's mayor to make a public appeal for calm
on the pitch , @entity161 @entity160 gave @entity59 an early lead prior to missing a penalty in the second half , with @entity155 legend @entity166 making no mistake from 12 yards when handed a spot - kick of his own
despite the dismissal of @entity59 's @entity170 with 21 minutes to go , seventh - placed @entity155 could not find a winner that would have moved them above their city rivals into fifth place in @entity176 reflecting on a calmer derby in @entity178 , victorious @entity1 captain @entity27 feels that his side 's victory could play a pivotal role in the race for next season 's @entity178 championship
" a derby is always a special game for us and to be able to win is massive , " said the @entity185
" i do believe the way we finish this season will have an impact on how we do next season
" this is a good win to have under our belt and we will take it into the next season
