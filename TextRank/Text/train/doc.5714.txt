-- twelve suspected members of the @entity4 drug gang and a member of @entity7 's @entity6 were killed in a shootout on an island in a lake that straddles the @entity12 - @entity7 border , authorities said monday
the @entity6 said the shootout occurred sunday on @entity14 , located between @entity15 and the @entity7 state of @entity17 , after troops patrolling the area spotted a camping area on an island
the suspected drug traffickers used the island for storing marijuana to be transported by boat to the @entity12 , the @entity6 said in a statement
after the shootout , the @entity6 said it seized guns , ammunition and bullet - proof vests from the island
@entity14 drew the attention of law enforcement authorities on both side of the border last september after an @entity12 man on a personal watercraft was reportedly ambushed by attackers and shot in the head
2010 : ' he took a bullet for me , ' @entity14 victim 's wife says @entity44 told police that she and her husband were riding water scooters on the lake on september 30 when they were attacked
her husband 's body has not been found , and the case has remained unsolved
" it did n't happen in the @entity12 , " said @entity52 , @entity15 , sheriff @entity53
suspects in @entity14 killing identified and @entity7 authorities , he told @entity0 last month , have " somewhat of a zero solvency rate , and a zero conviction rate
" " so unfortunately , this case may remain open forever , even though the information and the evidence may be there , " according to @entity53 .
