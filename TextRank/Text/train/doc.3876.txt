-- the first mobile phone powered by @entity2 has gone on sale in the @entity4 -- its first foray into the @entity7 market
the @entity8 represents @entity2 's first foray into the mobile phone market
the @entity8 -- unveiled in @entity11 last month -- has been released exclusively by @entity12 and will go head to head with products such as @entity16 's @entity15 , the @entity17 and other smartphones from makers including @entity20
the handset uses @entity2 's @entity23 software and is being touted as a phone with the capability of a hand - held computer
the arrival of @entity23 signals the opening round of the battle between @entity2 and its rivals such as @entity16 to create software for the next generation of mobile phones that allows users to connect seamlessly to the internet
it provides access to @entity38 , which lets third party companies offer applications to users
the @entity8 makes use of applications such as @entity45 , instant messaging through @entity47 , as well as high - speed internet browsing and a 3 - megapixel camera
other manufacturers -- including @entity51 and @entity52 -- are expected to produce their own @entity2 phones over the next 12 months
analysts have said the gadget could potentially transform the mobile telephone market by providing service supported by advertising instead of subscription fees
but some believe the phone may struggle to compete with the iphone in particular
@entity65 , from mobile phone comparison web site @entity64 , told the @entity66 : " despite the popularity of the @entity2 brand , the @entity8 's design lacks the inherent ' cool ' factor that made the @entity71 such a mass market success for @entity16
" the launch of the @entity8 is important not only because it 's @entity2 's first foray into the mobile market but because it 's also the launch of an entirely new mobile phone operating system
" @entity23 is the equivalent of releasing an alternative to @entity81 's @entity80 - and equally as risky
" however @entity12 @entity4 managing director @entity82 told @entity83 that the phone was set to " revolutionise the way we use the internet on our mobiles
" " it 's uniquely built for effortless online communication whether you want to email , text or blog , and with access to some groundbreaking applications on @entity38 , the possibilities really are endless , " he added .
