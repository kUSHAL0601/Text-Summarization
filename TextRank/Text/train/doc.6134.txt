@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's opposition fighters launched an assault on one of @entity8 's last bastions of support on saturday , but they met stiff resistance and some even pulled back , military commanders said the fighting raged after negotiators failed to work out a deal to surrender the city of @entity0 , a hardcore @entity8 stronghold southeast of @entity17
fighters believe key members of the ousted @entity1 leader 's regime -- including two of @entity8 's sons -- may be hiding
positioned on the outskirts of the city , grad rockets and bullets targeted the advancing fighters , some of whom retreated
others worked to position themselves in advantageous locations
planes were heard overhead and fighters assumed they were @entity36 jets because no other aircraft has been allowed in the no - fly zone established by international powers
the @entity40 , @entity1 's new leadership , said it wanted to negotiate the surrender to prevent further bloodshed and destruction , though critics believe it would give @entity8 's fighters time to entrench themselves within the town
opposition forces claim @entity8 loyalists fired on them friday , hours ahead of a saturday deadline to lay down their arms
" the deadline expired yesterday when they fired at our forces with grad rockets , " ntc chief negotiator @entity56 told @entity2
@entity56 said he expects opposition forces to take the town soon but acknowledged the tough resistance by snipers positioned in houses and loyalist forces firing artillery and rockets
opposition forces have been staging outside the town for nearly two weeks , surrounding it on three sides , while negotiations were under way
shortly before the saturday deadline expired , @entity40 spokesman @entity72 @entity71 said absent a resolution " it 's up to military planners to decide how to move forward
" sticking points in the negotiation included the demand by @entity78 for opposition fighters to enter their communities unarmed , and to refrain from searching houses , @entity71 said
the loyalists also asked for blanket pardons , but the @entity40 wanted to prosecute loyalists with blood on their hands , @entity71 said
@entity0 is one of three major towns in @entity1 that remain loyal to @entity8
the other towns are @entity90 , on the @entity92 coast , and @entity93 , in the southwest of the country
opposition forces do n't know how many @entity8 loyalists are in @entity0 , though they believe they are heavily armed with machine guns and rockets , said @entity100 , an @entity40 spokesman
the @entity40 has previously said it had confirmed reports that two of @entity8 's sons -- @entity104 and @entity105 -- were seen inside @entity0
@entity104 , who was once viewed as @entity8 's possible successor , is wanted along with his father , for crimes against humanity for a brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters
@entity105 , a defender of his father , served as @entity8 's national security adviser
@entity71 also said he received intelligence reports that loyalist forces were moving captured @entity40 fighters to @entity116 for use as human shields
that town is 10 miles east of @entity90
loyalists and opposition forces clashed about 55 kilometers ( 34 miles ) outside of @entity90 , said @entity123 spokesman @entity122
@entity2 can not independently verify the reports
the renewed fighting came as @entity126 issued @entity128 arrest warrants friday for @entity8 , who is wanted by the @entity129 in the @entity130 for alleged crimes against humanity
a red notice allows @entity126 , the international police agency , to circulate arrest warrants widely with an intention to extradite suspects to the @entity129
at the @entity138 , @entity136 , the secretary - general 's special envoy to @entity1 , told reporters that fears of a humanitarian disaster within the capital city have not materialized
@entity17 's infrastructure has suffered little damage , the disruption of the water supply has been largely alleviated , supplies of fuel and electricity are improving , schools are slated to reopen september 17 , and there has been no general breakdown of public order , said @entity136 , who had earlier briefed the @entity154 after his return from five days in @entity1
" that 's quite a striking conflict with other post-conflict " cities , he said
but those advances do not minimize the enormous challenges that transitional authorities still face
a @entity163 has been established in @entity17 to bring all armed elements under a single command , but " the proliferation of weapons is a major concern , including to @entity1 's neighbors , " @entity136 said
" the approach they 're taking is to , at this stage , tell the very top echelon of the military , the police , the civil service , to remain at home while decisions are taken as to which of them should or should not be part of the future , " he said
despite appeals by @entity40 leaders , acts of revenge have been carried out , " especially of @entity187 accused -- often , i think , quite wrongly -- of having fought for the @entity8 regime , " he said
in addition , " terrible evidence continues to come to light of the deliberate human rights abuses and crimes of the @entity8 regime , both those that took place over many years and during the fall of @entity17 , when many of the prisoners were massacred , " @entity136 said
meanwhile , an interim government is to be established within 30 days of the declaration of liberation , @entity138 envoy @entity136 said
until then , the @entity40 is assuming " caretaker responsibilities " to carry out urgently needed functions , he added
@entity138 secretary - general @entity205 has proposed a support mission for three months , after which " we would then go back to the @entity154 for a longer mandate , " @entity136 said
@entity2 's @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .
