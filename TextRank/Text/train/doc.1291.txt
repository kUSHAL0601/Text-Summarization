-- a new powerful earthquake struck saturday in southwestern @entity2 , shaking an area already trying to recover from a quake that killed more than 300 people
the 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck in @entity9 province saturday about 96 kilometers ( 60 miles ) northeast of @entity10 , the @entity6 said
@entity11 , the deputy commissioner @entity10 told @entity0 seven people died when a house collapsed in @entity14 as result of new earthquake on saturday
just tuesday , a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck the same area of @entity2
the death toll in that quake has risen to 366 people and another 765 are injured
authorities estimate that 21,000 houses were destroyed in tuesday 's earthquake
but @entity11 , deputy commissioner for @entity10 district , told @entity0 more than 60 mud - walled buildings had collapsed in the @entity28 area of the district
four bodies have been found in the rubble , he said , but they appear to be casualties of tuesday 's quake
@entity11 said a rescue operation was under way in @entity10 district to retrieve the dead bodies and shift the injured to hospitals
the remoteness of the affected area and damaged communications networks are hindering the rescue operation , officials said
rescue teams are also reluctant to visit some troubled areas owing to attacks by @entity11 separatists , the deputy commissioner said
the separatists are blamed for firing two rockets at a military helicopter ferrying the chairman of the @entity51 , maj. gen. @entity52 , and another general to the earthquake zone on thursday
both survived the attack , said @entity57 , spokesman for the government of @entity9
the defunct @entity59 reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack
militants fighting for a separate state in @entity9 operate out of part of @entity10 district , which has been the site of bombings
tremors were also felt saturday in @entity70 district , @entity71 , @entity72 and other towns of @entity9 province
injured flee hospital ward some of those injured in tuesday 's quake fled their hospital wards in @entity80 as the new tremors rocked the area
" more than 100 injured are now outside @entity10 hospital , " local journalist @entity83 told @entity0
local tv footage also showed ministers and members of the @entity88 walking out of an @entity88 session due to the tremors
the session was subsequently suspended
" we can not sit in the house after such strong tremors , " assembly member @entity91 told @entity0
the quake also caused people to come out of their homes far to the north in @entity99 , the capital of @entity9
" i was sitting in my office when the earthquake struck , " @entity100 , a @entity9 government official , told @entity0
saturday 's 6.8 magnitude tremor " could be an independent earthquake and not an aftershock , " of the 7.7 - magnitude quake from earlier this week , @entity103 , director of the @entity104 , told @entity0 's @entity2 affiliate @entity105
the second quake will only add to the difficulties for @entity9 's residents
officials had already warned that thousands of survivors in need of assistance after tuesday 's quake are having to cope with high temperatures , a lack of drinking water and little in the way of shelter
october is the hottest month in @entity9 and the region is in a perpetual state of drought , said @entity125 , the director of the @entity126
temperatures in @entity10 and @entity70 have reached 37 degrees @entity128 ( 99 degrees @entity129 )
@entity0 's @entity130 in @entity131 contributed to this report .
