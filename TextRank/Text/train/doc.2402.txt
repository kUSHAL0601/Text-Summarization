@entity17 , the course of things
peace for @entity10 " along with a link to the recording on @entity23
@entity28 to the tune of @entity30 's " @entity31 , " the lyrics include " black rage is founded on / blatant denial / squeezed economics / @entity36 survival " and " when the dogs bite / when the beatings / when i 'm feeling sad / i simply remember all these kinds of things and then i do n't fear so bad

that 's my challenge to me and hopefully you will accept this challenge too
