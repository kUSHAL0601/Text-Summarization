@entity0 -- @entity3 's family says it was making funeral plans for her last week as she lay stricken with @entity6 in @entity7 amid the disease 's deadliest recorded outbreak
after an experimental serum and a plane flight , she 's now the second human @entity6 patient on @entity13 soil , and her relatives think she has a fighting chance
a medical plane on tuesday flew @entity3 from @entity7 to @entity0 , where she was rushed to the same hospital where an @entity13 missionary colleague arrived days earlier
like her , he was sickened by the deadly hemorrhagic disease while on a team caring for @entity6 patients in @entity23
@entity3 was wheeled into @entity24 early tuesday afternoon on a gurney , wearing a white , full - body protective suit and escorted by two people wearing similar gear
there , she joins her fellow missionary dr. @entity30 , who became the first @entity6 patient ever in the @entity13 on saturday , for treatment in a special isolation unit
it is one of four of its kind in the @entity13 designed to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases
" @entity3 is still very weak " but has shown signs of improvement , said @entity41 , president of @entity43 mission group @entity42 , with which @entity3 is affiliated
@entity3 's arrival contrasted with that of @entity30 , who wore a similar suit but walked into the hospital saturday with someone 's assistance
@entity3 , of @entity52 , and @entity30 , of @entity53 and @entity54 , were on a joint @entity55 caring for @entity6 patients last month when they became sick in @entity7
that is one of four @entity60 nations hit by an outbreak that the @entity62 believes has sickened 1,603 people and killed 887 of them
@entity3 's two sons expect to communicate with her soon , @entity41 said
the family was considering funeral arrangements for her just last week , days after she became sick , @entity65 said through @entity41
" yet we kept our faith , ( and ) now we have real reason to be hopeful , " @entity65 said in a statement read by @entity41
though there is no proven treatment or vaccine for @entity6 , @entity30 and @entity3 were recently given an experimental , @entity13 - manufactured drug in @entity7 while they were awaiting evacuation to the @entity13
both have since shown significant improvement , sources said on condition of anonymity
what the inside of the evacuation plane looks like the gruesome disease that can torment victims with profuse vomiting , uncontrollable bleeding and organ failure is ravaging @entity60
the outbreak started this year in @entity92 but also has affected @entity7 , @entity93 and @entity94
the flight and the experimental serum though @entity3 was weak , she had yogurt before her flight early saturday from @entity7 to the @entity13 , @entity41 said
she was taken to the plane by stretcher , but she stood up and entered the plane with assistance , he said
the experimental drug @entity104 , which @entity30 and @entity3 received despite the medication never being subjected to clinical trials , is getting a lot of attention
just last thursday , @entity30 's condition in @entity7 had deteriorated so badly that he called his wife to say goodbye
but three vials of @entity104 stored at subzero temperatures were flown into @entity7
@entity30 and @entity3 took the drug , and their conditions improved before they evacuated to the @entity13
9 questions about this new @entity6 drug the medicine is thought to work by preventing the virus from entering and infecting new cells
it 's a three - mouse monoclonal antibody -- meaning mice were exposed to fragments of the ebola virus , and the antibodies generated within the mice 's blood were harvested to create the medicine
while @entity30 and @entity3 's conditions improved after taking the drug , the serum should n't be viewed as a miracle cure , internist and gastroenterologist dr. @entity132 said
" let 's be cautious
we do n't even know really if this serum is working , " @entity132 said
" i 'm glad now that these patients were brought to a hospital where so many tests can be done , where they can see the response of their body to this serum
we do n't know if these patients are naturally getting better , or whether the serum is really doing something
" many have asked why the two @entity13 received the experimental drug when so many in @entity60 also have the virus
the @entity62 says it was not involved in the decision to treat @entity30 and @entity3
both patients had to give consent to receive the drug knowing it had never been tested in humans before
the process by which the medication was made available to the @entity13 patients may have fallen under the @entity165 's " compassionate use " regulation , which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials
@entity13 ebola patient ' seems to be improving , ' @entity171 chief says how @entity6 spreads @entity6 does n't spread through the air or water
the disease spreads through contact with infected organs and bodily fluids such as blood , saliva and urine
historically , the odds have not been good
previous @entity6 outbreaks have had a fatality rate of 90 % , but the current outbreak in @entity60 has a rate of about 60 % , perhaps because of early treatment
there is no @entity165 - approved treatment for @entity6
@entity24 will use " supportive care " for its two @entity6 patients , unit supervisor dr. @entity190 said
that means carefully tracking a patient 's symptoms , vital signs and organ function and using blood transfusions and dialysis to keep patients stable
the @entity201 plans to begin testing an experimental @entity6 vaccine in people as early as september
tests on primates have been successful
in the 1990s , an @entity6 strain tied to monkeys -- @entity208 -- was found in the @entity13 , but no humans got sick from it , according to the @entity171
what is the risk of catching @entity6 on a plane ? concerns , testing spread outside @entity60 a man hospitalized in @entity217 was in strict isolation monday and tuesday , waiting to learn whether he has the disease
the patient became ill after recently traveling to @entity60 , @entity217 's @entity220 said
doctors were trying to confirm the cause of the man 's high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms
a specimen from the patient was delivered to the @entity171 in @entity0 ; testing typically is completed within 48 hours , the hospital said tuesday
but " odds are this is not @entity6 , " said dr. @entity231 , chief medical officer of the @entity232
" it 's much more likely that it 's a much more common condition
" the patient was stable monday night into tuesday and was in " good spirits , " the hospital said in a news release tuesday
@entity1 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity241 agrees
about half a dozen people have recently returned from @entity60 and gotten tested because of symptoms , but none of those cases has been confirmed as @entity6 , @entity241 said
doctors in @entity247 are also taking precautions as they treat a 40 - year - old man who recently returned from @entity93
the man was in critical condition tuesday with symptoms of a viral hemorrhagic fever , the @entity250 said
the source of his infection remains unknown , but @entity6 can not be ruled out , the ministry said
what to know about @entity6 experimental drug likely saved @entity6 patients @entity1 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 contributed to this report .
