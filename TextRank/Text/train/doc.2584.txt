comfort from others being held " eighteen of us have been held together in one cell , which has helped me
we have had each other to have endless long conversations about movies , trivia , sports , " @entity2 wrote , describing makeshift games of checkers , chess and risk
" the games and teaching each other have helped the time pass
they have been a huge help
" he had specific messages of love for his brothers and sister , and to his grandmother he told her , " please take your medicine , take walks and keep dancing
" by the time he wrote the letter , he had already been held captive for a year and half , and seemed to waver between remaining hopeful for his release , while also resigned to his fate
while addressing his brothers and sister , he gives specific wishes on who his money should go to and thanks them for " happy childhood memories
" but he closes the letter by addressing his " @entity144
