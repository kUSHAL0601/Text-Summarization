-- the woman hired to turn around @entity3 's troubled athletic program came under renewed fire tuesday after news emerged she was named in a sex discrimination lawsuit at the @entity7 , according to court documents obtained tuesday
the revelation that @entity10 was at the center of a discrimination lawsuit while working at the @entity7 , according to the documents , came just days after a report that a group of @entity17 volleyball players accused her of verbal abuse when she coached them in the 1990s
@entity21 's appointment as @entity3 athletic director came more than a month after a video of a @entity3 coach hurling basketballs and yelling homophobic slurs prompted the coach 's firing , the resignation of the school 's athletic director and sharp criticism from @entity34 gov. @entity33
" it is a new day , " @entity21 told reporters after being appointed
" ( the problem ) is already fixed , and there is no one that does n't agree about how we treat young people with respect and dignity and build trust
" the allegations against @entity21 have raised questions about whether the @entity49 , @entity34 , university properly vetted @entity21 before hiring her
but @entity33 told @entity34 101.5 radio that he spoke with the university 's president and board chairman about the allegations and that he would not second - guess @entity3 ' hiring of @entity21
" i told them i had questions , and i was going to get answers to those questions , " he said on the radio station 's weekly " ask the governor " show on tuesday
" i have gotten answers to those questions
" @entity3 , meanwhile , went on the defensive tuesday , releasing a list of names and contacts for supporters of @entity21
it also put out a statement that said she was on the " original list of candidates " assembled by a search firm for the position
" @entity10 also was among the group of candidates considered at each step of the search process from the beginning , " the statement said
@entity21 was named in a 2008 lawsuit filed by @entity80 , an assistant track and field coach , who alleged she was the victim of sex discrimination by the head coach and then fired after she complained to @entity21 and the university 's human resources department , according to documents
banker alleged in the complaint that when she told @entity21 about the discrimination , which included offensive comments , she was praised
" we 're lucky to have you , " @entity21 allegedly said in an e-mail , according to court documents
a jury in @entity95 awarded banker $ 300,000 in damages and lost wages , but it was overturned by an appeals court
banker 's attorney is appealing the ruling to the @entity102 , according to court documents
@entity21 did not return a telephone call from @entity0 seeking comment
the @entity7 , in state @entity102 court filings , defended the firing , saying the evidence showed @entity80 was " an abysmal coach and recruiter
" word of the @entity7 lawsuit followed news first reported sunday by a @entity34 newspaper , @entity114 , that a group of former volleyball players at @entity17 accused @entity21 of " mental cruelty
" in a letter written in 1997 and obtained by the newspaper , members of the team purportedly claimed that @entity21 called players " whores , alcoholics and learning disabled
" verbal abuse from @entity21 became so intense , they claimed , that the team banded together to write the letter , calling the situation " irreconcilable
" after the team presented the letter to @entity21 , she chose to stop coaching them , according to the newspaper 's report
one former @entity17 volleyball player defended @entity21 in a statement of support , which was released by @entity3
" you were tough no doubt but i knew you cared and i went from being a kid with a bad attitude who thought i was @entity141 's gift to athletics to the captain of my team , " wrote @entity134 , who played for @entity17 from 1992 to 1995
" your intensity helped me be mentally tough and it was exactly what i needed
none of it was abusive , mean spirited or demeaning
" in a written statement released monday , @entity21 said her former students ' comments are " heartbreaking
" she denied the allegations of abuse and vowed to push ahead in her new role
" i was never notified of the reported letter outlining the concerns of some former athletes
however , i am truly sorry that some were disappointed during my tenure as coach , " she said
" for sure , i was an intense coach , but there is a vast difference between high intensity and abusive behavior
" @entity21 said her commitment to students ' success has been firm throughout her career
@entity3 president @entity171 said monday that he stands by the school 's choice
" @entity3 was deliberative at every stage of this process , " he said in a written statement
" over the course of the search , @entity10 's record established her as a proven leader in athletics administration with a strong commitment to academic success as well as athletic excellence , and a strong commitment to the well - being of student athletes
" a @entity17 spokeswoman declined to comment
@entity7 women 's basketball coach @entity189 backed @entity21 , his boss over the last six years
while he could n't speak about what may or may not have happened at @entity17 , @entity189 said that in their time together at @entity7 , he found @entity193 to be " a very good administrator who always put the student athletes ' well - being first , no matter what situation it was
" the @entity199 coach said he did n't see the uproar over @entity21 coming , given his observations of her with him and his players
he credits her with helping put a solid system in place , so student athletes were in good hands from their first day on campus through to their graduation
" ( in ) the six years that i had with her , she was very competent at what she does , how she handles situations , and how she treats the student athletes , " @entity189 said
@entity0 's @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .
