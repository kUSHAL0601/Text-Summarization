-- a @entity3 soldier who blew the whistle on his fellow soldiers ' links to the killing of civilians in @entity9 -- and who himself is accused of one slaying -- has been moved to solitary confinement for his safety , a source said
spc. @entity14 , 21 , told @entity17 investigators that he alerted his father to the civilian killings early this year and told him that he feared for his own life , according to an interrogation tape obtained by @entity0
his father tried and failed to get the military to intervene , @entity23 's attorney , @entity22 , said
@entity23 now is held in a military facility at @entity26 in @entity27 along with other soldiers he said instigated the killings
some of those soldiers are facing charges in connection with three slayings of civilians , and @entity23 would be a key part of any case against them
@entity23 contacted his father about the serial killing ring inside his @entity41 squad , and his father , @entity23 , telephoned the @entity17 but with little result , @entity22 said
the father 's phone calls , from the family 's home in @entity49 , @entity50 , and the failure of the @entity17 to take swift action to intervene are the focus of a separate military investigation , an @entity17 spokesman said
a person familiar with the case against @entity23 and the other soldiers said sunday that @entity23 had been moved to solitary confinement amidst concerns about his safety
but that person insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue
authorities at @entity26 , @entity23 's home base , would not comment on any questions about @entity23
but a spokeswoman said that an investigation is underway , although she would not identify who was involved
" we will not comment on measures taken to ensure this individual 's safety , " maj. @entity70 , a public affairs officer for @entity26 , said
" the @entity75 is investigating allegations that a threat was made to one of the defendants ; however , we are not releasing any further information associated with these allegations
" the @entity17 would provide no details of how @entity23 and the other defendants are being housed or whether they have been allowed to communicate amongst themselves
@entity23 , cpl. @entity14 of @entity85 , @entity86 ; @entity87
@entity88 of @entity89 , @entity90 ; spc. @entity14 , of @entity92 , @entity93 ; and platoon leader staff sgt. @entity94 of @entity95 , @entity96 , are charged with premeditated murder charges in the killings of three @entity9 civilians between january and may of this year
seven other soldiers face charges ranging from conspiracy and interfering in a military investigation to drug use , specifically smoking hashish , while in @entity9
military reports say that @entity94 kept track of the killed with skull tattoos and collected body parts as souvenirs .
