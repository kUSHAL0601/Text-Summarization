-- @entity2 , the highly anticipated new operating system for the @entity4 , will be released ahead of schedule friday , @entity1 announced monday
" ordered already : i 'm just one of those nut cases , " one @entity7 user wrote about the new release
the @entity2 will be available as an upgrade to the current leopard system for $ 29 and can be pre-ordered now , the company said
" @entity2 builds on our most successful operating system ever , and we 're happy to get it to users earlier than expected , " said @entity13 , @entity1 's senior vice president of software engineering
" for just $ 29 , @entity2 users get a smooth upgrade to the world 's most advanced operating system and the only system with built - in [ @entity24 ] @entity23 support
" the company said in a news release that , for @entity2 , @entity1 engineers refined 90 percent of the 1,000 projects that currently make up its operating system
among the anticipated features will be what @entity1 promises to be faster applications , including e-mail and web browser @entity36 , while freeing up 7 gb of drive space , compared with the current system
an upgraded @entity40 system will let users more easily view , record , trim and share video , the company said , and it will include improvements to the system 's @entity47 calendar , podcast producer and wiki server
the system had been scheduled for a september release date

@entity1 rival @entity24 is set to release @entity56 7 , a new version of its @entity59 operating system , on october 22
@entity4 users were reporting that @entity1 's online stores were unavailable monday morning , presumably to add the order page for @entity2
