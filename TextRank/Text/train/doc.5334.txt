formula one world champion @entity0 declared himself impressed after road testing the new @entity4 tires that are to be used for the 2011 season
the @entity7 driver was back at the @entity9 circuit where he clinched his first ever drivers ' championship crown last weekend , after edging out teammate @entity12 and @entity14 's @entity13
the @entity16 track played host to all 12 @entity19 teams as they began a two - day tire test on the @entity4 rubbers , set to replace @entity22 from next year
a total of eight sets of tires are available to teams during testing
@entity14 's @entity28 , who finished a disappointing sixth in the drivers ' standings , was quickest in the unofficial timings on friday , with @entity0 in second
" i think the tires behaved well , better than expected given the short amount of time @entity4 have had and they 've done a good job , " @entity0 told the official @entity19 website
" @entity4 are obviously in the middle of their development and what we used today is not what we will race with , but it was a good start
" @entity28 was three - tenths of a second faster than @entity0 , and completed 94 laps of the circuit using two different types of tires
" it was a positive start to begin to understand the behavior of the @entity4 tires
i felt at ease right from the start and there were no unpleasant surprises , " @entity28 added
" we acquired a lot of data which will be useful for the @entity61 company to develop the tires still further for the start of the 2011 season
" on the harder tires , there were some difficulties over a long run while the softs worked well both on the very first lap and also after they had done a larger number of laps
" @entity75 test driver @entity74 claimed third place while @entity77 of @entity78 was fourth
" we have to hand it to @entity4 , the tyres are already on a good level and we feel it was a very positive day , " said @entity78 technical director @entity79
" we feel we learned a lot about the way the tyres are behaving and responding to different set - up changes
