the @entity10 giants confirmed on their official website that the club spent a total of 3.1 million euros ( $ 4.04 million ) on " espionage " between 2008 and 2010
the money went to the now defunct @entity17 agency and another company called the @entity19 and @entity20
@entity1 said that " legal action will be taken to preserve the image of the club , the privacy of its employees and the legacy of the institution
" spokeman @entity28 added : " @entity1 wants to know ' who was spied on and why
' " the alleged activities took place under the presidency of @entity33 , who was at the helm from 2003 - 2010 , one of the most successful spells for the famous @entity4 club
current president @entity38 , a fierce critic of @entity33 , succeeded him in june 2010 , winning 60 % of a vote among @entity1 club members
the relationship between the two has remained cool since @entity38 was elected , but on the pitch under former coach @entity45 and his successor @entity46 , the triumphs have continued
reports on the @entity4 website @entity49 , claimed @entity50 trailed defender @entity51 and his pop star wife @entity52 in 2010 -- following them to a concert to log their activities
former stars @entity58 and @entity60 's @entity59 were also believed to have been monitored in the past
blog : will @entity45 return to @entity1 ? the allegations come as @entity1 has suffered a mini slump in form , twice losing to rivals @entity66 and having to cope with the absence of @entity46 , who is battling cancer
@entity38 told the official website that the board had " absolute confidence " in @entity46 and were supporting him as he undergoes chemotherapy and radiotherapy in @entity73
" his recovery is our priority and i 'd consider this season a success if he fully recovers from his illness
he will not leave even if it costs us every single title
" he 's encouraged , and he 's eager to return
" a tentative return date of the end of march has been set by the @entity4 league leaders , who are trailing @entity87 2 - 0 from the away leg of their @entity90 last 16 tie , another disappointing recent defeat
" in the event that @entity1 defeat @entity87 , the manager could be on the bench for the away leg of the @entity90 quarter finals , " @entity38 told gathered reporters .
