@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 police said saturday that they are glad the parents of a missing 10 - month - old @entity1 girl have resumed conversations with them
" we could n't be happier about it , " police capt. @entity7 said
" their involvement in this investigation is critical
" a meeting was held saturday evening
investigators have searched about 300 homes and apartments in the area around the home
@entity20 has n't been seen since monday night
federal authorities joined police in the search effort this week -- which included an inspection of a landfill and a nearby creek -- speaking with neighbors and sweeping the area with metal detectors
police said they have no suspects or solid leads
@entity32 , a family spokesman for the parents of the missing infant , said police collected what could be forensic evidence in the case , but authorities have declined to comment on that claim
on thursday , @entity7 said the parents stopped cooperating with detectives
but a woman who identified herself as the sister of @entity20 read a statement late thursday on behalf of her brother and @entity20 , parents of missing the girl
" we have never stopped cooperating with the police
we 've been cooperative from day one and we continue to assist the police with the investigation , " the statement by @entity51 said
" the main goal has always been to find @entity56 and bring her home
that remains the sole focus of the parents
" @entity32 said that the parents had been exhausted from questioning at the police station
" i think it 's just a lot of miscommunication , to be honest
" @entity56 was last seen around 10:30 p.m. monday , asleep in her crib , police said
authorities were called to the home at about 4 a.m. tuesday
" it appears the suspect entered / exited through a bedroom window , " authorities said in a statement
" evidence at the scene leads police to believe the child has been abducted
" @entity20 told reporters that he found @entity56 missing when he got home from work
" the front door was unlocked , " he said thursday
" most of the lights were on in the house , and the window in front was open -- all very unusual
" the couple also said three cell phones were missing at their home , according to @entity7
@entity56 is described as 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair , police said
she weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it
the missing girl has two bottom teeth , a small bug bite under her left ear and a " beauty mark " on her right outer thigh
she had a cold with a cough , police said
