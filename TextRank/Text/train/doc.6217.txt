-- so used to being the only @entity2 man in the second round at grand slams -- especially outside @entity5 -- @entity6 will have company at the @entity8
although @entity6 did n't play his first - round match against @entity11 on monday , the defending champion is fully expected to defeat the @entity13 veteran
and if he indeed gets to the round of 64 , he will find qualifier @entity15 alongside him
@entity15 became the first men 's player outside the top 150 in the world rankings to defeat a top - 15 rival at the @entity8 in six years when he dispatched @entity23 's @entity22
the 179th - ranked @entity15 did n't only beat @entity22 -- he won in straight sets 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 2
after @entity15 rallied from a break down in the first set , he cruised
" when i saw the draw , it was a little bit daunting but i went out and i played a good game and he did n't react that well to how i was playing , " @entity15 told @entity27
once described as the bad boy of @entity2 tennis because he liked partying and did n't practice hard enough , @entity15 has seemingly turned his career around in recent months
the 23 - year - old sent @entity2 into the @entity35 world group playoffs when he crushed @entity37 's @entity36 in april in the decisive fifth match
@entity6 decided to skip the series but is expected to feature when @entity2 faces @entity40 in september with a spot in next year 's world group at stake
with his performance in @entity45 , @entity15 now has the edge over @entity47 in being the no. 2 behind @entity6 in the tie
@entity47 failed to qualify for @entity50
ahead of the @entity8 , @entity15 reached challenger finals in @entity52 and @entity53 to see his ranking move from around 250 to his current 179
qualifying and toppling @entity22 will see the diminutive shot - maker 's ranking rise yet further
" i 've just been on the practice court a lot more and in the gym a lot more , " @entity15 said
" it 's been a gradual process from january onwards and i 'm reaping the rewards of it now
" @entity2 had another winner on day one of the season 's last major , as @entity68 overcame @entity69 7 - 5 6 - 0
@entity70 was one of the young stars of the 2012 edition , sending crowd favorite @entity73 into singles retirement and also upending @entity75
her 2013 , though , has been blighted by injuries and a coaching change
she has yet to register a quarterfinal showing at any event this campaign
elsewhere , men 's favorite @entity81 eased past @entity84 @entity83 in straight sets and @entity86 maintained her record of never losing in the first round of the @entity8 when she beat 12th - seeded @entity89 6 - 1 6 - 2
@entity81 missed last year 's @entity8 due to knee troubles
" for me , the chance to be back here playing -- i have a chance to compete this year -- is great , " @entity81 , unbeaten on hard courts this year , told reporters
@entity89 , the @entity5 semifinalist , had gotten the better of @entity86 in @entity95 this month in the 33 - year - old @entity84 's comeback from a back injury
blake to retire @entity98 retired last year after the @entity8 and @entity99 's days on the tennis tour might be numbered given his health issues
now a third member of the @entity84 's older generation , @entity104 -- like @entity86 33 -- said monday in an emotional news conference he would quit following the @entity8
" despite the tears , i 'm actually really happy about this , " @entity104 told reporters
diagnosed with severe scoliosis as a teen and later breaking his neck in a practice accident , @entity104 persevered
he reached a career high of no. 4 , has claimed 10 titles , won a @entity35 and played at the prestigious year - end championships
his career , however , has been slowed by injuries in recent years and he became a father in 2012 .
