-- a group claiming to be the @entity3 arm of the @entity5 terrorist network is purportedly taking responsibility for a pair of deadly bombs that exploded within minutes of each other at two luxury hotels in @entity11
the @entity12 in @entity11 , @entity3 , which was bombed july 17 , is guarded wednesday
the july 17 blasts at @entity11 's @entity12 and @entity15 hotels killed nine people , including at least two presumed suicide bombers , and wounded more than 50
on wednesday , @entity18 -- the suspected leader of a small splinter group of the militant @entity20 , which has ties to @entity5 -- purportedly issued statements claiming responsibility for the attacks on behalf of " @entity5 in @entity3
" @entity18 purportedly signed the statements posted on radical @entity27 web sites as the head of @entity5 in @entity3
@entity0 could not independently authenticate the statements
one of the statements says the @entity15 attack was carried out by " one of our mujahedeen warriors against the @entity34 lackeys and stooges visiting the hotel
" " @entity38 has given us a blessing for us to find a way to attack the biggest hotel that @entity34 owns in the @entity3 capital of @entity11 -- the @entity15 , where security was very tight making it very difficult to initiate the attack that we did , " the statement says
the statement mentions members of @entity50 's @entity49 soccer team , which had been scheduled to check into the @entity15 on july 19 but canceled its trip after the bombing
" those players are @entity54 and therefore do not deserve @entity56 ' money and respect , " the statement says
the other statement addressed the @entity12 attack
it claims that the target in that bombing was @entity34 with ties to the @entity3 @entity64 , known as @entity65
police say a third bomb had been planted in an 18th floor room of the @entity12 two days before the other two bombs exploded
the unexploded bomb -- which was timed to detonate on the upper floor before the first blast tore through the @entity12 's lobby area at 7:47 a.m. -- was found and defused , police said .
