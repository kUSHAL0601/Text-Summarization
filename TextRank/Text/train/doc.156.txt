editor 's note : @entity2 is an award - winning journalist , documentary filmmaker and former editor of @entity8 ' @entity7 magazine
@entity2 wrote and directed the feature documentary , " bling : a @entity11 , " about hip - hop 's obsession with diamonds and its effect on the decade - long conflict in @entity17
@entity2 is based in @entity18 , where she was born to @entity20 parents

@entity2 says people do n't fit into the neat categories outlined by the @entity23
@entity18 ( @entity24 ) -- let 's all pretend to be the astrologer @entity26 for a moment
say we predict that the @entity31 administration 's master plan to engage people of @entity35 / @entity35 / @entity34 origin proves to be effective
let 's say that along with strategic partners @entity38 and the @entity39 , they somehow manage to corral the millions of " latinos " into filling out the 2010 census forms in april
say the idea of plot - kneading the message into an already half - baked yet inexplicably popular telenovela , " @entity45 , " wins over the hearts and minds of " latinos " everywhere
but what 's a @entity35 ? while we all may speak a version of our @entity34 colonizer 's language , contrary to popular belief , we 're not all @entity54
yes , the majority of @entity48 in @entity56 are of @entity54 descent , but we also hail from other countries around the world
take the ethnically ambiguous 15 percent of us who descend from the @entity20 , @entity61 and @entity62
an overwhelming majority of us are n't solely of @entity34 , black or native origin : we 're all of the above and then some ( some of our ancestors migrated from @entity67 , @entity68 and an array of @entity71 countries )
with the 2010 census upon us , the time is now for the fastest - growing minority group in the country to define themselves for themselves and at the same time clear up the cultural confusion surrounding our identity
but how can we , given the perplexing racial categories on the census , coupled with our own complex identity issues , paint an accurate picture of who and how complex we are , not just what we are ? take me , for example ; i 'm a first - generation @entity56 , the product of @entity20 parents whose short - lived relationship could have rivaled that of @entity93 's own telenovela , @entity94
my family is made up of a rainbow coalition of racial chameleons
recently , i was told that my maternal grandmother 's own abuela was @entity100 ; my maternal great - great - grandfather was @entity102 ; somewhere on my paternal side , we 're supposedly sephardic
as in many @entity20 families in my @entity18 neighborhood -- @entity106 -- with ties to the motherland , blackness is rarely discussed
when i traveled to @entity17 and @entity110 , i was asked if i was @entity111 , @entity112 or @entity113
in @entity116 , if i was @entity114 or @entity115
in fact , i 've been singled out a couple of times when entering and leaving @entity114 , and was once accused of having a fake @entity56 passport by an agent
being mistaken for everything but a person of @entity20 heritage has certainly piqued my desire to examine how i and other @entity48 fit into our national and global communities
when i learned that nearly eighty percent of @entity61 's 4 million colorful residents checked off the " white " racial box on the last census , i was n't floored -- given the alternatives
race in the @entity133 lies in the eye of the beholder
and the beholder , from centuries of colonization , has more often than not been socialized to reject their blackness despite our collective and direct relationship to slavery
an association with a historically discriminated ethnic group like african - americans somehow drives the idea that the @entity56 dream is out of reach
in the @entity56 media , people with darker complexions are often grossly stereotyped
and @entity34 language television often depicts people with darker skin and so - called @entity157 features as shiftless , ignorant and at the bottom of the social barrel
this sort exposure , along with other factors , will result in a @entity35 with dark skin to be inclined to check off " white , " especially if their only other choices were " @entity165 " instead of , say " black / @entity166 , " and " @entity167 " rather than the more familiar " @entity168
" and then there 's the pesky " hispanic / @entity35 / @entity34 " issue
i posed a few questions about the racial categories within the census to my @entity35 followers on @entity176
off the bat , people found that lumping @entity34 - speaking origins together was misleading
@ @entity180 , self - described as half @entity20 , wrote that there are " definitely misnomers unless you 're strictly from @entity184 or have acknowledged @entity34 ancestry
" many used " @entity35 " and " @entity35 " interchangeably , unsure about the differences , but rejected @entity34 altogether because not doing so would be the same as an @entity56 calling themselves " @entity187
" younger generations of @entity56 - born @entity48 are challenging the census ' categories , like 25 - year - old @ deevazquez , whose parents are @entity20 and @entity195 : " having @entity197 - @entity133 roots , i do n't feel like any of those labels really represent my culture and historical background
" others , turned off by the overgeneralizations , are opting out altogether
if anything encouraging results in @entity35 census participation , aside from enhancing your state 's chances of receiving a chunk of the allocated $ 400 billion in federal funds , it may be a growing desire within the @entity35 - @entity56 community to ask questions
many responders have expressed interest in exploring their roots through genealogical dna testing
i 've often wondered where my @entity20 ancestors originally came from , as have others in my community
said one responder , " not only do i look at myself and feel like i look different in every picture or mirror , but i also look at my family and wonder where certain features come from , " she states , " and what it all mean [ s ]
" many of us want to know
maybe in the future , the @entity39 may want to borrow from a survey conducted by the @entity236 in 1976 and ask @entity48 to classify themselves
through self - definition , the population presented 134 terms to describe race
though it 's uncertain that latino - americans will come close to topping @entity114 's exhaustive list of ethnic categories , the results will certainly encourage all @entity56 to start thinking outside the box when it comes to their perceptions of race
one thing is certain : @entity249 and his @entity250 did their best to not only conquer the land but also , through slavery and miscegenation , to literally change the face of the @entity255
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
