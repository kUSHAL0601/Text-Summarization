grief and rage erupted on the streets of @entity4 's largest city after a 15 - year - old boy struck in the head by a tear gas canister died tuesday morning in a hospital
much of the anger was focused on @entity4 's embattled prime minister , @entity10
a crowd chanted " fascist government , @entity10 killer , " as @entity13 's coffin was carried through the streets of the working - class @entity16 neighborhood his family calls home
some bystanders wept in the freezing , pouring rain
president @entity25 spoke with the boy 's father monday and was saddened by tuesday 's news , according to the semiofficial @entity30 news agency
" i extend my condolences to his family
i share their pain , " he said
@entity34 was only 14 when he was critically wounded last summer , at the height of a wave of anti-government protests that erupted across @entity16 and other @entity4 cities
his parents said he left home on the morning of june 16 , 2013 , to buy a loaf of bread
less than 15 minutes later , neighbors arrived , telling them their son had been wounded
the boy suffered blunt trauma to the head
according to a report by @entity51 , an eyewitness said the child was hit by a police tear gas canister
for the next nine months , @entity34 lay in a hospital bed in a coma
when @entity34 's mother attempted to make a public statement about her son 's ordeal in central @entity16 in july 2013 , @entity57 journalists witnessed and filmed @entity4 riot police hitting demonstrators with pepper spray and beating one man with a club in an apparent effort to break up the demonstration
more recently , riot police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators holding a vigil outside the hospital where @entity34 was being treated
members of the family said the boy wasted away to a weight of 16 kilograms ( about 35 pounds ) during his nine - month - long coma
" the government has not accepted any responsibility and they have not brought the police who were responsible for this to justice , " said @entity79 , one of the men who attended the funeral procession
news of @entity34 's death sparked a fresh round of protests in other parts of @entity16 , as well as in the capital @entity93 , where riot police reportedly intervened using tear gas
@entity16 police denied using tear gas to disperse crowds that gathered tuesday at the hospital where @entity34 died , @entity30 reported
see photos from the protests on @entity102 political passions are running high in @entity4
in less than three weeks , the country is expected to go to the polls in nationwide elections
though voters will be electing town and city mayors in a series of municipal elections , the contest is widely seen as a referendum on @entity4 's long - serving prime minister
@entity10 has been on the political defensive since december , when police detained dozens of people close to his government as part of a wide - ranging corruption probe
in subsequent weeks , the prime minister dismissed thousands of police commanders , as well as the prosecutors leading the investigation
he has also mounted a media offensive against his former political ally , the powerful @entity129 preacher @entity128 , who lives in self - imposed exile in the @entity132 state of @entity133
@entity10 has repeatedly accused @entity128 and his supporters of establishing a " parallel state " within the @entity4 police and judiciary aimed at toppling his democratically - elected government
as the corruption probe ground to a halt , anonymous critics began publishing a series of audio recordings online that appear to be wiretaps of @entity10 's telephone conversations
@entity10 has denounced some of the recordings , calling them " immorally edited material
" but the prime minister has also confirmed the authenticity of at least one recording , in which he is overheard instructing the executive of a @entity4 tv channel to censor the live broadcast of a rival politician 's speech in parliament
on tuesday night , @entity34 's body lay in a " cemevi , " the house of worship of the @entity166 religious sect to which he belongs
the boy is expected to be buried following a funeral service on wednesday
in the meantime , activists have called for symbolic funeral protests to be held in other cities across @entity4
more than 100 @entity4 riot police walled off the center of @entity16 's busy @entity175 on tuesday evening , in a clear effort to prevent demonstrators from gathering in the heart of the city .
