@entity0 wo n't be following @entity1 into @entity2 anytime soon
@entity0 's latest movie -- a comedy about two talk show hosts who are asked to assassinate @entity2 leader @entity7 -- has earned the distinction of a frothing rant from the regime in @entity11
" the enemies have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their despicable moves to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership , " a @entity2 @entity13 spokesman told the country 's state - run news agency wednesday
the film , titled " @entity22 , " stars @entity0 and @entity23 as two lightweight talk show hosts recruited by the @entity25 to take out @entity7
it 's not due in theaters until october , but the trailer is already drawing worldwide attention , including in the corridors of power in @entity11
' @entity31 ' the distribution of the movie is " the most undisguised terrorism and a war action to deprive the service personnel and people of the @entity2 of their mental mainstay and bring down its social system , " the @entity2 spokesman raged , using an abbreviation of the authoritarian country 's official name , the @entity2
comedians taking shots at @entity2 's dictatorial leadership is hardly new -- it goes back at least a generation
a decade ago , " @entity31 : @entity55 " used puppets to lampoon @entity7 's father , @entity51 , memorably featuring him singing about his loneliness at the top of the despotic state
@entity51 also popped up as a waiter in @entity58 's " @entity57 " -- albeit one who claimed to be " the greatest waiter of all time
" brutal regime the situation in @entity2 is no joke
a recent @entity66 commission detailed a horrifying list of crimes it says the regime has committed against its own people , including the large - scale use of prison camps and torture
the cold - blooded brutality of the system was displayed late last year when @entity7 's uncle was purged and executed
meanwhile , the isolated state continues to develop its nuclear weapons program , which it has used to threaten neighboring countries and the @entity80
will @entity7 watch ? but like his father , @entity7 has also brought about bizarre moments in his two and a half years in power , such as his basketball - based friendship with @entity1
such peculiar behavior , along with the secrecy in which the regime cloaks itself , is hard for comedians to resist
@entity90 last week cited @entity91 , the executive director of the @entity92 for @entity2 - @entity93 and a frequent visitor to @entity11 , as suggesting that @entity7 would probably watch the new movie
that prompted glee from @entity23 , who also co-directed and wrote the film
" apparently @entity7 plans on watching # @entity99
i hope he likes it ! ! " he tweeted
' towering hatred ' but the @entity2 government showed little sign of favor toward the film on wednesday , accusing the @entity80 of " bribing a rogue movie maker " to produce it
and it warned that @entity0 and @entity23 's comedy , which it said had touched off " the towering hatred and wrath of the service personnel and people of the @entity2 , " would have consequences
" those who defamed our supreme leadership and committed the hostile acts against the @entity2 can never escape the stern punishment to be meted out according to a law wherever they might be in the world , " the foreign ministry spokesman said
" if the @entity80 administration connives at and patronizes the screening of the film , it will invite a strong and merciless countermeasure
