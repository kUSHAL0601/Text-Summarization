@entity0 -- prince @entity4 is to be deployed next february to the @entity5 in his role as a search and rescue pilot , the @entity3 @entity2 said thursday
he will be one of four @entity10 pilots to be sent to the lonely , windswept military base , the air force said in a statement
the deployment is part of the normal crew rotation for the air force and will form part of his training and career progression , the statement said
the air force provides 24 - hour search and rescue cover year - round from the base
@entity4 , whose marriage in april to @entity26 , @entity27 , was watched by millions around the world , qualified as a search and rescue pilot in september last year
he has been flying @entity31 helicopters for the @entity10 from a base in @entity33 , @entity34
prince @entity35 , the @entity35 , opened the @entity37 base to which his nephew will be deployed over two decades ago
living conditions are said to be basic and isolated
@entity4 will need to be back in @entity3 in time to help with preparations for the @entity41 -- marking 60 years since she took the throne -- to be celebrated next june
his deployment will be seen as somewhat sensitive , coming 30 years after @entity3 and @entity45 went to war over the @entity5
known as @entity5 in @entity45 , the islands lie off the @entity50 country 's coast in the @entity51 and have been under @entity3 rule since 1833
@entity45 invaded the @entity5 in 1982 , prompting a war in which more than 600 @entity45 and 255 @entity3 military personnel died
@entity3 retained control of the islands after the war .
