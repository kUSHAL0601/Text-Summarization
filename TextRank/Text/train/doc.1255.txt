the whisky glows like a candle in the bottom of the glass
its aroma is rich , deep , musky , inviting
but dare i take a sip ? this is the new @entity10 50 - year - old , which carries a price tag of £ 25,000 ( $ 40,800 ) a bottle
which means that the single dram i am holding is worth about £ 830 ( $ 1,350 )
slowly , i raise it to my lips
i am standing in the whisky room at the luxurious @entity19 hotel in @entity20 , @entity21 -- which incidentally is owned by local boy tennis star @entity22 -- along with a select group of journalists
we have been invited to the exclusive launch of the new 50 - year - old , which is only the fourth time the distillery has released a whisky of this age
" a 50 - year - old @entity33 featured in ( the film ) @entity35 , but whiskies of this age are extremely unusual , " says @entity31 , global brand ambassador for @entity10 , who is introducing us to the latest release
" nobody 50 years ago knew that people would care about @entity40 the way they do in 2014
nobody planned to leave this whisky for so long
its existence is a bit of a miracle
" we tilt our glasses
the butter - colored liquid is rich with notes of cloves , summer flowers , dried fruits and marzipan , underpinned by the woody polish of an old gymnasium
" it tastes like soap , " somebody says
" you 've eaten soap ? " @entity31 replies
" it reminds me of the inside of a grand piano , " ventures someone else
" whisky of this age has a natural alcohol level of below 50 % , " @entity31 explains
" that 's when very unpredictable chemical reactions happen between the spirit and the wood
that 's the magic time
it creates whisky that is unique , quirky and unpredictable
" whisky collectors are making big money as extraordinary as this whisky is -- it is exceptionally long , with flavor lingering for several minutes after each sip -- one question is in the back of everyone 's mind
who would pay £ 25,000 for a bottle of whisky ? the answer is people like @entity93 , a whisky collector and building tycoon from @entity95 , @entity96 , who once bought a @entity97 64 - year - old for £ 100,000 ( $ 166,000 )
" i have about 5,000 bottles , including a lot of old , one - off , high - end whiskies , " he says
" over the years , i 've spent about $ 2 million on it
the collection is worth about $ 6 million now
i keep it at different locations all over the world , for security reasons
" @entity93 is one of a breed of whisky collectors that have found that their passion for the drink has led to great financial gains
distilleries first hit on the idea of limited editions and special releases in the early nineties , such as the famous @entity120 that came in a wooden presentation case
collectors like @entity93 bought the bottles largely for the love of them
but over the decades , their value started to appreciate to the extent that unusual bottles started to be seen as cash cows
fast - forward to 2014 , and the market is booming
according to the @entity132 index that is compiled by @entity134 - based @entity133 , the top 100 whiskies appreciated by an average of 440 % in the last six years
last month , a 50 - year - old bottle of @entity140 @entity139 single malt sold for £ 20,000 ( $ 33,000 )
in january , @entity141 's sold a six - liter decanter of @entity143 for £ 387,000 ( $ 631,000 )
these transactions are becoming relatively frequent , if not commonplace
indeed , @entity133 expect 30,000 bottles to be sold at auction this year , a 50 % increase on the 20,211 that were sold in 2013
by contrast , the @entity149 stock index increased by 31 % in the same period , and the live - ex @entity151 dropped by 2 %
if you 're a drinks investor with money to spend , it is something of a no - brainer
is whisky for collecting or drinking ? but most people in the whisky world see collecting purely for the sake of investment as something of a taboo
" you have to start by drinking the product and enjoying the product , " says @entity93
" buy two bottles , one to drink and one to collect
otherwise you 're going against the spirit of the industry
" @entity169 , the founding director of @entity133 , agrees -- but only to a point
" there are three types of buyers : drinkers , collectors and investors , " he says
" i know one person , who shall remain nameless , who is teetotal , and buys whisky only to invest
" some people think that this is a crime and whisky should be set free
but from my perspective , people can choose how to spend their money
it 's supporting the industry and that 's a good thing
" @entity188 , a former corporate banker , is launching a new business called @entity190 101 , which he describes as " consultants , brokers and valuers "
" @entity190 has always been collectable , but there were no market figures before @entity133 came along five years ago , " he says
" there were no indices , charts , graphs , nothing
rare @entity203 will have the world 's largest online database of whisky auction sales , so investors can accurately follow the market
" this is the latest contribution to the digital revolution that has transformed the secondary whisky market
physical auction houses like @entity213 and @entity214 's have traditionally tended to charge 25 % commission , and hold auctions just a few times a year
by contrast , sites like @entity40 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 run online auctions regularly , and charge a commission of just 10 %
" those sites have added liquidity into a traditionally illiquid market , " says @entity188
" they are part of the reason why whisky is booming , and the growing value of whisky is starting to usurp the experience of opening and drinking it
" @entity190 investment funds : too good to be true ? the market is gradually showing signs of maturity
in june , the world 's first whisky investment fund was set up by @entity241 , the ceo of @entity242 in @entity243 ; another has been established in @entity245
but many seasoned collectors -- who themselves have made millions through buying and selling whisky -- are skeptical about whisky funds , and suggest that potential investors tread carefully
" they worry me because genuine whisky experts are few and far between , and there is nobody credible behind these funds , " says @entity250 , founder of the @entity251 , who boasts a " handsome " private collection of 6,000 bottles that he keeps in his boardroom
" they are run by people from the wine industry , but you need a lot of knowledge specifically about whisky to make good investments
it 's not about just buying old whisky
i 've been collecting for 30 years and i know everyone who is good
how many whiskies have these guys tried ? fifty ? a hundred ? that 's not enough
" there are lots of hidden pitfalls , he says
for example , if you invest in a whisky that is not " amazing to drink " , demand may remain low even if it is a limited edition
and while some bottles go up , it is common for others to lose value
for example , the @entity288 limited edition @entity33 whisky , which marked the marriage between the @entity290 and @entity291 in 2011 , rose from £ 150 to £ 1,650 by 2013
these days , however , after the distillery lost many fans by removing age statements from its bottles , it has depreciated to about £ 900
by contrast , however , the iconic @entity299 whisky , which was released in 1996 to mark the 35th anniversary of the @entity134 satirical magazine , has appreciated from £ 35 to about £ 1,500 , and shows no sign of falling from grace
telling the difference between these two whiskies requires significant expertise
the importance of loving your whisky according to @entity250 , when it comes to whisky collecting , there is no substitute for genuine passion
he still vividly remembers the first bottle in his collection
" i visited a man in @entity21 , and noticed a special bottle on his mantelpiece , with a beautiful , intensely colorful label , " he says
" it was an original bottling from a distillery called @entity324 , which had closed in the early 1900s
" i knew i had to have it
it took me half an hour to persuade him to sell it to me , for £ 700 , which was a lot of money at the time
it 's worth about £ 20,000 now , but i 'll never sell it
" what advice would he offer an aspiring collector or investor ? " the whisky market is on fire at the moment , it really is , " he says
" but you ca n't become an expert overnight
" as a rule of thumb , buy limited edition bottles from iconic distilleries
but most importantly , learn about whisky , meet the experts and talk to them , and drink as much as you can
" back in the honeyed presence of the @entity10 50 - year - old , @entity31 is inclined to agree
" ultimately , whisky is about loving the mystery of the drink , conversation and friendship , " he says
" @entity190 is to be drunk and enjoyed
however high the stakes get , you can never lose sight of that
