-- @entity1 need to show more political spine when it comes to the issue of taxes
this week , income taxes are on everybody 's mind with tuesday 's filing deadline in view
@entity11 have no interest in defending the progressive income tax system
@entity14 , with an eye toward 2016 , has called for a flat tax with one rate for all income levels
in their minds , the progressive tax is system has often been inequitable , and they claim that those who work hard are penalized for spurring economic growth rather than rewarded
ever since conservatives undertook their " starve the beast " strategy in the early 1980s , @entity11 have also been aware that continually cutting taxes is the best way to ensure that @entity1 wo n't have the money they need to start new government programs
but @entity1 ca n't afford to sit still when it comes to this issue
too often in recent decades , @entity1 have desperately tried to avoid the subject of taxes
when republicans complain that taxes are bad , @entity1 slip into the corner so that nobody asks them what they think
ever since @entity42 came to @entity43 in 1981 and slashed tax rates to historically low levels , @entity1 have always felt that talking about a more vigorous progressive income tax system that brings more revenue into the federal government is toxic
they all remember when @entity1 presidential candidate @entity49 admitted in a debate against @entity42 in 1984 that he would raise taxes and suffered as a result
when president @entity54 took the step of raising taxes in 1993 to curb the deficit , his party suffered in the 1994 midterm elections
president @entity59 , who simply decided not to restore some of the @entity61 tax cuts , came under intense criticism and was branded a tax and spend liberal
the failure to defend taxation has its cost
at a time everyone is celebrating @entity69 's historic achievement with the @entity70 , @entity1 should remember the consequences of another piece of legislation passed 50 years ago -- the @entity74 which provided an across - the - board tax cut , reducing top rates from 91 % to 70 % , the bottom rate from 20 % to 10 % and the corporate rate from 52 % to 48 %
this too was a historic tax cut , unequaled at the time , that liberal economists had proposed as a way to stimulate consumer demand
while many liberals signed on to the tax cut , including president @entity69 , others warned that it would starve the government of needed revenue right as the president was embarking on an effort to build a @entity93
to obtain passage of the tax cut , which @entity69 believed would stimulate the economy by the time of the 1964 election , he agreed to a stringent budget in order to win over the support of @entity104 democrat @entity103 , the conservative southern chairman of the @entity105
as a result of the tax cut , @entity69 did n't have much money to play with early in his term
when he convinced @entity111 to pass the @entity112 in 1964 , it was done on the cheap
@entity111 did n't allocate , and he did n't ask for , sufficient money to construct programs capable of really taking a bite out of economic inequality
many of the programs still did well and provided a huge boost to the disadvantaged , but the money that would have been needed to really eradicate poverty was never there
@entity69 also backed away from other proposals , like the public works programs his secretary of labor @entity125 was proposing , because he did n't want to endanger the tax cut and did n't have enough funds to do more
later in his presidency , @entity69 would also hesitate to propose increased taxes to finance the war in @entity132
he waited too long , fearful of the political consequences , finally approaching @entity111 in 1967 to ask for a temporary tax surcharge
but he did so when his political stock had fallen and the war was controversial
@entity111 passed a 10 % , temporary tax surcharge in 1968 , but only after forcing @entity69 to agree to steep cuts in domestic spending and after inflation had really taken off
another @entity103 who took a very different approach to taxes was @entity142 , the architect of the @entity143
early in the 1930s , @entity142 displayed an antipathy toward taxation , generally resisting any efforts to undertake a mass expansion of the tax system , which then only touched a small portion of the population
but did finally take steps to increase taxes on the wealthy , such as the enactment of the " @entity155 " in 1935 as well as the earmarked taxes tied to @entity157
in the middle of @entity159 , @entity142 became even bolder
he understood that we have to pay if we want the government to do great things
in other words , we needed " taxes to beat the @entity165
" in 1943 and 1944 , @entity142 undertook a massive expansion of the income tax system , expanding the number of people subject to the income tax from 4 million to 44 million and instituting the policy of withholding at the source
the @entity173 conducted an aggressive campaign -- using film , radio and more -- to sell @entity177 on the idea that they had to sacrifice , through taxes , while other @entity177 were sacrificing their lives
even @entity181 was called in with the movie " @entity183 " to persuade the nation that taxes were a patriotic duty
@entity187 wrote " i paid my @entity188 , " which reminded @entity177 : " you see those bombers in the sky ? @entity192 helped to build them -- so did i ! " the campaign worked and the tax system put into place remained a permanent part of the political landscape with upper level taxes reaching over 90 % in the 1950s
while proposing taxes is politically frightening , it is necessary
and @entity1 , as the party that believes in government , must also be willing to defend and fight for the progressive tax system that has been the backbone of domestic and foreign policy since the start of the 20th century
they need to find a way to build support for increasing rates and filling loopholes such as lower rates on dividends and capital gains and the earnings of hedge fund millionaires -- all of which exacerbate the problem of inequality in @entity177
if democrats do n't do something to shore up the progressive income tax system , they will continue to see the funds of government erode , limiting what they can do or even imagine .
