-- the key to president @entity3 's triumphant performance in monday night 's debate was not his command of the facts , his well - crafted answers or his cutting comeback lines
it was one thing : the stone cold , laser - like stare @entity3 shot his opponent when @entity13 was answering questions
i call it " @entity3 - stare " -- but unlike @entity18 , this @entity3 plan may not be good for your health
for those , like me , who watch the other candidate closely when his opponent is answering a question , the contrast between @entity3 and @entity13 's reactions was like comparing @entity26 with @entity27
@entity13 's look vacillated between forced smiles to that of a person whose stomach was alarmingly churning and was worried he would n't make it to the bathroom in time
but @entity3 pinned @entity13 with the look -- @entity3 - stare
it 's not a look we saw at the previous debates
( of course , @entity3 did n't even attend the first one
) opinion : @entity3 in command ; @entity13 plays it safe @entity3 - stare resembles the grimace that @entity46 might have had on his face moments before guns were drawn at the famed gunfight at the @entity50
or even @entity52 's classic scowl in his " @entity54 " movies just before shooting a bad guy -- not to be confused with the look he recently gave to an empty chair
the @entity3 - stare is more than just a laser - like game face -- apparently it causes people to agree with him on issue after issue
@entity3 - stare is more akin to @entity63 's use of the @entity65 mind trick , or vampires on " @entity67 " glamouring someone into saying exactly what they want to hear
@entity13 agreed with @entity3 so often i thought @entity13 was going to endorse him
how else can anyone explain why @entity13 -- who is highly critical of @entity3 's foreign policy when he is out on the campaign trail -- would agree with the president on issue after issue when placed in the same room ? @entity13 appeared as if he was n't vying for commander in chief as much as for " agree - er in chief
" for starters , @entity13 praised @entity3 regarding @entity82 : " i congratulate him on taking out @entity82 and going after the leadership in @entity85
" @entity13 then agreed with @entity3 's policy regarding @entity87 during the @entity88 : " i believe , as the president indicated , and said at the time that i supported his -- his action there
" opinion : @entity13 endorses @entity3 's national security policies @entity13 continued his " i agree with @entity3 " tour with regard to @entity98 : " i want to underscore the same point the president made , which is that if i 'm president of the @entity103 ... we will stand with @entity98
" and on the @entity3 administration 's use of drones , @entity13 agreed some more : " i support that and entirely , and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology
... " @entity13 also concurred with the president on employing a host of tough sanctions against @entity114
( but i wish he would 've said he would impose " a binder full of sanctions
" ) and @entity13 agreed with @entity3 that at this time , he would not call for the deployment of @entity103 military personnel into @entity119 to stop the bloody conflict there
true , there were some disagreements
but those were mostly in the area of domestic policy , which oddly dominated the middle portion of the foreign policy debate
thankfully , moderator @entity129 finally regained control and returned the candidates to foreign policy
i can only assume someone texted @entity129 the words " @entity135
" i 'm sure there will be those who fault @entity13 for agreeing so often with @entity3 instead of articulating a stark contrast on foreign policy
but it was truly refreshing to see a @entity140 and @entity141 actually agreeing on issues
opinion : was @entity3 too relentless with @entity13 ? now , if the president can just figure out how to use @entity3 - stare on the entire @entity145 , maybe then we would see @entity145 get something done
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .
