@entity0 -- the @entity5 needs a new law requiring that the president consult with @entity8 before going to war , a blue - ribbon panel led by two former secretaries of state said tuesday
@entity10 , left , and @entity11 led a panel that recommended a new @entity13
the current @entity13 is " ineffective , and it should be repealed and it should be replaced , " @entity10 said in a joint appearance with @entity11 , announcing the results of the study they led
the recommendation follows failed efforts by @entity20 in @entity8 to put a stop to the war in @entity23 or to put conditions on president @entity26 's conduct of it
@entity8 passed a joint resolution to authorize armed force against @entity23 in 2002 , but some @entity26 opponents say it should not have been interpreted as a blank check for the @entity5 to invade and occupy the @entity33 nation
@entity10 , who served in @entity26 's administration , and @entity11 , who served under president @entity35 , said their project was not prompted by any specific war , with @entity11 adding that the commission had " tried very hard not to call balls and strikes on past history here
" " we did n't direct this report at any particular conflict , " @entity10 added
the existing law , the @entity13 of 1973 , has been regarded as unconstitutional by every president since it was passed as a response to the @entity48 , @entity10 and @entity11 said
it requires presidents to report regularly to @entity8 about ongoing conflicts , but the provision has been flouted
" no president has ever made a submission to @entity8 pursuant to the @entity13 since 1973 , " former sen. @entity53 , a @entity54 member of the committee , said tuesday
the panel , formally called the @entity59 , said a new law should be created requiring the president to consult with key members of @entity8 before sending troops into combat expected to last more than a week , or within three days of doing so in the case of operations that need to be kept secret
it should also make clear exactly who the president needed to consult
the panel suggests that the president talk to " a joint congressional committee made up of the leaders of the @entity73 and the @entity74 as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees
" the new committee would have a permanent professional staff with access to intelligence information , @entity10 and @entity11 said
@entity8 , in turn , would have to declare war or vote on a " resolution of approval " within 30 days , they said
if a resolution of approval failed , any member of @entity8 could introduce a " resolution of disapproval , " but it was not clear that such an act would stop a war in progress
@entity11 was unable to say in the news conference what practical effect congressional disapproval would have
@entity10 said the commission had been in touch with the presidential campaigns of @entity104 @entity103 and @entity54 @entity105 , as well as leaders of @entity8
he declined to reveal what they thought of the proposal , but said : " we have n't gotten a negative reaction
" @entity8 has not officially declared war since 1942 , when the @entity5 entered formal hostilities with the @entity114 in @entity115 but since then , presidents have sent troops into countries including @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity23
the @entity122 makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces , but gives @entity8 the power to declare war and approve military budgets
@entity10 and @entity11 's group included both @entity54 and @entity20 and held seven meetings over 14 months .
