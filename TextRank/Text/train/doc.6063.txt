a referendum over @entity2 's future as a part of @entity4 has been put on hold
@entity4 's @entity7 on monday suspended the planned referendum on independence for @entity4 's @entity2 region set to happen on november 9 , a court spokeswoman told @entity11
the court has suspended the referendum as it consider the grounds of a lawsuit issued by @entity4 's federal government that challenged the planned independence vote as " unconstitutional
" the president of the @entity2 region , @entity18 , on saturday had signed a decree setting the date for the vote
even before the @entity7 suspended the plan , the federal government had made it clear that it any such referendum
a legal and political confrontation was expected
the next move is in @entity2 's hand -- and whether its leaders decide to go ahead with the vote anyway
the holding of @entity34 's independence referendum earlier this month buoyed other separatist movements around the world , despite @entity34 voters opting to remain part of the @entity39
@entity18 has said that @entity2 wants to speak , wants to be heard and wants to vote
on september 11 , @entity42 national day , hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of @entity44 for the third year running demanding a vote on independence be held
but @entity47 argues that @entity2 , which represents one fifth of @entity4 's economy , already has broad home - rule powers , including its own parliament , police force and control over education and health
and it insists that the @entity4 @entity56 does not allow any of @entity4 's 17 regions to unilaterally break away
@entity2 is a region of northeastern @entity4 , with @entity44 -- the second - largest city in @entity4 -- as its capital
a referendum is expected to ask a two - part question : " should @entity2 be a state ? " and those who vote yes to that can then go to vote on the second question : " should that state be independent ? " polls indicate that a majority of @entity42 want to have a chance to vote but that less than a majority would vote for independence , given the chance .
