-- @entity2 rep. @entity1 is pressing the @entity4 ethics panel to set her trial date before the midterm elections in november
" i have made a very public request to come out with the formalized charges and to set up a meeting to hear them , " she said thursday in an interview with @entity8 , a public radio station in @entity10 , @entity2
" let 's hope that they do it , " she said
the 10 - term congresswoman is accused of violating @entity4 rules by seeking federal assistance for a bank with financial ties to her husband
according to a @entity27 report , @entity25 helped arrange a meeting in september 2008 between @entity30 - based @entity29 and @entity32 officials
@entity29 ultimately received $ 12 million in bailout funds
@entity25 is a senior member of the @entity34
according to @entity25 ' 2008 financial disclosure statement -- as mentioned in the report -- her husband had two investments in @entity29 at the time of the meeting
they were valued between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million
" there is substantial reason to believe that rep. @entity25 ' conduct may have violated " @entity4 rules , the report concludes
@entity25 , who represents the @entity47 section of @entity48 , insists she did nothing wrong
" i have not violated any @entity4 rules , " she said in a statement monday
" i simply will not be forced to admit to something i did not do
" @entity25 asserted that " the record will clearly show that in advocating on behalf of minority banks neither my office nor i benefited in any way , engaged in improper action or influenced anyone
... the case against me has no merit
" @entity25 has asked @entity62 to make public the formal charges against her
" all i know is that i have not been charged , that there has been a report that was released that said further investigation , " @entity25 said
" most people do n't have a clue about what these charges are supposed to be and we 're eager to get the information out
" the announcement this week by the ethics committee means @entity25 , 71 , may now face a trial by committee members tasked with determining whether there is " clear and convincing evidence " she broke congressional rules
rep. @entity83 , d - @entity84 , is also facing a possible ethics committee trial
@entity83 , the former chairman of the tax - writing @entity87 , has been accused of 13 violations of @entity4 rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of @entity92
both trials could take place in september , only a few weeks before the midterm elections
the prospect of inquiries into two high - profile @entity98 has compounded the fears of congressional democrats nervous about their prospects in november
" i think that there should be a process that works for everybody
it should be fair , " @entity25 said
" people 's due process should not be trampled on
i think it 's unfortunate that these cases have been handled the way they 've been handled
" the growing likelihood of trials for @entity25 and @entity83 also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation
both representatives are leaders of the @entity118 , and @entity29 is one of the largest minority - owned banks in @entity121 .
