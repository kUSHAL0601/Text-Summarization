-- @entity1 won the 10th stage of the @entity3 -- but it was @entity5 who stole the headlines tuesday
the @entity8 was forced to endure a nervous wait following the conclusion of the race with television pictures appearing to show him barging into @entity15 @entity14 during a sprint finish
the @entity17 had looked to be in contention as the 197 kilometer stage between @entity20 and @entity21 approached its climax before clashing with @entity23 within sight of the finish line
the @entity27 rider suffered cuts and bruises but race jury president @entity30 refused to blame @entity5 for the coming together
" @entity14 had done his job for @entity34 , he was tired and he was looking down , " the @entity31 told reporters
" if we have to blame anyone , it is @entity14
there has been no complaint from @entity27 , but we were not considering sanctions or a disqualification
" @entity5 , who finished third following the incident , maintained his innocence after missing out on a 25th stage win
" the commissaires are already putting the blame on me , " he told reporters
" you can see he ( @entity23 ) moves a little bit right , i move a little bit left , it 's not like i took his wheel , i 'm following the road
" @entity5 also took to @entity55 to defend his actions , tweeting : " just seen the sprint
i believe i did n't move line
i 'm actually coming past @entity14 and we touch elbows when he moves
anyway , hope he 's ok
" there 's no way i 'd move on a rider deliberately , especially one not contesting a sprint
i hope @entity14 's ok
" @entity64 , who is the first man to win two stages during this edition of the @entity3 , escaped the crash as the sprinters went full pelt for the line
" i 'm really happy to have won but the victory is tempered a bit by the crash
i hope @entity14 is n't too injured , " he told reporters
" apparently @entity5 bumped into @entity14 and he lost control of his handlebars and crashed
" i can not imagine that @entity5 did that on purpose , it just happens sometimes in a hectic finale
every sprinter wants to come to the front when he comes to the line and i hope that he 's ok
" you can see that @entity5 really bumped into the handlebar of @entity14 but it does n't look like he does it on purpose
@entity14 swings off to the right and @entity5 to the left - and it 's just very unlucky at that moment
" @entity92 's @entity91 maintained his one minute 25 second lead over nearest rival @entity94
@entity91 was close to the crash towards the conclusion of the race but escaped with his lead intact
" it was a bit tricky towards the end , but i always had a teammate with me and i kept out of trouble , " he told reporters
" it 's always nervous when you come into the last 2 km with a bunch sprint coming off the final bend , but i was to one side of it and went around it without any problems
