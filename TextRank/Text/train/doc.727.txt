@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 are signaling that a final health care bill will drop the government - run public health insurance option favored by liberals but rejected by conservatives from both parties
a @entity3 - @entity11 conference committee will begin negotiations next month on merging health care bills passed by the @entity15 majorities in each chamber
however , voting in both chambers was extremely close , raising concerns that a compromise might fail to win the necessary final approval
one of the main differences between the two measures is the public option
the @entity3 bill contains the public option as a competitor to private insurers in a national heath insurance exchange open to people now unable to get coverage , but the @entity11 version lacks a public option
president @entity34 , who has made health care reform his top domestic priority this year , has expressed general support for a public option but stops short of insisting on the provision
@entity2 in the @entity3 have said they want to keep the public option , but one of their leaders -- rep. @entity42 of @entity43 , the chamber 's third - ranking @entity44 -- said sunday that he could vote for a bill without the government insurance plan
" we want a public option to do basically three things : create more choice for insurers , create more competition for insurance companies and to contain costs , " @entity42 said on the @entity49 program " @entity50
" " so if we can come up with a process by which these three things can be done , then i 'm all for it
whether or not we label it a public option or not is of no consequence
" the @entity11 health care bill required the support of all 60 members of the @entity15 caucus to overcome a @entity68 filibuster
such precarious support allowed individual moderates in the @entity15 caucus to wield major influence on the bill , with at least two -- sens. @entity74 of @entity75 and @entity76 of @entity77 -- saying they would oppose the measure if it contained the public option
on sunday , rep. @entity80 of @entity81 , chairman of the @entity82 , acknowledged the reality of the @entity11 politics
asked on " @entity86 " about the public option , @entity80 said , " it 's not dead , but we also recognize that the @entity11 was able to just muster the 60 votes
" the @entity3 could drop the public option if " there are other mechanisms in whatever bill comes out that will keep down premiums , " @entity80 said
supporters of a public option say it would provide nonprofit competition to private insurers that would bring down costs , but opponents contend that it is the first step toward a government takeover of the health care system
in place of a public option , the @entity11 bill includes a provision allowing private insurers to offer nonprofit coverage overseen by a government agency
both the @entity3 and @entity11 bills would permit the creation of nonprofit private insurance cooperatives to increase competition .
