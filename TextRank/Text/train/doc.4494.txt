-- feeling overwhelmed ? stop stress in its tracks with this 14 - day relaxation regimen
here 's a plan aimed at reducing your daily stress
monday day 1 : see the big picture
when obstacles pop up , ask yourself how stressful the situation really is : will this matter in three months ? three years ? for issues with long - term repercussions , write down exactly what you think the problem is or how the situation needs to change
brainstorm about what you can do to move toward a better outcome , itemize the steps that must be taken , then create a concrete plan of action
tuesday day 2 : survey your support system
make a list of people you could turn to for advice and hands - on help in a pinch
you 'll probably realize you have more people to rely on for emotional , practical , or financial support than you thought you did
knowing that they 're there can mitigate the effects of stress and make you feel more resilient
@entity36 : how to make positive changes in your life wednesday day 3 : plant something
whether it 's a window box or a row of bulbs , caring for greenery can have a positive effect on your well - being
a recent study put heart - disease patients in a horticultural - therapy class
immediately after the class , their heart rates were lowered and their moods improved
gardening can help shift the focus away from the stressors in your life and calm you down
thursday day 4 : take tea
a @entity61 study found that regularly drinking black tea can lower levels of stress hormones and induce feelings of relaxation
just be mindful of how much caffeine you drink before bedtime
@entity36 : easy ways to unwind friday day 5 : get a chair massage
these short massages now offered in salons , malls , and airports can work wonders on chipping away accumulated stress
even a 15 - minute massage can calm nerves
or try this @entity81 solution a few times a day : place your left hand in front of you , palm - side up with your fingers together , and using your right thumb , massage the fleshy spot between your left thumb and index finger in a circular motion while you slowly count to 15
saturday day 6 : play on the web
doing online puzzles , like solitaire or sudoku , can decrease stress and improve mood , according to research from @entity99 , in @entity100 , @entity101
because you 're distracted from your worries by the game , your nervous system can relax
find a game you like , one you become so absorbed in that you lose all track of time , and play it daily
sunday day 7 : bless yourself
focusing on what you 're grateful for flips a switch in your brain : when you let good things take center stage , the stressful ones can recede
make a list of three to five specific things you 're thankful for your husband did the laundry today , the new album you downloaded , and so on
with daily practice , gratitude will soon become a more natural state of mind
@entity36 : 36 low - cost , make - you - smile ideas monday day 8 : think pink
you may find it too girly to wear , but , surprisingly , a bubblegum shade of pink originally called @entity129 has been shown to have a temporary soothing effect , actually lowering blood pressure
to add a little pink to your day ( without repainting your office ) , make your screen saver a bright pink image , store papers in pink file folders , put a pink pillow on your chair , or jot memos on @entity141
tuesday day 9 : turn off the tv
constant bombardment by news can make you feel anxious when you 're already keyed up , and a blaring tv hits you with both visual and aural stimulation
consider a quieter , more single - sensory form of news whether it 's the morning paper or the car radio
and limit your news to one source to keep from being overwhelmed
wednesday day 10 : take the scenic route
whenever possible , get off crowded city streets and busy highways and take a tree - lined road to your destination
a study showed that the frustrations of commuting are somewhat eased if you travel down streets with views of vegetation
thursday day 11 : untie your knots
several times a day , scan your body from top to bottom , focusing on the areas that are most vulnerable to stress - related muscle tension
consciously release the muscles in your forehead , eyes , lips , tongue , jaw , lower back , and toes
friday day 12 : give bad thoughts the stop sign
negative thinking can fuel stress
so when damaging , unhelpful thoughts come to mind , ask yourself : how could i look at this in a more positive or at least a neutral light ? or try visualizing a giant red stop sign in front of these thoughts
then take a few slow , deep breaths and decide whether you need to dwell on the negative or can think about something more upbeat
saturday day 13 : lend someone a hand
help a colleague who 's in a jam , sign up to mentor a student , or volunteer at a women 's shelter
reaching out to someone else gets you away from your own worries , puts things in perspective , and can make you feel better about yourself and your circumstances
sunday day 14 : plan to laugh
research has found that feel - good endorphins start cranking and the mood - boosting benefits kick in as soon as people start anticipating having a laugh , and a good belly laugh can relax your whole body
so @entity211 @entity210 and let the good vibes start flowing
