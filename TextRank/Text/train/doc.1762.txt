-- @entity1 stretched his unbeaten run to 16 matches as the @entity4 was joined in the semifinals in @entity6 by five - time winner and defending @entity8 thursday
@entity1 has been in imperious form at the hard court event and was never troubled by quarterfinal opponent @entity11 of @entity13 , winning 6 - 0 6 - 3 in 64 minutes
@entity8 was equally impressive against @entity15 veteran @entity14 , dropping just four games in a straight sets romp
but they face much tougher tests in the last four clashes friday , with @entity1 playing in - form fourth seed @entity22 of @entity23 and @entity8 taking on third ranked @entity24 , who beat him in the quarterfinals of the @entity26 last year
it is the first time in the history of the 20 - year - old @entity29 that all top four seeds have reached the semifinals and @entity22 and @entity24 were largely untroubled in their last eight clashes
@entity22 outclassed @entity33 6 - 4 6 - 2 while @entity24 overpowered @entity15 wild card @entity35 6 - 3 6 - 2 in just over an hour
@entity37 champion @entity1 's streak dates back to november last year , but he knows he will have to be on top of his game against @entity22 , who won in @entity40 earlier this month
" @entity22 is a very talented player , very powerful from the baseline and with a big service
we know everything about each other , it 's going to be a tough one and i need to be on top of my game , " he told the official @entity44 website
@entity50 knows formidable @entity51 will offer a difficult test as he bids fora place in the final and his 77th career title
" he 's obviously a good player
he 's got amazing power , one of the strongest guys out there on tour
we 'll see tomorrow how it goes
i have n't seen him play at all here this tournament
i need to just focus on my game , " said the @entity65
in @entity8 's favor may be the tough schedule of his opponent , who had to fly from @entity70 where he lost to @entity71 of @entity72 in sunday 's final
@entity71 also made the long trip , but exited in the first round to fellow @entity72 @entity76 .
