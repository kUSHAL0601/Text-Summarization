-- the @entity1 and @entity2 were meeting monday to debate the imposition of martial law in the country 's south by president @entity7 in the aftermath of last month 's massacre of 57 civilians
as required by law , the president issued a report sunday explaining her reasons for making the proclamation for the province of @entity16
" lawless elements have taken up arms and committed public uprising against the duly constituted government and against the people of @entity16 , " @entity7 said in a 20 - page letter to the leaders of the @entity1 and @entity2
martial law went into effect friday night , allowing arrests without a warrant
@entity29 spokesman lt. col. @entity28 said it was necessary to impose peace following what has been called a politically motivated massacre
he added that @entity34 would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days
the @entity1 and @entity2 might jointly convene on tuesday to discuss the president 's report , house speaker @entity36 said sunday , according to the @entity39
the debate began as elite forces of the @entity42 clashed in the town of @entity44 with suspected followers of the politically powerful @entity47 family , which has been implicated in the massacre , the @entity39 reported monday
reports said the armed men offered stiff resistance on sunday against government security forces in a 10 - minute firefight , withdrawing after government reinforcements arrived
no casualties were reported on either side
charges of rebellion will be leveled against many of those arrested since martial law was implemented , @entity59 justice secretary @entity58 said saturday , @entity0 affiliate @entity65 reported
at least six members of the @entity47 family have been arrested , including @entity44 mayor @entity47 , according to @entity65
@entity47 , whose father is governor of @entity16 , has been accused of directing the killings and has been charged with 25 counts of murder
one of the massacre victims implicated members of the @entity67 before she died , the affiliate reported
over the weekend , authorities raided at least one warehouse and ranch belonging to the family
they confiscated firearms , ammunition and vehicles , maj. @entity84 , deputy of operations for the eastern @entity87 command , told @entity0
the military was looking at arresting at least 100 people tied to the massacre , @entity65 reported
the @entity59 military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well , @entity28 said
asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings , @entity84 said authorities " were trying to build a case , a tight case " against suspects
" but it is taking long to build a case , so i think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects , and allowed us to search , even without warrant
so we really need this declaration of state of martial law
" violence in the run - up to elections is not uncommon in the country
the @entity16 massacre , however , is the worst politically motivated violence in recent @entity59 history , according to state media
the victims included the wife and sister of political candidate @entity122 , who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of @entity16
he said he had received threats from allies of gov. @entity128 , the father of the accused mayor , saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself
@entity16 is part of an autonomous region in predominantly @entity133 , which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent @entity137 homeland in the predominantly @entity139 nation .
