-- this month on @entity1 , a modern insight into our enduring bond with man 's best friend ... the humble dog
singer @entity7 tells quest why dogs are a girl 's best friend
when humans blossomed from the evolutionary tree , it seems there was a cold wet nose and a wagging tail waiting for us
so it remains to this day , that we need dogs and they need us
@entity22 alone now spend $ 41 billion a year on their pets , more than the gross domestic product of all but 64 countries in the world
quest begins his journey in @entity30 where pampered pooches are the ultimate accessory
it 's the city that caters for a dog 's every whim , from spa treatments to doggy bakeries
some mutts are not so lucky -- quest joins actress @entity40 at the @entity42 dog rescue center , where the doe - eyed inmates wait for adoption
it is here where @entity1 encounters @entity47 , a shy , docile pit bull / boxer mix with a troubled past
they say every dog has its day and on a sunny afternoon in @entity52 , @entity47 has hers , as @entity1 takes her for a grooming and spot of shopping
ultimately , the show is about companionship
back in @entity58 , in the @entity59 , singing sensation @entity7 eulogizes about the fluffy members of her band -- she says that her dogs are the perfect companions because they have no idea she is a celebrity
we also join actor @entity67 on the set of his new movie " @entity73 " -- the traditional @entity71 story of canine loyalty
on set , we meet the dog trainers and look at the work of @entity77 , authors of the phrase : " no animals were harmed during the making of this movie
" just like proud parents , every owner likes to think their dog is special
at the @entity87 in @entity88 , competition gets bitchy and only the best trained hounds need apply
back in @entity52 , @entity1 helps pick out the doggy stars of the future with @entity92 agent @entity92
working dogs have left an important paw print on our society -- in @entity96 , @entity97 , we see how the specially trained dogs of the @entity99 bring comfort to sick children and prepare for rescue missions during natural disasters
join the experts and the eccentrics for some canine capers , on this month 's @entity107
