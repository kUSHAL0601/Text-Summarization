-- there are seemingly millions of smartphone apps out there designed to make traveling easier , but not all of them are very good
every company seems to think that it needs an app to be cool , but not every app is worth the effort
here are some of the apps that i find to be most helpful while on the road : @entity14 i 'm one of those guys who always thinks that more information is better , and that 's why i like @entity14
you can see exactly where your flight ( or any other flight ) is at the moment
i 've used the @entity14 website for years to see near real - time flight tracking , and now there 's an app as well
were you told your airplane is coming from @entity27 , but it 's still not there and you should be boarding ? go to @entity14 to see where the airplane is right now
@entity14 is hardly the only one in this space
other frequent fliers swear by @entity31 , for example
@entity33 when i was in @entity35 recently , my wife was looking for something before our next flight
trying to find the right store in an airport the size of @entity42 is a mind - numbing experience
@entity45 , however , gives the rundown on which stores and restaurants are in each terminal and it pulls in reviews as well
if you 're in an airport looking for a particular product or service , this will make your task much easier
hotel tonight have you ever been somewhere and realized you needed a room for the night ? maybe your flight was canceled or perhaps your meetings ran long
this company negotiates deals with hotels for last - minute rooms in many big cities
within seconds , you can have the room reserved for a low rate
@entity69 if you do n't know a city well , the taxi scene can be confusing
where is the best place to hail a cab ? how much should you pay ? @entity69 makes it a lot easier
if there 's a participating cab company in your city , @entity69 will have a cab sent right to you
you can pay directly through the app so you do n't have to worry about whether credit is accepted or not
the app and booking services are free , and there 's a $ 1.50 documentation fee for using a credit card through the app. if there is n't a participating cab company in the area , @entity69 will give you phone numbers for local companies so you can call and arrange for a cab yourself
@entity96 if you 've ever used @entity96 online to manage your travel , you know it 's a great tool for keeping all your travel plans in one place
of course , there 's also an app for that
see and manage all your travel plans in the @entity96 app so you never lose your details
beyond the basics of flights , hotels and cars , you can also put in things like appointments and meals
your airline app this is n't one app ; it 's dependent upon which airline you fly
if you fly a different airline every time , then it 's probably not worth downloading every single airline app. but if you 're a loyalist , you should absolutely have it
there are some excellent apps out there that allow you to check flight status , see the standby list , book flights and even check in
apps will store a mobile boarding pass so you can just flash your phone to get on the airplane ( not in all airports , but it 's getting there )
some airlines have better apps than others
i 've heard rave reviews about the new @entity143 app , but get the apps for the airlines you fly frequently
what would you add to the list ?
