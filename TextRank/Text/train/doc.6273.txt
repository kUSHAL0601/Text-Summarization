-- when @entity2 sits across from the @entity3 to seek their presidential endorsement , i ca n't wait to hear his reaction to these men and women carrying guns and tasers when they ask him to explain why he does n't think the nation needs more of them on the streets
mr. @entity13 sounded like a completely out - of - touch guy when , in an effort to slam president @entity17 's news conference on the economy , said : " he wants another stimulus , he wants to hire more government workers
he says we need more firemen , more policemen , and more teachers
did he not get the message of @entity26 ? the @entity28 people did
it 's time for us to cut back on government and help the @entity28 people
" last i checked , teachers , firefighters and police officers are @entity28
in fact , if you have ever had your home broken into , i 'm sure the last thing you want the 911 operator to tell you is they will have to schedule a cop to drop by as if he 's an air conditioner repairman
when your house is going up in flames , i doubt there would be many chuckles if the 911 operator says , " @entity2 says you should be happy to have a smaller government , so we wo n't be able to send someone to put out the fire until monday morning
" this is the kind of ignorance that gets passed off to us as smart political thinking
trust me , i get the whole argument of downsizing government
but people like @entity2 act as if the essential services that makes our neighborhoods , towns , cities and states run is n't done by government employees
need that trash picked up ? yeah , it smells a bit funky , but suck it up , @entity2 says we can get by with fewer garbage collectors
tired of that pothole ? do n't complain
just drive around it since we do n't have the manpower to get them fixed in a timely manner
it 's real easy to take shots at government , but when it comes to determining what is essential to our daily lives , we must have a different conversation
when you 're a rich guy like @entity2 , public school teachers mean nothing to you since you can afford to send your kids to private schools , hire tutors and enjoy those small classrooms
but if you 're like most of " the @entity28 people " you ca n't stand overcrowded classrooms and few resources
but @entity2 does n't care
instead of separating the battle between union contracts and cities from actual people , he chose to make a ridiculous comment and dismiss the millions of hardworking @entity28 out there
that 's even more laughable considering republicans call themselves the law - and - order party , and are quick to tout their police endorsements
how many times have we seen @entity2 's party pals call @entity109 firefighters heroes after 9/11
so , @entity2 , should we not bother to expand the ranks of the men and women who keep us safe ? @entity2 does n't have to worry about the @entity17 campaign or the @entity114 running ads showing him to be an out - of - touch rich guy who does n't care about blue - collar workers
we just have to wait for him to open his mouth
and we wo n't have to wait long
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity120 .
