@entity0 -- the prosecutor sounded like the narrator of a hard - boiled police drama as he carefully laid out pieces of the puzzle that led detectives to arrest one of their own in a 23 - year - old cold case
" a bite , a bullet , a gun barrel and a broken heart , that 's the evidence that will prove to you that defendant @entity23 murdered @entity23 , " deputy district attorney @entity11 told jurors as an unusual criminal trial began this week in @entity14
the trial promises to tell the story of a decorated female officer who rose through the ranks of the @entity28 while allegedly hiding a dark secret : she was getting away with murder
@entity32 , now 51 and retired from the force , is accused of killing her college crush 's new bride in 1986 , staging the crime scene to make it look like a burglary
yes , she was a police officer , but she did not kill in the line of duty , or to protect the public , @entity11 alleged
" this killing was personal
" @entity43 was a tall , athletic 29 - year - old hospital nursing supervisor with a pretty smile
she met a brutal end , beaten , bitten and shot to death in her townhouse in the suburban @entity48 on february 24 , 1986
she 'd also been tied up and hit over the head with a vase
to police , it looked like a burglary gone bad
stereo components were stacked by the door and @entity43 's new @entity56 , an engagement gift , was missing
the case intrigues because it blends soap opera suds with " csi " - style forensics -- including broken fingernails and a bite mark
it also promises to hold up a mirror to one of the nation 's most storied law enforcement agencies
" metaphorically speaking , this case is about the new @entity28 investigating the old @entity28 , " said @entity69 , who has covered the department for the @entity71 since the 1990s
" this trial really traces the evolution of the @entity28 and its approach to investigations , coupled with the revolutionary advances in technology
" he added , " there 's the old adage that the @entity28 would never go after one of its own , but this case flies in the face of that
" according to prosecutor @entity11 , the crime was all about a guy
witnesses who knew them in college at @entity91 will testify that @entity32 was smitten with @entity92 , but he just was n't that into her
to underscore his portrayal of @entity32 as a woman obsessed , @entity11 displayed an old photograph found during a 2009 police search of the journals she 'd stashed in a footlocker at home
taken at their college dorm 30 years earlier , it shows @entity92 sleeping with his back to the camera
he was wearing only white cotton briefs
@entity92 did care for @entity32 , @entity11 continued , but in his view they were just good friends -- with occasional " benefits
" defense attorney @entity112 told jurors there was much more to the relationship
the couple dated after college , went on trips and slept together " many , many times
" @entity32 thought it was serious and also got to know and love @entity92 's mother and brother
she thought they had a future , the lawyer said
when she learned @entity92 was marrying someone else , @entity32 decided to lay her cards on the table
she told him how she felt
they slept together one last time , and then he told her he was going ahead with his marriage to @entity43 , @entity112 said
" she was tearful , " he added
" she was n't hysterical
" a key part of the case involves a confrontation between @entity32 and @entity43 at the hospital where @entity43 worked , but @entity112 insisted his client was no stalker
by some accounts , @entity32 allegedly told her rival : " if i ca n't have him , nobody can
" while @entity112 acknowledged there was a meeting between the two women , he described it as more of a heads - up
the message from @entity32 , according to her attorney : " hey , if he 's dating you , you 'd better tell him to stop bothering me
tell him to knock it off
" at the time of the slaying , @entity32 was in her second year with the @entity28
the killing occurred on a monday
@entity32 had taken the day off ; @entity43 had called in sick that morning
authorities estimate she died before lunchtime
@entity92 found the body when he came home from work after 6 that night
wearing a red robe , pink t - shirt and black panties , @entity43 was sprawled on her back on the living room floor
by all accounts , the grim find left @entity92 dazed and despondent
@entity32 was a newbie patrol officer when @entity92 broke up with her for good
she was hurt by his rejection , sure , but she moved on and prospered , @entity112 said
she made detective and met her husband , a fellow @entity0 police detective , in 1993 , and they have a daughter
she was headed for the department 's internal affairs and its prestigious art theft detail
according to prosecutors , the key to unlocking @entity32 ' dark secret lay for years on the back shelf of an evidence freezer in the coroner 's office
a sealed evidence envelope contained a vial
inside that vial was a cotton swab
on that swab , prosecutors say , was dna taken from saliva from the bite wound on @entity43 's left forearm
testing in 2005 revealed the assailant was a woman
but still some detectives clung to the burglary theory and focused their inquiries on known female prowlers
from the beginning , the victim 's family had pointed to an ex-girlfriend of @entity92 's who was a cop , and as the dna testing advanced , undercover police followed @entity32 to a @entity207 store and retrieved a discarded soda from a trash can
saliva traces from the straw matched the bite mark dna , and she officially became a suspect
@entity32 was confronted , and another sample was taken from her shortly before her arrest
tests revealed the dna found in the bite mark on @entity43 's left forearm belonged to @entity32
how sure were they ? @entity11 said the chances of the killer being anyone else is " one in 1.7 sextillion
" that 's a 17 followed by 20 zeroes
@entity112 says the crime scene evidence from 1986 was mishandled and tainted years ago and ca n't be trusted
the envelope has been torn
photos show the top of the vial poking through
and while the top of the envelope may have been sealed with red crime lab tape , the bottom was wide open
@entity235 quoted the crime lab 's supervisor , who observed : " we 've got a problem
" hairs , fibers and fingerprints found at the crime scene ca n't be tied to @entity32 at all and have n't been matched to anyone else , @entity112 told the jury
the jurors listened intently monday but did n't take many notes
as prosecutors set the scene with their first witnesses , the images projected on a large screen were jarring : a beaming bride in white appeared one minute , followed by an image of a bloodied corpse in a red robe , arms and legs stiffened with rigor mortis
both photos were of @entity43 , and they were taken less than four months apart
her father , @entity261 , occasionally choked back sobs , and one of the victim 's sisters teared up at the sight of the bloodied face with one eye blackened and swollen shut
@entity23 " wore the white dress that the defendant felt was hers , " @entity11 said
" four months after that marriage , @entity23 was dead , her beauty disfigured , obliterated , blotted from existence
" @entity32 , dressed in black for court , appeared pale and waxy as she jotted notes and whispered with her attorneys
during breaks , she waved at her husband , mother and brother , who were seated behind her
@entity11 reminded jurors what life was like in 1986
@entity288 had the top - rated television show
people played @entity291 and @entity292 and hardly anybody had a home computer
and few , except for scientists , had heard of dna
the genetic testing that is now the " gold standard of evidence , " was yet to come , @entity11 reminded the jury
" a tiny @entity23 was hiding in the bite on @entity23 's arm , " he said
the @entity304 trial in 1994 and 1995 helped cement dna as a household word
ten years later , the @entity28 launched its cold case squad , reopening hundreds of files to see , as @entity11 said , " if there were more killers hiding on evidence shelves in coroners ' freezers
" it will be up to eight women and four men to decide if @entity32 is one of them .
