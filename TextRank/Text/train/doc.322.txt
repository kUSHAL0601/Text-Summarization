-- lawyers for a man who ran a notorious torture prison in @entity4 where more than 14,000 people died during the 1970s @entity7 regime are appealing his conviction
the lawyers for @entity10 , @entity11 , say he should be acquitted since he was " a witness of the events of the relevant period " and should be in witness protection -- not detention
@entity11 was convicted of war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture in july in a @entity20 - backed war crimes tribunal also known as the @entity22 in the @entity23
@entity11 's lawyers also say the court did not have jurisdiction , the appeal states
" to interpret the applicable law in reliance on international customary law is inconsistent " with the law of the @entity22 , according to the appeal
earlier this month , prosecutors in @entity4 appealed @entity11 's 30 - year sentence , saying the punishment was too light
" the co-prosecutors are of the view that the judgment gives insufficient weight to the gravity of @entity11 's crimes and his role and his willing participation in those crimes , " they said in a statement
" at the same time , the co-prosecutors believe that undue weight is placed on any mitigating circumstances applicable to @entity11
" some survivors had been angered by the sentence for @entity11
his prison term would have been about 19 years after the court took off 11 years for the time he has already served behind bars
the verdict sparked strong reactions as word spread outside the courtroom
some said it made them lose faith in the @entity20 - backed war crimes tribunal
" it 's becoming a sham , " @entity62 , chairwoman of the @entity63 , said after the verdict
at least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of @entity4 's population -- died under the 1975 - 1979 @entity7 regime from execution , disease , starvation and overwork , according to the @entity73
@entity11 , 67 , was the head of the @entity75
few people brought to the prison made it out alive ; only about a dozen were found by the @entity80 , who invaded @entity4 in 1979
prosecutors had initially sought a 40 - year sentence
the judges first gave @entity11 35 years , but took five years off that for the time he was illegally detained before the tribunal was established
prosecutors have said the judgment failed " to reflect the full extent of @entity11 's criminal conduct " and he should be " separately convicted of the crimes against humanity of enslavement , imprisonment , torture , rape , extermination , and other inhumane acts
these crimes should not have been subsumed into the crimes of persecution and torture
" the judge , in announcing @entity11 's sentence , said he took into consideration that the defendant had expressed remorse , admitted responsibility and cooperated with the court
the judge also took into account the " coercive environment " of the @entity7 , he said @entity11 pleaded guilty , but he said he was only following orders and asked for forgiveness
last november , he asked to be freed after spending some 11 years in detention
in the last week of his trial , @entity11 argued that international law did not apply to him because he was following orders
the tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on - and - off negotiations between the @entity20 and @entity4 over the structure and functioning of the court
@entity11 's verdict was the court 's first
another four of the ultra-maoist regime 's former leaders are waiting to see if they will stand trial before the @entity20 - backed tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity
co-prosecutors filed a final submission in these cases and asked that the four be indicted and sent for trial , according to a statement from the prosecutors ' office
it 's not known when the court will make a decision .
