-- former @entity3 president @entity2 boycotted his war crimes trial again wednesday after judges rejected a delayed summary from his defense team , a court official said
@entity2 is the first @entity8 ruler to appear before an international war crimes tribunal
he is accused of fueling a bloody civil war in @entity3 and neighboring @entity11 that led to widespread murder , rapes and mutilation
the former president has pleaded not guilty to charges that include crimes against humanity and war crimes
his lawyers first walked out tuesday after a tribunal declined to accept their trial summary because it was filed after a january 14 deadline , a court spokesman said
his defense team walked out first , then @entity2 refused to return to the courtroom after a break , said @entity27 , a spokesman for the @entity29 court in the @entity30
" he indicated he was deeply upset and needed to rest , " @entity27 said
@entity2 did not attend the proceedings again wednesday , and the judge has adjourned the case until friday , the spokesman said
the boycott comes as prosecutors prepared to present their closing arguments
the verdict is expected this summer , @entity27 said
@entity2 is on trial at the @entity40 in the @entity29
@entity42 officials and the @entity11 government jointly set up a special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities
prosecutors allege that @entity2 , who was president of @entity3 from 1997 to 2003 , fueled the lengthy civil war , which killed tens of thousands , using riches from a diamond trade
the so - called blood diamonds are mined in war zones to support rebels and warlords
blood diamonds have fueled bloody conflicts in @entity8 for more than a decade
the trial has included testimony from supermodel @entity60 , who said that @entity2 gave her " dirty - looking " uncut diamonds as a gift
prosecutors were hoping her testimony would tie him to blood diamonds
last year , @entity66 said it expedited a $ 4.5 million grant because the court was facing a financial crisis
the @entity71 urged the international community to donate to the court before its financial resources run out
if found guilty , @entity2 will be sent to a prison in @entity76 , the spokesman said .
