days after @entity3 's @entity2 disintegrated above @entity4 , killing one of its co-pilots , @entity1 founder @entity0 says making commercial space travel a reality is worth the risks involved
the accident killed co-pilot @entity11 and injured co-pilot @entity12 , who managed to parachute to the ground
@entity0 paid tribute to @entity15 in an interview with @entity18 's @entity17 on monday
" he was an extremely brave man -- as all test pilots are , extremely brave people
he had a young family , he was married and his family loved him enormously , " @entity0 said
" but he was a test pilot , and test pilots are trying to discover things that 400 engineers and technicians on the ground ca n't necessarily see on the ground
and the test pilots push the aircraft to the limit before , finally , members of the traveling public are allowed on it
" asked if , in light of friday 's accident , he stood by his comment to @entity17 on the space program last year that " unless you risk something , the world stands still , " @entity0 told her that he did
" yes , the risk is worth it , " he said
" @entity46 would have been the first to say that
i 'm sure his parents and his wife and his sisters would not say that , but test pilots would say that , because the risk they 're taking , they know the importance of what they 're doing , " he said
" we 've got to go through the difficult testing stage of creating a space line in order to make it safe for travelers who want to travel on that space line in the years ahead , and we will persevere and we will succeed
" what caused the crash ? @entity2 disintegrated just two minutes after separating from the jet - powered aircraft that carried it aloft friday
at the time , the space plane was about 45,000 feet above the ground and about 20 miles northeast of @entity69 , @entity4
a team of 13 to 15 investigators from the @entity72 will be in the @entity73 for about a week
but analyzing the data from the test aircraft will take much longer , and the investigation may take up to a year
opinion : the truth about launching spaceships @entity0 warned against speculating before the board releases its findings
" the @entity83 press have , i think rather irresponsibly , speculated that it might 've been rockets exploding , it might have been fuel tanks exploding , in fact there might have been an explosion
" the @entity72 have firmly ruled all that out and have made it clear that they 're coming down to one particular thing that they think might have happened
but if you do n't mind , i 'm going to leave it to the @entity72 to let you know exactly what it is they think happened , and then we 'll wait for their definitive decision , " he told @entity17
friday 's flight was the first to use a new plastic - based fuel , something that @entity18 aviation analyst @entity107 has said could have affected the plane 's stability , despite the fuel tanks being found intact
@entity107 said that @entity3 had " consistently underestimated the risk involved
" @entity0 denied this , saying that 400 " of the best engineers in the world " were working on the project and that the risks were similar to those taken by people flying across the @entity118 in the 1920s and ' 30s
' feathering ' on sunday , the @entity72 revealed two clues about what went wrong , both involving the spacecraft 's " feathering , " a process used to stabilize and slow the spacecraft down toward @entity129
during feathering , two pieces on the back of the vehicle -- the " feathers " -- lift up perpendicular to the spaceship , making the vehicle look like it 's arching its back as it descends
but on friday , " the feather lock - unlock lever was moved by the co-pilot from the locked position to the unlocked position " prematurely , the @entity72 said
on top of that , the feathers are n't supposed to move until a separate feathering handle is activated
no one adjusted that handle ; yet the feathers were still deployed , @entity72 acting chairman @entity146 said
but @entity146 stressed that it was unclear whether pilot error , mechanical problems or another possibility caused the spacecraft to break apart in the air
" we are still a long way from finding a cause , " @entity146 said
" we are months and months away
" despite a debris field spanning 5 miles , investigators have found almost all the parts of the spacecraft needed for the investigation , @entity146 said
@entity163 may take up to a year veteran pilot killed a memorial fund has been set up for @entity11 's family
he worked at @entity167 , the company that partnered with @entity1 on the test flight program , and logged more than 1,600 hours as a test pilot and test engineer in @entity167 aircraft
analysis : will space accidents deter pioneer tourists ? @entity167 said sunday that co-pilot @entity12 -- the company 's director of flight operations -- was alert and speaking with family and doctors
" we remain focused on supporting the families of the two pilots and all of our employees , as well as the agencies investigating the accident , " @entity167 said
@entity72 investigators have yet to interview @entity12
" we have not because doctors did not recommend we do an interview at this stage , " @entity146 said
@entity2 helmed by experienced pilots when flight failed future of the program for years , @entity3 had planned to sell trips in which @entity2 would transport passengers about 62 miles above @entity129 -- the beginning of outer space -- and let them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to the ground
@entity3 planned to send paying customers on @entity2 as early as next year and has sold more than 700 tickets , each costing more than $ 250,000 , for future flights
deadly day for space tourism -- but future ' rests ' on such days , official says several celebrities have already signed up , including @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209
friday 's tragedy was not the first fatal accident to hit the @entity3 space program
in 2007 , three employees of @entity167 were killed during testing in the @entity73
sources told @entity18 that they had been testing components of a new rocket motor for @entity2 .
