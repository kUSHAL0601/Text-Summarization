-- it must be a bomb
that was @entity5 's first thought when she heard the boom as she lay in bed overnight saturday in her home on @entity10 ' @entity9
downstairs , she found a ceiling fan plunged to the floor , glass shattered , and the deadbolt of her front door blown open -- not even knowing then her garage doors had been blown in
only later did @entity18 and her husband @entity19 learn that , among their neighbors , they were some of the lucky ones
a huge explosion had pierced the nighttime silence and ripped through the streets before characterized by solid two - story homes , garages and lawns
two adults were killed , while seven others went to area hospitals , due to the explosion and related fires , said deputy chief @entity34 of the @entity35
aerial video showed the significant material cost as well , with only the foundations remaining of some homes , others left charred , and dozens more homes like the @entity43 ' suffering damage of all different sorts
" the house felt like it was shaking , your chest was shaking , " @entity18 told @entity0 affiliate @entity45
" it 's like nothing that you 've ever experienced
" fire department spokeswoman @entity52 said early sunday that two houses sitting next to one another blew up
but hours later , authorities still had n't determined , publicly at least , why they did
@entity57 spokesman @entity56 said sunday there were no reports of gas smells prior to the blast
while the personal and physical toll was enormous , some officials are counting their blessings and crediting the prompt , extensive response from public safety authorities -- plus the good fortune that some locals were away for the night -- with preventing even more bloodshed
" it was a massive explosion , " said @entity69 , the city 's director of public safety
" ... but it could have been much worse
" soon after it happened , first responders swarmed on the area -- some of them in shorts and tennis shoes , having apparently rushed to the scene right away , said @entity69
at one point , 60 to 70 firefighters were on site to control blazes and prevent more , according to @entity34
their other primary duty was to round up residents , as crews " did at least a primary , secondary and tertiary search of every home " to clear people out , he said
about 200 neighbors eventually made their way to nearby @entity93 , where doctors and paramedics checked each one , said @entity34
@entity18 described the predominant feeling among her neighbors as sorrow
" people are just ... in shock , because it is such a surreal thing , " she said
after the sun rose sunday morning , the devastation became more stark and painful
authorities went door to door at 126 properties in the neighborhood , dividing them into a few simple categories : " ok " for those with cosmetic and survivable damage , other designations for those with an uncertain future , or those that were a lost cause
eighty homes were somehow affected , said @entity118 , the deputy code enforcement director for the city , causing an estimated $ 3.6 million in damage
most of these had minor damage , in the form of broken glass , torn - off siding or garage door damage , that did n't make their homes uninhabitable
another 31 suffered what @entity118 called " major damage " -- meaning , for most of them , it 's still to be determined if they can be lived in again
inspectors know for sure that five can not , as they are " either gone or will require a demolition
" @entity69 said he expects authorities will discover more damage , and residents will have to deal with more headaches and heartache in the coming weeks
handing out his cell phone number to those affected , he promised them they would n't be alone
" we understand that their lives are upside down , " @entity69 said
" we 're going to do everything we can to help ( re- ) establish their lives , and go forward
" @entity0 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .
