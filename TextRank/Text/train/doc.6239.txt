@entity0 will be back on the prowl in 2015 -- and that 's according to the man himself
@entity6 says it is an " incredible relief " to be over his injury problems and is now concentrating on adding to his 14 major titles next year
woods , who turns 39 on december 30 , failed to make the cut at the @entity13 @entity12 in august after struggling to retain full fitness following surgery on a pinched nerve in his back earlier in the year
the @entity13 star made a return to action earlier in december at the @entity22 , the tournament he hosts every year at his home course of @entity24 in @entity25
but the former @entity26 was unable to finish after being physically ill during his third round , leaving him joint last
writing on his end of year blog , @entity6 said : " i 'm mostly excited about being healthy again
i 've struggled for the past year - and - half with my back , and it showed in my results
" even though i won five times two years ago , it was hit or miss some weeks and got progressively worse
now that it feels healthy , strong and stable , it 's fun to be able to play with my kids again , to play soccer and run around with them , shoot hoops ... things that i used to do and took for granted
" for anybody who has ever had a bad back with nerve damage , it 's downright debilitating
to not feel that is finally just incredible relief
" woods , who won the last of his major titles in 2008 , will spend the holiday season with his children and partner , @entity53
ski star @entity53 , who missed out on equaling the all - time record for the number of @entity57 race wins last weekend , has had injury problems of her own
@entity53 was forced to undergo knee surgery earlier this year and missed out on defending her @entity62 downhill crown at the @entity64
speaking to @entity1 earlier this year , @entity53 revealed how @entity6 had played a key role in helping her through a difficult time when he too was struggling for fitness
" @entity6 and i both went through rehab with our injuries at a similar time , so we were both in the gym together and pushing each other and motivating each other , both frustrated , " @entity53 told @entity1 's @entity69 last month
" i think we both helped each other a lot through that time , and i drew a lot of inspiration from him and i think he does the same with me
" we continue to push each other and it 's a really positive relationship in that way
