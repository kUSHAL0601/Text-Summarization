@entity0 -- @entity2 's has become the first international fine art auction house to receive a licence to operate independently in mainland @entity5 , giving it an edge in the race among dealers and auctioneers to unlock the potential of the @entity5 market
the 247 - year - old auction house , with sale rooms in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity0 and @entity17 , announced on tuesday that it plans to hold auctions in @entity19 starting this autumn
@entity2 's opened an office in @entity19 in 1994 and has held auctions with local firm forever
" the market for arts and objects in @entity5 has grown exponentially over the past decade
there are more new buyers coming into play in @entity5 than any other market in the world , " @entity27 , @entity2 's chief executive , told the @entity1
" to be in mainland @entity5 and serve those clients directly
has been a dream of ours for quite some time
" in the past five years , the @entity5 art market ranked as the fastest - growing in the world , as well as the most important emerging market in terms of the size of its domestic sales , according to a report by @entity44
after briefly overtaking the @entity46 as the largest market in the world in 2011 with 30 per cent market share , @entity5 slipped to the number two slot in 2012 behind the @entity46 with 25 per cent market share following a slowdown in growth
rival @entity53 's this week closed its five days of sales in wine , jewellery , @entity58 and @entity5 art , ceramics and watches , which were watched closely following slow economic growth in 2012 and a crackdown on extravagant spending by officials
an imperial bowl broke a world record for @entity68 ceramics , selling for $ 9.5m
@entity2 's said that the number of clients from mainland @entity5 bidding at its global auctions has doubled since 2008
" the demand still is there because the number of clients being served is increasing
that is why we wanted to be in @entity5 with a home for @entity2 , to serve those clients entering the market , " mr @entity27 said
the agreement restricts @entity2 's from selling cultural relics , which predate 1911 , such as valuable classical paintings and antiques
@entity2 's ignited controversy in @entity5 with the attempted sale in 2009 of two bronze sculptures of animal heads from the @entity86 in @entity87 that were part of the late @entity90 's collection
mr @entity27 said the incident did not enter the discussion
both @entity2 's and @entity53 's have operated out of @entity17 for several years , where a large portion of the items are sold to mainland @entity5 collectors
in mainland @entity5 , @entity53 's has a deal with @entity97 to conduct sales in the country
@entity2 's total sales in @entity58 were $ 715.1m in 2012
the granting of a licence to @entity2 signals a determination in @entity5 to continue to open up to international businesses
this week , @entity105 , @entity5 's president , promised to protect global companies ' interests amid concerns about discriminatory policies that hurt their operations in @entity5
