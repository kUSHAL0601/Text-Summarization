oh , that pesky history of ours
why not just take a big ole ' eraser to it ? smudge out the ugly parts
that 's essentially what some @entity9 lawmakers aimed to do this week
you may have read about it : an education committee in my home state -- a place with plenty of historical blemishes and oodles of modern - day screw - ups -- actually approved a bill that would rewrite advanced placement @entity23 history classes , potentially eliminating them
the cause ? they paint @entity23 in too negative a light
to get a full sense of how ludicrous this proposal is , you need to hear straight from its sponsor , @entity32 , a @entity33 state representative from a suburb of @entity35
" in essence , we have a new emphasis on what is bad about @entity23 , " @entity32 said in a committee hearing , according to a @entity0 report
" ( the new framework ) trades an emphasis on @entity23 's founding principles of constitutional government in favor of robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people , where the emphasis on instruction is of @entity23 as a nation of oppressors and exploiters
" @entity32 's bill , as it was proposed , bars state money from going to @entity62 @entity23 history courses , according to @entity0
it also requires the replacement class to cover a number of " founding documents of the @entity23 that contributed to the foundation or maintenance of the representative form of limited government , the free - market economic system and @entity23 exceptionalism
" oh , and speeches by @entity74 and @entity75
sense a political slant there ? nah
the proposal is a major sideshow in a state with some serious educational failings
@entity83 ranked @entity9 's educational system 48th out of the 50 states and @entity86 , " with an overall score of 67.6 out of 100 points and a grade of d - plus
" a d - plus ! @entity92 - rah ! better cut back on those think - y classes
the state 's teachers make , on average , about $ 44,000 per year , according to the @entity96 , which uses stats from the 2012 - 2013 school year
the national average is more than $ 56,000
@entity32 could use his time to focus on either of these issues -- poor educational performance or low teacher pay -- instead of distracting all of us with this heap of revisionist , partisan nonsense
the @entity62 history bill itself is being rewritten , the @entity107 reported on wednesday
and @entity32 apparently has backed off wanting to kill @entity62 @entity23 history altogether
but , i 'm sorry
that 's almost beside the point
what bothers me is that @entity32 had the gall to propose something so ludicrous in the first place
doing so makes my home state -- a place i 'm immensely proud of -- look ridiculous
it wastes my time and yours
and , more to the point , it flies arrogantly in the face of history
@entity23 history -- despite what @entity32 or those @entity33 at the @entity127 might say -- is anything but crisp , clean and " exceptional
" this is one of the greatest countries on @entity132 , to be sure
we have freedoms of speech and religion that are unmatched worldwide
but we are not perfect
we have to acknowledge that
it 's the only way we can move forward
the only way we prevent history from repeating itself
@entity9 -- @entity32 and his fringe cohorts aside -- has proven to be good at this
@entity35 was the site of one of the worst terror attacks in this country 's history , the 1995 bombing of the @entity150
an @entity23 , @entity151 , was executed for that crime
now , the city has a beautiful memorial in tribute to the victims of that tragedy
it has a museum decrying hate
it cherishes the " survivor tree , " a beautiful @entity163 , which withstood that 1995 blast and now serves as a symbol of the city 's and the state 's resilience in the face of hardship
you ca n't erase those memories , and @entity173 would n't want to
the same goes for the " robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people " that the @entity9 rep seems so bothered by
this is a country that remains ensnared by all those things
we ca n't close our eyes and plug our ears
we 're still tangled in the awful legacy of slavery and the racism that 's followed
the @entity192 marched @entity193 into present day @entity9 , and it 's not such a distant cultural memory , especially there
nationwide , women still are n't paid as much as men for the same work
and there are still 13 states where gay and lesbian people are n't allowed to be married -- and 29 , including @entity9 , according to the @entity201 , where they can be fired because of their sexual orientation
these injustices are historic -- and they 're now
you 'd think we 'd get that
but apparently it bears repeating
so , i guess , does this : we have to learn from these mistakes in order to move forward
sweeping them aside in favor of preaching " exceptionalism " in the classroom is n't just ignorant -- it 's dangerous
instead of rewriting history we should learn from it
and write a better future .
