floating in the middle of the sea , the first thing we noticed was the vast expanse of tarmac , roughly the size of three soccer fields
and then we heard the loud blasting sound of fighter jets preparing to take off
this was one of the world 's most powerful warships , the @entity16 ' super carrier ' @entity18 @entity17 , which the @entity11 crew and members of other media organizations were granted a rare opportunity to visit this weekend
after climbing up the equivalent of an eight - story building , staircase after staircase , one narrow hallway after another , we finally arrived at the " bridge , " an elevated tower containing the command control center on the aircraft carrier
the @entity35 nuclear - powered carrier was in the waters off the @entity37 for a routine patrol mission , which followed a trilateral " search and rescue " drill between the @entity35 , @entity40 and @entity41
the drill drew harsh rhetoric from @entity44 earlier last week , warning the @entity35 of a " horrible disaster " and claimed that its troops are on high alert to promptly cope with " blatant provocations
" standing on the flight deck of the @entity18 @entity17 , i realized @entity44 probably had good reason to be on edge
the @entity18 @entity17 can carry about 80 aircraft , launch tactical fighter jets towards any location and is equipped with various types of missiles
known as a " floating military base " , it can also accommodate more than 6,000 crew , serve 18,000 meals per day and even has live broadcast television on the vessel
back on the bridge , we saw fighter jets take off one after another at an impressive pace
this , i was told , was the work of a deck catapult , which slings the fighter jet forward , generating enormous speed
ending the tour , we strapped ourselves into a propeller - powered , windowless plane
after a roaring sound , the plane took off at an enormous speed , faster than any roller coaster ride i had been on
