more than five years after he resigned in disgrace over a prostitution scandal , former @entity1 gov. @entity0 and @entity2 are splitting up
" we regret that our marital relationship has come to an end , and we have agreed not to make any other public statement on this subject , " @entity0 spokeswoman @entity5 said in a statement released on behalf of the couple tuesday
@entity13 would n't comment on whether they had filed for divorce or were still in the process of divorcing
on the campaign trail over the summer during his failed bid for @entity20 comptroller , @entity0 shot down rumors that he and his wife had separated
but @entity2 , who famously stood by her husband in the aftermath of the 2008 prostitution scandal , was n't seen hitting the trail in his bid for a political comeback this year
" i think it 's fair to say that i 'm running for office , no other member of my family is running for office , and i think the public 's going to judge me , not who else is with me or not with me , " @entity0 told reporters in july
he lost his bid for comptroller in september 's @entity40 primary .
