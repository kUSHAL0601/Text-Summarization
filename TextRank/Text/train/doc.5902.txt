-- at least two people have matched the winning numbers in tuesday night 's $ 636 million @entity4 jackpot
one winning ticket was sold in @entity7 , and the other was sold in @entity9 , lottery officials said
the winning numbers were 8 , 14 , 17 , 20 and 39 , with a megaball of 7
strong sales boosted the jackpot to $ 636 million from the previous estimate of $ 586 million , lottery officials announced late tuesday morning
that 's tantalizingly close to the @entity17 record -- a $ 656 million @entity4 jackpot split by three winning tickets in march 2012
this jackpot was so large in part because @entity4 , in a sense , became tougher to win
the prize rises with each miss , and no one has won it since organizers increased the pool of numbers to choose from -- making astronomical odds even longer -- back in october
no lotteries in these 7 states in @entity34 , $ 8,000 worth of tickets were sold every minute from 9 to 10 a.m. tuesday , @entity0 affiliate @entity35 reported , citing lottery officials
@entity4 tickets go for $ 1 each , though buyers choose to pay an additional $ 1 for the @entity4 option , which could multiply lesser , non-jackpot winning prizes
a lottery player in the @entity43 joked the jackpot would n't change his life
" it would just change my vocabulary
i would say , ' i quit ' ( my job ) , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity49 of @entity50 on tuesday morning at a gas station in the @entity43 's @entity53 neighborhood
at @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , a clerk told @entity0 affiliate @entity59 that @entity4 sales were brisk tuesday -- she 'd gone through four rolls of ticket paper by noon
one player there , @entity63 , said he 'd like to use the jackpot to escape snowy @entity58 for a warm vacation
but he 'd also share with his large family
" my mother had 19 of us , and that is a big family , and 14 are still living , " he told @entity59
the chance of winning -- never particularly bright -- got worse in late october , when @entity4 increased the drawing 's pool of numbers
the odds of hitting the jackpot , which were 1 in 176 million , are now 1 in 259 million
you have more than 1,000 times better chance of an asteroid or comet killing you -- and that 's using the longest estimated odds for the celestial bodies -- according to @entity85
" winning the @entity4 is akin to getting struck by lightning at the same time you 're being eaten by a shark , " @entity86 , founder of @entity87 , told @entity0
previously , lottery players chose five numbers , ranging from 1 to 56
it 's now 1 to 75 , but the sixth , gold ball has fewer numbers from which to choose , as the pool decreased from 46 to 15
@entity4 tickets are sold in 43 states -- all but @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 -- plus the @entity106 and the @entity107
@entity0 's @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .
