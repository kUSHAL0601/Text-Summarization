-- one of the most watched cases in @entity2 in the last few decades reached a conclusion of sorts on august 20th as @entity5 was declared guilty of murder and sentenced to death with a two - year suspension , meaning an almost certain commutation
the one - day trial of @entity5 on august 9th was , quite literally , a spectacle : something meant to be watched
( but not recorded , apparently , except by approval , even pencils were confiscated from the pre-selected audience
) @entity5 , the wife of the fallen high - ranking @entity2 politician @entity16 , had been charged in the death of @entity18 , a @entity19 businessman
@entity5 confessed to poisoning @entity18 , allegedly because he threatened her son following a botched business deal
the case has caught the attention of many because of the prominent status of the defendant and its steamy mix of allegations of murder , corruption , and even sex
but does it tell us anything new or interesting about the @entity2 legal system ? i think not
@entity2 's legal system is heavily politicized
the @entity38 controls key appointments through a nontransparent process
judges have no security of tenure and can be dismissed at any time
courts must answer to local governments , who hold the purse strings and pay judges ' salaries
the court president , typically an official who hears no cases , can effectively dictate the decision in any case , whatever the judges who heard the case might think
and while there 's no doubt that in many cases politicians do n't interfere -- who has the time ? -- the system as a whole does not give courts and judges the resources to resist orders from senior politicians when they do come
few doubt that those orders have come in the @entity5 case , in all likelihood from the summit of political power in @entity2 , the @entity73 of the @entity38 's @entity74
before his fall , @entity5 's husband seemed headed for the @entity73 himself
this makes the case too politically important to be left to chance , that is , to the whims of a judge deciding on the basis of evidence presented in court
certain questions must be avoided : what did @entity16 know and when ? can powerful politicians in @entity2 cover up a murder ? as for @entity5 's sentence , that too could n't be left to chance
@entity16 may be in disgrace , but he was still a high flyer before his descent
the @entity96 leadership has established a solid tradition of not killing losers in political fights , and it 's in the interest of everyone to extend that protection at least as far as spouses
@entity5 's suspended death sentence was widely predicted and comes as no surprise at all ; such sentences are virtually always commuted to life imprisonment after two years , and can ultimately be reduced down to as little as fifteen years following commutation
timeline : @entity16 's fall from grace given all of this , most @entity2 - watchers assume that proceedings in this case have been tightly controlled to ensure that only the officially approved narrative emerges
they assume that the verdict was decided in @entity117 before the opening gavel sounded , and that the proceedings were merely a performance for the benefit of the public , a kind of judicial shakespeare - in - the - park , but without the drama
that 's the conventional wisdom
and at times like this , it 's the job of the think - outside - the - box expert to explain why the conventional wisdom is wrong
in fact , the trial is as predictable as it is banal
if anything is surprising , it 's the degree to which it utterly fails to upset our assumptions about how @entity2 politics and the legal system work
a criminal trial , for example , is normally at the place of the crime or where the defendant lives
but @entity5 's trial took place in @entity148
we all know the reason : too many possible sympathizers in @entity152
the decision to have it in @entity148 was political , not legal
@entity5 seems to have tried to hire a lawyer experienced in defending anti-corruption cases , as is her right under @entity2 law
but one account of the trial says the government vetoed her choice , and she had to be represented by a local lawyer with no known experience in criminal law
@entity2 law generally requires trials to be public , and the official report of the proceedings ritualistically invoked the term " public trial " to describe the proceedings
but they were in no sense public : the audience was carefully selected
the real lesson in this case , then , is twofold
first , it offers us no reason to change our understanding of the @entity2 legal system as directly subservient to politics when sufficiently powerful politicians choose to get involved
second , it reflects the cynicism that seems so pervasive in @entity2 society
nobody i know , @entity2 or foreign , with the remotest knowledge of the @entity2 legal system thinks that anything of importance will be decided as a result of what went on at the @entity5 trial
those who were waiting for a sign of fundamental change in the system will have to keep waiting
