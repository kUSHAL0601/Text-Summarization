@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 ended their magnificent @entity4 campaign as they started it , stunning hosts @entity1 in their own back yard with a sensational performance to claim the tournament 's bronze medal with a 34 - 10 victory
@entity2 players celebrate another try on their way to a stunning 34 - 10 victory over @entity1
the result , secured thanks to @entity17 tries by @entity18 and @entity19 in the first half and @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity18 again in the second , brought back memories of the shock 17 - 12 win earned by the @entity26 on the tournament 's opening night
that @entity1 triumph was built around sturdy defense and although they showed the same resolve here at the @entity35 , their attacking edge came to the fore this time
the tries by @entity21 and @entity22 were especially memorable , and helped earn the @entity38 a record success over the @entity40
@entity18 added three conversions and a penalty to give himself a 19 - point personal haul for the night , while @entity44 could only manage a try from @entity46 -- converted by @entity47 -- and a @entity49 penalty
it was a disappointing way for their head coach @entity51 to depart -- he takes up a post in the @entity40 government now -- but departing @entity17 coach @entity55 , who is off to @entity56 , was all smiles at the final whistle
with the pressure off , the shackles were well and truly removed from the hosts , who were the more fired - up of the two sides throughout
indeed , they bossed the majority of a fiery opening 40 minutes , but somehow found themselves 17 - 3 behind going into the break
@entity44 , throwing the ball around like the country 's teams of old , had a try disallowed in the 10th minute when @entity73 was adjudged to have passed forward prior to @entity49 touching down
the likes of @entity75 and @entity76 were finding gaps in the @entity17 defence but all they had to show from a dominant opening 20 minutes was an @entity49 penalty , for @entity82 's hands in the ruck
their lack of cutting edge was ruthlessly punished by @entity2 , who scored two tries in four minutes around the half - hour mark
@entity18 , who had levelled matters with a 22nd - minute penalty , was the first player to go over , running onto a delayed @entity93 pass to force himself over in the left corner
then , after @entity95 had crashed a drop goal against the post , the @entity17 retook possession and prop @entity19 was there at the bottom of a pile of bodies to ground
the try needed the say - so of the video referee and @entity18 -- like he had after his own try -- added the extras for 17 - 3
it was a bizarre scoreline , given @entity1 's dominance of the early possession
even when they were encamped on @entity2 's line in the last five minutes of the first half , the hosts still could not break through their opponents ' obdurate rearguard
@entity75 came closest to scoring in the second minute of injury time , but dropped the ball as he was attempting to ground
the half ended with @entity119 and @entity120 receiving yellow cards after another heated exchange , but the start of the second period was engagingly open
@entity1 needed to score first to make a game of it but they were hit by @entity21 's sucker punch in the 53rd minute
and what a try it was
@entity131 's chip - and - chase was fielded by @entity18 before @entity22 set off on a magnificent 50 - yard winding run
the ball was fired out to the right -- through the hands of @entity136 and @entity95 -- to @entity21 , who jinked inside @entity76 to ground
@entity18 missed the conversion but the @entity1 supporters were already whistling with their team 22 - 3 down
@entity142 was brought on for the final 20 minutes , and almost immediately he was floored by a late hit by @entity144
it earned the @entity147 flanker a yellow card , but @entity2 made light of their numerical deficit by running in a sensational fourth try
off turnover ball , @entity152 was set clear down the left
his inside pass was taken by @entity22 and just as he did in the opening game of the tournament , he scorched past the covering defense to dive over in the corner
the try @entity1 deserved came in the 69th minute , the recalled @entity46 easing over in the left corner following an initial harinordoquy break
the night belonged to the @entity17 , though , and @entity18 rounded things off with his second try of the night with three minutes left to add insult to injury for the @entity40
