-- @entity2 president @entity1 has refused to be drawn over speculation on the future of @entity5 at the legendary @entity7 marque
while @entity2 driver @entity14 leads the standings after six races with 73 points , his @entity9 teammate @entity5 , whose contract with the @entity12 team runs until the end of 2012 , is back in 14th place having picked up just 10 points this season
@entity5 has struggled for form after fracturing his skull during qualifying at the @entity24 @entity23 in 2009
" in this moment my concentration is everywhere except the drivers , " @entity25 told @entity0 in answer to a question whether @entity2 were looking at new drivers
" it 's too early in the season and we will see after that
" @entity14 : @entity7 runs risk of losing credibility however the @entity2 chief did make a point of praising @entity5 's performance at the @entity40 when the @entity9 finished sixth
" i 'm pleased to see @entity5 did a very good race weekend in @entity42 , " said @entity1
" because the more the car has improved , the less difficult it is to drive and good for @entity5
i count on him to take off points for @entity14 's competitors
" by way of contrast the @entity2 president was fulsome in his praise of @entity14
" i think i have the best driver in the world that is @entity14 , said @entity25
" @entity14 , particularly in the races has been fantastic and i like his attitude to work very closely with the team as @entity57 was able to do
" @entity14 is a driver with attention to the details but most of all what i like about him is that he is always positive - even in the difficult moments he is always positive
this is very important for the psychological attitude and psychological reaction of the team , this is what i like the most
" the scenario of the @entity2 leading the drivers ' standings after six races seemed unlikely at the start of this season , when @entity14 and his @entity12 team publicly doubted the race pace of the two ferraris
" now we are in the lead of the championship , it 's only up to us to win the championship , " added @entity1
" so each of us has to look at the pole position of our jobs , to be perfect , to improve , to look inside ourselves what we can do to improve because in a competition in which you can win or lose for half of a tenth of a second - you have to perfect , in the start and in the pit stop
