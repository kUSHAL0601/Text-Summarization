-- i stood up and began talking on the floor of the @entity3 not long ago because i hoped the @entity4 in power would listen to how their latest cruel health care proposal would hurt the women of @entity8
simply put , this bill would take away access to the most fundamental form of health care women need
it would close down almost 90 % of the women 's clinics in this state
this comes after more than 50 women 's health clinics providing cancer screening and family planning services were closed because the @entity4 withdrew state - financed support from them
under this draconian proposal , a state as expansive as @entity8 would have only five clinics remaining to serve thousands and thousands of women
@entity29 do n't want any woman to die of cancer because she ca n't get decent health care or medical advice
@entity29 do n't want any woman to lose control of her life because she ca n't get birth control
during the filibuster , women around the state related thousands of personal stories to me : one young woman said contraceptives gave her a chance to choose motherhood when she was ready
women were helped by a clinic with the difficult and highly personal decision to end a pregnancy
another woman said a clinic had helped comfort her when a much - wanted baby was dying inside her
the " people 's filibuster " that put a temporary stop on the misguided bill that powerful @entity4 are still intent on ramming through will long be remembered as the moment when regular @entity29 -- real @entity29 -- stood up and said " enough " to the self - interested politicians who have run our state for too long
enough to using @entity8 as a political laboratory for testing far - right ideas
enough to using @entity8 as a workshop for fattening the wallets of their special interest friends and supporters
and enough of politicians listening only to each other , rather than real @entity29
there are important issues that desperately need the attention of the politicians who are -- at least for now -- in charge of our state
sadly , gov. @entity79 and his powerful allies do n't seem interested
they do n't identify with the strong @entity29 who live in the town of @entity84 , where an unregulated , unmonitored fertilizer plant blew up , taking lives and destroying livelihoods
because of a lack of state oversight , the small volunteer fire department that rushed to help did n't know the degree of danger they were facing
they paid with their lives
real @entity29 believe in looking out for each other
we believe in honoring our mothers and fathers and keeping our smallest residents -- our children -- healthy
the politicians in charge of @entity8 now clearly do n't
@entity79 has refused to even consider expanding health care coverage in @entity8 because he cares more about scoring political points than he does about our @entity8 families
@entity29 help when their neighbor is in need
@entity8 @entity4 political leaders take perverse pride in how deeply they have cut our state 's education budget
thousands of teachers have been pulled from classrooms , schools have closed and valuable programs have been canceled
in many places , districts are forced to choose between prekindergarten programs and @entity121 , algebra and art. real @entity29 want their kids to have the best education possible , not the one politicians looking to brag about budget cuts have left us with
my first filibuster , two years ago , was an attempt to protect our schools and our children from these reckless cuts
@entity4 leaders rewarded me for my efforts by removing me from the powerful @entity138
i had to fight unfair @entity4 redistricting efforts when they tried to make the district i represent disappear
now , @entity8 @entity142 legislators are fighting hard to pass an equal pay for equal work bill , something that is crucial to the many families that rely on income from dad and mom
but then real @entity29 have never been afraid of a good fight
that 's what happened at our @entity154 during the filibuster , when real @entity29 -- ultimately -- decided to make their voices heard
i have a question for @entity79 and the state 's powerful politicians who have ignored real @entity29 for so long : can you hear us now ? and , more important , are you listening ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .
