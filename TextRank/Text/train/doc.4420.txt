-- before releasing an album most bands would talk about record sales or concert dates
but for @entity7 band @entity6 the bigger talking point is whether they will get arrested
" only @entity11 because he writes the lyrics , " the band 's bassist @entity8 jokes , tapping the shoulder of his friend , the band 's lead singer @entity11
in a country currently polarized by politics the band are concerned some of the songs featured on " @entity20 " ( " @entity21 " ) could make them targets for the authorities
in another of the group 's songs entitled " @entity26 " ( " i want to explode " ) @entity28 sings : " a new order , just like the old one
and everything works with lying
i want to blow up the streets and roads
" according to the band the song reflects the daily frustration faced by @entity7 , such as stifling traffic , drug use and sexual harassment
" we have many fans that will get very angry if we did n't release these songs , " says @entity11 , who claims the band speaks the mind of many @entity7
in doing so they realize they could face censorship and defamation campaigns , similar to those faced by television satirist @entity52 who had his show cancelled last september after mocking supporters of @entity7 's military
he is now on air again with a different network
@entity6 performed three songs on the first of his new shows
sitting at the makeshift studio within @entity11 's family apartment in which the band recorded most of their songs for the past 10 years , they insist they are not political
" we talk about freedom , social rights , what we think will make a better place for all of us , " says guitarist @entity67
" a lot of people kind of mix that , that we have a political agenda
" after years of little success or recognition they rose to prominence through their participation in " @entity82 " ( " @entity83 " ) , a song recorded during the @entity85 sit - in in 2011
for the three years that followed they released other songs that also became anthems to @entity7 's revolution , urging @entity7 to " hold their ground " in " @entity93 " and in another yearning for " @entity95
" their concerts included free performances at political sit - ins
" the revolution is not politics
this is what we sing about
we did n't sing about politics , but we sing about basic human rights , " says @entity11
they have a committed and growing fan - base and when they released on @entity113 " @entity112 " ( " @entity114 " ) it gained 1 million views in two months
for the band the song symbolizes a clash of generations , which they think is the source of most of @entity7 's problems : an older generation holding on to an idea of stability and a younger one trying to shape the future it will live in
@entity11 's raspy vocals give the band 's music a unique sound , while they cultivate an unconventional image , riding high - powered " muscle " motorbikes in defiance of the terrible @entity137 traffic as an " escape from reality
" the band is honest about the potential violent consequence of taking a stand against deep - seated views , but they choose to remain optimistic
" this voice is like a turtle
( we ) work very slowly , but we never go back ... look at the past three years , regimes changed and we continued the revolution , " says @entity11
