-- @entity3 @entity2 gubernatorial candidate @entity1 took to @entity0 's @entity5 - language airwaves recently to deny accusations that a campaign ad he shot with @entity10 - @entity9 actress @entity8 is racist
the candidate , who is also a state assemblyman , touted his @entity13 wife as evidence that he 's not prejudiced
" if i am a racist , i 'm not a very good one , " @entity1 said thursday on @entity0 en @entity16 's " @entity17 " show
" i must have gone to the wrong school where you learn how to be a racist because i married a woman with dark skin
as a matter of fact , her skin 's darker than @entity8 's
" @entity29 agreed , saying , " @entity1 is married to a @entity13
his daughter - in - law is @entity31
he is not a racist and neither am i , as we are now being accused
" the three - minute video , released january 13 on @entity36 , has come under fire by some @entity38 and latino groups
in the video , @entity29 cradles a small , sweater - clad lapdog she calls @entity42 as she translates , and oftentimes reinterprets , @entity1 's views on a wide range of issues
at one point , @entity29 makes a somewhat crude allusion to @entity1 's boldness
in the ad , @entity1 says , " i want a gun in every @entity3 gun safe
i want the government out of our business and our bedroom
i want to bring the film industry back where she belongs , @entity59
" to which @entity29 responds , " @entity61 " meaning , " he has really big ones , and he 's angry
" the candidate said the exchanges are meant to be tongue - in - cheek , but to some @entity38 , who have taken to @entity69 to express their outrage , the spot comes across as bizarre and ridiculous and as a stereotypical attempt to connect with @entity73 voters
@entity29 , in particular , has drawn sharp criticism for endorsing a @entity76 favorite and immigration hard liner who in 2011 tried to gather enough signatures to repeal @entity3 's so - called @entity81 , a law that allows undocumented college students to use state financial aid programs
@entity1 also founded a local chapter in 2005 of the armed civilian border patrol group @entity87
in a series of tweets , @entity31 - @entity90 cartoonist and immigration activist @entity88 called @entity29 a vulgar @entity5 term for idiot or stupid
@entity95 , co-founder and producer for the @entity97 , an independent initiative dedicated to preserving the life stories of @entity90 's immigrant population , tweeted that he was shocked to see the @entity102 actress supporting the perceived anti-immigrant gubernatorial candidate
over the weekend , the 56 - year - old former beauty queen turned telenovela and @entity59 star said the resulting fallout forced her to resign from a @entity109 production of " @entity110
" " of course she has the right to say whatever she wants , " producer @entity111 told local @entity113 affiliate @entity112
" but ... doing what she is doing is against what we believe
" @entity29 , however , said on " @entity17 " that she firmly stands by her decision to support @entity1 for two reasons : @entity1 's proposed plan to create more jobs and his desire to raise the minimum wage to $ 20 an hour , something the candidate has said he would do by unleashing @entity3 's natural resources
" we ought to be fracking and drilling our way to prosperity rather than sitting on an ocean of oil and importing it from our enemies , " @entity1 told " @entity17 " anchor @entity129 , noting what occurred in @entity131
in that state , @entity140 's restaurants offered employees about $ 15 an hour , plus signing bonuses after the discovery of the @entity144 in 2006 , which boosted the economy and led to a labor shortage
as to @entity1 's stance on immigration , @entity29 offers a few explanations
" after 9/11 , he told me that he organized a group of civilians to go protect the border from the invasion , not of @entity31 , " @entity29 said
" a lot of @entity157 and drugs enter through the @entity31 border , so what he did was protect us from the people who wanted to come attack us
" @entity29 also said @entity1 " today supports the idea of helping immigrant children who came to the @entity90 at the age of 3 or 5 with their college education
" however , @entity1 said in the " @entity17 " interview that the @entity81 " is an open - ended entitlement that will invite and incentive more people to come here illegally
... i 'm not upset at people for coming here
i 'm mad at my government for inviting people to come the most dangerous way possible and putting their lives at risk
" a spokesman for @entity3 @entity180 gov. @entity179 dismissed @entity1 's campaign ad
" what this video lacks in terms of logic and sanity , they make up for it in pure entertainment value , " said @entity182 , a political strategist and adviser to @entity179
even some fellow republicans have taken issue with @entity1 's latest spot
in a statement , @entity195 Â© @entity197 , a @entity73 group , said the ad is so bad it 's almost laughable
and , the group said , rather than appeal to @entity73 , the ad insults their intelligence
" @entity8 is no doubt a great actress , but as we 've seen time and time again , movie stars often lack common sense , " the group said in a release
the actress is known to be politically provocative
she is an outspoken critic of former @entity10 leader @entity209 and of deceased @entity9 president @entity210 , whom she once described as a @entity212 - like dictator and upon his death said she was not sad about his departure but that " ideally he would be alive with cancer , in jail
" but this endorsement surprised many people , leading some to wonder whether she was paid to support @entity1
the actress said she was not
the pair has found some support on social media , where some people have tweeted that @entity29 should not be attacked but should be free to exercise her @entity226 right to free speech
however , the overwhelming sense among @entity38 appears to be that invoking ethnic stereotypes and vehemently opposing immigration reform might not be the best strategy to win the governorship of a state where about 38 % of its residents are @entity73 .
