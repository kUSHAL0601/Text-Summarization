-- a faulty monitoring system on a gasoline tank at a @entity4 storage facility most likely led to a massive fire in october that damaged homes and businesses more than a mile away , federal investigators said tuesday
a storage tank at the @entity13 facility in @entity14 , near @entity15 , was being filled with gasoline from a ship docked in @entity15 harbor when the tank apparently overflowed , @entity10 investigators said at a news conference
" gasoline spilled from the tank without detection ; as the material spilled , it vaporized and spread across the facility , " the agency said in a release
" @entity10 investigators estimate that the vapor cloud spread to a 2,000 - foot diameter until it reached an ignition source in the northwest section of the facility
" the liquid level in the tank could not be determined because the facility 's computerized monitoring system was not fully operational , the @entity10 investigators said
to monitor the level in the tank , operators used a mechanical gauge on the tank 's exterior wall , the investigators said
as the gasoline level in the tank rose and eventually overflowed , employees in the facility 's control room were not aware of the situation
" the filling of a tank without a functioning monitoring system is the type of activity the @entity10 will be examining very closely , " said lead investigator @entity49
" the @entity10 's investigation will examine operations particular to @entity13 , but will also look at the regulations and best practices surrounding the industry as a whole in an effort to improve safety practices at similar facilities
" the fire , which started at 12:23 a.m. on october 23 , burned for three days
there were no fatalities , but thousands of residents were forced to evacuate to avoid the thick clouds of black smoke
the @entity70 has determined that the explosion was an industrial accident , said agent @entity73 of the @entity15 office
" it was not a terrorist act or an act of sabotage , " he said
he said the @entity70 had determined that graffiti found on two @entity15 tunnels that referred to a fire were not painted by anyone with connection to the blaze
the spray - painted message on the tunnels , less than three miles apart , said : " boom , fire , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92
" @entity13 owns the @entity90 brand in @entity4
nonetheless , @entity73 said , the @entity70 and the @entity94 were still investigating
@entity13 supplies a significant portion of @entity4 's petroleum products
the facility includes a tank farm and refinery that was shut down in 2000
before the fire , the tank farm stored gasoline , diesel fuel , jet fuel and fuel oil in about 30 aboveground tanks
the @entity10 is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents
@entity10 investigators look into all aspects of chemical accidents , including physical causes such as equipment failure , as well as inadequacies in regulations , industry standards and safety management systems
the board , which is appointed by the president and confirmed by the @entity118 , does not issue citations or fines
the board does make safety recommendations to plants , industry organizations , labor groups and regulatory agencies such as the @entity127 and the @entity128
@entity0 's @entity129 contributed to this report .
