-- @entity2 's hotel promises her a refund for her nonrefundable hotel room after a hurricane strikes
but months later , there 's no sign of the money and the hotel has gone into radio silence
should she kiss the money goodbye ? a guest 's hotel promised her a refund , but she has n't received anything
q : i think that you may be my only hope ! my father and i were supposed to meet in @entity20 before a conference
lucky for us , the weekend that we were to be in @entity20 was the same weekend @entity22 plowed through @entity25
after experiencing @entity26 just two weeks prior in @entity27 , i was not very keen on going for round two
my flight was canceled , anyway
we had made reservations at the @entity31 on the @entity32 for the weekend
the rate was pre-paid and nonrefundable , which at the time of booking was fine
however , when we saw where the hurricane was headed , we called to cancel our reservations independently
after some discussion about the storm , the hotel told us both independently that , due to the extreme circumstances , we would receive refunds
i have an e-mail from the hotel regarding my " refund
" despite numerous e-mails to the hotel over many months , we 've received nothing
any assistance that you can offer me would be greatly appreciated
-- @entity2 , @entity27 , @entity52 a : i think @entity31 owes you a refund
not because of the hurricane , or because it was the right thing to do ( although both are true ) but because a hotel representative promised one in writing
if you had disputed the hotel charge on your credit card -- which would have been one of your options -- then the e-mail from your hotel is almost like money in the bank
during a dispute , a hotel may counter that by citing its nonrefundability policy , but from your credit card 's perspective , a written statement from the property that it agrees to override its rule is compelling evidence in your favor
many resorts offer hurricane guarantees that give guests a no - questions - asked refund when a storm is on the way
@entity31 was n't one of those hotels as far as i can tell , but the commonly accepted practice in the travel industry is to not hold a customer accountable for a trip that ca n't be taken because of circumstances beyond his or her control
( remember , we let travel companies off the hook when they ca n't operate a plane because of bad weather or a hotel shuts down during a flood -- it 's only fair that they should do the same thing for us
) it looks as if you limited your correspondence to the hotel
in a situation like this , it 's useful to begin with a brief , polite e-mail to the corporate guest - relations section on its web site
many hotels pass these complaints along to the hotel and may fine it if the grievances are n't resolved quickly
however , dealing with the hotel directly puts it under no such pressure and it may feel as if it can ignore your repeated requests
next time you reserve a room during hurricane season , consider one that 's refundable
and if not , then at least consider taking out a travel insurance policy that would cover you if a hurricane hit your hotel
i contacted @entity31 on your behalf and it promised you a full refund
