-- over the past decade the @entity2 world has witnessed a shifting of not only hard power -- which saw the traditional armies of the @entity2 world in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 consumed in internal turmoil -- but also of what @entity12 professor @entity11 termed " soft power , " which has moved from these countries to the resource rich @entity16
long before their formation into modern states , the cities of the @entity16 were recipients of talent , skill and economic aid from the traditional @entity2 nation states that have today fallen into obscurity
for centuries the @entity27 , or black drapes of the holy @entity29 in @entity30 were supplied by @entity31 , @entity32 or @entity33 as well as @entity34 who were locked in protocol battles of soft power over the holy city
this is of course no longer the case
@entity41 -- the @entity2 world economic superpower and fourth largest spender on military -- is the party that sends aid not only to @entity47 and @entity8 but also to most @entity2 states
according to the @entity51 , the @entity16 , perhaps none more so than @entity50 , are today amongst the most generous nations with regards to financial aid , contributing more than twice the @entity56 target of 0.7 % of their combined gross national income during the period between 1973 - 2008
since the beginning of the @entity2 uprisings , @entity62 to the @entity2 world has significantly spiked
@entity8 , for example , has received billions of dollars from the @entity16 since its january 25 , 2011 , uprising
the @entity8 ' loss of influence over @entity30 -- which was then under @entity68 rule -- to @entity41 founder @entity69 in 1925 was an irreparable blow to @entity32 's mechanism of religious soft power and a significant advantage to the @entity74
perhaps no other city in the world , save for @entity77 , commands as much global soft power as @entity30
for decades , media output in the @entity2 world was produced , recorded , filmed and performed in the traditional leading @entity2 states of @entity9 , @entity7 and @entity8 as well as @entity81
today a significant portion of television production , recording and filming -- not to mention financing -- takes place in the @entity16 cities of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91
much of this entertainment is produced in the local dialects of @entity8 and @entity7 , but the @entity16 cities can exercise a large degree of influence on material that is locally filmed and financed
the @entity16 states are also home to the most watched tv news channels in the @entity2 world , a significant mechanism of soft power in one of the most politically unstable regions
between the @entity91 based @entity105 and the @entity41 owned and @entity89 based @entity106 is a media war for the hearts and minds of the @entity2 public
the two leading news channels of the @entity2 world are accused of reflecting the versions of events closest to the politics of their funders
even so , the soft power reach of these channels with their tens of millions of @entity2 viewers can not be quantified and has become one of the main levers of soft power of the @entity16
flourishing tourism while tourism has come to a standstill in @entity81 , @entity8 , @entity7 and @entity9 it has flourished in the @entity16
@entity89 with its infrastructure and attractions that were built over the past half - century today attracts more tourists than any other @entity2 state and is the seventh most visited city in the world
this year , @entity133 ranked @entity89 's airport , home of @entity136 , as the world 's busiest -- in terms of passenger numbers -- for the 12 months ending march
@entity90 , @entity91 , @entity140 and a number of @entity41 cities are undertaking massive airport and other infrastructure projects that will keep tourists pouring in
the @entity16 cities have turned themselves into globally recognized brands , while traditional @entity2 cities such as @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity149 have become synonymous with turmoil and unrest
the massive multi billion - dollar nation branding exercise that cities like @entity90 , @entity89 and @entity91 have undertaken has turned into a self - fulfilling prophecy
world diplomatic , business and media leaders continuously make visits to these cities attracted by their commercial , political and media clout , this in turn attracts others to be based here
for instance , today @entity90 is arguably the de facto political hub of the region having witnessed visits by most foreign ministers of regional and global powers
while the traditionally culturally rich powers of the @entity2 world continue to face internal turmoil and fail to invest in cultural projects , the @entity16 continue to thrive
@entity90 , @entity89 , @entity91 and @entity171 are investing heavily in museums and education , attracting talent from across the @entity2 world and beyond
for the second year running , a survey of young @entity2 found that the @entity176 topped their list of preferred countries to live in , followed by the @entity179 , @entity41 and @entity180
the @entity176 at 39 % scored almost twice as high as the @entity179 at 21 % -- a significant show of force for a country that is n't even half a century old
barely a week goes by in the @entity16 without them witnessing major international events and meetings
the @entity16 states have been on a publicity and nation - branding streak
from @entity89 's hosting of the @entity51 and @entity193 meetings in 2003 to the @entity194 in 2020 , the city is abuzz with global conferences such as the @entity197 's @entity196 , sporting championships and media , it and business forums
@entity180 's hosting of the @entity202 of talks in 2001 to the @entity204 2022 as well as @entity90 's massive @entity206 and @entity207 museums -- which are scheduled to open in the next few years -- will cement these states ' soft power advantages
when the @entity211 decided to withdraw from the @entity16 in the 1960s they left behind fledgling nations , weak and exposed to regional states and the political ambitions of neighbors
today -- due to their incredible soft power -- it is these @entity16 states that carry influence over the rest of the @entity2 world .
