@entity0 -- the gay @entity3 man who helped overturn the state 's decade - old ban on same - sex marriage is featured in a campaign ad for a @entity10 @entity9 candidate -- and he now finds himself on the receiving end of some criticism from @entity14 activists
@entity15 and his husband , @entity16 , became high - profile figures in @entity3 's gay rights community this year when they challenged the state 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage and won
now @entity15 is backing @entity22 , the @entity10 nominee and same - sex marriage supporter who 's challenging sen. @entity24 , a @entity25 incumbent with a long record of fighting for lgbt rights
it was n't too big of a surprise that @entity22 is unveiling her support for same - sex marriage
this is not @entity36 , " @entity10 strategist @entity32 said , referring to the state 's liberal tendencies
" i do n't see a political risk
" it was , however , a big step for @entity15 and his husband to lend their names to @entity22 's campaign
while many of @entity15 's friends and acquaintances have been respectful and even happy with his decision , he said , some have been " shocked
" his @entity49 page shows a sampling of the disagreements
some simply ca n't fathom electing a @entity10 , while others say they have a hard time buying @entity22 's position
" where was she earlier this year when we were ' fighting the fight ' ? " one person wrote , referring to the legal challenge against the state 's law
" but now that it 's over and she does n't want to be on the ' wrong side of history ' , she is supportive , or says that she is
" still , others are dismayed that @entity15 would not support @entity24 , a senator that one person described as " a point of pride for @entity70
" " i am deeply saddened by the public stance that you have taken against one of the gay community 's champions in @entity0 , " another person wrote
" i hope you will recant your position
" judge strikes down @entity80 's same - sex marriage ban @entity81 , executive director at @entity70 , a group that worked actively in the challenge against the state 's same - sex marriage ban , said she ca n't speak for @entity15 and @entity16 , adding the " lgbt community is politically diverse and we ca n't expect 100 % agreement on every issue or candidate
" she went on to laud @entity24 and question @entity22 's record on same - sex marriage
@entity25 point to previous comments when @entity22 did n't take one position or the other on same - sex marriage , saying mostly that it 's an issue that should be left to the states
the ad causing the stir in the 30 - second television spot released tuesday by @entity22 's campaign , @entity15 looks directly into the camera and talks about how marrying his partner " was the happiest day " of his life
but he cautions there 's still " a lot of work left to do " in the national push for same - sex marriage
" whether it 's standing up for equality or for the unemployed or for the next generation , we need leaders who have the courage to do what 's right , " he continues
" that 's why i support @entity22
i know she 'll fight for every @entity3 family , including mine
" at the end of the ad , which was first reported by @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity22 stand next to each with their arms around each other , smiling
in a written statement , @entity22 said she 's " proud and humbled " to have the endorsement of @entity123 , a @entity10 , and his husband , a @entity129
" their courage to stand up for their family , and against inequality , is inspiring and embodies the spirit i will serve with as @entity70 's next senator , " she said
@entity138 : no same - sex marriage in @entity140 , yet @entity15 and @entity16 reached out to @entity22 's campaign shortly after she became the @entity10 nominee and got to know her over a coffee date and a long visit to her house
while @entity16 had some serious doubts at the beginning , @entity15 said they eventually decided to " go out on a limb " and endorse her because they believed she was an overall better candidate than the incumbent senator
citing their role in @entity3 's gay rights world , @entity15 described the decision as " very difficult
" " it 's not easy to get the blowback when yesterday you were the darling of the community , " he said
" but we 're acting with conviction in our hearts , and i 'm not going to apologize for that
" a blueprint for the future ? while it was n't a big risk in @entity3 , the spot was certainly an uncommon move on the national level
only four current @entity10 members of the @entity9 support same - sex marriage
but @entity22 , a pediatric neurosurgeon , trails @entity24 by double digits
while her race has become more competitive than expected , political observers still rate it as a likely @entity25 seat
experts say she needed to make a splash to keep the pressure on
" it seemed like a powerful , daring and bold move , but it also seems very wise given the landscape of @entity70 , " said @entity32
judges hear four states defend same - sex marriage bans as polls continue to show increasing support for same - sex marriage , @entity32 argued @entity10 will be paying close attention to the outcome in @entity3
" depending on how this turns out for @entity22 , this could be a blueprint for how @entity10 could move forward , " he said
advocates for traditional marriage , however , have vowed to stop any momentum @entity22 may gain from the ad
" i think she 's committed suicide politically , " said @entity198 , the political director for @entity199
he blasted her for supporting @entity15 and @entity16 , calling their lawsuit a major insult to the voters who backed the amendment in 2004
@entity198 said his group is beginning to put together its plan to go after @entity22 , adding that they 're prepared to spend money in the state
" our organization will certainly urge @entity221 to refuse to vote for her , " he said saying they 'll make sure people know she 's not only in favor of same sex - marriage , but " she is in favor of the courts invalidating their votes
