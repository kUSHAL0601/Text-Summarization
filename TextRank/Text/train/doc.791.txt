like a groggy traveler after a long , cold night , the @entity3 's comet - chasing @entity1 spacecraft woke up , warmed up and called home monday before setting off on the final leg of its journey
@entity1 shook off 31 months of sleep , during which it traveled into the dark reaches of the solar system , and contacted its operators monday evening
cheers erupted in the @entity3 mission control center in @entity17 , @entity18 , when a signal from @entity1 arrived shortly after 7 p.m. ( 1 p.m. et )
" the spacecraft is there , it 's awake , and i think we are all overwhelmed , " mission manager @entity20 told reporters
now , he said , controllers will have " two busy years ahead of them " as it approaches its target , @entity28 , and follows it around the sun. there was only an hour window for the signal to reach @entity34 , putting scientists on pins and needles
" the spacecraft decided to make us suffer after two and half year , " @entity38 , head of @entity39 told @entity40
" we came almost to the end of the window , we were very tense , " he said
the unmanned probe was launched in 2004 and is now nearly 500 million miles ( 800 million kilometers ) from the @entity46 -- a distance that puts it just past the orbit of @entity49
at that distance , the message it beamed back took 45 minutes to arrive
when the signal finally arrived there were cheers of relief
wake up @entity1 : you have a date with a comet if all goes well , @entity1 will rendezvous with the comet in august and fly with it for two years
scientists now have to learn how to maneuver the craft around a comet
" it 's flying in a very unusual environment for space flight with gas and dust and not much gravity to keep your obit stable , " @entity38 said
@entity1 is also supposed to send a small lander to the surface of the comet in november
the mission will give scientists unprecedented insight into the makeup and structure of these ancient residents of the solar system , @entity3 officials say
" this is groundbreaking science , " @entity1 project scientist @entity81 told @entity3 television
" we 're looking at where we came from , the evolution of our own solar system
and comets are looked upon as kind of a time capsule back to the beginning of the solar system
" scientists believe comets , composed of rock and ice , may have brought water and maybe even the primitive building blocks of life to @entity34
@entity1 carries 11 scientific instruments ; its lander has 10 more
@entity3 controllers ordered @entity1 to shut down most of its systems in june 2011 to save on power as it sailed through the darkest reaches of the solar system
the amount of sunlight reaching the solar - powered probe is only 4 % that on @entity34 , according to @entity3
