-- @entity2 's oil reserves may have been grossly overestimated and its capacity to continue pumping at current capacity exaggerated , according to a @entity6 diplomatic cable sent from the kingdom in 2007
the cable , obtained by @entity9 and published in the @entity11 newspaper @entity10 , cited the views of @entity13 , who had been in charge of exploration and production at the @entity2 state - owned company @entity17 for 12 years until 2004
@entity17 dominates exploration and production in the kingdom
" according to @entity13 , the crux of the issue is two-fold , " the cable says
" first it is possible that @entity2 reserves are not as bountiful as sometimes described and the timeline for their production not as unrestrained as @entity17 executives and energy optimists would like
" @entity28 is quoted as disagreeing with his former company 's estimate of total reserves in @entity2 , the world 's largest oil producer
" he believes that @entity17 's reserves are overstated by as much as 300 billion barrels of ' speculative resources
' he instead focuses on original proven reserves
" @entity28 forecasts " a plateau in total output that will last approximately fifteen years , " meaning that soon after 2020 " a slow but steady output decline will ensue and no amount of effort will be able to stop it
" the former @entity17 executive 's forecast was based on @entity2 's stated goal of producing 12.5 million barrels per day by 2009
industry commentators say it has fallen short of that goal because of the global economic slowdown and insufficient global refining capacity
according to the @entity53 , @entity2 produced 8.4 million barrels per day of crude oil in 2010 , and around 1.8 million barrels per day of natural gas
but less was available for export because of rapidly increasing domestic demand
and as global demand recovers , driven by @entity63 and @entity64 , the price of crude oil has risen sharply
in the long term , @entity28 sees an " underlying reality that global demand has met supply , " according to the cable
" due to the longer - term constraints on expanding global output , @entity13 judges that demand will continue to outpace supply and that for every million - barrels - per - day shortfall that exists between demand and supply , the floor price will increase by $ 12 ( per barrel ) , " the cable says
oil industry observers say that while there have been significant finds of crude in recent years -- especially off the coast of @entity84 and @entity85 -- some fields are in deep water and will be difficult to recover
and they are not big enough to alter the fundamental picture with " super-fields " like the @entity91 field in @entity2 beginning to decline
however , new reservoir technologies may allow producers to exploit reserves that are currently inaccessible
in @entity2 's case , that amounts to an estimated 360 billion barrels
oil industry analysts point out another variable : the use of alternative energy sources
a @entity6 cable from 2009 says the @entity2 want to develop renewable energy sources , including nuclear power , to meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity
that could have the effect of reducing the need to divert crude from exports to fuel domestic electricity generation
the 2009 cable says analysts believe " a civilian nuclear program ... is the only possibility the @entity117 has to generate sufficient electricity to meet projected demand from economic and population growth and increasing affluence without wastefully burning large quantities of fuel oil
" last year @entity2 announced plans to built two nuclear power plants .
