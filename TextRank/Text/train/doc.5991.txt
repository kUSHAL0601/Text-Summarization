-- a @entity2 prosecutor said his office will " get to the bottom " of a sexual assault case investigation involving @entity6 quarterback @entity5
a lawyer for the @entity6 star said his client will cooperate with authorities even though he believed the case had been closed for months
in an interview friday , state attorney @entity13 said his office learned of the case on wednesday
" what we 're going to try to do is to get to the bottom of it and try to do justice , " he said
@entity13 , state attorney for @entity2 's 2nd @entity21 , said he believed the case could have been handled differently , but he did not offer specifics
the latest development in the case comes as no. 2 @entity6 plays its homecoming game against @entity25 on saturday
@entity5 is a candidate for the @entity26 , college football 's top award
the sexual assault complaint was filed in december
@entity5 's lawyer , @entity29 , said the red - shirt freshman has not been questioned by police as part of the investigation
@entity29 said police in @entity35 told him in february the case had been closed
" i informed my client , i informed the university , that the matter was resolved , and we all moved forward , " @entity29 said
but @entity13 said the case is not closed
" there 's people who needed to be located and talked to and , to the best of my knowledge , they have n't been , " the prosecutor said
@entity13 said , " the most important thing here is , we do have a victim in the case
we do n't pick our victims , nor do we pick our suspects
they are who they are and i think our job is to do the right thing with the case
" @entity35 @entity61 have released a heavily redacted police report documenting a sexual assault allegation
@entity29 would not comment on the document , but said his client 's name " has been intermingled " with the investigation
no one has been charged in the investigation
calls made friday for comment from the @entity72 were not immediately returned
@entity5 's name does not appear in the redacted version of the complaint , dated december 7 , and a suspect description includes a height ranging between 5 - foot - 9 and 5 - foot - 11 , several inches shorter than the 6 - foot - 4 quarterback
@entity13 said , " if i were you all , i would n't put too much into a redacted police report
" @entity29 said he had given investigators sworn statements from witnesses " that we believe are favorable to mr. @entity5 , " and those witnesses had been interviewed by police
@entity13 confirmed that his office received two affidavits from @entity29 but had not yet interviewed the witnesses
@entity89 , the @entity90 chief assistant state 's attorney , said police delivered the case to her office on tuesday
" i am not aware of it being closed nor did my office ask that it be reopened , " @entity89 said
" i do not know the reason the case was not presented sooner
i can not confirm any suspects or comment on the evidence , as it is a pending investigation
" @entity6 said it could not comment on an open investigation , but said there was no change in @entity5 's status
" we look forward to a speedy resolution of the issue , " a school statement added
@entity29 said the report had been leaked to reporters in the past week , timing he called " very suspect
" @entity6 is a national title contender , and @entity26 voting takes place in early december : " any kind of negative can affect that , " he said
