-- @entity1 wasted a golden opportunity to close the gap on leaders and city rivals @entity6 at the top of the @entity9 table after being held to a 1 - 1 draw at home to lowly @entity12
with @entity6 's match at @entity15 postponed because of heavy snow , a @entity1 win would have closed the gap at the top of the table to eight points -- with both teams having played 21 matches
veteran midfielder @entity22 put @entity1 ahead on the stroke of half - time when he hooked the ball home after goalkeeper @entity27 failed to deal with a @entity29 cross
but @entity30 poked home a mis - hit @entity32 shot just before the hour mark to earn @entity12 a point
it completes a difficult week for @entity37 's side following their surprise @entity41 defeat to @entity42 and last weekend 's ' derby ' reverse at the @entity45
@entity1 's failure to win means in - form @entity48 have joined them on 41 points after a narrow 2 - 1 home win over bottom side @entity51
second - half substitute @entity53 struck the winner three minutes from time in his final match before joining @entity57 side @entity56 in a six - month loan deal
@entity59 had put the hosts in front in the 29th minute before @entity51 's @entity62 equalized just before half - time
however , striker @entity53 flicked home the late winner to earn @entity67 's side a fourth successive @entity9 victory
elsewhere in @entity70 , striker @entity69 has confirmed he has turned down the chance to join @entity72 , choosing to remain with @entity73 despite reports of a fall - out with coach @entity76
on the pitch , @entity73 maintained their @entity79 challenge with a comfortable 2 - 0 win over strugglers @entity81
meanwhile , @entity82 moved up a place to fifth , going above @entity84 , after a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity87
@entity89 's penalty after 70 minutes looked like giving new coach @entity90 a winning start to his reign
however , @entity93 converted a cross from @entity95 to level matters with just 12 minutes remaining .
