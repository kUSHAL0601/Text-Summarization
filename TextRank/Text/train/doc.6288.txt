@entity0 -- engineers have uncovered the haunting remains of a mummified cat bricked up inside the wall of a cottage near the site of one of @entity10 's most infamous witch trials
workers made the startling discovery during routine maintenance on a reservoir in the shadow of @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 's " witching country
" they called in archaeologists , who unearthed a cottage believed to date from the 17th century buried beneath a grassy mound
inside , they found a sealed room where the cat had been walled up
the area is famous for the @entity16 witch trials , which saw 10 women and two men accused of using witchcraft to murder people in the 1600s
it is thought the unfortunate feline may have been buried alive by the cottage 's superstitious inhabitants , in an attempt to protect them from evil spirits
" it 's not often you come across a fairytale cottage complete with witch 's cat , " said @entity41 , project manager for water company @entity42
" the building is in remarkable condition
you can walk through it and get a real sense that you 're peering into the past
" @entity16 has a real aura about it -- it 's hard not to be affected by the place
even before we discovered the building , there were lots of jokes from the lads about broomsticks and black cats
the find has really stunned us all
" @entity65 , an expert on the @entity16 witches , likened the find -- which he said could be the @entity68 , site of a notorious meeting of the " coven " on @entity71 , 1612 -- to " discovering @entity73 's tomb
" " we are just a few months away from the 400th anniversary of the @entity16 witch trials , and here we have an incredibly rare find , right in the heart of witching country
" cats feature prominently in folklore about witches , " said @entity65
" whoever consigned this cat to such a horrible fate was clearly seeking protection from evil spirits
it 's an absolutely spellbinding discovery
" " it 's like discovering your own little @entity93 , " said @entity88 of @entity89 , who led the team which excavated the building
" we rarely get the opportunity to work with something so well preserved
" as soon as we started digging we found the tops of doors and knew we were onto something special
" the building is a microcosm for the rise and fall of this area , from the time of the @entity16 witches to the industrial age -- there are layers of local history right before your eyes
" archaeologists also uncovered a host of other artifacts in and around the cottage -- including a 19th century kitchen range , tin bath , bedstead and items of crockery .
