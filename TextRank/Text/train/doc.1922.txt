first , it was the snowy weather
an @entity4 flight trying to leave @entity5 on sunday night was delayed for about 2Â½ hours before it finally took off at 10:52 p.m. the crew of @entity7 knew hours before takeoff that they could n't go the distance to @entity11
the first officer was going to exceed his allotted work time , as dictated by the @entity16 , if he flew the entire route , @entity13 spokeswoman @entity12 said
that 's why the crew made the decision to divert to @entity21 that night and informed the passengers hours prior to takeoff , @entity12 said
the passengers were told about the stop in @entity21 while still in the @entity5 boarding area , several hours before departing , she said
they would have had time to rebook if they wanted to do so
" certainly , the weather had a lot to do with this decision , " @entity12 said
" it was prudent to depart and be able to go as far as @entity21 , " especially with the snow predictions in the @entity5 area
given monday 's snowfall in the @entity5 area , it seems like a smart decision to get out of town
it 's not likely the flight would have taken off monday
@entity42 remained open , but most flights have been canceled , @entity41 gov. @entity40 said
3 mondays , 3 straight snowstorms bury the @entity45 snowstorms in the @entity45 have caused the cancellation and delay of thousands of flights over the past couple months
@entity50 showed more than 700 flights within , into and out of the @entity13 canceled for sunday , on top of the more than 1,500 flights scheduled to be scrubbed monday
@entity7 's passengers landed in @entity21 just after midnight and were put up in hotels overnight
they departed @entity21 with a new crew at 8:05 a.m. monday and landed in @entity11 at 10:11 a.m. , according to @entity50
