economist @entity2 says it 's better to cut taxes than to raise government spending
@entity8 , @entity9 ( @entity10 ) -- when the @entity13 administration takes office in january , it will propose a fiscal stimulus consisting of increased government spending and lower taxes
by all accounts , the package will be big -- at least $ 700 billion , and possibly $ 1 trillion , over two years
the goal will be to end or moderate the recession
according to the textbooks , government spending raises the demand for goods and services
tax cuts also spur demand by putting more income in the hands of consumers or more after - tax profits in the hands of businesses
is a fiscal stimulus good policy ? the answer is no if the stimulus consists of increased spending
the stimulus may be good policy , though , if it consists of lower taxes
consider first the increased spending
if the new spending is for projects that are beneficial for society overall , and if the private sector can not or will not undertake these projects , then the expenditure is worthwhile independent of what it does to fight the recession
a standard example might be repair of the interstate highway system
this justification for additional spending is far from compelling , however
no doubt some roads need repairs , but the @entity61 already spends huge amounts on its highway system
the @entity61 could address existing deficiencies by increasing the use of toll roads and charging drivers extra at rush hour , or by repealing prevailing wage laws that inflate construction costs
similar caveats apply to other proposed increases in government spending
research on alternative energy is fine , but government funding is likely to come with costly strings and political interference
a better policy is higher taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels , which would enhance the private sector 's incentive to undertake such research
additional spending on education makes sense in some cases , but the level of spending is already substantial
improvements in education are more likely to come from expanded school choice and elimination of policies that limit efficiency , such as rigid hiring and firing rules negotiated by unions
even if certain components of the nation 's spending are too low , nothing guarantees that new spending will be directed to these areas
instead , experience suggests that much will be for repairing " bridges to nowhere , " especially those located in the districts of influential legislators
the @entity115 argument for a spending stimulus does not , of course , assume this spending is for projects that have economic or social value
the theory , in fact , suggests that digging ditches and then filling them up is effective at stimulating the economy
this can not make sense in the long run ; government spending must be paid for with taxes , so it ultimately comes at the expense of private spending
projects that do not make economic sense are then pure waste
yet the history of government spending indicates the stimulus package will include countless zoos , aquariums , museums , parks and other pork barrel projects for which the private demand does not come close to justifying the investment
in many cases , these projects will persist for decades
even in the short - run , the economic effect of public spending is often weak since it partially crowds out private spending
research subsidies for green technologies , for example , mainly give private companies money for research they would otherwise undertake themselves
in any case , spending operates with a substantial lag , so it can kick in long after it is needed
the case for a spending stimulus is therefore weak
consider instead using tax cuts to simulate the economy
most tax cuts enhance economic efficiency by giving the private sector better incentives
reductions in the corporate income tax , for example , increase the incentives for investment , while reductions in personal income taxes raise the incentives for work and saving
tax cuts also stimulate demand via the standard @entity115 channels of increased disposable income for consumers and higher cash flow for businesses
tax cuts thus improve economic performance in the long run and the short run
recent analyses of past tax cuts and spending increases , moreover , suggest that cutting taxes is the more effective approach
any stimulus package should therefore consist mainly of tax cuts
whether a major tax cut is desirable depends on one 's view about the current size of government
for those who believe government should be at least as large as it is now , tax cuts are problematic because they add to an already dismal deficit picture
@entity205 and @entity206 , in particular , are projected to boost the deficit dramatically , implying higher tax rates will be required to achieve budget balance
rigid focus on the deficit might not be appropriate in a recession , but the long - run outlook still suggests caution about any policy that increases the current deficit
for those who advocate smaller government , the case for a tax cut is easier ; short - run increases in the deficit are not a major concern if government should be smaller ( and can eventually be reduced in size ) in the long run
if the level of spending is too high , the @entity61 can have its cake and eat it too : cut taxes now to improve efficiency and stimulate the economy and cut spending later to balance the budget
is the @entity61 government too large ? this is not the place to address that question , but it is the crucial issue that policymakers and society must confront
if the level of spending is about right , then the @entity61 must raise taxes sooner or later
a tax cut now therefore means an even larger increase down the line
the overall point is that government spending should be determined by long - run costs and benefits , while taxes should be sufficient to pay for programs that make sense on these grounds
concern with stabilizing the economy in the short run is understandable , but it often generates policies that are counterproductive over the long haul
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
