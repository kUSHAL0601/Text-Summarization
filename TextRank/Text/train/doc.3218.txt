-- @entity1 dispatched troops friday to quell clashes that arose in the city of @entity5 over the @entity7 crisis
prime minister @entity8 said on tv that @entity1 army reinforcements went to two neighborhoods to " put an end to what happened
" the clashes were between @entity1 alawites who support the @entity7 government and @entity16 who oppose it
there also had been a large demonstration in @entity5 in support of the @entity7 people
the clashes in @entity5 killed one soldier and three civilians and injured two soldiers and 10 civilians , the army said
@entity1 's @entity27 said one of those killed was an official with the @entity30 , an @entity14 entity
" i asked the military and the security forces to impose the law and order in the city and strike with an iron fist , " said @entity8 , who noted that authorities are investigating
" i am not accusing anyone
we do n't know who started the clashes , " he said
" the timing is suspicious , and the civil peace is a red line that no one can cross
" the @entity14 faith is an offshoot of @entity47 that dominates @entity7 leadership ; @entity7 president @entity49 is an @entity14
the majority of @entity7 are @entity51
there 's been tension between the two groups in @entity1
@entity14 and @entity51 / leftist militias fought at various junctures during the 1975 - 90 @entity1 civil war until the @entity7 established a presence there
the majority of the @entity16 in @entity5 loathe the @entity7 regime , but the @entity14 in northern @entity1 thrived during the @entity7 presence
tensions have increased between the groups during the most recent @entity7 crisis
