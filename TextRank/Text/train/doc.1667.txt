@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has a pitch for @entity1 : @entity6 beer and @entity8 ice cream
if he has his way , those products soon will be available at supermarkets and beach resorts on the communist island
" this is one of the things people are going to pay premium for , " @entity3 said , " especially the tourists that have the dollars
it 's going to be a phenomenal product
" this week , dozens of @entity24 are in @entity0 , peddling their wares at an international trade fair : apples , pears , grapes , raisins , nuts out of @entity32
@entity24 - @entity1 relations appear to be thawing
in @entity0 , billboards depicting the @entity24 president as @entity36 have disappeared
in @entity38 , president @entity37 has lifted restrictions on @entity1 - @entity24 travel and money transfers
the new political climate has prompted companies such as @entity44 to come to @entity0 's trade fair for the first time
they 're hoping to break into the little - known market and go home with a contract
despite a trade embargo imposed against @entity1 in 1962 , the @entity24 is the no. 1 supplier of food to that country and has been for more than five years
a law passed in 2000 allows the @entity24 to export agricultural products and medicine
but this year , the global economic crisis is taking its toll
" @entity1 has not been an exception , " said @entity60 , minister of foreign trade and investment
" at the end of the third quarter in 2009 , our trade fell by 36 percent
" the country is slashing imports of @entity24 food by one - third , which means some vendors will go home empty - handed
but vendors are betting @entity24 - @entity1 relations will only get better
they said they 're also hoping the next step could be bills in the @entity77 that would eliminate restrictions on all @entity24 traveling to @entity1
" we 're in this for the long haul as well , " said @entity79 of @entity44
" like i said before , we 're thinking about today as well as tomorrow
" a tomorrow that would have @entity24 tourists sipping @entity24 beer on @entity1 beaches .
