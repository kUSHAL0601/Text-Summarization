-- @entity2 's birthday is friday , and she 'll be wearing red to celebrate
it 's not her favorite color , but it is for her favorite cause
friday is @entity7 , part of the @entity9 's @entity11 movement to raise awareness about women 's heart health
@entity15 is a survivor of heart failure
@entity15 's life changed in 2000 when she remained hospitalized for fatigue , nausea and other unexplained symptoms after her daughter 's birth
" they could n't figure out what was wrong with me , " said @entity15 of @entity24 , @entity25
" by the time they figured it out , my heart function had gone to 5 % , and i was on the heart transplant list
" @entity15 was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy , a rare heart disorder that affects women from the final month of pregnancy to five months after childbirth
she had never heard of the condition before and had no history of heart disease in her family , or so she thought
" once i became sick , we had to dig into our family history to find out was it hereditary , " @entity15 said
" i 've had relatives that have died from it
" after her diagnosis , volunteers from the @entity9 helped teach @entity15 about her illness and how to manage its symptoms
her heart function has improved to around 40 % , and by making lifestyle changes , she is able to lead a mostly normal life
during her recovery , @entity15 realized how important it was to educate herself and other women about the risk factors and warning signs of heart disease
" we like to take care of the family and everyone else first
we have to go to the doctor first
the family can not boil water if you 're sick , " she said
" the more education we know about these things the better we can react for our families
" for 10 years , @entity15 has dedicated her birthday to teaching other women about heart health and raising money for @entity81
" every year that i 'm alive i want to remember
i want to educate women on the @entity81 campaign and @entity84 ( @entity9 ) because they really did save me , " @entity15 said
according to the association , cardiovascular disease claims the lives of 500,000 women each , yet like @entity15 initially , a large percentage of women are unaware of its dangers
" i think that women commonly think of heart disease as a man 's disease , which it is not
heart disease is the no. 1 killer of women , " said dr. @entity97 , medical director for women 's health and community relations at @entity100 in @entity101 and also a spokeswoman for the @entity9 's @entity104 movement
" this grass - roots movement has made a difference , " @entity97 said
" research shows that women ( who ) have visited ( the @entity113 ) website , more than a third of them have lost weight ; 40 % have checked their cholesterol ; a third of them have talked to their doctors
" @entity113 is trying to raise $ 100,000 by the end of february in honor of @entity121 to fund additional research and education programs on women 's heart health
this year @entity15 will don her red and gather with friends , family and other women at a suburban @entity132 restaurant to celebrate her 39th birthday , raise money for the association and teach women to take charge of their health
" it can happen to anybody
i do n't want women to wait , " @entity15 said
" you only get this heart once
be forceful about your health
" she plans to pass out small red dress pins , a symbol of @entity81 for @entity11 's fight for awareness
" for me it symbolizes that there is an importance placed on women 's health
it also seems like a sisterhood when i see people with the red pins on , " @entity15 said
she said hopes the pins are a reminder that heart disease can be treated and even prevented , but first you have to be informed
