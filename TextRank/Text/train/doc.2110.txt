@entity1 , @entity0 -- synagogues across metropolitan @entity1 , @entity0 , began taking " appropriate precautions " friday after a warning by security officials to watch out for suspicious packages from abroad , according to a @entity8 spokeswoman
president @entity10 said that two packages that apparently contained explosive materials were bound for two synagogues in @entity1
while there were " no identifiable or specific threats , " an @entity17 official in @entity1 said suspicious packages addressed to @entity20 destinations found on cargo planes abroad warranted the precautions
" since two of the suspicious packages that were intercepted were addressed to religious institutions in @entity1 , all churches , synagogues and mosques in the @entity1 area should be vigilant for any unsolicited or unexpected packages , especially those originating from overseas locations , " said @entity17 special agent @entity22

" at the same time , we 're not going to go hide in the basement
" " i may say a word or two about this tonight , but i do n't think it 's worthy of a sermon , " he said friday
