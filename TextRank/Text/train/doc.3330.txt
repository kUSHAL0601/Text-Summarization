-- with a first name that means " wave " in @entity4 , perhaps @entity1 was destined to pursue a career in water sports
and for a self - confessed " mermaid , " synchronized swimming provides the ideal escape
" i do n't know why but the water , for me , it 's perfect
i feel better inside the water than outside , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity14 series
she has become @entity17 's most successful synchronized swimmer , collecting two @entity19 medals and more than a dozen at the world championships
" you can do anything -- you can create and ( be ) very original
it 's an artistic sport , " she added
then there 's the glitzy outfits -- and the hair , which is lacquered into a hard gloss with gelatine to keep it styled in the water
like @entity32 in tennis , @entity1 -- who is studying fashion design at university -- and her teammates play a role in creating the costumes they wear
the collaborative approach also applies to choosing music to routines and developing the choreography along with their coaches
@entity1 's big tune is " @entity47 " -- the ode to her home city sung by @entity50 and @entity51 , to which she performed at july 's world championships in the @entity4 capital
" it 's the music of @entity19 ' 92 and it 's very nice song and very nice choreography -- i think it 's very beautiful , " @entity1 explains
" the costume is like @entity59 -- in @entity47 very famous -- and blue and shiny like @entity51 when she sings
" the 2013 world championships were a special moment for the 23 - year - old
she was able to get close to the countries now dominating the sport , @entity67 and @entity68 , as she earned seven podium placings across the individual and team events
but it 's clear that for @entity1 , picking up silverware is n't her lone goal
being underwater for 20 seconds at a time -- unable to even communicate with your partner -- adds to the feeling of peaceful isolation
it 's an escape , however , that requires its participants to combine artistic elements with strength and technique , similar to rhythmic gymnastics or figure skating
on average @entity1 suspects she spends 10 hours in the pool a day -- a necessary workload if she is to catch her @entity67 and @entity68 rivals
while twisting , turning and lifting , competitors have to make sure the strain does n't show on their well - manicured faces -- sometimes they put the waterproof makeup on themselves but on other occasions they have makeup artists
any sign of straining and the judges are sure to pounce
the degree of difficulty is thus high
growing up in @entity47 , the vibrant city in northeastern @entity17 that rests by the @entity106 , paved the way for @entity1 's development in " synchro
" " when i was seven i did rhythmic gymnastics , " she recalls
" when i was nine i started synchronized swimming because i liked the water a lot
i spent a lot of hours in the sea
" it prepared her well for a life in the pool , which requires strong stamina
" there are many hard things in synchronized swimming but the hardest is to hold our breath inside the water , " @entity1 says
" when we go up and breathe , you have to do a good face and smile
" we have to work a lot to hold our breath because many moves in the performance are like 20 seconds without a breath
" we do n't communicate -- it 's impossible
sometimes when we do n't have music we speak inside the water but it 's very difficult and without goggles you see very bad
" you have to believe in each other
" in the team format that consists of eight swimmers -- one of the two @entity19 disciplines , while there are seven formats at the world championships -- @entity1 and company are aided by underwater speakers
" we listen perfectly inside and outside , too , and it 's nice because it 's like all the other people , " said @entity1
" a lot of people do n't know we have a speaker inside
" @entity17 , with @entity1 in the group , claimed a silver medal in all three team events in @entity47 , finishing second to @entity67
individually she collected four bronze medals , with @entity67 once again leading the way
@entity67 's clean sweep of all seven gold medals confirmed its status as the powerhouse of the sport , unlike the early days
when synchronized swimming first became an @entity19 sport in @entity169 in 1984 , @entity164 , the @entity165 and @entity166 led the way in the absence of the @entity173 nations -- who boycotted the @entity175 in retaliation for the @entity178 's refusal to attend @entity179 ' 80
" @entity67 is very difficult to get , " said @entity1
" @entity68 is difficult , too , but maybe i get
" @entity1 did win gold at the 2009 world championships in @entity182 in the team free routine , but the highlight of her career remains tallying a silver in the duet and team bronze at last year 's @entity19 in @entity190
caught up in the moment , she was unable to appreciate her achievements
it was only when @entity1 went on holiday did she fully reflect
" i ( thought ) a lot about the competition -- ' oh it 's a very , very big thing that we did , ' " she says
" for me , the most important result in my life is the silver medal in @entity190 because it 's very hard to get there
i 'm younger and my partner was like eight years older than me
@entity1 is now working towards the 2016 olympics in @entity207
" i think we go for gold , and work more , more , more , " she says
as for later in life , @entity1 is n't the sort to predict what she will be doing in 10 years
she wonders , though , if men will be allowed to compete in international tournaments at some stage
for some , men and synchronized swimming are forever linked to a skit on @entity165 comedy show @entity220 decades ago starring @entity221
" i do n't understand why in synchronized , there is not men 's , " said @entity1
" in ballet there are men
for me it would be very good if men start to do synchronized swimming
