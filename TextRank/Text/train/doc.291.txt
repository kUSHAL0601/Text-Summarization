-- as coach @entity2 studied the opposing team , he realized his players were at a big disadvantage
their future opponents moved quickly around the court , passing the puck with strength and agility
his floor hockey team was out of shape
while in their hearts they were champions , their bodies were n't quite ready for the challenge ahead
if @entity17 was going to win at the @entity18 , @entity2 thought , they had some conditioning to do
@entity2 has been a @entity18 coach in @entity20 , @entity21 , for 11 years
his oldest son , @entity22 , 29 , has @entity24 's syndrome , a high - functioning form of autism
when @entity27 outgrew youth soccer , he joined the @entity18 program
since then , he has added basketball , floor hockey and track and field events to his athletic resume
i have @entity24 's ; i am just like you @entity2 decided his son would set an example for the floor hockey team
father and son gave up soda and switched to water
they replaced sugary snacks with fruits and vegetables , focusing on eating an overall healthier diet
over the next few months , the younger @entity2 lost 25 pounds
@entity2 took his plan to the rest of the team , recruiting his other son , @entity51 , to design a training program
" he put the challenge out there and i accepted it , " said @entity53 , captain of @entity17
the players began working out five to six days a week
they started slow , doing low - impact exercises and lots of stretches to prevent injury
since they did n't have a lot of equipment , they used their bodies to strength train ; push - ups , sit - ups and burpees became second nature
" it was very hard at first , " goalie @entity71 said
" i thought to myself , ' am i going to do this ? ' " with @entity18 , @entity74 leaves legacy of hope the teammates held each other accountable for healthy eating as well
if one person was caught drinking soda or chowing down on chocolate , the whole team did extra exercises at the next practice
" the whole team suffered because one person stepped out of line , " @entity53 said
" it helps you learn
... ' i do n't want to do ( any ) more burpees so i 'm going to stop this
' " their efforts paid off
the team blew by its goal of losing a combined 300 pounds before the @entity94
fourteen players dropped a total of 400 pounds in preparation for their trip to @entity99 , @entity100
@entity101 , a @entity102 diabetic , got to significantly cut back on his insulin injections
@entity104 now shops for dresses that are six sizes smaller
@entity53 , one of the team 's biggest losers , dropped more than 50 pounds
" i 'm so proud of them , and i 'm proud of myself , " @entity53 said
" i feel great now
i feel like now everything that i 've been wanting is coming
" @entity104 used to have trouble making it through more than three minutes of a floor hockey game
" i could n't move as fast ... because i was always getting tired , " she said
but working out consistently and eating healthier has upped her game
" i 'm able to be on a run all the time , " @entity104 said
" i hope i never come back to being the way i used to be
" one teen 's journey to @entity18 the weight loss has affected more than his team 's physical abilities , @entity2 said
they 've become more confident , working harder on and off the court
" we have a saying in our team that we 're champions , but we 're champions in everything we do , " @entity2 said
" we 're champions in how we work , how we walk around and how we want to live our lives
i think the exercise and nutrition program is just part of that
" @entity53 has even learned to control his anger issues , whether that 's an effect of the weight loss or his team 's continuous support is unclear
he plans to continue losing weight after the team returns home ; he wants to drop from 350 to 280 pounds
" this is forever , " he said
" i 'm not going to stop doing it
no matter what happens , i 'm not going to quit
" @entity18 takes on use of ' @entity149 '
