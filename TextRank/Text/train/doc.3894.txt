@entity0 , @entity1 -- rescue workers searched wednesday for six elderly people missing at @entity5 , one of three villages in southwest @entity1 that was hit monday by a wave of toxic red sludge from an alumina plant reservoir that burst
wearing chemical protection suits , the workers used metal sticks to poke through muck three - feet deep ( 1 meter ) for the presumed victims , reported @entity15 , @entity1 's official news agency
at least 116 people were injured , eight of them seriously , when the mishap occurred monday afternoon , the agency said
most of them were flown to hospitals in the capital , @entity24
the reservoir has been repaired and the flow from the pool has halted
but the material that flowed out of the reservoir continued to pose a threat
on wednesday , more than 500 @entity31 staffers and soldiers and employees of @entity34 and @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , the company that owns the alumina plant 's reservoir , were trying to halt the advance of the sludge before it reaches the @entity43 's tributaries , said @entity44 , head of the defense committee , according to @entity15
the sludge had already reached the @entity47 , which flows into the @entity48 , which empties into the @entity43
it was expected to show up in the @entity43 as soon as this weekend , said @entity49 , head of @entity51 's defense authority , @entity15 said
emergency workers were pouring plaster and fertilizers into the @entity47 in hopes that it would bind with the sludge and counter its alkalinity before it reached the @entity43 , the continent 's second - longest river , some 70 km ( 43 miles ) north , reported @entity15
but the material will have been neutralized by the time it reaches the @entity48 , interior minister @entity60 told reporters
untreated , the sludge contains heavy metals , which cause burns and eye irritation , he said
four people -- two children ages 1 and 3 , an elderly woman and a 35 - year - old man whose suv overturned in the sludge -- have been confirmed dead in the environmental disaster , which occurred 160 km ( 99 miles ) west of @entity24 , near the town of @entity77
residents were advised not to eat produce from gardens that were covered when the dam burst , releasing at least 1 million cubic meters of thick red mud
it was not clear when residents evacuated from affected areas in the villages of @entity5 , @entity0 and @entity87 would be able to return home , nor were the long - term consequences clear
a state of emergency has been declared in three counties , the @entity90 said
in a statement on its website , @entity36 said it " offers its honest condolences to the relatives of all of the victims who lost their lives in the catastrophe
