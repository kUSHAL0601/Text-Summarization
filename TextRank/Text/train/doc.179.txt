-- in the wake of the @entity3 and the global financial crisis , focus has been on the world 's new and so - called " disrupted society
" but i would avoid using such a negative phrase for @entity9 ; which is where i live and which has avoided the severity of the uprisings in other @entity14 countries
while some might point to a " disrupted society , " i call our world an " enriched and awakened society
" it is a society of potential , innovation , and opportunity
youth dominate the globe -- the 3.5 billion people under the age of 30 make up half of the world 's population
therefore , we have an impact on our own lives today , and we are the decision makers of our lives tomorrow
so how do we react to such opportunities , and what do we do with such potential that resides within us ? do we add water and sunlight so it can sprout , or do we suppress it with darkness and ignorance ? it is said that @entity45 youth have faced tough challenges since the @entity3
but this is not unusual
youth all around the world have faced unemployment , high tuition fees , and tough economic situations for years
it is these challenges that allow for innovation and creativity to be born
this is when and where we unleash our potential
@entity9 's youth are not completely satisfied with the performance of the public sector , nor are they satisfied with their ability to participate in the decision making process
these frustrations , coupled with difficult economic times , have created an unstable environment and resulted in the launch of initiatives to engage youth as active citizens in political , economic , and social decision - making
but unemployment in @entity9 and the @entity14 did not take us by surprise during the @entity3
high unemployment was present in the @entity14 , and in almost every country around the world , for many years before the uprising
the impact , however , has been far more painful as the world faltered under the economic downturn
the domino effect of the economic crisis hit the developed countries first , and then reached the developing nations of the @entity14
when it hit @entity9 it was , by coincidence , around the same time of the @entity3
therefore , it is important to note that the @entity3 was n't a mere result of unemployment , nor was it a complete call for democracy and freedom
the @entity3 was simply a call for change : change in ideologies , change in direction , change in hope
unemployment is a major issue in the @entity14 and @entity104 region , especially in @entity9
the official rate is 11 % , and unofficial estimates are about twice that figure
generous employment opportunities in the public sector have eased the pressure , but the debt crisis facing the government has been hindering its ability to help
policy makers are now pressed to come up with solutions to empower the private sector and improve the education system
many of the world 's young are uncertain of their future and their ability to find meaningful employment
@entity9 's young have some of the region 's most sought - after talents , due to their high quality of education and hard - working attitudes
regretfully , their productivity is not contributing to @entity9 's economy , as they can not find competitive salaries or similar opportunities
therefore , many look for jobs abroad , particularly in the @entity137
yet , there is still hope for @entity9
the entrepreneurship scene is expanding , and more of the country 's young are establishing companies
i believe the young can rise and flourish -- especially in today 's tough climate -- by thinking about their " sphere of influence
" we should collaborate with individuals from our region by crossing borders , creating partnerships , and exploring ideas
travel between @entity14 counties can be challenging due to visa requirements , but the virtual world eliminates such boundaries
technological advances unite us in ways we should be united
and we must remember that divided we are as fragile as separate fingers , but united we are a strong fist
three years ago , the @entity3 signified hope
now , @entity9 youth have witnessed the negative transformations in neighboring countries such as @entity166 and @entity167
@entity9 youth are smart and will not allow their country to head towards that same path
but the need for security and stability must be accompanied by reform and growth
i do not believe the @entity3 caused a " disrupted society
" rather , the @entity3 has created an opportunity that allows things " out of the norm " to occur
such an @entity3 encourages innovation and creativity ; it allows for thoughts and ideas to sprout that were once dormant
therefore , i advise my fellow @entity45 to prepare , strategize , and implement with utmost passion , wisdom , and honesty
