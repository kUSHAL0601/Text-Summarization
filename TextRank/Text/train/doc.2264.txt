-- it 's not your imagination : our politics are more polarized than at any point in recent history
that 's the conclusion of a new survey from the indispensable @entity10
and if you needed more evidence of the passionate and sometimes poisonous polarization afflicting our nation , you did n't have to look further than the crowds in @entity16 on tuesday night after the recall attempt
here 's the real wake - up call : @entity19 are more divided about partisan politics right now than they are about race , class , gender and age
that 's right : forget the original sin of slavery and the longstanding fights over civil rights -- those old divisions now seem small compared with perceptions of whether a person is a @entity33 or @entity34
welcome to the new bigotry , where a person 's partisan identification is a source of prejudice , seen as a reflection of fundamentally different values , representative of an alien @entity19
like any form of prejudice , this is learned behavior , exacerbated by the daily drumbeat of partisan media
conservatives are led to believe that liberals are essentially less patriotic and secretly socialist , while some liberals believe that conservatives are bigoted @entity54 thumpers
the mutual distrust leads members of different parties to feel unfairly judged by the other side , further fueling polarization -- and so fellow @entity19 divide into warring camps , us against them
partisan difference did n't always seem like an unbridgeable divide
but over the past 25 years , the split on basic values between @entity33 and @entity66 has skyrocketed
for example , on the issue of the environment , at the end of the @entity71 era , 86 % of @entity33 and 93 % of @entity66 believed that " there needs to be stricter laws and regulations to protect the environment
" that broad consensus has fallen apart -- now , 47 % of @entity33 support that statement , while @entity66 ' sentiment remains the same
likewise , take a look at attitudes regarding the social safety net -- a quarter century ago 62 % of @entity33 and 79 % of @entity66 believed that government should " take care of people that could not take care of themselves
" today , 40 % of @entity33 believe in that aspect of the social contract , while 75 % of @entity66 still do
what happened to compassionate conservatism ? these policy divides reflect increased ideological and demographic differences between the two parties
over two - thirds of @entity33 self - identify as conservative and 87 % are @entity96 white , with an average age of 50
democrats are evenly split between liberals and centrists , more racially diverse than ever before and less likely to be religious or have " old - fashioned values about family and marriage
" there is however a hopeful sign beneath the hyper - partisanship -- a healthy rebellion against this division and consequent dysfunction in @entity110
according to the @entity10 survey , a record number of @entity19 are declaring their independence and proactively rejecting both the @entity33 and @entity66 parties
in fact , there are more independents than @entity66 or @entity33
it is a direct reaction against the unprecedented polarization of the two parties
and this ai n't no mushy middle
as in surveys past , we can see that independent voters tend to be closer on economic issues to @entity33 and closer to @entity66 on social issues
most importantly , while the two parties are deeply polarized , independent voters ' attitudes on issues most closely parallel the @entity19 people as a whole
at heart , most @entity19 are nonideological problem - solvers , and that 's a quality we see less and less of in our politicians
why does this growing polarization matter ? first , because it is resulting in an inability of the two parties to reason together on pressing issues such as improving the economy or dealing with the deficit and the debt
but more broadly , it risks undermining a core bit of @entity19 wisdom expressed in our national motto -- e pluribus unum : out of many , one
democracy requires competing political parties , but they are not supposed to take the place of tribal affiliations
that they are is evidence of group - think that pushes the idea that people who think differently about politics or policy are not merely mistaken but a clear and present danger to the @entity162
that 's the way political opponents become enemies -- even ( and especially ) if we do n't know them personally
changing the culture of hyper - partisanship will take time
it requires pushing back at the constant drumbeat of partisan media that polarizes in the pursuit of profit
it requires showing that there is a strong alternative , a better way to conduct civic debates
but this effort is essential to restoring common sense and collegiality to our politics
we can take comfort from the wise words of the original founding father , @entity190 , who devoted a considerable portion of his farewell address to warning against the dangers and distortions of hyper - partisanship : " one of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts , " he wrote
" you can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations ; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .
