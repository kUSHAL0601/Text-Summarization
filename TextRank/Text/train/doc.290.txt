-- hosts @entity1 needed a stunning late strike from substitute @entity3 to salvage a 1 - 1 draw against @entity5 in the @entity7 opener friday night
@entity1 could not break down the underdogs in the first half and just two minutes after the break it was @entity5 who took a shock lead as @entity14 backheeled a corner past @entity1 goalkeeper @entity16
@entity17 might have put the game out of @entity1 's reach as he beat the offside trap but @entity16 was alert to push the ball away from him before saving a follow - up effort
a jittery @entity1 , with @entity23 well below his best , had to wait until 13 minutes from time for the equalizer
@entity25 chested down a cross from @entity27 and @entity29 star @entity3 volleyed home spectacularly
@entity3 had a late chance to give the hosts an undeserved win but @entity5 goalkeeper @entity34 saved smartly
the opening match of the 12 - team tournament was held in @entity37 and a win for @entity1 , with the likes of @entity23 and @entity40 in their ranks , was considered almost a foregone conclusion by the home faithful
but @entity5 played to the standard that had seen them humiliate @entity1 6 - 1 in the high altitude of @entity47 during the last round of @entity50 qualifying
" it is not what we expected , now we must improve and win our remaining matches , " @entity51 star @entity23 told gathered reporters after the draw
@entity1 's arch - rivals @entity58 will be looking to win their fifth @entity7 title in six and open against @entity61 on sunday
the 12 teams are divided into three groups of four , with the top two in each group and the two best third - placed teams reaching the quarterfinal knockout stage .
