he was my dear friend for nearly four decades
although we would have disagreements over the years , they never interfered with our friendship and commitment to each other

" " i met the real @entity4 on only one occasion when he actually came and played himself on an episode of ' @entity109 , ' " recalled @entity110 , who played @entity111

i did not get to know him but the fact that he allowed himself and his beloved team to be satirized on our show is an indication to me of his true character
" @entity120 catcher @entity95 called @entity4 a " great friend

... it 's only fitting that he went out as a world champ , " he said in a statement
in an interview tuesday on @entity0 's " @entity150 , " @entity139 said , " he did scream , he did get loud , but when you closed that door there was a human side of him too
that 's one thing , when you work with @entity4 ...
you ca n't pick and choose the parts you like
you have to understand that it 's the whole package
" @entity0 sports contributor @entity161 said , " @entity4 is the most famous owner in sports , really maybe in the history of @entity167 team sports -- it 's a very big deal
he was an ongoing character on ' @entity109
' ... @entity4 has made his way into popular culture , into the cultural consciousness
" @entity4 was born on july 4 , 1930 , in @entity173 , @entity174
his mother , he once said , imbued him with a compassion for the underdog
he told the @entity178 in 1978 that he " never really appreciated " his father when he was growing up but that now he " ca n't give enough credit " to him
" anything i ever accomplish i owe to him , " he said then
now a baseball icon , @entity4 began his major league ownership career in 1973 after he bought the @entity3 from @entity185 for $ 8.7 million
@entity4 was chairman of the board of the @entity187 , which had an estimated $ 180 million in sales in 1978
his other ventures including political fundraising , backing of @entity192 plays , an interest in the @entity195 basketball team , ownership of the thoroughbred @entity197 in @entity29 and an extensive holdings in banking operations and @entity29 real estate
@entity4 was for decades the most colorful , controversial and domineering owner in baseball
he demanded victory from his teams and managers , firing managers who did n't deliver
famously , he hired and fired manager @entity207 half a dozen times in the 1970s and 1980s when the @entity3 dominated baseball
he was willing to shatter ideas about what baseball players should be paid to stack his teams with stars , starting with pitcher @entity215 and slugger @entity216 in the 1970s and continuing up to the present with @entity24 and @entity218
but @entity4 did n't always know where to draw the line on payments , and stepped over it at least twice -- with illegal campaign contributions to @entity224 in 1974 , and with a $ 40,000 payment to a gambler for damaging information about a player
he was suspended from baseball for the @entity224 contribution and banned for life for the payment to gambler @entity233 , according to @entity76
he was reinstated three years later
he often starred in commercials lampooning himself , including a commercial in which he chewed out @entity24 for partying
on his 80th birthday last week , @entity4 thanked fans , friends and family for their good wishes
" i am very fortunate to have the love and support of a great family and many , many friends
the @entity3 and their fans are a large part of what keeps me going
it means a lot , " he said
@entity252 mayor @entity251 said , " this is a sad day not only for @entity3 fans , but for our entire city , as few people have had a bigger impact on @entity252 over the past four decades than @entity4
@entity4 was a larger - than - life @entity252 figure whose passion and drive to succeed will forever be missed
" funeral arrangements will be private , the family said , adding there will be an additional public service with details to be announced at a later date
@entity4 's death marks the second loss in so many days for @entity3 veterans
@entity4 called @entity272 " a good friend and fine man whose voice set the gold standard for @entity167 's sports announcers
" @entity0 producer @entity278 contributed to this report
