-- for some , going to work after losing a son would be unthinkable
for others , it 's a way to cope
that 's the route @entity7 running back @entity6 took , choosing to play sunday , just two days after the death of his son , who was living with his mother in @entity12
the woman 's 27 - year - old boyfriend , @entity15 @entity13 , has been arrested on felony battery and assault charges in the child 's death , according to @entity20 , @entity12 , police
" even if it 's bad , i try and take the good from it
that 's the way i approach life , with all situations , " @entity6 told reporters after the game
" i never thought about not playing
it was all about going out there and praying that i had the strength to get through and help my team , so that was my focus
" @entity6 , who rushed for a season - low 62 yards and caught three passes for 21 yards in the @entity7 ' 35 - 10 loss to the @entity37 , took some heat for the decision from people who questioned how he could play a football game so soon after losing a child
in a text to a @entity45 reporter , @entity6 said he decided to play sunday for the same reason he participated in the @entity48 's skills testing event for potential draft picks a day after his brother died in 2007
" @entity55 wants good to come from it , " he told @entity48 on @entity52 sideline reporter @entity51 in a text before the game sunday
" we mourn and grieve , but heaven had the baddest welcoming party for my son
that knowledge gives me peace , " @entity6 said , according to @entity45
" i 'm still hurt and feel the pain of life , but i 'm able to function because of the peace and joy of knowing my loved ones are in a much better place
" @entity6 confirmed the child was his in a tweet friday
he tweeted that another child , @entity6 , lives with him and is fine , and he asked people to stop distributing pictures of that child
on friday , he tweeted thanks to fellow players , some of whom had taken to the social network to defend his decision to play
" the @entity48 is a fraternity of brothers and i am thankful for the tweets , phone calls and text messages from my fellow players , " he tweeted friday
after sunday 's game , @entity6 's teammate , tight end @entity84 , praised @entity6 's determination and heart
" i ca n't imagine , you know , the heavy heart that he had today , being out on the field , " @entity84 said
" but he spoke to us right before the game , right before he took the field and said he was going to give it his all , for all four quarters , and that 's exactly what he did
" " he said , ' i 'm going to give it my all , and i expect you guys to do the same , ' " @entity84 said
" for a guy like that , how can you not ? "
