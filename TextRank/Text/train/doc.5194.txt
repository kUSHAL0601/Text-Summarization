@entity0 -- more than any other @entity4 lawmaker , sen. @entity2 has aggressively gone after nontraditional @entity4 voters in the past year , trying to lure @entity6 and independents into his party 's column as he considers a presidential bid
so it seemed odd last week when the libertarian - leaning senator from @entity13 made a partisan joke about the prisoner swap that secured @entity18 sgt. @entity17 's release
" mr. president , you love to trade people
why do n't we set up a trade ? but this time , instead of five @entity28 , how about five @entity6 , " @entity2 said friday to cheers at the @entity26 @entity4 convention in @entity27
the @entity30 administration released five @entity32 detainees in exchange for @entity17 , who had been held captive for five years and was handed over to @entity35 forces at the @entity38 - @entity37 border on may 31
to help bring back a @entity35 marine currently detained in @entity40 , @entity2 suggested trading " @entity41 , @entity42 , ( and ) @entity43
" " could n't we send them to @entity40 ? " the audience roared
as would be expected , @entity2 's joke ignited a firestorm
his comment made national headlines , and the @entity50 called his remarks " completely out of line " and uncivilized
@entity50 press secretary @entity53 said the joke showed " how unserious " @entity2 is on foreign policy and argued he was trying to score cheap shots by riling the base
and as would be expected , conservative blogs and commentators found it funny -- even " hilarious " -- and argued critics had no sense of humor
the following day , saturday , @entity2 returned to @entity13 to help open the first state @entity4 office in the urban area of @entity67 , where he reiterated that the @entity4 has to be a " more diverse party
" it 's a theme he has taken on the road this past year , visiting areas unfamiliar to @entity4 , such as the @entity72 , a liberal hotbed
he has also traveled to inner - city @entity74 and @entity75 , as well as historically black colleges to help spread the @entity4 message to @entity50 - leaning audiences
@entity2 : @entity4 must reconnect with @entity79 and just last month , he told a @entity13 radio station that people are looking for a leader in @entity0 who carries " the best parts of what @entity4 stand for and also some of the good things the @entity6 stand for
" so , why make a joke that rips some of the very voters you 're trying to attract ? political experts say @entity2 is testing out his campaign language before it starts to count in the run - up to the 2016 presidential election
" he 's really trying to figure out what he can and ca n't get away with on the stump , " said @entity4 operative @entity93
" if he ca n't broaden his appeal in the @entity4 primary , there is no general election
" @entity2 is also trying to place daylight between himself and other potential @entity4 candidates , @entity93 continued , as the @entity4 still lacks a clear frontrunner for 2016
known for his non-interventionist views , @entity2 has to convince @entity4 donors and voters that he 's strong enough to be commander in chief , @entity93 said
@entity2 responds to @entity4 criticism of his foreign policy views his joke was the latest in a string of comments last week expressing frustration with the @entity30 administration over the @entity17 swap
on @entity115 , @entity2 said he 's not sure the prisoner exchange would have been a good deal , even " if we were trading for a @entity120 winner , much less trading for somebody who may well have been a deserter
" while @entity93 argued the dust - up over @entity2 's @entity28 joke at the convention will be nothing more than a " blip " in the long run , it was nevertheless " out of character " for the senator
" if he continues to do that , it 's obvious that he has n't figured out how to brand himself distinctly from the others , " he said
@entity137 , also a @entity4 strategist , argued @entity2 would probably " like to have that one back
" " here he is trying to do outreach , then he delivers a line like this
clearly this statement seems to be at odds with the general direction he 's going , " @entity137 said
" the remark was just unacceptable
" @entity2 highlights bigger @entity4 ' tent ' in meeting with top @entity148 donors talking to reporters in @entity26 after his speech , @entity2 said his comment was simply a joke
" except for @entity43 , i was serious about her , " he added , tongue fully planted in cheek
" it 's humor , and i hope there 's room for humor , " he continued after being asked about the comment again
" i thought it was funny
it was meant to be humorous
" @entity137 , however , stressed that @entity2 would be better off staying on message , not offering " some trite , strange comment
" " i think up to this point in many ways he has engaged voters on a substance level -- that 's why this particular statement was so dissonant , " he said
others say he was just serving up some red meat in the @entity26
@entity173 , a @entity4 consultant in @entity26 , said @entity2 's comment was in tune with the rabble - rousing rhetoric so often heard at state conventions held by either party
" it was a line designed for partisans , to be responded to by partisans , " @entity173 said
" that quote happened in a vacuum to the outside world , but it did n't happen in a vacuum to those who were there at the convention and listening to other speeches
" @entity2 criticizes the @entity190 , urges @entity4 to engage minorities six analysts agreed that @entity2 's comment is unlikely to have a long - term effect if he decides to run for president
it 's still early , they say , and almost all candidates make controversial statements along the way
" i ca n't imagine that this will have an impact on @entity2 's political career , one way or another , " said @entity4 strategist @entity199 , adding the joke was n't all that funny
" when you are serving red meat to a crowd , sometimes it is served very raw
" sometimes jokes can hurt a person politically if the comments mirror a deep - seated public fear about that individual , said presidential historian @entity216
as an example , @entity216 cited sen. @entity219 's 2007 joke where the then - presidential candidate parodied a @entity222 song and called for the bombing of @entity224
he also referenced @entity226 's 2012 comment in which the @entity4 strategist joked about murdering then - rep. @entity228 , whose disastrous comments about rape ultimately cost him the @entity232 race in @entity233
but @entity216 argued @entity2 's outreach efforts and his work with @entity6 on legislation -- such as measures aimed to limit the @entity239 's domestic reach -- will outweigh any partisan jokes like the one he made last week
" if the debate centers around bipartisanship and who has the most appeal from both sides , then let the debate begin , " @entity216 said
" " it is early , and he has to reassure his @entity4 base before he starts tapping the wide appeal he has among youth and others across the partisan divide , " he added
" the fact that liberals jumped on this reveals their concern about that appeal
