@entity0 -- the inspector general at the @entity3 is asking airports to deliver personal information on workers who have access to secure or sensitive areas
a memo sent to airport security badge offices by a senior analyst at the department is asking for the names , @entity15 numbers , birthdates and 13 other personal data points in a review of the @entity20 's credentialing process
the procedure for obtaining the information and the number or type of workers to be covered were not immediately known thursday
the request is not timed to the busy @entity27 travel season
it appears to be a test of @entity20 security procedures
the information is due to the @entity3 by november 22
@entity32 , which has 575 members worldwide , is urging its member airports to hold off on sending the information until more guidance is available
a @entity3 annual performance plan called for the information
" @entity20 has the statutory responsibility for requiring employment investigations , including a criminal history record check and a review of available law enforcement databases and other records for individuals who have unescorted access to the secure areas of airports and aircraft , " it said
a transportation official familiar with the request told @entity1 it came in late wednesday afternoon , giving airports just two business days before the busy @entity27 week to comply
one major @entity56 airport may have as many as 40,000 to 50,000 badged workers , the official said
airports submit monthly information to the @entity20 , but the request this week requires additional information and the agency is not being flexible , the official said
" this is going to require some heavy lifting by the airports , " the official told @entity1
airports are already dealing with increased security and are preparing to handle the holiday crush , the official said .
