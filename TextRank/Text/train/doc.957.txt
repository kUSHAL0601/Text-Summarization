@entity0 -- the recent health crisis for former @entity6 ruler @entity5 started when he slipped in a prison bathroom , his attorney told @entity1 thursday
the ousted strongman hurt his neck and developed a blood clot after the fall in @entity13 , attorney @entity8 said
@entity8 said @entity5 was taken off life - support equipment and his health improved on wednesday , a day after grim and contradictory news emerged over the 84 - year - old man 's health
the state - run @entity19 reported that he was " clinically dead
" the nation 's military rulers denied the report , with one general saying @entity5 's health was deteriorating and he was in critical condition
@entity5 was transferred from @entity13 to @entity27
now , @entity8 said , his ailing client is out of a coma and under the care of doctors at the facility 's intensive care unit
" he had slipped in the bathroom of @entity13 and hurt his neck , which caused a blood clot that started all his medical problems that night , last tuesday , including heart attack and irregular breathing , " @entity8 said
he said he had warned before that " the prison hospital was not equipped with well - trained nurses or personnel to assist him or proper equipment
" the lawyer said he had n't been informed about how the latest bout of health problems started because he was in @entity48 when @entity5 fell sick
" i was getting information by phone with a minute - to - minute update , but i learned that he fell when i returned to @entity0 , " he said
the hospital , located minutes away from @entity13 , is under heavy security
dozens of @entity5 supporters and opponents stood outside the hospital wednesday and argued
security forces stepped in to prevent clashes
@entity61 is the same hospital where former president @entity63 died after he was shot in 1981
@entity5 became president after the assassination
he ruled @entity6 with an iron hand and as a staunch ally of the @entity68 , which gives the nation $ 1.3 billion a year in military aid
more than 800 people died and 6,000 were wounded during the uprising that ended @entity5 's 29 - year rule in february 2011
@entity5 and his former interior minister , @entity74 , were convicted of ordering security forces to kill anti-government protesters and this month were given life terms
but other top aides -- as well as @entity5 's two sons , who had been tried on corruption charges -- were acquitted
@entity8 appealed the verdict four days after it was issued
he has until august 1 to submit a memo indicating the reasons for the appeal prior to his sentencing , @entity5 was already suffering from health problems ; he attended court on a gurney
he had been in @entity13 for 17 days until he was transferred to @entity61
some citizens thought the @entity5 health scare was staged to focus attention away from the controversies over @entity6 's elections
reports of @entity5 's failing health have taken a back seat to the political and constitutional turmoil in the country
@entity6 's @entity104 has delayed , from thursday until a date to be announced , the release of the results of @entity6 's presidential election , state - run @entity100 reported wednesday
" the committee has not completed the verification of a total of 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two presidential candidates , " said @entity106 , a senior member of electoral committee
" most probably the announcement of the election results will be delayed a day or two but nothing is final yet
" the results of last weekend 's runoff between @entity118 , the last prime minister to serve under @entity5 , and @entity120 , the @entity121 candidate , remain uncertain
@entity118 and @entity122 each proclaimed himself winner in the race to succeed @entity5 16 months after a popular uprising ended his three - decade rule
military rulers dissolved the lower house of parliament last week , extending their power and sparking accusations of a coup
the military council announced it had full legislative authority
the @entity121 , the country 's largest @entity135 group , was the dominant party in the parliament
under an interim constitutional declaration released monday , the military council retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution is written and a new parliament elected
the declaration says @entity151 members " shall decide all matters related to military affairs , including the appointment of its leaders
" the president has the power to declare war , it says , but only " after the approval " of the @entity151 .
