-- an @entity2 bishop resigned wednesday following a government report into the sexual abuse of children by catholic clergy -- the second to do so
bishop @entity8 was not directly criticized in the @entity9 , but was a member of the @entity12 archdiocese leadership for more than a decade before it put proper protections for children in place , he said
@entity8 said he " should have challenged the prevailing culture " of protecting the church rather than children when he was an auxiliary bishop in @entity12 from 1991 to 2002
" i know that any action now on my part does not take away the suffering that people have endured , " he said in a written statement
" i again apologize to all the survivors and their families
i have today offered my resignation as bishop of @entity29 & @entity30 to the holy father
i hope it honors the truth that the survivors have so bravely uncovered and opens the way to a better future for all concerned
" the @entity36 had no immediate comment on the resignation
@entity8 has been a priest for 48 years , he said in the statement
" i fully accept the overall conclusion ... that the attempts by church authorities to ' protect the church ' and to ' avoid scandal ' had the most dreadful consequences for children and were deeply wrong , " @entity8 said after the government report came out last month
bishop @entity48 , the bishop of @entity49 , resigned on december 17
@entity48 was named in the 720 - page report that found the @entity51 and other @entity53 authorities in @entity2 covered up clerical child abuse from 1975 to 2004
child sexual abuse was " widespread " then , the report found
the report by the @entity58 , which was set up in march 2006 to look into the abuse allegations , did not say @entity48 was guilty of abuse but that he failed to report it
@entity48 was " aware for many years of complaints and / or suspicions of clerical child sexual abuse in the archdiocese , " the report found
it said he dealt " badly " with a number of complaints and suspicions of abuse , and that his failings in at least one instance were " inexcusable
" @entity48 resigned under a canon law that requires bishops who have become unsuited for the fulfillment of their office to resign , the @entity36 said
pope @entity77 met with senior @entity2 bishops at the @entity36 a week before @entity48 's resignation and said he was " deeply disturbed and distressed " by the report 's findings
he promised that the @entity53 would try to develop strategies to make sure the abuses do n't happen again
@entity0 's @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 , contributed to this report .
