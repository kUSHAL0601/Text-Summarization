-- dear @entity1 , @entity1 and @entity1 , my name is @entity4 , and i , too , am a survivor of a kidnapping
my sister and i were kidnapped by my baby sitter
in 1974 , at the age of 4 , i was forced to live like a fugitive on the run , from cheap motel to cheap motel -- sometimes sleeping in cars
i endured extreme abuse and neglect during my entire childhood
i only went to school for a few months or weeks at a time , till we would go on the run again
i was able to get away when i was 12
my kidnapper died in 1986 , when i was 16
i had a very difficult time adjusting to the normal world
@entity1 , @entity25 and @entity1 , it is so wonderful that all of you are alive and survived your ordeal
my heart is with you all
hearing about your story , i felt it was important to share with you my journey to healing and recovery from kidnapping
it is important that you know that you are not alone
you have the love and support of your families , your community and other kidnapping victims who were rescued or escaped
you are all survivors , and you will continue to survive
it 's been nearly 40 years since the kidnapping , and i am still healing
it will be my lifetime work
i was diagnosed with severe @entity47 and anxiety and have learned to manage my disorders with acupuncture and @entity52 herbs , which help calm my nervous system after the trauma my body has endured
yoga helps tame my mind by using my breath to find peace and calm after many years of trauma
i also went to the @entity63 foundation for intensive reunification healing with my family last summer in 2012
i am learning how to function in society again and most important , learning how to live again
i went back to college and should graduate in 2014
i offer you hope on this next part of your life journey
it will not be easy , but you can overcome and even thrive
my prayers are with you and your families as you come through this horrible ordeal
i will never forget what happened to me and will never understand how or why this it had to happen -- but i can not change the past , so i must keep going forward
during my kidnapping , i lost my entire identity and could n't remember my real name
i wanted to know who i really was and where my parents were
i contacted attorney @entity85 , and we decided to go to the media to tell my story in the hope that my parents would contact me
that is exactly what happened
" @entity94 " aired my story in 2011 , and 37 years after my kidnapping , my real mother found me by seeing me on the show
despite being my biological mother , she had to formally adopt me
i believe i survived for a reason , in order to keep telling my story and document my own personal healing process
the healing process has been difficult but not impossible
sometimes the transition from captivity to freedom can be almost as difficult as the transition from freedom to captivity
that certainly was the case for me
i am truly grateful to be alive and to be able to share with you
as you continue to come through your ordeal , just remember to take one day , one hour , one breath at a time
you strong , brave women are in my thoughts and prayers
peace , love and many blessings , @entity4 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity4 .
