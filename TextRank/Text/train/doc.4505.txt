-- @entity1 completed his hat - trick of sprint titles at the @entity4 in @entity5 as he helped the all - conquering @entity7 side power to victory in the men 's 4x100m relay final
@entity1 ( second right ) celebrates his third gold medal after helping @entity7 to victory in the 4x100m relay
@entity1 ran the third leg , handing off to individual bronze medallist @entity15 , as @entity7 champions @entity7 took gold in a new championship record of 37.31 seconds
@entity7 had rested @entity1 and @entity15 in the heats and were always red - hot favorites to win
" i was n't really thinking about getting three gold medals because i could be in better shape , " @entity1 , who broke his own world records in the 100 and 200m with times of 9.58 and 19.19 respectively , told trackside reporters
@entity25 , who chased @entity7 home in @entity27 last year , again took silver with @entity29 claiming the bronze medal
the @entity31 were disqualified on friday for an illegal baton change despite winning their semifinal
@entity7 's victory , their seventh gold medal of the games , ensured the nation won both sprint relays after their women claimed gold in the women 's 4x100m relay earlier on saturday
individual 100m champion @entity45 led the team to victory in a time of 42.06 seconds to take gold ahead of the @entity50 , while @entity51 pulled off a surprise to claim third place
defending champions the @entity31 failed to reach the final when @entity56 struggled to get hold of the baton on the second handover from @entity60 and stumbled before pulling up with a hamstring injury
the @entity31 relay performances in @entity5 's have been a carbon copy of last year 's @entity64 where neither team reached the final or finished their heat
elsewhere , @entity68 's @entity67 comfortably won the men 's marathon with a well - timed break in the last four miles of the race
@entity67 produced a sustained burst to pull clear of team - mate @entity74 and win gold in a championship record time of two hours six minutes and 54 seconds
@entity74 finished 54 seconds behind in second position while @entity79 's @entity7 bronze medallist @entity78 again took third place
@entity68 were celebrating again when @entity81 outsprinted defending champion @entity82 of @entity79 to win the women 's 5,000 meters
@entity81 , a @entity84 finalist at 16 , who won silver in the last worlds in @entity87 in 2007 , had led for much of the race but was overtaken by @entity82 with 150 metres to go to the finish
it looked like @entity82 would be celebrating an @entity79 gold in the absence of injured team - mate and @entity7 champion @entity94 , but @entity81 produced a stunning fightback to cross first in 14 minutes 57.98 seconds
as @entity82 eased off in the knowledge that she had been beaten , @entity81 's compatriot @entity96 stole in for silver in 14:58.33 , for the second one - two podium finish for @entity68 following the men 's marathon
the result was a blow to @entity79 , for whom @entity7 champion and world recorder holder @entity94 was injured but would have been pre-race favorite if fit
in the field events , @entity7 champion @entity107 of @entity108 added the men 's pole vault title to his @entity27 crown by clearing 5.90 meters
the 27 - year - old , whose personal best of 6.06m makes him the second highest vaulter in history , showed his confidence by sitting out the early rounds and only came in at 5.85m which he failed to clear
but he opted to raise the bar and nailed 5.90m at his first attempt which was enough to give him the gold medal with @entity124 @entity123 and @entity125 claiming silver and bronze
@entity31 @entity128 regained his men 's long jump title to fulfill his dream of winning in the same stadium and same event where @entity134 triumphed at the 1936 @entity64
the 31 - year - old , the 2004 @entity7 champion and 2003 and 2005 world champion , won gold with 8.54 meters to beat @entity140 's @entity7 silver medalist @entity139 ( 8.47m ) while @entity108 's @entity141 took bronze ( 8.37m )
@entity144 's @entity143 won the women 's hammer with a new world record throw of 77.96 meters
the 24 - year - old beat defending champion @entity149 of @entity51 , who took silver with a national record of 77.12m , while @entity152 of @entity153 won the bronze with a throw of 74.79m .
