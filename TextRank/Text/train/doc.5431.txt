-- @entity1 is claiming responsibility for the destruction of a @entity5 convoy in western @entity6 last week that killed some 48 @entity7 and nine @entity6 soldiers
the militant group released a statement on jihadist forums monday
the group claims it intercepted the convoy while the @entity7 troops were on their way to camps secretly provided by the @entity6 government
the militants said everyone in the convoy was killed
the attack has raised concerns that @entity7 's civil war could spill over into @entity6
" from the beginning , we have warned that some militant groups want to move the conflict in @entity7 to @entity6 , " @entity24 , an adviser to @entity6 prime minister @entity25 , said last week
" militant groups are very active on the border areas between @entity6 and @entity7
" @entity32 said that many of the @entity7 killed in the ambush had earlier received medical treatment in @entity6
they were wounded during a battle at the @entity38 border crossing
the point is called @entity40 in @entity6 ; @entity38 in @entity7
dozens of @entity7 soldiers and officials took refuge in @entity6 by surrendering to that country 's army on march 1 after rebels took over the @entity38 post , @entity6 security officials said
they added that the convoy had been headed from @entity38 to the @entity52 border crossing in @entity6 's @entity54 province when it was attacked
the @entity55 has estimated that about 70,000 people have been killed in @entity7 's civil war , which began roughly two years ago .
