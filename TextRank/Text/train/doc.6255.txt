@entity0 -- the growing outcry over how the @entity3 and commissioner @entity4 deal with incidents of domestic violence has reached the nation 's highest office
even president @entity9 has seen the footage of @entity11 running back @entity12 punching his then - fiancee
" the president was shocked by what he saw
let 's put it that way , " @entity16 chief of staff @entity15 said told @entity18 's " @entity17 " on sunday
the incident involving @entity12 is one of several high - profile scandals involving @entity3 players that have spurred complaints that the @entity3 is too lenient on players
a few months after the @entity12 incident , @entity4 suspended him without pay and fined him an additional game check
however , after the @entity33 video so clearly showed the forceful nature of the punch , @entity4 suspended @entity12 indefinitely
last week , the @entity16 addressed the suspension with a statement saying the president believes domestic violence " contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society , " but it was n't clear whether he had seen the video of the incident from inside the elevator
@entity15 said the @entity16 would n't at this point try to characterize how the @entity3 is handling the @entity12 case
but he did speak generally about @entity12 's indefinite suspension
" we all know that @entity12 being suspended indefinitely seems to be exactly the right thing , " @entity15 said
other lawmakers sunday were far more critical of @entity4 and the league
" i have a feeling there 's a lot of people that know stuff , what went on here , " @entity52 sen. @entity51 of @entity53 told @entity1 's " @entity61
" " i 'm waiting to see if there is a major cover - up , if it shows [ @entity4 ] lies , there could be many factual situations where , in fact , he should step down
" @entity51 , a former prosecutor , is one of 16 female senators who sent a letter to @entity4 calling on the football league to institute a " real zero - tolerance policy " in such cases
the @entity3 announced late wednesday that former fbi director @entity73 will lead an independent inquiry into the league 's investigation and how it gathered evidence in the case
" @entity73 's integrity is on the line here , and hopefully he 'll get the facts out , " @entity51 said of the investigation
" the fact that ( the @entity3 ) gave only a two - game suspension and then turn around and after the evidence goes public say , ' oh , oh , we made a mistake
now we 're going to let him go
' i think that 's problematic for the @entity3 and deeply concerning about how they handle these kinds of cases
" sen. @entity95 of @entity96 , who also signed the letter to @entity4 , had scathing words for the @entity3
" i think the way the @entity3 handled this was awful
it was outrageous , " @entity95 told @entity103 's " @entity102
" " they had all the facts they needed
they had a player who admitted to beating his wife
they had video of him dragging her out an elevator
there was nothing left to determine
that player should 've been fired immediately
so we are now looking to the commissioner to enforce a zero - tolerance policy
" @entity95 also said that if @entity4 has covered up what he knew about the @entity12 incident , he should be benched
" initially , i want him to lead the reform to actually create and enforce a zero - tolerance policy
but , given the recent debate , you know , if he lied , if he lied to the @entity129 people , then he has to step down , " she said , " because he wo n't have the force of authority to change how they address these issues
" @entity95 said the bipartisan letter from lawmakers to @entity4 may be merely the beginning of a broader congressional push for more accountability in the @entity3
" if the @entity3 does n't police themselves , then , you know , we will be looking more into it , " she said
" i would n't be surprised if we have hearings
" sen. @entity144 , @entity145 , recently told @entity1 that he would not " rule out " congressional action to force the @entity3 's hand on domestic abuse
in the past , members of @entity150 have leveraged their titles and hearing rooms to press major @entity129 sports leagues to face difficult issues
in 2007 , the @entity155 released the landmark @entity156 on steroid use in @entity159
household names such as @entity161 and @entity162 were named , and @entity159 commissioner @entity163 responded that the report was a " a call to action , and i will act
" baseball fans would eventually see both @entity163 and @entity161 , along with baseball titans @entity167 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 , testify before @entity150
outcry over the @entity3 's response to the @entity12 incident has been compounded by two more recent incidents of domestic violence allegedly involving @entity3 players
@entity178 of the @entity179 was indicted last week by a grand jury in @entity181 on a child abuse charge
shortly afterward , he was placed on the inactive list for his team
the @entity185 placed defensive end @entity186 on the team 's inactive list in a surprise announcement sunday , months after he was convicted of a domestic violence charge
authorities say @entity186 choked his then - girlfriend , threw her around , dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her
@entity186 -- 6 - foot - 4 and 275 pounds -- says he is innocent , and he has appealed a july guilty verdict rendered by a @entity196 judge in @entity197
beyond the @entity200 , @entity199 's second most powerful government official has called on the @entity201 to bench one of its own players involved in a domestic violence investigation
@entity205 , a starting defensive end , was arrested on felony domestic violence charges last month
" the 49ers ' continued insistence on playing @entity205 during his ongoing criminal investigation is a painful affront to every victim of domestic violence and sends a troubling message to our community , " lt. gov. @entity207 and his wife said in a statement
" we strongly urge the 49er organization we grew up revering to do the right thing -- right now -- and bench @entity205 , pending the outcome of his felony domestic violence investigation by @entity225 law enforcement
" @entity205 told @entity1 affiliate @entity226 last month that he could n't say much about what happened
" the truth will come out , " he said
" everybody knows what kind of person i am ... a good - hearted person
" @entity1 's @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .
