-- after playing college football , working as a financial aid adviser and earning a master 's degree , 25 - year - old @entity1 is back in high school
@entity1 is a new teacher at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9
he made the move from @entity11 to @entity9 to join @entity12 , a non-profit organization that recruits non-traditional teachers to improve education for children in low - income communities
@entity1 's passion for education stems from his own experience growing up
he was in a special education program from kindergarten to his senior year , and he felt stigmatized and overlooked
" i never knew why
i never knew my disability , " @entity1 says
" i never had an @entity24 , which is an individualized education program
i never had any of those things
" " just being in the classroom and just knowing that i 'd been given up on sometimes , that i 'm not receiving the work , it was heartbreaking , " he says
a gifted athlete , @entity1 was accepted to the @entity31 on a football scholarship
he later transferred and finished his college career playing for the @entity34
" at @entity34 is where i began a foundation and vision , knowing football is not the only thing that i 'm good at but i 'm also good at being a student , " @entity1 says
" that 's why i began to put in the work as a student , taking that football mentality of working hard every day and lifting weights to the classroom and starting to train my mind
" having found success off the field , @entity1 's goal shifted from playing in the pros to giving back to children who are like he was
he continued his education at @entity34 , earning a master 's degree in special education
then he applied to @entity12
" i felt that i wanted to be involved in the most high - need school but also have the backing of an organization that stood for what i embodied , which was : close the educational achievement gap , " he says
@entity12 began in 1990 after founder @entity62 proposed the idea in her senior thesis at @entity65 as a way to address educational inequality in the @entity68
the basic concept is to recruit highly successful individuals , often recent college graduates , to commit at least two years to teaching in a low - income community
" across the country what we are seeing in our low - income communities , unfortunately , is poverty oftentimes predicts destiny and where kids can go , " says @entity73 , the executive director of @entity12 in @entity74
he adds that " attracting the most promising leaders into these classrooms is difficult
" unlike @entity1 , most participants , called corps members , did not study education
many had never even considered education as a career before joining @entity12
rather , the movement looks for " a substantial set of traits that make them do amazing things in the classrooms and take kids and put them on a path to a much higher life opportunity , " @entity73 says
" some of those things are achievement ... strong track records of leadership , organizational abilities , and just this relentless drive if you hit a problem you 're going to be able to overcome it
" once accepted , corps members attend a summer training institute before the school year starts to get them ready for the classroom
@entity110 was an @entity112 major at @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115
now he is in his second year teaching third - graders at @entity117 in @entity74 , and he coaches football at @entity119 with two other corps members
" for me , seeing that reality that a life can pretty much be determined by the third grade , it really made me care and understand so much more , " he says
" i have this unwavering dedication to it now
" as a first generation college graduate , @entity128 says she " definitely thought that college meant that you did something else beyond teaching
" " i had planned to do research and was planning to continue straight on into grad school and earn a ph.d. , " she says
she applied to the program after a @entity12 alum visited her campus , and she was accepted into the 2001 @entity74 corps
after her stint in the program she moved into administration , and today is in her first year as founding principal at @entity145 in @entity74
" ideally , none on my students ever have to experience the achievement gap , based on the work that we do every day , " @entity128 says
" i 'm still taking with me the mission of ensuring educational equity , but now i get to do it from the earliest grade level possible
" the @entity12 model is not without its critics
in a list attached to a letter to @entity161 , the @entity158 wrote , " @entity12 does not include a sufficiently rigorous teacher preparation program , nor does it yield retention rates that warrant a federal investment in the program , " two points often cited by opponents of the program
@entity12 says that 66 % of its corps members remain in the field of education after their initial commitment , but that does not always mean they stay on as teachers
" there 's the first half of the movement , which is really getting strong teachers , " @entity73 says
" but there 's a second half , which is continue to keep many of these folks in the classrooms but then also build this leadership force to be principals and superintendents and policymakers
" as for @entity1 , he does not intend to remain in the classroom long - term but says his @entity12 experience is still vital to the impact he wants to have in the future
his goal is to become a principal and then a @entity68 senator , addressing educational issues through national policy
" i never want to lead anybody or teach anybody anything i 've never done before , and so i do n't want to be in the classroom or be in a leadership position telling my teachers how to teach , " he says
" and so being in the classroom will show me what the teachers need
