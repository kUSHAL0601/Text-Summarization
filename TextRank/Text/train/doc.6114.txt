@entity1 will change its policy on possession of small amounts of marijuana , giving police officers the option of writing offenders a ticket instead of taking them into custody , city officials said monday at a press conference
mayor @entity13 said the change will remove the stigma of a criminal conviction for many young people who are arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession
such a conviction can prevent people from getting a job or housing , he said
" a summons will not affect their future , " he said
" the policy change , which goes into effect november 19 , will only affect cases involving 25 grams ( .88 ounce ) or less of marijuana , police commissioner @entity26 said
the officer can choose to write a citation , which requires the suspect to appear in court later , @entity26 said
the marijuana would be seized and the person who had the marijuana would continue with their day
the fine for a first offense would usually be $ 100 , officials said
officers will make judgment call if the officer does decide to take the suspect into custody , the suspect would be handcuffed and taken to the station house for fingerprinting and a mugshot , @entity26 said
police did n't specify the penalties but said they 'd be tougher than for a citation
as to how that decision would be made , @entity13 said , " an officer ultimately has to make the judgment on the scene
" if police find somebody smoking marijuana -- as opposed to simply possessing it -- the suspect would have to go through the entire arrest procedure , @entity26 said
people without proper identification or people with outstanding warrants would be taken into custody , he said
@entity68 said misdemeanor marijuana arrests disproportionately affect young people in minority groups in @entity1
he said many job applications ask about arrests or convictions , but not summonses
" we do n't want to saddle someone who made one small mistake with something that will follow them all their lives , " the mayor said
' you will see fewer unnecessary arrests ' @entity68 said the policy change will also free up @entity1 police to concentrate on more serious crimes
the officers wo n't have to spend hours at the station house or in court because of small amounts of marijuana
" you will see fewer unnecessary arrests , " he said , noting that misdemeanor marijuana arrests have declined for several years
voters in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , have voted to legalize recreational marijuana
@entity1 law still bans possession of the drug
the policy shift only changes how police would enforce the existing law
@entity108 and @entity26 said they do not support legalizing recreational marijuana
the policy change was first reported sunday by the @entity112 .
