-- officials are monitoring a remote @entity3 volcano that could launch an ash cloud , potentially threatening intercontinental flights
" @entity9 activity " of @entity10 was detected in satellite data , according to the @entity7
the volcano , also known as @entity10 , is on the @entity12 , southwest of mainland @entity3
" a new lava dome has been observed in the summit crater , " the observatory said tuesday
" there have been no observations of ash emissions or explosive activity during this current lava eruption
" but the volcanic activity could heighten and affect air travel , said @entity23 , a scientist at the @entity24
@entity23 said 90 % of air freight from @entity26 to @entity27 and @entity28 flies over @entity3 air space , and hundreds of flights -- including more than 20,000 passengers -- fly through @entity33 's air space daily
" if there is an explosion and ( ash ) reaches high altitudes , it will causes flights to be rerouted and ultimately canceled , " @entity23 said
the volcano 's most recent significant eruption took place in 2001
it produced three explosions that led to ash clouds as high as 7.5 miles ( 12 kilometers ) above sea level , according to the volcano observatory
" the 2001 eruption also produced a rubbly lava flow and hot avalanche that reached the sea , " the observatory said
last year , volcanic ash spewing from @entity56 's @entity55 volcano forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights across @entity27
the @entity55 eruption came about 13 months after @entity56 's @entity61 volcano belched smoke and ash into the skies , forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights per day at the peak of the problem .
