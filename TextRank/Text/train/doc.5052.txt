there used to be an ad campaign for @entity3 featuring the line , " do you know me ? " @entity7 could probably be its poster boy
the writer and comedian , whose new " the @entity12 " debuts on @entity9 on monday after @entity11 's " @entity10 , " has generally stayed behind the scenes
sure , he 's popped up occasionally on " @entity10 " as " senior black correspondent , " but he 's devoted much of his career to writing and producing
it did n't start out that way
in the 1980s , he dropped out of college to become an actor and stand - up comedian
( you may remember him as a police officer on " @entity26
" ) it was a few years later when he decided to become a tv writer
as @entity7 tells it , he was just being practical
" i knew @entity37 was n't going to find me , " he told @entity31 of his acting years , when the standard casting call wanted black men closer to @entity36 's fast - talking types
" i needed to be able to control my own destiny
being an actor was too flighty
" after success as a writer for " in @entity42 , " " @entity43 " and " @entity44 , " he turned producer with " @entity46 , " the animated @entity36 show , and the offbeat " @entity48
" he had returned to standup and done some hosting with a touring show called " @entity7 's @entity51 , " but was ready to go back to producing as the show runner for " black - ish
" instead , he decided to stay in front of the camera to host " the @entity12 , " which is taking over the " @entity55 " time slot
he does n't seem intimidated
not only is he going to be in @entity58 's old offices and using his old studio , " i 'm also moving into @entity61 's house and driving his old car , " he told @entity63
@entity7 grew up in the @entity65 area , where comedy was a regular part of his growing up
it 's still a family affair : his brother @entity69 is a writer for " @entity70
" hard work is also in his makeup
his father was a probation officer who decided to become a doctor -- in his 40s
" he started taking premed courses , and he just did it
he was a really solid student because he had perspective , " @entity7 told @entity63
" he was n't out playing beer pong every night
it was such a lesson to me
" @entity7 has distinguished himself on " @entity10 , " where his senior black correspondent has chimed in on such subjects as @entity84 , @entity85 's presidency and the @entity87 violence
he 's already had to adjust to changes at " the @entity12 , " which was originally announced as " @entity89 with @entity7
" unfortunately for @entity9 , @entity90 decided to develop a project based on the 2002 @entity93 movie , so @entity9 opted for " the @entity12
" but the easygoing @entity7 is ok with that
besides , the show was n't just going to be about people of color , he told @entity63
" it was never intended to be a show only about minorities , " he said
" it 's a show about underdogs , and that happens in a lot of different forms , whether it 's race , gender or whatever
" according to @entity31 , the new show will have some regular cast members , a few panelists and @entity7 , anchoring it all with monologues and his distinct take on the news
@entity114 , the " @entity12 's " executive producer , told @entity115 that @entity7 's training behind the scenes will serve him well
" @entity7 's like a @entity118 " of tv and comedy , he said
@entity7 himself is taking a casual attitude to the inevitable attention
you did n't know him before ? you may soon see him everywhere , but he 'll be the same @entity7 regardless
" it 's too late for success to do anything to me
success had its chance , " he told @entity63
" it 's too late for you , success
you 're not going to change me at this point
