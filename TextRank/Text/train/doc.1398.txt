@entity0 -- after years of being badgered by her parents to get married , 26 - year - old @entity2 finally had enough
" i have decided never to marry or have a child , " said @entity2 , a university graduate from @entity4 , @entity5 province , who moved to @entity7 earlier this year to escape her family and jumpstart her career
@entity2 's vow to never marry is rare in a country where educated women are constantly told by their families , friends and the state media that they will be lonely and miserable if they do not find a husband quickly
yet some women are fighting back by rejecting marriage altogether
@entity2 had been living with her parents in @entity5 to save money after obtaining her college degree , and for a time , fell sway to her parents ' worries that she would become a " leftover woman " ( or " shengnv " in @entity27 , ) officially defined as an urban , educated woman over age 27 who is single
but upon reading feminist websites , she came to believe the term existed to make women return to the home
she then took a risk by moving to @entity7 without a job and leaving the comforts of home for a dorm room shared with nine other roommates
but she loves her new friends and sense of freedom
" men are still thinking in the old ways , but women 's values have evolved
i feel very relaxed now , " said @entity2 , who just received a sales job offer
@entity48 , a 32 - year - old client relations manager for a financial company in @entity7 , similarly embraces her single lifestyle
she enjoys a relatively high income of 20,000 rmb a month ( around us $ 3,200 ) and often goes out with friends to dinners , movies and concerts
" where i grew up in @entity56 , i saw so many couples getting into big fights , and most of them seemed unhappy
plus , so many men have affairs , " @entity48 said
" my life in @entity7 now is very rich , why would i want to change it ? " @entity2 and @entity48 are in the minority , but their attitudes reflect the reality that marriage in today 's @entity69 does little to protect women 's rights
domestic abuse for example , a @entity27 woman has almost no recourse if her husband abuses her
official statistics show that a quarter of women have experienced intimate partner violence , but feminist activists say that number is an underestimate
@entity84 , an attorney and director of the @entity86 in @entity0 , said many women do not recognize they are victims of domestic violence
" ask a woman if she has experienced domestic violence and she will say , ' oh no , of course not ! ' " @entity84 said
" ask her if her husband has hit her and she will say yes
" despite years of intense lobbying by women 's rights groups , the @entity27 government has failed to enact targeted legislation to curb domestic violence
" judges almost never define a case as ' domestic violence ' because the current law in @entity69 is not specific or clear enough , " said @entity95 , a leading activist with the @entity96 in @entity0
as a result , it is extremely difficult for women to secure protection from a violent partner
' the most rational choice is to stay single ' married women also experienced a severe setback to their property rights in 2011 , when the @entity109 amended @entity69 's @entity110 to state , essentially , that marital property belongs to the person whose name is on the home deed
in @entity69 , that person is usually the husband
according to a 2012 survey by @entity69 of home buying in the cities of @entity0 , @entity7 , @entity121 and @entity122 , only 30 % of marital home deeds include the woman 's name , even though over 70 % of women contribute to the marital home purchase
this is just one of the ways in which @entity27 women have been shut out of arguably the largest accumulation of residential property wealth in history , valued at 3.3 times @entity69 's gdp , according to figures from @entity135
that amounted to more than $ 28 trillion at the end of 2012
defenders of the court ruling on marriage argue that women are entitled to compensation for their share of the home payments , but most women do not keep receipts of their contributions
and stay - at - home mothers have even less financial protection in the event of a divorce
many women are upset about the change in the @entity110 , but the authoritarian nature of @entity69 's one - party state has prevented a women 's rights movement from gaining traction
" the institution of marriage basically benefits men , and when women are hurt , this institution does n't protect our rights , " a young woman in @entity0 recently told me
" the most rational choice is to stay single
