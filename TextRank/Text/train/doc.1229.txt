-- fifteen years ago i walked out of a mosque in silent protest of the imam 's sermon
outside , the heat of the desert sun could hardly match the fire of the rhetoric being spewed forth inside
the imam was railing against the foreign enemies of @entity13 and the sinners within
with every genocidal rant came an " amen " from the congregation
some regrettably came from the heart
others came from those on autopilot putting in their " time " at the mosque to fulfill their quota of good deeds
still others were a tradeoff : penance for their sins , an economy of convenience that was born long before @entity13 and long sold as the path to heaven of other faiths
it was not the first time i had heard terrible notions of fear and hate peddled in the name of my religion
but that day was different
that day i felt complicit
i had reached a point of intellectual critical mass where my love for my religion overwhelmed my sitting in silence any longer
as i stood up , i stared at the imam to make sure he knew that at least one person would no longer accept the recipe of his revenge
@entity13 and @entity50 were born in the same neighborhood under similar conditions 600 years apart
@entity50 came about at a time when harsh rulers subjugated their people , making already difficult lives nearly impossible
the people responded to the message of @entity59 as they did 600 years later to the message of @entity61
both @entity50 and @entity13 offered simple messages to the poor : live by the rules and your rewards will come later
@entity67 : how @entity69 cultures are borrowing from western pop culture @entity13 came of age at a time of open warfare between what was loosely called @entity75 and the occupying @entity76
it was a religion for the willing believer , further steeled by the @entity79 of the 11th and 12th centuries and the @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 inquisitions
many imams today are still preaching in the rhetoric of the seventh century without regard to contemporary reality
but unlike @entity59 and @entity61 , they preach not of future rewards for living a just life as @entity91 promised
instead , they offer their rewards to those who devote themselves to the genocide of those who they have anointed our enemies
they prefer not to leave @entity102 to @entity91 , instead they substitute themselves as a sort of lower trial court
we are now in the @entity108 month of @entity109 , a time of dawn to dusk fasting intended to teach @entity108 about patience , humility , and spirituality
during @entity109 , more than a billion @entity108 will congregate at their mosques
@entity67 : comics provide a window into our world it is finally time that all of us became more accountable for that which our children will be hearing ; tiny differences setting us apart rather than celebrating those positive things that bind all good people together
if we allow small - minded men to spout fear and hate in the name of our religion , we will enable them to brainwash another generation as they did our own
and soon , the next generation will fall into a pit of dissonance
to sit by silently makes us all complicit
as the father of five sons , i worry about who they 're going to be using as role models
i worry because all around me , even within my extended family , i see religion being manipulated
as a psychologist , i worry for the world in general , but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world
now , i 'm a clinical psychologist
i 'm licensed in @entity149
i trained at @entity151 's survivors of political torture program
and i heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership , only to end up being tortured by their heroes
and torture 's a terrible enough thing as it is , but when it 's done by your hero , that just breaks you in so many ways
i left @entity163 , went to business school and started the comic book series " the 99
" the 99 references the 99 attributes of @entity91 in the @entity167 , things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom
@entity67 : comics of bygone @entity149 fifteen hundred years after the birth of @entity59 , men representing the @entity175 poured hot lead down the throats of @entity108 and @entity179 to get them to accept @entity59 as their @entity180
fourteen hundred years after @entity181 conveyed @entity183 's message to @entity61 through the @entity167 , a tiny minority of self - aggrandizing @entity108 are using the lead of bullets to kill untold numbers in an unspeakable insult to name of @entity13
today , through the 99 , this proud @entity108 is using the lead of his pencil to take a stand
for all our sakes , i hope the pencil really is mightier than the sword
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .
