@entity0 -- lawyers acting for @entity3 , the partner of journalist @entity4 , said they will bring his case to the @entity6 in @entity0 on thursday after he was detained at @entity7
@entity4 , who works for @entity9 newspaper , has been at the forefront of high - profile reports exposing secrets in @entity14 intelligence programs , based on leaks from former @entity18 contractor @entity16
@entity19 , a @entity20 citizen , spent nearly nine hours in detention sunday being questioned under a provision of @entity24 's terrorism laws
he was stopped as he passed through @entity0 on his way from @entity27 to his home in @entity20
opinion : silence the media , compromise freedom authorities confiscated @entity19 's electronic equipment , including his mobile phone , laptop , memory sticks , smart watch , dvds and games consoles , lawyer @entity41 wrote in the court filing wednesday
the lawyers , hired by @entity9 to represent @entity19 , are trying to recover his property and prevent the government from inspecting the items or sharing what data they may have already gleaned from them
" what they 're essentially seeking right now is a declaration from the @entity24 court that what the @entity24 authorities did is illegal , because the only thing they 're allowed to detain and question people over is investigations relating to terrorism , and they had nothing to do with terrorism , they went well beyond the scope of the law , " @entity4 told @entity1 's @entity51 on tuesday
" and , secondly , to order them to return all the items they stole from @entity3 and to order that they are barred from using them in any way or sharing them with anybody else
" @entity19 ' afraid ' during questioning pressure on @entity9 ? meanwhile , new claims have emerged that the pressure placed on @entity9 over its reporting on information leaked by @entity16 came from the highest levels of government
the @entity24 newspaper @entity82 reported wednesday that prime minister @entity83 ordered the country 's top civil servant , sir @entity84 , " to contact the @entity9 to spell out the serious consequences that could follow if it failed to hand over classified material received from @entity16
" asked about the report by @entity1 , @entity83 's office did not deny it
" we wo n't go in to specific cases , but if highly sensitive information was being held insecurely , the government would have a responsibility to secure it , " a @entity93 press officer said
she declined to be named in line with policy
the @entity9 's editor , @entity101 , said in an editorial published monday that the paper had physically destroyed computer hard drives under the eyes of representatives of @entity24 's @entity107 -- the @entity24 equivalent of the @entity18
the move followed several meetings with " a very senior government official claiming to represent the views of the prime minister " and " shadowy @entity115 figures , " @entity101 said
they demanded the @entity9 hand over the @entity16 material or destroy it , he said
deputy prime minister @entity120 , the head of @entity83 's @entity122 coalition partners , considered the request " reasonable , " his office said
â € ª " the deputy prime minister felt this was a preferable approach to taking legal action , " according to a statement issued wednesday evening
" he was keen to protect the @entity9 's freedom to publish , whilst taking the necessary steps to safeguard security
" @entity4 broke the story of the existence of a @entity18 program that is thought to have collected large amounts of phone and @entity138 data
the @entity9 also claimed , based on documents provided by @entity16 , that @entity140 made use of the @entity18 program , known as @entity143 , to illegally spy on @entity24 citizens
a @entity24 parliamentary committee subsequently found " no basis " for this claim
the @entity24 government says @entity140 acts within a strong legal framework
' journalistic material ' @entity19 was stopped as he returned to the couple 's @entity153 home after staying in @entity27 with filmmaker @entity155 , who has been working with @entity4 on @entity18 - related stories
@entity19 will seek a judicial review on the grounds that the legislation under which he was detained was misused , his solicitor @entity41 said tuesday
@entity41 wrote to home secretary @entity162 and the @entity164 chief asking for assurances that " there will be no inspection , copying , disclosure , transfer , distribution or interference , in any way , with our client 's data pending determination of our client 's claim
" the law firm has also demanded the same from any third party , either domestic or foreign , that may have been given access to the material
the letter , seen by @entity1 , claims that schedule 7 of @entity187 was used to detain @entity19 " in order to obtain access to journalistic material " and that this " is of exceptional and grave concern
" @entity19 has said he does not know what data he was carrying back with him
' huge black eye ' for @entity24 government @entity24 's @entity196 on tuesday defended @entity19 's questioning , saying the government and police " have a duty to protect the public and our national security
" " if the police believe that an individual is in possession of highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism , then they should act and the law provides them with a framework to do that , " it said
" those who oppose this sort of action need to think about what they are condoning
" in a statement that did n't name @entity19 but referred to his detention , the @entity164 called what happened " legally and procedurally sound " and said it came after " a detailed decision - making process
" the statement describes the law under which @entity19 was detained as " a key part of our national security capability which is used regularly and carefully by the @entity164 to help keep the public safe
" but that 's not how @entity19 and @entity4 view the law , or at least how it was applied in this case
sitting alongside his partner , @entity4 said the detention gave the @entity24 government " a huge black eye in the world , ( made ) them look thuggish and authoritarian ( for ) interfering in the journalism process ( and created ) international incidents with the government of @entity20 , which is indignant about this
" @entity4 added , " to start detaining people who they think they are reporting on what they 're doing under terrorism laws , that is as dangerous and oppressive as it gets
" @entity249 knew @entity19 would be detained @entity19 , who did n't have an interpreter on hand during his detention despite @entity253 being a second language for him , said : " they did n't ask me anything about terrorism , not one question
" he added , " they were just telling me : ' if you do n't answer this , you are going to jail
' " @entity4 said the entire episode was designed to intimidate him and other investigative journalists from using classified information and digging into stories critical of the @entity24 and allied governments
but , he said , it will have the reverse effect on him , making him more determined to carry on
the seizure of material from @entity19 will not stop the newspaper reporting on the story , he added
" of course , we have multiple copies of every single thing that we 're working on , " @entity4 said
" nobody would ever travel with only one copy of anything
" @entity1 's @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 contributed to this report
