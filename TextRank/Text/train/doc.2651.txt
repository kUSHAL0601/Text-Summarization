@entity1 ceo @entity0 has apologized for a massive e-mail outage last week , calling the days - long glitch " unacceptable " and a " massive inconvenience
" " this has been a very frustrating week for our users and we are very sorry , " @entity5 wrote friday on @entity1 - owned @entity6 as the company was cleaning up the last of a problem that began december 9 for some users
the problem was a hardware outage in one of @entity1 's storage centers
@entity5 said it affected about 1 % of @entity1 e-mail 's users
while teams began working around the clock on the problem immediately , it was " a particularly rare one " in which different users were affected in different ways
that caused it to take longer to fix , she said
service was restored to more than 99 % of affected users by saturday , although @entity1 's engineers were still working on the problem sunday
" the engineering team has been working over the weekend and making steady progress on restoring access to messages for affected users
this includes folders as well as inbox state ( like whether you 've read a message or starred it ) , " said a post on @entity1 's help page sunday night
@entity5 took the helm at @entity1 last year and has been credited with the first steps of what may be a turnaround for the troubled web giant
she promised improvements to @entity1 's e-mail service , which is the @entity48 's second - or third-most popular , depending upon which analysis you believe
" above all else , we 're going to be working hard on improvements to prevent issues like this in the future , " she wrote
" while our overall uptime is well above 99.9 % , even accounting for this incident , we really let you down this week
" we can , and we will , do better in the future
" @entity5 made revamping e-mail a key part of her effort to kick - start @entity1 , but it 's been a rocky process
announced in december 2012 , the first e-mail overhaul rolled out to all users ( whether they wanted it or not ) in june
so lukewarm was the reception that it got a largely cosmetic redesign again in october
the result ? more outrage
@entity1 e-mail has suffered from other limited outages since october , although none as bad as last week 's .
