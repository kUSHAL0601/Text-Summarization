@entity0 , @entity1 -- the weather system known as @entity4 has been downgraded from a tropical storm to a tropical depression as it moves across the @entity7 -- and there are indications it may not get too much stronger
as of 11 p.m. et , the system was moving through the eastern @entity7 after crossing southern @entity1 earlier friday
it had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph
the depression was moving west - northwest at a very fast clip for such weather systems -- 17 mph
forecasters from the @entity18 said the storm was expected to cross over the @entity20 , anywhere from @entity22 to southeastern @entity23 , late saturday night , earlier than had been anticipated previously
the fast pace means it wo n't be spending as much time over the warm @entity7 water , leaving less time to build up strength
@entity2 meteorologist @entity29 said an area of low pressure in the @entity7 has been creating some competing winds that have been pulling clouds away from the cyclone and weakening it
still , the hurricane center said the system may slow , and a tropical storm warning is in effect from @entity40 , @entity1 , to @entity41 , @entity22 , including @entity42
and @entity4 still could bring drenching rain to @entity22 and other states along the coast , the hurricane center said , creating a storm surge ranging from two to four feet
the hurricane center said @entity4 could bring one to three inches of rain across the region , with rainfall of five inches in some areas
@entity4 made landfall as a tropical storm earlier friday near @entity55 in southeastern @entity1 , with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph
but it weakened as it crossed over the state
even though @entity4 has weakened , uncertainty over the weather already has hampered operations at @entity63 's cripped well in the @entity7
@entity63 suspended work on a relief well to permanently seal the damaged well
and the federal official overseeing the effort , retired adm. @entity68 , ordered ships in the area to shore because of the choppy seas and gusty winds that @entity4 will bring
that could delay operations atthe well site for 10 to 14 days
but @entity68 said there 's enough confidence in the well 's " integrity " that it will be left capped and closed during the rough weather
ships used to skim oil off the surface will have to come ashore as well
hundreds have been operating off the coast
meanwhile , states of emergency have been declared in both @entity22 and @entity88
the emergency declarations are intended to speed state help to local goverments that need it and allow emergency crews to respond more efficiently
@entity22 gov. @entity94 said thursday afternoon it 's " good for @entity22 " that the weather system is moving so fast , since it may not strengthen significantly and is likely to move across @entity22 fairly quickly
still , he said about a half dozen @entity22 parishes have called for voluntary evacuations from low - lying areas and mobile home parks
the @entity22 @entity101 encouraged residents friday to prepare for the storm by pre-applying for @entity105 benefits , previously known as @entity106
the program offers help buying groceries for those who do not regularly receive nutrition assistance but who are affected by lost wages or damages because of a disaster
officials said that pre-applying does not guarantee benefits but is designed to prevent long waits
the weather system earlier drenched the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and the @entity123 as it moved from the @entity124 to the @entity125
when it reached @entity1 , residents in @entity127 saw tree branches littering the roads as @entity4 passed through @entity131
" it was pouring rain for four to five hours straight , " said @entity132 , a bartender at @entity133
but he added , " it 's not that bad
it 's like a regular summer storm in @entity0
" the storm also slowed business in southern @entity1
" we 've had a lot of people call and say they might have to cancel due to the storm , " said @entity141 of @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity1
" i had a few people leave a few days early
" @entity2 meteorologist @entity149 contributed to this report .
