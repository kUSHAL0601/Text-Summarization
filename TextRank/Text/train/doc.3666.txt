-- @entity1 took his first yoga class in the 1990s , right as the practice began gaining in popularity in the @entity5
" they did n't even have any yoga mats , " he said , recalling the @entity7 sports club that offered the class
it was n't until @entity1 started taking classes at yoga studios that he realized a lot of the previous sessions were " watered down " versions of yoga
the loose interpretation was n't bothersome ; yoga by definition is a diverse practice with more than a dozen different styles
but as @entity1 remembers , some of the poses the inexperienced teachers were demonstrating were simply not right
" the instructors were cool people , and they 'd play good music , but students did n't know they were being taught poorly , " said @entity1 , who became a yoga instructor himself 14 years ago
and , according to author and @entity33 science writer @entity32 , some of the common yoga poses can cause serious injuries like nerve damage , torn cartilage , and strokes , among others
an article adapted from @entity32 's upcoming book on yoga featured in the @entity42 earlier this month with the title " @entity44 , " sparked a lively debate within the yoga community about how to keep practitioners safe
in the article , @entity32 noted that yoga is a " free - for - all " with " no hierarchy of officials or organization to ensure purity and adhere to agreed - upon sets of facts and poses , rules and procedures , outcomes and benefits
" @entity32 is correct -- there is n't a government oversight committee dedicated to yoga practice
and that 's because many practitioners prefer it that way
" yoga comes from @entity67
things are not uniform by tradition , " said @entity68 , who has taught yoga for 25 years
in an effort to provide a common ground for the diverse practice of yoga , a group of seasoned yoga practitioners -- " yogis " -- came together in 1999 to form the @entity79 , a nonprofit organization whose sole purpose is to create minimum standards for yoga teacher training
fearing government or insurance companies might step in and start calling the shots , the alliance set forth to self - regulate , said @entity68 , who is the co-founder and vice chairman of the organization
it is for yogis , by yogis
after all , @entity68 said , those " who do n't understand the landscape of yoga are n't qualified " to regulate the standards for teaching
anyone trained by schools registered with the @entity79 completes 200 or 500 hours of training , based on the following five principles : yoga techniques , including poses , breathing and meditation ; general teaching methodology ; anatomy and physiology ; yoga philosophy and ethics ; and training , practicum , and supervised teaching , in which senior instructors observe trainees to identify and correct any issues
@entity68 said the five principles allow for " a lot of wiggle room , " and aim to protect and promote the teacher 's individuality
once trained , the instructors are certified by their school and their names are listed on a registry that informs the public of teachers in their area who have completed the minimum standards for yoga instruction
@entity79 - trained teachers may also use the trademarked " @entity134 " -- registered yoga teacher -- behind their name , indicating they 've completed the required hours
not all members of the yoga community are on board with this approach , however
@entity140 , co-founder of the @entity141 , a nonprofit that provides continuing education to yoga practitioners , disagrees with yoga regulation of any kind
he believes in a free market approach to regulations for yoga teacher training
" yoga is about freedom , " he said , " the market place is the ultimate quality control
" yoga instruction , he said , is about a relationship between a teacher and a student
if a teacher is trained to teach yoga on the @entity160 or by a dvd at home and the student is fine with it , it 's really nobody 's business
@entity68 said he has no problem with that approach
" it 's not illegal to teach without training as a teacher , " he said
but @entity1 is more wary
he believes that learning how to align properly is something that needs an " expert eye , " one that ca n't be achieved by watching a dvd
" anyone can tell you what to do , it 's explaining how to do it , " he said
and that is what separates effective teachers from the rest , according to @entity1
" it 's alignment with awareness , " he said
@entity1 trains teachers at a studio where he teaches in suburban @entity185
his 200 - hour training class meets one weekend a month for 10 months , a long stretch of time imperative to the teaching process
" you need time for information to settle , " @entity1 said
since yoga instruction is far more complex than just leading students to do poses , @entity1 said he reserves the right to extend the training past 10 months if needed
he wants to give his new teachers whatever time they need to assimilate the information so that they can feel confident teaching others
" it 's the integrity and the awareness that the teacher brings to class that is most important , " @entity1 said
@entity1 said successful teachers are committed to the safety for their students and will provide suggestions for modification , as well as props like belts , blankets and blocks to make those modifications
a willingness to adapt the practice for different audiences and environments helps too
" i 've taught yoga in the oddest of places , " he said
good teachers " can teach yoga in an auditorium , a prison , a hospital
" they " can transform the whole thing just by who they are
