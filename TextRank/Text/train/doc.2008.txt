-- @entity1 offered to " drop on my knees and beg " @entity4 's prime minister to get his comeback concerts back on track after the @entity8 city council denied licenses for two of his five shows
@entity1 , speaking at the announcement of a new recording deal with @entity15 , said he had no clue until the last two weeks that there was a problem with the shows , for which 400,000 tickets had been sold
" i do n't have a clue how we got here , " @entity1 said about the sudden cancellation of the sell - out shows
" all i know is the powers that can fix it are not here
" @entity1 hopes friends in high places can save @entity31 shows the @entity8 shows had been planned for @entity33 , a football arena that can hold more than 90,000 fans , on five consecutive nights during the last week of july
the council approved friday , saturday and sunday shows , but rejected licenses for monday and tuesday night concerts
instead of going forward with the three approved concerts , @entity1 said he would not do any since it would mean choose which 160,000 fans would be shunned
" if the prime minister himself wants to talk to me , i will crawl , swim , i will fly over there this weekend , sit in front of him , i will drop on my knees and beg for those 400,000 people to let them have fun
" @entity1 promised to announce a world tour on july 14 and he hinted that the first new music under his @entity15 deal would be out around the end of the month
a double album , which he 's working on now , will be released around @entity57 at " a stupid price " initially to reward fans who have waited through his retirement
@entity1 was the biggest selling solo recording act ever when he left the road and studio behind to concentrate on raising his three daughters 14 years ago
fans have only seen him perform since then at a few benefit concerts and a weekend residency in @entity68
his youngest daughter @entity69 graduated from high school in may , relieving @entity1 of his paternal duty to drive his kids from his farm in @entity74 , @entity75 , to school each morning and be there for every soccer match .
