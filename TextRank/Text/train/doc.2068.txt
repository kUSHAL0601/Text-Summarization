-- a former @entity2 judge is standing trial on charges he checked male inmates out of jail and forced them to engage in sexual activity such as paddling in exchange for leniency
former @entity12 circuit judge @entity11 denies all the charges , his attorney says
former @entity12 circuit judge @entity11 at one point faced more than 100 criminal counts in the case , including kidnapping , sexual abuse , extortion and sodomy
prosecutors filed cases relating to 15 alleged victims , with multiple counts in each case
but four of those cases have been dismissed -- some thrown out by a judge because the statute of limitations expired and others because prosecutors decided not to present evidence relating to them -- leaving 11 alleged victims and 51 counts , according to defense attorney @entity34 and @entity0 affiliate @entity35
retired @entity37 judge @entity36 dismissed jurors tuesday while attorneys argued whether the jury should be allowed to consider kidnapping , extortion or assault charges , @entity35 reported
@entity36 already has ruled there is enough evidence for jurors to consider the sex abuse charges
@entity11 , 48 , has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing
@entity34 told @entity0 on tuesday that @entity11 was trying to mentor the inmates and did not assault them
" the whole thing is , he tried to help people in this community , " @entity34 said
" he helped thousands to grow up and be productive citizens
" the judge does not deny bringing the inmates into his office , @entity34 said
" he was mentoring them
he was trying to get them to do right , to be productive citizens
" one of the alleged victims testified monday that he does n't know why his semen was found on the carpet of a small room used as an office by @entity11 , according to the @entity68 newspaper
but he did say @entity11 spanked him with a belt on several occasions , the newspaper reported , and that the paddlings took place inside a jury room , in the small office and at a @entity12 fraternity house
another man testified that after he was charged with kidnapping and robbery in 2002 , @entity11 visited him in jail and urged the man to let @entity11 decide the case instead of a jury , according to the @entity68
@entity11 convicted him of lesser charges , he testified , and sentenced him to a 90 - day boot camp
he said @entity11 also beat him with a belt on his bare buttocks about a dozen times at the courthouse , the newspaper reported
" all of them [ the alleged victims ] were given preferential treatment at some point , " @entity91 , chief assistant district attorney for @entity12 , told @entity0 earlier this month
" and ultimately , when some of them refused to continue participating [ in the activities ] , they were given what i would view as excessive sentences
but certainly while the inmates were involved with the activities we allege , the state would say , it was extremely lenient sentences
" however , " two of the individuals said he [ @entity11 ] did nothing bad to them , " @entity34 said tuesday
" that he did n't paddle them
that he only helped them
... i mean , the last guy that testified was a murderer
and he 's complaining he got assaulted
' i got assaulted , ' -- yeah , right
" asked whether @entity11 admits paddling the men , @entity34 said , " i did n't say either way
... i 'm saying there ai n't no sexual innuendoes
" @entity36 has heard arguments on whether an expert should be allowed to testify about sexual fetishes for the prosecution
@entity34 said the expert has not interviewed any of the alleged victims and that he fails to see how the testimony fits into the case
@entity36 was brought in to hear the case after all the @entity129 judges recused themselves -- standard procedure in a case involving another judge
@entity11 resigned from the bench in october 2007 before he was scheduled to stand trial before the @entity135 on multiple ethics violations charges
the complaint , dismissed after the resignation , accused him of " extrajudiciary personal contact " with some defendants but does not refer to any sexual contact
in april , @entity11 told @entity35 the allegations against him are false , but the most important thing for him was making sure his wife and two daughters were taken care of
" i 'm not guilty , and i look forward to being a part of the community that 's supported me and i 've supported my entire life , " he said
the @entity151 suspended @entity11 ' law license in january after a grand jury handed up the first of two indictments against him
in april , the bar 's disciplinary commission upheld the suspension , @entity35 reported , despite the fact that @entity11 under oath denied all the allegations in the first indictment
the second indictment was returned in august
