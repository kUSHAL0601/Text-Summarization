-- as president @entity4 was about to deliver his @entity5 on tuesday , his prospective @entity2 challengers were busy laying the groundwork for their efforts to challenge the incumbent
three of the four @entity2 candidates held events in @entity12 on tuesday , a week before the state 's crucial primary
while focusing criticism on @entity4 to try to dim the president 's limelight , the candidates also managed to get in some shots at each other in the aftermath of a spirited debate monday night
" the president will do what he does best
he 'll give a nice speech , a lot of memorable phrases in it , but he wo n't give you the hard numbers like 9.9 % unemployment here in @entity12 , " former @entity26 gov. @entity25 predicted at a campaign event in @entity28
" ... instead , tonight president @entity4 will make the opening argument for his campaign against a do - nothing @entity40
" @entity25 spoke at an abandoned factory , in front of an @entity44 flag and a banner that read , " @entity4 is n't working
" he later spoke in front of a foreclosed @entity12 home to emphasize the economic hardships facing many @entity44
" today , too many factory floors are silent , warehouses are deserted , corporate offices are empty and real estate endeavors are abandoned , " @entity25 said
" floridians are struggling to find a job , keep a home and raise a family
this is the real state of our union , but you wo n't hear stories like those at president @entity4 's address tonight
the unemployed do n't get tickets to sit next to the first lady
" former house speaker @entity67 , whose poll numbers have surged in the wake of his primary victory on saturday in @entity71 , said at an event in @entity73 that change must occur at the @entity75 , in @entity40 and in the bureaucracy of @entity77
" it 's bigger than @entity4 , " @entity78 said
" while he 's the start , there 's much more to getting this country back on track than @entity4
" later , in @entity84 , @entity78 said that , if elected president , his first acts would be to sign executive orders undoing policies of the @entity4 administration
" by the time president @entity4 lands in @entity93 , we will have dismantled about 40 % of his administration , " @entity78 said to cheers
his strongest barbs , however , were aimed at @entity25 , the early front - runner in @entity12 who has seen @entity78 close the gap in recent days in polls
@entity25 leveled attacks against @entity78 during monday 's debate , the first of two this week before @entity53 vote in their january 31 primary
a different candidate has won each of the first three nominating contests so far , but @entity25 's strong organization and war chest are considered an advantage as the primary process proceeds
" look , i need your help between now and next tuesday , " @entity78 told his supporters , referring to the primary date
" the fact is , gov. @entity25 will have vastly more money than i will , but we will have many more people than he will
this is exactly what happened in @entity71 , and people power beats money power every time
" still , @entity78 's campaign finances were improving : a super pac backing @entity78 , winning our future , bought $ 6 million in ads in @entity12 , a spokesman for the group , @entity128 , told @entity0
the buy came one day after major @entity2 donor @entity134 contributed $ 5 million to the organization
also tuesday , @entity25 's 2010 tax return and an estimate of his tax liability for 2011 underwent scrutiny
the documents reveal he made $ 42.7 million over the past two years and paid $ 6.2 million in taxes , with an effective federal income tax rate of just under 14 %
at an event in @entity146 , @entity12 , former @entity144 sen. @entity143 contrasted his finances with those of his rivals at an event in @entity146 , @entity12
" when you see my tax return , you will note that i do not have the riches of others in this race , " said @entity143 , who is vying with @entity78 to become the favored conservative candidate of the primary campaign against the more moderate @entity25
@entity143 preemptively criticized @entity4 's speech by blaming the president for increasing the size of the government , increasing deficits and debt , and seeing the @entity44 credit rating downgraded on his watch
@entity143 , citing @entity4 's legislation on health care and @entity169 , called him " the worst president this country has ever seen
" " you are going to hear a bunch of flowery rhetoric and all this stuff about all the things he has done , " @entity143 said
" but what he has done -- he has grown the tax burden on the @entity44 public through @entity180 , through @entity181 and through other bills
" @entity143 also leveled criticism at @entity25 and @entity78 in a fundraising letter that repeated his debate attack monday night that accused both of his rival candidates of having betrayed conservative principles on major issues such as health care and global warming
" on the big issues , @entity67 and @entity25 are not all that different from @entity4 , " the letter said
in @entity194 , @entity143 dismissed reports of growing income inequality in the nation
" income inequality is going to happen , some people are going to make more , some people are going to make less , " @entity143 said
" people ask me , ' what do you think about @entity25 , you know , making a gazillion dollars last year ? ' good for him , that 's what i say , good for him
i wish i 'd made some gazillion dollars last year
i 'd be in a little better shape financing my own campaign like he 's done
good for him , that 's ok
the problem is , and this is something @entity2 and conservatives need to be concerned about , is the ability of people to rise
the ability of people to climb the ladder
" in an interview with @entity0 , @entity78 cited his appearance in an advertisement about climate change with a @entity225 former speaker
" the dumbest thing i 've done in the last four years was sit on a couch with @entity228 , " he said
" i think he 's done plenty of dumb things and there 's stiff competition for what is the dumbest thing he 's done , of course , including his violations of the ethics rules of the @entity240 , " she told @entity0
@entity228 needed no polls in making her prediction about the outcome of the race
" he 's not going to be president of the @entity44 , " she said
" that 's not going to happen
" @entity248 rep. @entity247 has decided not to spend money in @entity12 because of his poor prospects in the winner - take - all primary
instead , he is focusing on upcoming caucuses in @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 in a bid to win more delegates so he can wield influence at the @entity2 convention in august
@entity12 is a key battleground and offers a different campaign landscape
the number of @entity12 @entity2 voters exceeds the combined total in the previous three states , requiring a larger campaign organization and more money for advertising
@entity25 got a head start in the state over his rivals and is expected to receive a boost from the early voting that the state permits
according to the state , at least 53,000 ballots had been cast in early voting that started on saturday
of the 475,000 people who requested and were sent absentee ballots , 180,000 had been filled out and sent back by last wednesday
those absentee votes came in before @entity78 rose in the polls and won @entity71 's primary by a double - digit margin
in 2008 , nearly 1.95 million people voted in @entity12 's @entity2 primary
according to @entity288 's daily tracking poll , @entity78 is in a statistical tie with @entity25 nationally among registered @entity2
the national poll showed @entity25 at 29 % and @entity78 at 28 %
after the @entity292 primary this month , @entity25 was at 37 % and @entity78 at 14 % in the same poll
monday 's poll results showed @entity247 at 13 % and @entity143 at 11 %
the sampling error was plus - or - minus 3 points
@entity0 's @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300 contributed to this report .
