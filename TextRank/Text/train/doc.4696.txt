@entity0 -- the @entity5 hopes air traffic controllers may soon benefit from long - standing research into worker fatigue by implementing strategies that include intentional sleeping on the job , the use of caffeine and other methods shown by science to deal with the overnight shift
" a controlled nap can boost performance significantly , " said @entity5 board member @entity14 at a briefing with reporters monday at agency headquarters
citing a 1995 study from @entity21 that has been backed by other research , he said , " a 26 - minute nap improved performance 34 % and alertness 54 %
" the study prompted an advisory that has been adopted by some international air carriers to keep pilots more alert in the cockpit
the measures were not moved forward by the @entity32
congressional lawmakers may soon consider legislation reauthorizing the @entity32 that includes provisions addressing the problem of fatigue
the @entity5 's recommendations monday followed a listening tour of air traffic controllers around the country
the board 's advice is issued to federal and other agencies
inside an air traffic controller 's life referring to a variety of transportation workers who unintentionally fall asleep on the job , the @entity5 official said , " we have many circumstances of documented , uncontrolled spontaneous sleep episodes , " including incidents among air traffic control , long - haul trucking and railroads
according to the research , " a short nap can boost performance , a long nap can make you groggy , " @entity14 explained , saying the tactic of catching a few winks is but one element in a comprehensive plan
although @entity67 transportation secretary @entity66 directed the @entity32 to increase overnight staffing in air traffic control towers in response to unplanned sleeping on the job , @entity14 says that alone wo n't solve the problem of fatigued controllers
what 's going on with air traffic controllers ? " if you do n't have a fatigue management plan , and you just throw more people at it , then you 've got more tired people on , " he said
" however many people you throw at the problem , you 're still gon na have the fatigue risk
" the @entity87 also hopes the @entity32 will implement scientifically validated improvements to fight fatigue in the control tower
in a written statement , @entity92 president @entity91 said , " there is nothing groundbreaking about these recommendations
they are common - sense solutions to a problem @entity87 and fatigue experts have consistently raised for years while past administrations turned a blind eye
" @entity14 says the @entity5 identified the problem of fatigue among air traffic controllers 30 years ago , but only within the past 15 years or so has the research revealed what fights the problem
he used the example of sleepy drivers who turn up the radio and roll down a window to try to stay awake on the road
" they only work for 10 minutes or so , " he said , saying the research suggests greater benefits from pulling over for a short nap
" @entity117 , caffeine , light physical activity , light levels , engagement -- social engagement -- can work , " @entity14 said
and addressing the economic issues of improved staffing and the cost of scheduling people more in line with their sleep clocks , @entity14 said , " most people focus on the cost of the fatigue risk when an accident happens
" what people do n't quantify is what they 're losing in productivity and performance before that , " he added .
