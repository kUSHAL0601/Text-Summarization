-- prosecutors say he may be a criminal
people who say they know him describe him as a great dad
so what 's the story with @entity8 , the @entity9 , @entity10 , man accused of murder after leaving his toddler strapped into his car seat under a blistering @entity16 sun ? the truth is , we do n't know much
police and prosecutors are being tight - lipped about the case against @entity8 , who is charged with felony murder and second - degree child cruelty in the death of 22 - month - old @entity25
he 's refusing visitors to the @entity9 jail -- including @entity0
his family is n't talking , and his attorney has not returned repeated telephone calls from @entity0
here 's what we do know : @entity8 is 33 years old
he has worked at @entity35 for two years
@entity35 corporate communications manager @entity36 said he worked " on our
com business , but i 'm not sure what his title is
" he was placed on unpaid leave after the charges were filed in the june 18 incident -- a routine action in such situations , @entity36 said
he held jobs at the @entity50 from august 2001 until may 2006 as a parking monitor and later as a mail delivery clerk , said @entity53 , university director of media relations
he worked as a police dispatcher in @entity56 , @entity57 , from june 10 , 2006 , to may 22 , 2009 , according to @entity59 spokesman sgt. @entity58
he said the department would confirm only @entity8 ' tenure , and not any details from his work history , so we do n't know why he left the job
in may 2012 , @entity8 graduated from the @entity50 with a bachelor 's degree in commerce and business administration , having majored in management information systems , @entity53 said
the boy 's mother , @entity70 , is listed as having the same home address as the father , but she told @entity0 last week that she 's been advised not to discuss the case with the media
they were married may 7 , 2006 , in @entity56 , according to the @entity78 marriage license clerk
a woman who knew @entity8 as a teenager but has n't seen him in 15 years described him as " a good kid " who spent a lot of time at @entity85 in @entity56 , where @entity25 is to be remembered at a funeral saturday
" we were always happy to have him in our home
and we were happy that he was friends with our child , " @entity89 told @entity0 's @entity90
people who say they know @entity8 posted change.org petitions asking that the charges against him be dropped but closed the petitions this week
one of the organizers posted , " based on the recent developments this petition is no longer revelant
" @entity0 could n't immediately confirm the authenticity of the petition comments , many of which speak glowingly of @entity8 as a man and a father
one petition signer , identified as @entity108 of @entity109 , @entity57 , described @entity8 as " a great husband and a great father
" another , identified as @entity113 of @entity109 , wrote of what he said was @entity8 ' " grace and exemplary attitude
" " he has been nothing but a caring father and supporting husband
he worked full time and went to school for many years to get where he wanted to be , " he said
a petition signer identified as @entity123 wrote that he could n't imagine that man he says he knows intentionally killed his child
" i 've known @entity127 for over 10 years and he is a selfless man who loved people and loved his family more , " the post reads
" nothing in his life even hints at this behavior
" @entity0 's @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .
