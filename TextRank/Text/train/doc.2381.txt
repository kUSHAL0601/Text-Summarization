-- the plight of a 10 - year - old @entity3 girl who could die within weeks without a lung transplant has sparked a fight for new rules governing organ donations
tens of thousands of people have signed a petition on @entity11 , and a congressman has called on the @entity14 administration to take quick action
@entity16 -- whose story @entity0 chronicled -- needs new lungs
she 's been in a @entity20 hospital for months due to the cystic fibrosis that she 's had since birth
she 's at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her region
she 's been waiting for 18 months
but doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her -- and adult lungs become available much more often
that 's where the rules becomes a problem
kids under age 12 are n't prioritized for adult organs
so @entity16 could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down
@entity16 's mother , @entity46 , told @entity0 she was " shocked " when she learned the rules a couple of weeks ago
the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) manages the nation 's transplant system under contract with the @entity52
the network , established by @entity54 , is officially called the @entity48 ( @entity48 )
lawmaker assails ' tragic unfairness ' rep. @entity57 , a @entity58 who represents @entity16 's district , sent a letter tuesday to secretary of health and human services @entity61 , calling on her to convene a meeting of the network 's leadership immediately " to address this tragic unfairness and act to give @entity16 a chance at life and an adult lung from the next available donor
@entity16 's young life literally hangs in the balance
" it 's a message echoed on the @entity11 petition
" this policy needs to change , " it reads
" the @entity76 , a national group of transplant physicians and surgeons , can make an exceptional ruling for @entity16
and they can recommend new policies
" people posted heartfelt messages along with their signatures
" because my daughter had ( cystic fibrosis ) and a double lung transplant
give this little girl the life she is entitled to ! " wrote @entity88
" she has just as much right to have a transplant as any adult
she could have her whole life if given that chance and for the parents to enjoy what some waiting adults have already experienced , " wrote @entity94
organ network : breaking the rules could hurt another patient @entity48 issued a statement noting that there is a separate policy for children because the " biological needs and circumstances of candidates younger than age 12 are different from either adolescent or adult candidates
one key difference is the size and lung capacity of donors and patients among these age ranges
" kids younger than age 12 are prioritized for donations from other kids of similar age and size within a 1,000 - mile radius
policies allow " status adjustments for specifically defined groups of candidates with unique medical circumstances not addressed by the overall policy , " the statement says
but , it adds , a " request to adjust the status of a patient under age 12 so that they may be included in the allocation sequence for adolescents and adults is not within the scope of the existing lung allocation policy
@entity48 can not create a policy exemption on behalf of an individual patient , since giving an advantage to one patient may unduly disadvantage others
" the network routinely reviews policies and considers " public input as well as medical data and experience , " the statement said
dr. @entity153 , a board member at @entity48 , helped develop the current policies
" there is no perfect system , " he told @entity0
" it 's the best we can do right now
" @entity153 said @entity16 's story " tugs at his heart " but that if he changed the system for @entity16 's advantage , " there 's another patient , very likely an adolescent , who gets a disadvantage
" " we 've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible
" @entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 , and @entity173 contributed to this report .
