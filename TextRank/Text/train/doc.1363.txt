-- @entity1 , a police officer in @entity2 , @entity3 , had just finished his shift
it was just after 9 p.m. last saturday , and he was driving home
but the 35 - year - old would never reach his destination
at an intersection near his home , he was ambushed and shot to death
investigators found 34 bullet casings at the scene
@entity2 was found facing down with multiple bullet wounds in his head , chest and left side of his body
his death made headlines in the @entity3 city across the border from @entity24 , @entity25
not only was the victim a police officer , but he was also the eighth member of the force to be murdered in two weeks
in the weeks prior to @entity2 's death , banners had appeared in @entity2 threatening to kill one officer per day unless police chief @entity32 resigned
@entity32 , some of the banners claimed , was only targeting members of one cartel while its rivals roamed free
@entity32 , a former military officer who has been on the job for less than a year , says he 's not stepping down
" we have to show them ( criminals ) that they ca n't be above the law or above authority
they 're criminals and they should be isolated ; isolated in jail or buried in the cemetery
they ca n't keep on intimidating or kidnapping people , " @entity32 said the day after @entity2 's death
the murders of police officers have taken their toll on morale in the department of 2,500 , and forced authorities to take unprecedented measures
@entity2 mayor @entity56 made the decision to temporarily house most of the police force in hotels , with 24 - hour police protection -- the police department protecting its own officers
. " i had to respond to reality , " @entity64 said
" i also decided that we were going to allow police officers to keep their duty weapons after their shift ended
we decided to send them to the barracks after the eighth death
we needed to do something about it
" the attacks against officers have n't stopped
a shootout between officers and their attackers earlier this week left three dead gunmen and produced three arrests
according to police , attackers tried to ambush the officers monday as they were fueling up their cars
three police officers suffered minor wounds in the shootout
in the blue @entity91 the suspects used in the attack , investigators found two high - caliber rifles , two handguns and a fragmentation grenade
mayor @entity64 has stopped short of calling the situation a crisis
responding to a reporter 's question about the recent deaths of police officers , @entity64 became visibly impatient
" it would be stupidly naive not to expect deadly attacks in an open war against organized crime , " @entity64 said
" what would you have us do ? do you want us to send messages to the criminals asking them to please put their @entity110 ( assault rifles ) down and stop committing crimes ? " three years ago criminal groups successfully used the same tactic of killing police officers to force the @entity2 chief of police then to resign
@entity117 stepped down after his assistant chief of police , @entity118 , and two of his bodyguards were gunned down in an ambush
investigators found more than 150 bullet casings at the crime scene
just before that incident in february of 2009 , anonymous banners had appeared throughout the city of 1.2 million warning that if @entity129 did n't resign a police officer would be murdered every 48 hours
by at least one measure @entity32 , the current police chief , has been successful
the number of violent deaths in @entity2 dropped by almost 40 % last year compared with the year before
there were 1,933 murders in 2011 , compared with 3,117 in 2010 , the all - time record
but @entity32 says he is not done yet
@entity32 , who also served as chief of police in @entity140 , is credited with bringing a significant decline in crime in that border city
his goal , he says , is to do the same in @entity2
journalist @entity146 in @entity2 contributed to this report .
