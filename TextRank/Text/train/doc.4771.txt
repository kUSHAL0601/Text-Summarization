" for every @entity2 boy fourteen years old , not once but whenever he wants it , there is the instant when it 's still not yet two o'clock on that july afternoon in 1863
" so starts a powerful passage by @entity7 in " @entity8
" the @entity10 novelist and poet poignantly painted the scene of dry - mouthed young men anticipating battle
but the @entity16 attack , known in the annals of history as @entity19 , ended about a mile away in failure , gray - clad troops blunted by determined @entity23 troops at @entity24 , @entity25
those young boys recalled by @entity7 were stopped at the @entity28 , a stone wall considered the high - water mark of the @entity16 -- perhaps the last chance for victory in the @entity32
instead , the @entity23 prevailed at @entity24 , a turning point in the four - year war that claimed at least 620,000 lives
this weekend and through july 7 , between 200,000 and 300,000 visitors -- more than the number of combatants -- will flock to the town and fields of @entity41 to mark the 150th anniversary of the three - day clash , which cost an incredible 51,000 casualties
@entity19 will be the climactic event of a large re-enactment this weekend outside of park boundaries
on july 3 , the actual anniversary of the attack , @entity48 rangers will guide thousands of visitors in loose formation across a gently rolling field
others will stand where @entity56 regiments poured rifle and artillery fire into the arc of @entity61
the event ends with the playing of taps by multiple musicians , a solemn remembrance of selfless sacrifice by the warriors at @entity24
times have changed since previous anniversary observances , including the 1938 reunion , at which grizzled veterans of the battle met at @entity24 one last time in an event known for reconciliation
they shook hands across that famous wall at the @entity28
some let out the haunting @entity80
the 150th commemoration of the battle will tell a wider story than previous observances , officials told @entity86
" for decades , people came here for military and black powder , " said @entity87 , media relations manager for the @entity88
" now they want to know about the civilians and what they endured during and after the battle
" @entity95 of the @entity48 said interpretations at federal @entity32 battlefields have evolved in the past 25 years
besides telling the story of the battles and the homefront , exhibits increasingly stress the importance of the conflict to civil rights and the role of african - americans , thousands of whom served in the @entity23
about 400 events are planned over 10 days , including a second battle re-enactment next weekend
@entity41 on sunday will hold one of its 150th anniversary signature events , an evening program entitled " @entity24 : a new birth of @entity114
" the keynote speaker is historian @entity116
country music singer @entity117 and a military band will perform the national anthem
the ceremony concludes with a procession to the @entity122 , where luminaries will mark each of 3,500 graves of soldiers who died at @entity24
" i think it is an opportunity for people to have a deeper understanding of what happened here and how it is still relevant in 21st century @entity133 , " said @entity95
12 fascinating @entity32 sites small town made way into history books @entity24 , then a bucolic town of 2,400 souls , found itself directly drawn into the @entity32 during the first days of july 1863
southern troops took the war to the @entity142 after a resounding victory at the @entity144 two months before
gen. @entity146 's soldiers on the first day of battle pushed @entity23 troops through the town and onto hills and ridges that eventually played a large part in the battle 's outcome
" there was street fighting in the inside ( of @entity24 ) , " said @entity87
" throughout the town , a lot of people were shooting muskets out of windows
" @entity164 , while kneading dough , was fatally shot in the back on july 3 , the only civilian casualty at @entity24 , @entity24 , now with a population of about 7,800 , and surrounding @entity167 anticipate a $ 100 million economic impact from 150th anniversary observances
@entity87 has spent much of his time assisting nearly 700 journalists from across the @entity133 and abroad
among international media are @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity177 companies
" one of the things that amazes international visitors and media is why we re-enact this war
it is such a pivotal and painful time for this country but every year we bring it to life and re-enact it
" the area 's 2,600 rooms and 1,800 campsites are largely filled , although a few are left
" a lot of people move to this area for the history , " said @entity87
" a lot of people just love being close to it
" first aid tents all over town will assist any visitors and event participants who run into problems from the muggy and warm temperatures
visitors can take free shuttles into downtown and re-enactments
the @entity48 also offers shuttles and satellite parking
traffic flow on friday , the first full day of 150th events , went well
' living history ' on @entity32 battlefields thousands of re-enactors go back in time @entity216 led the building of a replica @entity19 stone wall for this weekend 's re-enactment at @entity220
seventy volunteeers shaped 88 tons of stone to re-create the focal point of the march
" the @entity61 captured that angle for about five to eight minutes and the @entity23 reinforcements came in and pushed them out
" @entity216 , who authored a book about the wall and the attack , will portray a @entity23 lieutenant on sunday
" i wrote this book three years ago and i hope to see it happen before my eyes , " he said
an estimatetd 10,000 re-enactors are on hand at @entity220 this weekend , said @entity235 , media and marketing coordinator for the @entity237 , which is sponsoring the event
the first mock battle went well friday , said @entity235 , who said organizers have detailed logistics plans for the maneuvering of troops at the site
there 's a chance of rain for the next several days
" we are historically accurate , but we do n't control the weather , " @entity235 said
organizers expect tens of thousands of spectators on saturday and sunday
besides portrayals of the fighting , the re-enactment will include about 200 individuals representing the town of @entity24 in 1863
" the civilians living there have done careful research of the residents of the town and they have taken on their identities , including their trade and craft , " said @entity235
safety of participants and guests comes first , but authenticity also is a priority
" people are here to recognize and honor and commemorate what these people went through , the sacrifices of both soldiers and civilians , " said @entity235
the battles draw re-enactors devoted to donning the proper uniforms and equipment
they can get caught up in the heat of the battle and emotional or significant moments
" that intensity is something that really sparks re-enactors , " she said
" that combined with leaving electronics and the modern world behind
" visitors and participants alike understand that real people died in battle -- that freedom had a cost
making the battlefield historically accurate while battle re-enactments are not permitted on @entity48 sites -- the commemorative clashes will be on privately owned land -- such events and the visitor experience at @entity41 are " not mutually exclusive , " said @entity95
" we want that excitement to spill over to the sites and grounds where the events actually took place , " he said
the @entity48 does not provide crowd estimates or projections , but it 's clear the park will be busy over the next week , given ranger - led hikes and special programs
" we will probably see crowds we probably have n't seen before , or since the centennial , " said @entity95
" for the next couple weeks , there wo n't be many places to get some alone time here
" but for those who want to get away from at least some of the hustle and bustle , he recommends a visit to the @entity327 east of town and the park 's @entity329 , which has a great walking trail
the battlefield looks much different from even 20 years ago as the @entity48 worked to make it look much closer to its 1863 appearance
trees have been removed in some places and orchards planted
thousands may make the july 3 @entity19 commemorative march , timed to the actual assault
those with younger legs may be in front
and , like battles of old , there will be stragglers
" there will be not be a shortage of people with stories and pictures of great - great grandfathers who made that march , " said @entity95
" that is a neat part of the story
