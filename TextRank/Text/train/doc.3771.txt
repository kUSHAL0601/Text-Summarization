-- " my mama always said you 've got to put the past behind you before you can move on
" @entity6 words were never spoken , mr. gump
but this summer , we 've been ignoring @entity10 's sage advice and looking back at summers past in search of a little nostalgic kick
first , we revisited the " freedom summer " of ' 64 , then the " me " summer of ' 74 and finally the totally tubular summer of ' 84
now , as the end of the season draws near , let 's revisit some of the most notable moments from 20 years ago , the summer of 1994
inspirational movies reigned supreme , electro - pop and boy bands ruled the radio , and the " @entity25 " was the talk of the country
here 's more on the summer that was : blockbusters and summer 1994 were like peas and carrots " @entity36 " taught moviegoers young and old about the circle of life via the coming - of - age adventure of a young lion cub named @entity35
with a little musical help from his friends , a warthog , a meerkat and @entity42 , the movie became a roaring multiplatform success : after its june 15 release , the animated musical earned multiple @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 nominations and was the highest - grossing film worldwide that year
meanwhile , the domestic box office was dominated by a simple man
his name ? @entity54 , @entity55
that summer , we also met " @entity61 " in a live - action film that was received poorly by critics but ran the box office for several weekends after its may 27 release date
thirty - two writers famously worked on the script , but one key line still remained : yabba - dabba - doo ! " @entity68 " was another sssssmokin ' late - summer hit : the slapstick comedy starring @entity70 and @entity71 made more than $ 23 million on its opening weekend of july 29
and no summer movie season is complete without an action film -- or three : " @entity74 , " " @entity75 " and " @entity76 " all screeched onto the big screen in the summer of ' 94
soulful and @entity79 tunes @entity79 pop group @entity80 showed no signs of stopping with two hits that summer : " @entity83 " and " do n't turn around
" listeners swore by the soulful harmonies of @entity86 's " i swear , " which dominated the @entity90 charts for 11 straight weeks
during the week of august 6 , the top spot went to " stay ( i missed you ) " by the bespectacled @entity93 after the song 's appearance in the post-grad film " @entity97
" @entity93 was usurped after three weeks by another all - male vocal group , @entity98 , and their single " @entity99
" meanwhile , @entity101 viewers were going " @entity108 " for @entity102 and @entity103 , who played two schoolgirls cutting class in @entity107 's music video
baseball players cry foul , and @entity111 fever @entity113 's @entity112 ended their 54 - year wait for the @entity115 with a defeat of the @entity117 in game seven of the finals on june 14 , 1994
three days later , on june 17 , legendary golfer @entity120 made his final appearance in the @entity122
@entity111 fever was at an all - time high in a notoriously soccer - averse nation : not only did the @entity125 play host nation with a cumulative attendance of 3,587,538 , but the home team advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1930 with the help of popular players like @entity133 and @entity134
as soccer fever cooled , @entity136 frustrations heated up
players went on strike august 12 over a proposed salary cap
they would strike for 232 days ; it was the first year without a @entity141 since 1904
summer of scandals -- and @entity144 speaking of the @entity111 , @entity146 player @entity145 was sent home early after he tested positive for the drug ephedrine
this was not the first time @entity145 faced drug trouble : the famed soccer player was suspended for 15 months by @entity153 in 1991 over alleged cocaine use
in a more tragic turn of events , @entity156 player @entity155 was gunned down in the streets on july 2 after accidentally scoring a goal for the @entity125 and ultimately eliminating his nation 's team
cartel bodyguard @entity163 confessed to the murder , but it is widely speculated that he did not act alone and was employed by a cartel that lost significant money betting on @entity156
in @entity169 , the tabloids were aflutter after the @entity170 admitted in a televised documentary to committing adultery with @entity173
the documentary was supposed to paint @entity170 in a sympathetic light after his very public separation from princess @entity176 after 11 years of marriage
and then , of course , there 's @entity144
on june 17 , 1994 , the @entity181 winner and @entity182 led police on a low - speed chase on @entity186 freeways after the killings of his ex-wife @entity188 and her friend @entity189
the now - legendary white @entity190 has been burned into the brains of the collective @entity125 audience , as the events unfolded on live television before 95 million viewers
@entity188 would be charged and found not guilty of murder
and that 's all we have to say about that .
