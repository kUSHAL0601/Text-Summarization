-- double winners @entity1 began the defense of their @entity4 title with a 6 - 0 drubbing of @entity6 , while another promoted club provided the shock of the day as @entity9 thrashed @entity10 4 - 0
@entity11 scored a hat - trick as @entity1 bounced back from last weekend 's 3 - 1 @entity14 defeat by main rivals @entity15 , who take on the third promoted side , @entity17 , on monday evening
@entity18 put the @entity20 team ahead in the sixth minute on saturday evening after @entity6 goalkeeper @entity21 spilled @entity11 's free - kick , and the @entity24 striker made it 2 - 0 on the stroke of halftime when he curled another set - piece through a poorly - assembled defensive wall
ten minutes after the break , @entity11 scrambled in his second after @entity32 's header was blocked on the line , and midfielder @entity34 slotted in on 63 after @entity36 teammate @entity35 squared the ball into his path
@entity11 was the @entity4 's top scorer last season with 29 goals , and is on target to repeat that feat after his 68th - minute shot was deflected past @entity21 off the head of defender @entity45
@entity4 preview it lifted him up to sixth on the club 's all - time scoring list with 133 goals , putting him above @entity52 , who played for @entity1 from 1957 - 61
@entity53 winger @entity18 sealed a miserable day for @entity6 manager @entity54 , a former @entity1 player , as he beat the offside trap and fired in off the post in the 90th minute
it was the biggest opening - day win since the @entity4 began in 1992
@entity9 , unable to pay their players bonuses for winning promotion via the playoffs until this month , took a 3 - 0 lead at halftime against @entity10 as striker @entity63 netted before a double from new signing @entity65
goalkeeper @entity67 was at fault for both @entity65 ' efforts , and was again exposed in the second half as he was beaten at the near post by @entity73 's shot from the touchline
it was a remarkable day for @entity9 , overwhelming favorites to be relegated in the club 's first season in the top flight since 1971 , as they ended the day second in the table despite a fruitless summer in the transfer market that finally saw free agent @entity65 and three little - known @entity83 arrive this week
" i will take a photograph of the table and then retire , " manager @entity84 said
" it has been a horrible summer and i am quite worn out
this is quite a scary place to be
" in the opening match of the season , @entity89 drew 0 - 0 with big - spending @entity92 in an early - afternoon battle between last season 's fourth and fifth - placed teams
city boss @entity97 fielded three of his five new signings in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , but needed young @entity36 goalkeeper @entity102 -- starting ahead of last season 's first choice @entity105 -- to keep out a wave of @entity89 attacks
the @entity20 side , who face @entity111 side @entity110 in the final round of @entity114 qualifiers next week , also hit the post through @entity116
@entity92 lost @entity117 defender @entity101 to injury at halftime , but should have taken the lead through @entity121 as the winger lost the ball in front of goal
both sides had several half - chances before @entity116 also squandered a great chance , and the game petered out in a draw despite a raft of substitutions as @entity89 brought on forwards @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 while @entity92 introduced @entity137 and @entity138
@entity139 , still seeking to replace departed manager @entity140 , crushed @entity141 3 - 0 in @entity143 's first @entity4 match in charge of the @entity20 team
@entity146 and @entity147 gave the home team a 2 - 0 lead , then @entity150 sealed victory with a 66th - minute strike in what could be the @entity36 midfielder 's final game for @entity139 before joining @entity92
the 24 - year - old was given a standing ovation by the crowd when he was substituted late in the game
@entity160 won 1 - 0 at home to @entity162 as young @entity164 striker @entity163 took advantage of a mistake by @entity168 goalkeeper @entity167 to score the 15th - minute winner
@entity170 came from 2 - 0 down to secure a draw at @entity173 , who had new captain @entity175 sent off in the first half
the home side led in the 24th minute with a penalty from last season 's top scorer @entity179 , then midfielder @entity175 received two yellow cards before defender @entity182 -- who had conceded the spot - kick -- headed into his own net 11 minutes into the second half
@entity185 pulled one back with a header on 78 then defender @entity187 earned a point two minutes from time
@entity189 beat @entity190 2 - 1 as the visitors lost record signing @entity192 to injury
@entity192 , a $ 12 million buy from @entity173 , hit the crossbar early on but needs a scan after suffering an ankle problem soon after
wolves took a 2 - 0 lead at halftime as @entity202 and new strike @entity203 scored just before the break , then @entity206 gave @entity190 hope with a header 10 minutes after the restart
@entity210 drew 0 - 0 at @entity211 in manager @entity213 ' first game in charge , with the home side hitting the post through @entity168 midfielder @entity217 in the second half
@entity213 did not pick veteran @entity220 goalkeeper @entity219 , who handed in a transfer request during the week as he seek to join @entity223
@entity223 boss @entity224 signed a new three - year contract ahead of his team 's opening match of the season at @entity229 on sunday
the 60 - year - old , the club 's longest - serving manager after joining in 1996 , is now tied to the @entity20 side until june 2014 .
