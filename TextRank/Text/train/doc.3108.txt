-- @entity3 , a @entity5 @entity4 associated with major legislative achievements over five terms in the @entity8 and the chamber 's last surviving @entity10 veteran , died on monday of viral pneumonia , his office said
@entity3 , 89 , missed key @entity8 votes late last year during a weeks - long absence because of a cold that turned into what he called a " severe case of bronchitis with fluid in the chest
" he also battled stomach cancer in recent years
he announced in a statement in february that he would not seek re-election next year , but he continued to push for stronger gun control laws
after last month 's @entity27 bombings , @entity3 said he would reintroduce legislation to require background checks for sales of explosive powder
an influential businessman - turned - legislator , @entity3 scored big victories in @entity34 , including a ban on smoking on airplanes , preventing domestic abusers from possessing guns , cracking down on drunken driving , and the " @entity40 " law about the release of pollutants into communities
" @entity3 has been one of the most productive senators in the history of this country , " senate majority leader @entity47 , @entity48 , said in december 2011 on the occasion of @entity3 's 9,000th vote , the statement by @entity3 's office said
on monday , political colleagues and foes lauded @entity3 as a passionate advocate for the issues he championed
@entity3 : the last ' swamp dog ' " he improved the lives of countless @entity62 with his commitment to our nation 's health and safety , from improving our public transportation to protecting citizens from gun violence to ensuring that members of our military and their families get the care they deserve , " said a statement by president @entity60 , a former senator
secretary of state @entity77 , in remarks to reporters , called his longtime fellow @entity79 senator " tenacious as a legislator " and someone who " never forgot where he came from
" in particular , @entity77 cited @entity3 's advocacy for environmental issues and his spirited defense of @entity77 's military record when it came under attack by @entity89 in the 2004 presidential election campaign
" he was as loyal as he was patriotic , " @entity77 said , also noting how " during the years when @entity3 was going through chemotherapy and he was weakened by cancer , he was still down there on the floor of the @entity8 floor fighting on every environmental debate late into the night
" @entity5 's @entity89 governor , @entity98 , told a @entity89 event on monday that he often disagreed politically with @entity100 , but he respected the senator 's battling spirit
" we had some good fights over our time -- battles on philosophy and the role of government , " @entity98 said
" i think the best way to describe @entity3 and the way he would probably want to be described to all of you today is as a fighter
senator @entity3 fought for the things he believed in and sometimes he just fought because he liked to
" @entity3 leaves tricky political question for @entity98 according to @entity5 law , @entity98 can appoint a temporary replacement to serve until a special election in november or fill the rest of @entity3 's term , which expires next year
with the likelihood that @entity98 will appoint a @entity89 , the @entity79 majority in the 100 - member @entity8 would decrease to 52 , along with two independents who caucus with the @entity79
possible @entity89 appointees would include state sens. @entity128 and @entity129 , a @entity98 ally who lost to @entity4 @entity130 in the @entity8 race last year ; lt gov. @entity132 , and @entity133 leader @entity133
on the @entity79 side , @entity135 mayor @entity134 announced in january he intended to run for the @entity8 next year , which caused a public tiff with @entity3 , who later decided against seeking re-election
the son of @entity142 and @entity143 immigrants , @entity3 grew up in @entity144 , @entity5 , and enlisted in the military at 18 , his office said
he was a member of the @entity146 from 1942 to 1946 , according to his biography
after the military , he graduated from @entity148 with the help of the @entity150 , then joined with two boyhood friends to start payroll processing firm @entity152 , or @entity152 , which grew into one of the world 's largest computing services companies
@entity3 was first elected to the @entity8 in 1982 and won re-election twice
he did not seek re-election in 2000 when his third term expired , but was recruited to run again two years later after @entity79 sen. @entity160 quit his re-election bid weeks before the polls opened amid reports of ethical issues
@entity3 was then re-elected in 2008
survivors include his wife , @entity100 ; six children ; and 13 grandchildren , the office statement said
