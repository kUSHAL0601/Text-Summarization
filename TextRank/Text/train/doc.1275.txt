@entity0 -- convulsions of violence followed the fierce clashes that killed dozens of people sunday in @entity6 , when @entity8 supporters clashed with their opponents and security forces
by tuesday , the death toll from sunday 's violence climbed to 55
that number could continue to rise , as some of the 250 injured could succumb to their wounds
on top of that , six @entity6 soldiers have died in attacks since sunday
in the city of @entity23 , a group of attackers shot and killed an @entity6 soldier on tuesday , according to state - run media
and on monday , @entity28 militants in the @entity29 killed five @entity6 soldiers in the town of @entity32 , state media said
in the village of @entity35 , they set off a car bomb that killed two people and wounded 48 , state media reported
jihadists have stepped up their assaults since @entity6 's military forcibly removed former president @entity41 from office in july
elsewhere in the country , his supporters continue vent their anger in the streets despite the muscle government security forces have applied to suppress and disperse them
sunday 's violence early sunday , @entity8 protesters marched in different neighborhoods in @entity0 and across the country
in @entity6 's capital , people swam across the @entity55 to escape arrest as military armored personnel carriers supported police clearing the streets of protesters
tear gas filled the air , and security forces with batons beat some of the protesters they detained
it was another powerful sign that @entity6 's military - backed interim government will go to almost any measure to shut down the @entity8 's protests
but in nearby @entity72 , the scene was drastically different ; throngs of people celebrated @entity75 at a festive event that included dancing and fireworks
as thousands of @entity8 protesters marched along the @entity55 from @entity0 toward @entity72 , security forces blocked their path and quickly dispersed the crowd
quelling the @entity8 in a statement , the @entity8 's @entity82 decried what it called " crimes of violence and murder committed today against peaceful protesters
" the group also said it holds the leaders of the coup that ousted @entity41 responsible
@entity6 's @entity92 said it had arrested 423 " rioters " on sunday
in september , an @entity6 court banned all activities of the @entity8 and froze its finances , drawing complaints from the international community
at the @entity100 , @entity6 's interim foreign minister sought to quell these concerns
@entity102 said @entity6 will hold elections in the spring
he also argued that the political process is open to all " as long as they are committed to the renunciation of violence and terrorism and acts of incitement to them
" on sunday , protesters from the @entity8 said they would accept nothing less than the reinstatement of the government led by @entity41
but supporters of the military in @entity72 remained adamant that that should n't happen
neither side appeared willing to compromise
violent clashes after relative calm new @entity6 government to be in place by spring , foreign minister says @entity1 's @entity124 contributed to this report .
