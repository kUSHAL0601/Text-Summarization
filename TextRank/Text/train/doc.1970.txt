@entity0 , @entity1 -- three representatives of the @entity4 and an @entity6 representative met twice monday with self - declared @entity1 president @entity7 in an attempt to persuade him to step down , but there was no indication late in the day that they were near their goal
" we had a very fruitful meeting between all parties and in a good spirit , " @entity14 president @entity13 told reporters after meeting with @entity7 for a second time monday in his residence here
" but the discussions are still underway
" he said a full statement would be issued tuesday , though there was no indication that further meetings would be held tuesday
the presidents of @entity27 , @entity14 and @entity28 , and the @entity6 mediator -- @entity31 prime minister @entity30 -- also met with the man the international community recognizes as the winner , @entity34
after the meeting , @entity34 told reporters that @entity7 must leave immediately
the @entity38 leaders then departed @entity0
they had indicated they were planning to fly to @entity39 , @entity40 , to consult with @entity40 president @entity41 on the matter
an election observer in the @entity1 's november 28 election for the @entity45 offered a dour interpretation of monday 's events
" it does n't look like he will take an offer from these leaders today , and that 's a real problem , it 's a tragedy , " @entity48 , told @entity49 in a telephone interview
" he is being obstinate right now
" the leaders ' apparent failure to make progress leaves the @entity38 community with little recourse but to strengthen the @entity62 presence , he said
" there has got to be a resolution of this , but it should not betray the wishes of the @entity1 people , " he said
@entity30 warned sunday that @entity7 must step down or face military intervention by his neighbors
he said the @entity1 's people " have spoken clearly " in the runoff , which international observers say @entity7 lost to his challenger , @entity34
@entity7 has refused to leave office and had himself sworn in for another term
the standoff has brought the country to the brink of renewed civil war
" we are engaged in this to ensure there is a peaceful solution -- that we do not have to use military force to sort out matters in @entity1 , " @entity30 told reporters , referring to the country by its @entity83 name
@entity4 has threatened to use " legitimate force " to remove @entity7 and called a two - day meeting of its defense chiefs january 17 to plan future steps if he fails to step down by then
@entity7 has said he wants an an international committee to recount the vote
but the @entity6 , @entity4 , the @entity62 , the @entity96 and the @entity97 all have recognized @entity34 as president - elect and called on @entity7 to step down
the impasse has led to a tense standoff in @entity0 , where @entity34 has been holed up since the election with @entity62 peacekeeping troops in the @entity103
on sunday , @entity7 cabinet minister @entity104 reversed his call for @entity106 to surround the hotel " to give a chance for peace and the negotiations that are going on
" @entity104 made the announcement on the state television network @entity112
@entity62 officials had warned @entity7 that the 9,000 - strong peacekeeping mission would " repulse and defeat " any attack
meanwhile , 400 to 500 refugees were crossing the border daily into @entity118 , putting pressure on @entity118 's ability to meet their needs , @entity116 , the @entity62 human rights commissioner representative for @entity118 told @entity49 from @entity124
" the local community and human rights organizations are working hard to see how to improve the basic services like water , like sanitation , health , and also provide them some relief items , " he said
asked about the possibility that @entity118 mercenaries might be on the ground in the @entity1 , @entity118 information minister @entity133 told @entity2 , " it is possible that some of them might want to get involved in mischief
" but , he added , " we have made it very , very clear , emphatically clear , that we would not support any @entity118 going to the @entity1 and anybody who is caught in that kind of position will be dealt with under our laws
" in @entity148 , a senior administration official said an offer for @entity7 to step down and travel to the @entity97 remained open
the official , who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue , said " if president @entity7 is looking for a dignified exit , we remain open to help him with that , but there 's no indication that he 's prepared to leave at this point
" the country was wracked by civil war from 2002 to 2007 , when a settlement left the country divided between north and south
the 2010 elections came with high expectations that they would open a new chapter in the country 's history
