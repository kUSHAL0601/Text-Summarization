-- @entity1 famously said that 80 % of success in life is about just showing up
success in life -- as in diplomacy -- is about showing up at the right time
so is @entity8 coming to the @entity11 - @entity10 crisis too early , too late or just at the right time ? the secretary of state has been eager to get into the middle of this almost since it started
he considered going last weekend from @entity16 , @entity17 , where he had joined five other world powers in negotiations with @entity21 on the nuclear deal
but he smartly decided -- or was discouraged by the @entity23 who were in the middle of their own cease - fire mediation -- not to go
still , the rising number of deaths primarily on the @entity29 side and the real danger of escalation of a ground incursion left him little choice
regardless of the outcome , after @entity35 and @entity36 , both president @entity34 and @entity8 realized that the @entity38 could n't sit on the sidelines like a potted plant
@entity8 arrives in @entity11 moreover , @entity8 's hot mic comments showing his irritation at @entity11 's supposed " pinpoint " airstrikes in @entity44 revealed a good deal more frustration than simply a desire to collect more frequent flier miles
@entity8 is an activist and simply could n't abide the fact that people were dying and the @entity38 was n't at least trying to stop it
but desire and passion wo n't produce a deal
@entity8 proved that in his nine - month effort to negotiate an agreed framework for peace between @entity11 prime minister @entity58 and @entity60 president @entity59
so what will it take to negotiate a cease - fire , and is @entity8 the guy to do it ? a key question is whether the combatants now believe it is urgent to reach a cease - fire : you would think that with more than 600 @entity29 dead , thousands wounded and displaced , and @entity11 soldiers ' casualties rising , the conflict would have created an imperative for de-escalation
and it may eventually bring both @entity10 and @entity11 to the point that a cease - fire is a top priority
at the same time , @entity11 's successful @entity80 missile defense system has insulated the government to a degree from popular pressure to stand down , and the @entity38 generally has been supportive of @entity11 's right to defend itself
but @entity29 civilian casualties have increased international pressure
and tuesday 's @entity88 decision to stop flights to and from @entity11 temporarily will remind @entity11 about the costs of the continuing confrontation
as for @entity10 , it 's not easy to read its calculations , in part because it 's not clear whether the military or political wing is in charge
but it is evident that having entered this conflict financially strapped and politically weak , @entity10 leaders believe they need to show something tangible for the death and destruction their missiles have produced in @entity44
and , by infiltrating @entity11 through tunnels and confrontation with @entity11 in @entity44 , they have inflicted more fatalities on the @entity108 than they did in the entire three - week war of 2008/9
indeed , @entity10 seems convinced this fight could continue for a while longer
bottom line : both sides may be reaching a tipping point when pain outweighs gain
but they just may not be there quite yet
a second key question is who is in a position to mediate the deal
@entity8 's formidable energy and talent notwithstanding , he can not do this deal on his own
@entity126 has plenty of influence with @entity11 under the right circumstances but none with @entity10
and that means relying on regional partners who do
but that poses a variety of complications
@entity23 wants to maintain the key role here while keeping @entity138 and @entity139 at bay to limit their @entity142 leanings
still the deal will likely require payment of @entity10 employee salaries and the @entity138 may be the banker on that one
@entity23 and @entity10 will also need to work out some new arrangement to ease crossings from @entity150 -- the largest pedestrian crossing from @entity44 to @entity23
@entity11 also wants to limit the gains @entity10 makes
it wants a clean cease - fire first and only then arrangements that might satisfy some of what @entity10 is seeking
in the middle of this is a secretary of state who 's very much improvising in an effort to determine who has the most influence with @entity10 and how best to go about using it
at the end of the day , it 's no coincidence that @entity8 stopped in @entity23 first
@entity165 will remain the fulcrum of this process
the final question is what kind of deal could be achieved
the simplest way to conclude this round would be quiet for quiet : no more @entity10 rockets and no more @entity11 military action
but it 's probably too late for that kind of a cease - fire , and it would likely only be a temporary respite
at the other extreme are a variety of proposals from demilitarization to reoccupation of @entity44 by @entity11 to eliminating @entity10 as an organization
but none of these are realistic
the best that can be hoped for is a kind of stability for stability in which a long - term cease - fire would be followed by a number of arrangements to open up @entity44 economically in exchange for @entity10 ' commitment to stand down and ensure that there would be no attacks against @entity11 via tunnels and rockets
indeed @entity11 may well demand the border with @entity44 be supervised to prevent reconstruction and reuse of @entity10 ' terror tunnels
in exchange , a number of parties would be asked to deliver on certain commitments : @entity138 would pay promised salaries for @entity10 employees under the @entity210 - @entity10 unity accord ; @entity23 would allow the @entity150 crossing to be opened under terms to be negotiated ; @entity11 would agree to open its crossings with @entity44 , perhaps with the return -- even in a symbolic manner -- of @entity60 officials in some role in @entity44
@entity23 would continue to crack down on military contraband , slowing @entity10 ' capacity to rearm
and the @entity220 -- together with international donors -- would work to deal with the humanitarian costs of the current crisis
sooner or later , something along these lines will be put together
and @entity8 can work to assemble part of it
but it will be @entity23 that will drive the train , not just because of its desire to be the key actor , but also to limit the outside influences of others
and of all the potential mediators , including the @entity38 , @entity11 would likely prefer @entity165 , which shares its objective of limiting @entity10 gains
none of this will provide a long - term solution to an @entity11 - @entity10 rivalry , let alone to the broader question of how to reach a two - state solution of the @entity11 - @entity29 problem
but it will bring to an end another costly round of @entity11 - @entity29 violence
and the time for that is long overdue .
