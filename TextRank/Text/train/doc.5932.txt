@entity0 , @entity1 -- prime minister @entity4 has ordered his government to take down concrete blast walls that line @entity0 's streets and surround whole neighborhoods , the @entity1 military announced thursday
the walls split @entity0 along sectarian lines , shielding some from @entity12 militias and @entity14 insurgents
" the concrete walls will be taken off from the main roads and side streets in all @entity0 areas , with no exceptions and within 40 days , " a statement from @entity1 military 's @entity21 read
the massive concrete barriers , typically 3 meters ( 10 feet ) tall , were quickly erected around many @entity0 buildings after the @entity26 invasion in 2003
they mushroomed during the sectarian warfare that followed the 2006 bombing of a @entity12 shrine in @entity31 , when they were put up to separate @entity12 and @entity14 districts across @entity0
while they split the city along sectarian lines , they also managed to protect neighborhood residents from @entity12 militias and @entity14 insurgents and helped @entity26 troops and @entity1 government forces manage security within them
the order does not cover the @entity43 , which houses @entity1 government buildings and the @entity26 embassy , or military installations , government institutions , hotels or some private companies
the order came after meeting wednesday with high - ranking security officials , according to the command
@entity1 forces are now calling the shots on issues related to security in their homeland since june 30 , the date @entity26 combat troops were mandated to leave @entity1 cities and towns pursuant to a joint security agreement .
