when @entity2 and her family abruptly fled from @entity6 's @entity5 province on a balmy august day , they left all their possessions behind
" i left with nothing , only a bottle of water , and this shirt , " says @entity8 , @entity2 's eldest son
the family traveled by foot for 15 days to reach the safety of @entity16
@entity8 's wife was pregnant , slowing their travel
by the time they arrived , 13 members of their family had been killed or kidnapped , including one 12 - year - old girl
today the surviving family members rely on plastic sheeting , cardboard and pallets for an improvised shelter
it was here that @entity8 welcomed a baby girl into their family , and in just a few weeks , he and his family may have to move again as local authorities , hoping to get children back in school , move displaced families into temporary shelters
many of these shelters are built of flimsy materials and some are missing walls , leaving families open to the chilly weather
it 's a terrible decision @entity2 and her family may have to make just as the freezing temperatures are expected to arrive : school or shelter ? " we do n't need anything else , " says @entity2 , " but , please , just help us for winter
" from northern @entity6 to @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , the continuing fighting across @entity57 and @entity6 is forcing families to run , and those who survive do not have what they need to last the winter
at the @entity64 refugee camp in @entity53 , where i visited last year , the cold wind shakes the tents and the temperature drops to freezing
drafty , damp shelters will spread illness and disease
while most of the year this desert city is bone dry , during winter the rain washes along the rocky ground
it can flood quickly , destroying what few things families still have and making even these sparse accommodations unlivable
in the past , floods have caused riots in the camp
there , a 10 - year - old girl , @entity82 , said to me , " we fear you are forgetting us
... have you ever thought of the children of @entity57 ? " roughly 6.5 million children have been affected by the war in @entity57 , and 1.6 million children are refugees
children represent fully half the 3 million refugees across the region
many @entity57 have sought refuge in @entity55 and @entity54
neighboring countries are being overwhelmed by the influx of refugees who have nothing but the clothes they wear
something as simple as a blanket can help a family adjust to their new situation , easing the burdens on their host communities
a blanket can keep out the cold during these harsh nights and make life as a refugee a little more bearable
when i was in @entity53 , i met a man named @entity114 , who had fled after being threatened by militants
his life as a refugee was nothing like what he left in @entity57
like many refugees , his life was n't too different from a middle - class @entity123 's
" we had everything , " he told me on my visit to @entity126 last year
he had a good job , a nice home and regular vacations with his family
@entity133 , @entity114 's wife , told me , " helping my children with homework was the most difficult part of my day
" but the family was caught in the epicenter of the civil war
their hometown , @entity142 , is nicknamed " @entity143
" @entity114 has scars and burns after being arrested and detained for six days
after getting out , he fled with his wife and seven children toward the @entity53 border , fearing for their safety the whole way
the family 's oldest daughter , 11 - year - old @entity152 , told me the road up and down mountains made her " so scared i did n't talk
" in @entity157 , where @entity2 and her family now live in @entity16 , 100 other families are seeking refuge
there is no proper sanitation , and people have taken to relieving themselves in the open air
heavy rains have caused flooding
these unsanitary conditions , experts believe , will lead to the spread of disease
as much as half of the vulnerable population is likely to need medical care
@entity2 and her son @entity8 , with his wife , are hopeful that the family 's 3 - week - old baby will be among those who live through the winter
the family has n't named the baby girl yet , in case she does n't survive
across the region , refugees need adequate shelter and other cold weather supplies such as coats , mattresses and blankets , boots and shoes , and socks and hats
@entity194 is distributing kits with these materials
however , the need continues to grow
@entity2 's family has survived a harrowing few months , but the hardest 40 days are yet to come .
