-- the human imagination is an amazing thing
take for example the story of how a simple father - and - son chat led to a prototype spacecraft for landing on other planets
one friday evening in 2009 , @entity9 engineer @entity8 arrived home from work feeling , well , kind of frustrated
@entity8 , who was chief engineer at @entity9 's @entity12 in @entity13 , believed the agency was under " incredible pressure and scrutiny " for allegedly high budget costs
@entity9 's ambitious @entity19 program to develop a next - generation rocket was about to be canceled
" the environment was a sense of uncertainty and chaos and redirection , " @entity8 told @entity0 last week on the phone
engineering , he believed , was n't being used to contribute to @entity9 's future
" that responsibility to make sure every dollar is spent exactly right within the agency sometimes causes a stifling of innovation , " @entity8 said
" what @entity9 needed was an innovative fire that made it ok to try and fail and learn from mistakes
" @entity8 ' 15 - year - old son noticed something was wrong
" ' you never talk bad about @entity9 , @entity42 , ' " @entity8 recalled his son saying
the conversation that followed , the engineer said , was a " moment of inspiration -- instigated by my son
" they sat down at the family dinner table and talked about how to " put @entity9 back on the map with a bold mission that seemed nearly impossible
" a short time later , @entity8 created a few charts and his son put together an illustrative @entity54 video
monday morning at his office , @entity8 made his pitch to his @entity9 leadership team
" i said , ' what if we unleashed the power of engineering , and did things our way , and were not deterred ? what could we do together ? ' " it was a radical idea : build an unmanned spacecraft with a robotic explorer and send it to the moon within 1,000 days
its engines would be powered by liquid oxygen and methane fuel
the vehicle would also have a self - guided laser landing system that avoided coming down on big boulders and other hazards
@entity78 ' fellow team members said , " yes
@entity8 then took his crusade to a higher level , briefing officials at @entity9 headquarters
" we told them , ' we 've got an idea that 's going to change the agency
' they were like : ' yeah , yeah , this is really good but politically this may not fly
' " nonetheless , @entity90 was born
" we had no money we had no endorsement from leadership , we had no authority to proceed , we had nothing
all we had was this commitment to do engineering in a lean , affordable way
" despite a shoestring budget , @entity78 ' team cobbled together the parts and technology they needed
at first , " a whole lot of political fallout came trying to squash the project , " @entity8 said
nonetheless , @entity90 gained momentum
" it was nothing like what @entity9 was used to
" eventually , " the whole attitude changed
" by june 2010 , @entity90 ended without making it to the moon
but it resulted in an offshoot project called the @entity116 planetary lander
an unmanned spacecraft that can haul 1,100 pounds of cargo , @entity116 looks like a four - legged metallic spider on steroids
given what this thing can do without risking human lives , the four - year program was a steal at $ 14 million
compare that to the approximate $ 1.7 billion cost of one space shuttle
that 's billion , with a " @entity130 " mainly @entity116 serves as a testing platform for new technologies that could take both unmanned and manned spacecraft to other worlds
it 's the first @entity9 prototype spacecraft to be propelled using liquid oxygen and liquid methane
it 's also the first to use a suite of laser - based sensors as a kind of autopilot for dangerous landing situations
" the technologies demonstrated on @entity116 are directly applicable to future robotic , and eventually human missions , " @entity116 project manager @entity143 told @entity0 via e-mail
that includes landing on asteroids , the moon , @entity151 , or even @entity153 's moon , @entity154
@entity156 president @entity155 has called for astronauts to orbit @entity151 by the mid- 2030s
but its development was n't exactly smooth sailing
in 2012 , during an engine test of a @entity116 prototype , the lander rose a short distance , rolled over and slammed into the ground
it caught fire immediately and exploded about 30 seconds later
thankfully there were no injuries , but the crash " was a huge setback for the team , " @entity8 said
@entity9 quickly " picked itself up " and figured out how to fix the problem
read more about the crash today , the latest version of the @entity116 lander " is a centerpiece for the agency to show what a fantastic team it is , and what incredible things can be done with just sheer willpower to imagine , " said @entity8 , who in 2013 ended a 25 - year career at @entity9 to start an engineering products business based on space technology
the sophisticated self - guided system that prevents @entity116 from setting down in hazardous landing zones could be used on a lander that could safely put astronauts on another planet
the auto - pilot could greatly reduce astronaut workload during the critical phase of a manned mission , @entity143 said
it opens up areas for exploration that were once considered too dangerous even for robotic landings -- like the north and south poles of the moon , which are riddled with craters
in fact , during the next decade , @entity9 plans an unprecedented mission to send astronauts to an asteroid
accomplishing that feat would be historic
on may 9 , two astronauts performed a simulated asteroid space walk at the @entity13 facility 's 40 - foot - deep low - gravity simulation pool
they practiced on a mockup of an @entity215 , @entity9 's manned spacecraft which is still being developed
read more about the asteroid mission amazingly , @entity9 planners hope to design a robot spacecraft that would capture an asteroid and haul it into a stable orbit near the moon
next , astronauts aboard an @entity215 would spacewalk to the asteroid and collect rock samples that would help scientists learn more about the components of asteroids
it 's possible that @entity116 ' fuel -- liquid oxygen and methane -- could be found on @entity151 or other planets
this opens the door to the idea that a @entity116 - like lander could refuel there
here 's how it might work : an unmanned fuel - making spacecraft would travel to @entity151 ahead of the lander
the fuel - making spacecraft would then harvest methane from the atmosphere , said @entity8
" if there 's water in the soil you would harvest the water and break down the water into oxygen and hydrogen
then the lander sets down near the fuel - making spacecraft and uses the oxygen and methane to refuel for another flight
how amazing would it be if that father - son talk across a @entity13 dinner table back in 2009 had even the smallest connection to a journey to another world ? human space exploration is " part of our dna , " said @entity8
" it 's as simple as that
we as human beings will find a way to strive to create , to invent
as long as there are planets in the sky that are unreachable , somebody 's going to try to reach them
