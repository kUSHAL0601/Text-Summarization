-- the moment has to happen sometime in a new administration , and the @entity4 speech was it : the end of the @entity7 campaign of limitless aspiration and the acknowledgement of a presidency burdened by harsh realities and difficult choices
the candidate who had called the surge in the @entity16 war " reckless " was proposing a surge of his own in @entity4
the candidate who criticized president @entity21 's emergency spending bills for the @entity16 war could end up proposing one of his own
the candidate who said that defined benchmarks -- and penalties -- were necessary for @entity21 's surge to work in @entity16 provided none of his own in his speech
yet , in the end , there was one consistency : the candidate who called @entity4 a " war of necessity " found that , as president , he still believes it to be true
there was a clear subtext in the president 's speech on @entity4 : i would n't be in this awful situation if my predecessor had n't sent troops to fight the wrong war in @entity16
it 's awfully late in the process to jump - start this war
i tried to figure out some other way to approach this , driving my generals and the intelligence community to distraction for three months with all of my questions and scenarios
no one can actually be certain that this is going to work , given the fact that we have to depend on the previously -- and notoriously -- untrustworthy governments in @entity4 and @entity61
but , knowing the threats that are out there , we have no choice : " if i did not think that the security of the @entity66 and the safety of the @entity66 people were at stake in @entity4 , " @entity7 said , " i would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow
" but he found out that he could not
nor could he go the leaner troop route initially proposed by vice president @entity72
@entity7 himself made it clear that @entity4 is no @entity75 : after all , our enemies there were n't looking for ways to kill @entity66 at home
and , by specifying a clear exit ramp , he made it clear that he is n't about to get bogged down in a war , as if saying it could make it true
or at least convince his liberal base to support him
yet what he could n't escape were the comparisons that he might be morphing into a version of @entity89 : a president with a robust domestic policy agenda fighting an unpopular war at the same time
and you can just hear his argument : i 'm not @entity89 ; we 're not getting bogged down
we 're getting in fast , and , after 18 months , we 're gone
but , like @entity89 and @entity75 , this is now @entity7 's war
it 's also @entity7 's economy -- and his high unemployment , his health care bill , his deficit
he 's all - in
and now , so are we
