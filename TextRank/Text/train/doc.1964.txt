-- a @entity2 waitress who served in the @entity3 for over two years told @entity0 friday she is now getting tips from all over the world after she says a family refused to tip her because she is gay
" i 'm sorry but i can not tip because i do not agree with what your lifestyle and how you live your life , " a family member wrote on the receipt for $ 93.55 at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity2
i was mad at first , and then i was more so hurt , " 22 - year - old @entity15 told @entity0
@entity15 , who did a tour with the @entity3 between 2009 and 2011 , said she has been " out open and proud for years , " but " never discussed with them ( the family ) anything ; it was their pure assumption
" " it 's disrespectful and it 's hurtful , " she said
" i feel bad for their children because that 's how they are going to be raised
" she says the trouble began when she approached the table of four -- a man , wife and two girls -- at around 7 p.m. wednesday
@entity15 said that when she introduced herself as @entity35 and told them she was going to be their server , the older woman " looked at me and said , ' i thought you were going to say your name is @entity34
' " @entity15 was so upset about the incident , she vented on @entity41 , and the group " have a @entity44 " posted her story on their @entity41 page
" people have sent me tips from all over the world just to show support
i have had people from @entity52 to @entity53 , @entity54 to the @entity55 , @entity56 , everywhere
" @entity15 says that between the people who have called in to the restaurant to give credit card numbers , those who have mailed tips , or donated to a special @entity61 account the restaurant set up , she estimates that she has received more than $ 2,000 so far
she plans to donate the funds to the @entity64 , and the restaurant plans to match the donations and give it to a local @entity69 organization
" it was n't for the money
i never planned on this
i just wanted to vent , " she said
" the purpose was to inform people it was n't ok
" @entity15 , noting that gay marriage recently became legal in @entity2 , added , " it 's 2013
this should n't be going on
" the general manager of the restaurant , @entity81 , did not release the family 's names , adding that " we fully respect our guests ' privacy
" @entity81 posted support for @entity15 on the restaurant 's @entity41 page : " @entity35 is one of our absolute best servers working here at @entity92
we as a team were deeply hurt by the events that transpired
i myself as the general manager took it personal as my team treats each other like a family
i made sure that @entity35 was compensated for the tip , as for emotionally i wish there was much more i could do
one thing i can say is that people of that woman 's kind business is not welcome here at @entity92 , and i can assure you that if they decide to dine here again that they will be turned away
" @entity113 's act of kindness a reminder that ' there is good in the world , ' waitress says
