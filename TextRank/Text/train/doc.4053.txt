@entity0 , @entity1 -- the fiery leader of @entity1 's @entity5 militant movement assured @entity1 on monday that his movement will cooperate in the country 's political life
supporters carry posters of @entity5 chief @entity11
@entity11 said : " we do n't want to have control over @entity1 , or to have governance over @entity1 or to impose our ideas over the people of @entity1 , because we believe @entity1 to be a special and diverse country that needs the collaboration of everyone
" @entity11 spoke a day after @entity1 's parliament elected @entity19 the country 's president after a six - month vacancy in the position
@entity11 , speaking at a packed stadium , told his followers : " i renew my appeal and invitation for a true national partnership with no eliminations or impositions
the national unity government is not the victory of the opposition against the pro-government
it is the victory of all @entity1
" he said @entity19 's election " renews the hope amongst the @entity1 people to a new era and a new start
" " i must say that there are deep wounds from our side and theirs , we are both in front of two choices ; either to expand the wounds and add salt to them or try to cure them for the sake of @entity1 and we prefer the second choice
" the parliament had tried 19 times to vote on a new president , but failed because of disagreements over how to share power in a new @entity60
@entity1 's @entity62 - backed government and the @entity5 - led opposition reached a deal last week aimed at ending an 18 - month political crisis that pushed the country to the brink of civil war , and paved the way for @entity19 's election
the agreement , reached in @entity71 , @entity72 , calls for a consensus government in which the @entity60 would be comprised of 30 posts -- 16 for the majority , 11 for the @entity5 - led opposition and three set aside for the president to nominate
the seat allocation had been a key sticking point for the opposition , which wanted to ensure it had the power to veto major decisions
with 11 @entity60 posts , it will have that power
in exchange for the veto power and a redistricting plan ahead of next year 's elections , @entity5 agreed to end its sit - in protest that has paralyzed downtown @entity0 since late 2006
in his speech , @entity19 expressed gratitude to @entity72 and to the @entity92 for helping broker the deal
@entity19 was the consensus candidate , and is viewed as a neutral party by @entity1 's political factions
the nation 's previous presidents have been seen as either @entity99 or pro-western
in his 10 years as chief of the army , @entity19 also is believed to have unified the splintered military
however , he inherits a nation grappling with divisions
@entity1 's elected , @entity62 government has long been locked in a power struggle with @entity5
in public statements and demonstrations in recent years , @entity5 threatened to use its power and popularity to oust the @entity112 - led government , triggering fears of a new civil war that could further destabilize the volatile region
the election helped end a political crisis that deteriorated into violence this month
that crisis was defused when the @entity1 government gave in to two key @entity5 demands -- lifting a government ban of @entity5 's telecommunications system and reinstating the chief of security at @entity0 's airport
" the performance of the opposition proved that it did not organize a coup , but only wanted the illegal government to withdraw its two decisions , " @entity11 said
" i promise that the opposition 's representation in the government will not be monopolized by @entity5 , @entity135 and the @entity136
we will give other opposition parties shares - and unfortunately we must speak of shares - even if it is at the expense of @entity5 's shares
" @entity5 has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks against @entity144 , @entity145 , and other @entity62 targets and the @entity144 lists it as a terrorist organization
but many in @entity1 and other parts of the @entity149 -- particularly @entity150 -- view @entity5 militants as freedom fighters .
