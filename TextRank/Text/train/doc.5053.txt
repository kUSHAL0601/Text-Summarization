-- it began as an attempt to shut up one woman -- a video - game developer who had criticized the entrenched sexism and misogyny in her industry -- by " slut - shaming " her and then threatening her
as other women entered the conversation that was spreading across the @entity13 , male gamer bullies organized to stamp them down as well , some of them adopting @entity15 as the rubric for their " movement
" when the argument finally caught the attention of mainstream media , the controversy was no longer only about the original issues
it had also become about who gets to determine the real meaning of @entity15
so , what is @entity15 ? explaining it makes @entity28 look like a piece of cake
( " you see , kids , burglars broke into @entity34 offices , and the @entity36 president tried to cover it up
" easy ! ) not gamergate
for one thing , unraveling the truth about the 1972 break - in at the @entity28 office complex fell to professional journalists and the legal system
for @entity15 -- now a catchall term for a kind of culture war sprung from the gaming world , taking in issues of sexism , free speech , journalistic ethics , identity and more -- the most timely and thoughtful coverage is coming from people who are affected by it
and now that we get to hear every person 's voice , online , there is no single national narrator
that means how you explain @entity15 depends on why you think it 's worth explaining
for example , just calling it by that name implies that it 's about some type of scurrilous behavior , in this case a breach of journalistic ethics ( which we 'll get to in a minute )
yet , if that 's all it were about , it would have sunk without a ripple
after all , there 's no evidence that there was any breach , and even if there were , why go after a woman who is a tiny indie game developer instead of the $ 100 billion mainstream industry that dwarfs @entity85 in its ability to unduly influence society and the media ? news : @entity90 pulls ads over sexism in video game drama so , if it 's not about that , then what is it about ? here are the facts , but they do n't tell the whole story
@entity99 is one of the creators of " @entity102 , " an award - winning indie game released in 2013 that , unlike the typical run - and - gun games , puts the player in the text - based shoes of a depressed teenager
about a month ago , an ex-boyfriend claimed the game had gotten a particular good review on a gaming news site only because ( the angry ex-boyfriend claimed ) @entity113 had had sex with the reviewer to further her career -- which @entity113 denies
even though the journalist had n't actually written a review , and the gaming news site found no wrongdoing , this triggered an avalanche of attacks on @entity113 's ethics from some of the @entity128 's danker forums , including threats of rape and murder
the fury directed at women went beyond @entity113 and beyond the @entity13
in the most visible episode so far , a few days ago @entity134 , who in august had released a video about the use and abuse of women in games , canceled a scheduled talk at @entity142 after the school received emails threatening to murder people at the event
because of the state 's open - carry law , the university refused to ban students from carrying guns into the event
those are the " newsworthy " events , but they do little to explain what 's happening
for example , with my hat of @entity157 on , i 'm tempted to say " of course no one -- gamer or not -- supports anyone threatening rape and mass murder
" but we do n't really know that
even if few would applaud such horrific acts of violence , the meaning of " support " is one of the questions raised by @entity15 : these women are being attacked for criticizing mainstream games ' diminishment of women , and some of the sites where these discussions have erupted have subcultures of misogyny
that is a type of support that ca n't be dismissed simply by disavowing those who threaten physical violence
in a brilliant post , the tech writer @entity185 explains why " stating the facts " is n't always the same as telling the truth
he says that @entity15 is " a fascinating glimpse of the future of grievance politics as they will be carried out by people who grew up online " -- a politics that exploits the " basic loophole in the system " : " the press 's genuine and deep - seated belief that you got ta hear both sides
" that 's why " a loosely organized , lightly noticed collection of gamers ... have been able to set the terms of debate " and chase women who speak up into hiding
a recounting of " the simple facts " makes this look like a " he said - she said " dispute over journalistic ethics
that gives too much credence to what " he said , " and , more importantly , distracts attention from the real issues
@entity223 's angry and hopeful post puts it all in terms of a larger shift
" there 's a culture war happening right now , " she begins
" it 's happening in games , in film , in journalism , in television , in fiction , in fandom
it 's happening online , everywhere
and everywhere , sexists , recreational misogynists and bigots are losing
" these groups ' fear that they are no longer going to be able to shape the story is what has driven " @entity15 " -- a term @entity223 pointedly does not use
" they ca n't understand , " she says , " why game designers , industry leaders , writers , public figures are lining up to disown their ideas and pledge to do better by women and girls in the future
" they ca n't understand why the ultra-mainstream @entity255 invited @entity256 -- a technology and culture critic -- to explain @entity15 to its readers
the old forces of assumed privilege are realizing they 're losing their grip on our culture
but , if @entity223 is right , the extremity of their tactics is a tacit admission that the game is over , even as the shouting continues
so , @entity15 has escalated not because , as with @entity28 , the " scandal " that started it has been discovered to be more extensive than it first seemed , or because there was a cover - up
before hashtags and the rest of the web infrastructure , @entity15 would have been an unpleasant story about an angry ex-boyfriend and a woman who wrote a game he did n't like
it would not have scaled up the way it has if we still had the old broadcast filters that presented clean national narratives that adhered to the national fiction that everything was basically ok , because it was ok for the class that got to tell us the news
@entity15 is one of the clearest examples of what happens now that the forging of the narrative not only occurs in public but becomes part of the event itself
is gamergate about game industry corruption ? journalistic ethics ? an ex-boyfriend 's revenge ? about the role of media ? or ( as i believe ) about our culture 's dismal history of dismissing women ? you can decide , but in so doing you 're taking a side
in the age of the @entity311 and the days of @entity15 , to understand is to take a stand and to explain is to participate .
