-- @entity2 has sold more than 10 million @entity4 systems for the @entity5 to retailers , the company announced wednesday
@entity4 , a controller - free gaming system that competes with the @entity9 and @entity8 , has been selling at an impressive rate since it launched in november
during the first three months after its launch , this rate was fast enough to earn @entity4 the title of " fastest - selling consumer device
" according to @entity14 , which officially confirmed the record today , @entity2 sold an average of 133,333 units per day between november 4 and january 3
" the sales figures here speak for themselves , " said @entity18 , gaming editor for @entity14 in a statement from @entity2
" according to independent research , no other consumer electronics device sold faster within a 60 - day time span , which is an incredible achievement considering the strength of the sector
" in comparison , it took the @entity9 about two years to pass the 10 million sales mark ( although to be fair , @entity28 's system was about $ 100 more expensive at launch than @entity2 's sensor )
kinect sales have unsurprisingly slowed since the holiday season and the initial launch
if sales had continued at the newly announced record rate , @entity2 would be announcing it had sold more than 18 million units instead of 10 million
even so , at this point it looks safe to call the device a smash hit
