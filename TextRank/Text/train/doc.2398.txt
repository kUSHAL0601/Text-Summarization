-- the woman was related to at least two of the three children
was she their doting mother ? an adoring aunt ? or , given her relative youth , perhaps a much older sister ? " that leaves you with so many possibilities , " says @entity8 state police sgt. @entity7
all four females are long dead , their bodies crammed into two 55 - gallon barrels , the first barrel discovered by a hunter in 1985 , the other 15 years later
they have never been identified
now , there 's a new push to solve a cold case that has stymied determined investigators
this week , the @entity20 , after a request from state police , released new @entity24 facial reconstructions of the four victims
they provide more details than previous images
investigators hope that someone , by looking at gaps in their teeth , thickness of lips , the length of their hair or other features , will make a connection
" the right person is going to see it , " says @entity39 , director of the center 's unknown victim identification team
seemingly endless questions and possible scenarios swirl around investigators who have sifted through hundreds of tips or leads over the years
is this a domestic case , or a professional hit ? how did the barrels come to be on a wooded lot near a state park in @entity53 , @entity8 ? were the four transients ? could they have lived on a commune ? did they live in other state or country ? police have no missing persons report associated with the mysterious case
@entity7 , in an interview with @entity0 on friday , said he has been open to theories and new evidence since he joined the case a few years ago
he 's certain of one thing
" i believe that there is somebody who knows who these children are and knows what happened to them
" two horrifying discoveries during deer season in 1985 , a hunter made a grisly discovery on a parcel of private property near @entity78 , known for its bogs , lakes and trails
a steel drum contained the remains of the woman , estimated to be between ages 23 and 33 , and the eldest girl , who was between 5 and 11
original reports indicated they died of blunt - force trauma
investigators later determined they were related in some way
state police , who handle nearly all homicide investigations in @entity8 , notified the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) , a computerized index that includes such reports
it was believed then that the victims might be a mother and child
" they came to every person 's door and asked , ' have you heard anything , if you knew anyone that 's missing ? ' " @entity53 resident @entity107 told told @entity0 @entity8 affiliate @entity108 this week
' " no , we have n't heard anything
' " within one day of the discovery of the bodies , state police were called in to investigate an apparently unrelated slaying of a man in nearby @entity116
suddenly , that murder became the priority of the police force
" it took a great number of resources , " @entity7 says of the @entity121 investigation
that murder was finally solved eight years ago
@entity8 , with a population of about 1
3 million , sees an average of only 20 to 30 homicides a year , according to @entity7
about half are domestic incidents
policy called for troopers to look into a cold case if they were not working on a current homicide
so , in 2000 , an investigator drove to the @entity53 scene to check on the proximity of barrels on the property to a road and a mobile home park close by
the property included a trailer and the remains of a burned camp store
in another barrel , the trooper found two more bodies -- a girl between 1 and 3 and another aged 2 to 4
tests indicated the woman whose body was found earlier was related to the younger child
so far , the girl between 2 and 4 has not been linked to the woman
instead of a mother and child , police broadcast that they had four victims , meaning old assumptions were gone
" so much can change in that span " of time , @entity7 says of evidence and investigative leads
police spoke to between 50 and 100 individuals , including the property owner and residents of the mobile home park
now the case is getting a fresher look
" we are reanalyzing each and every person , " says @entity7
the department , when the @entity94 broadcasts went out in 1985 and 2000 , was flooded with information
" we took great pains to rule people out
" the sergeant acknowledges that many may question why it took 15 years to find a second barrel 100 yards from the other
" how do four people go missing and nobody knows it " ? the sergeant cites resources needed for the @entity121 murder , the number of people in the major crime unit and the fact that autumn leaves covered much of the property
" they did the best with what they had at the time , " he says
@entity203 school deaths remain mystery " i keep an open mind to everything " @entity39 , of the @entity20 , tells @entity0 that she and her team are awaiting results of more comprehensive dna testing of the remains of the woman and young girls
they are being aided by additional autopsy photos not available years ago
evidence indicates the victims were white , but investigators do not know skin tone or eye color
the bones were not in the best condition , given they were exposed to the elements and years of deterioration , says @entity39
they may have died as early as 1977 or 1978
@entity224 , a forensic imaging specialist with the center , used newer technology to make the facial reconstructions
the use of clay directly applied on skulls is no longer necessary
investigators caution people looking at the reconstructions to focus on specific facial features
" do n't expect this to look like a @entity237 of the family member , " says @entity7
based on evidence and poor dental care , officials believe the four may not have been visible members of society
" if they interacted with people on regular basis and suddenly disappeared you would expect somebody to say something , " says @entity39 , a forensic scientist
and they may not have been in a traditional family setting
" i do n't think they were regularly in school and went home and had dinner with mom and dad every night , " says @entity39
@entity7 says , although it is a possibility , his hunch is the victims are not from @entity8
they could be from @entity262 , about 90 minutes away
or more remote portions of the @entity8
" i keep an open mind to everything , " @entity7 says
police are not certain whether the victims were killed elsewhere and dumped on the property -- or even when
" it takes a very certain profile of an individual to kill a child , " says @entity7 , who declined to elaborate on consultation with the @entity272 's behavioral analysis unit
" we either have n't reached the family members we need to , or we missing their family members and for their own reasons they are not coming forward
" one day , grave marker may bear names @entity283 and her brother , maintain a blog about the @entity53 case and have provided some information they 've gleaned to police
" this case is so compelling , " says @entity290 , who grew up in southern @entity8 and now lives in @entity291
" this story has been very quiet
" the siblings , who on their website say they do not represent a law enforcement agency , have talked with hundreds of people
@entity7 says the pair have been in contact with state police
@entity290 praises police for their doggedness and said she believes the case will be solved
she believes she and her brother are in a sense a proxy family for the victims
a grave marker at a church cemetery in @entity53 -- a town of about 4,400 east of @entity312 -- refers only to the first two victims found
" may their souls find peace in @entity319 's loving care , " the inscription reads
one day , @entity290 says , she would like the grave marker bear names of the four victims
" i want to see it resolved
" social media might have made a difference the woman and the girls were killed before there was text messaging , @entity330 and other forms of social media -- a fact not lost on investigators
and , back in 1985 , police did not have a clearinghouse for missing people
the @entity20 had been in existence for only one year
social media is a valuable tool for investigators , says the center 's @entity39 , who leads a five - member team
" from the missing side it has helped in a lot of cases , " she says
" you can see who perhaps who they were talking to
with teenagers , their friends know more than their families know
" unlike in 1978 or 1985 , people nowadays are extremely connected , be it through cell phones , e-mail or social media
" if you do n't get a text within two hours you might wonder what is going on , " says @entity39
still , she cautions , there are still cases today when people " are not reported missing for various reasons
" @entity7 says someone critical to identifying the four victims may not have come forward because of a sense of criminal liability or guilt for not having provided clues sooner
the victims , he says , may have been part of a disjointed family
he hopes the dna testing may clearly show the relationships among the four victims , providing police and the public more opportunities to identify them
" it 's an awful tragedy to lose a person to a homicide
it is terrible miscarriage of justice not to know who carried out the crime against your loved one
" @entity39 and her team are working on 650 cases involving unidentified children
the oldest case is from @entity395 , in 1933
since november 2011 , the team has helped identify seven children , one of whom was a victim of @entity400 , the so - called @entity401 , she says
@entity402 helped solve the cases
now @entity39 hopes to give a family a sense of closure
" a good day is giving a child their name back , " she says
" and we get very excited
