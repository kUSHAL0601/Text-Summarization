could you imagine a presidential election where two hopeful candidates had their campaigns run by the same communications firm ? welcome to the world of football where two men hoping to become the leader of @entity10 , football 's world governing body , are using the same campaign company despite ostensibly being in opposition
@entity15 , the former @entity17 and @entity18 midfielder and @entity20 's prince @entity19 have engaged @entity22 - based @entity21 to help land them the top job
a public relations company with great experience in sport , @entity25 also has a wider communications brief working with @entity30 , the @entity31 confederation within @entity10
meaning truth in @entity33 , @entity25 has enjoyed great success helping @entity35 win the hosting bid for the @entity37 , running @entity39 's successful presidential bid for the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) and working with the city of @entity42 during the @entity37 in @entity43
now it is set to play a key role in the presidential election -- by representing two of the candidates
both men along with @entity51 @entity50 are hoping to bring an end to the 17 - year reign of @entity54 , who at the age of 78 is aiming for a fifth consecutive term in office
but why are @entity15 , one of the finest players of his generation and @entity19 , the @entity20 prince who sits on the @entity61 , both using @entity62 to promote their campaigns ? responding to questions from @entity1 , @entity25 confirmed it was working on both campaigns
" @entity25 is proud to be providing prince @entity19 with strategic campaign and media relations support , " said the statement
" we also offer communications support , via the @entity73 , to @entity15 's campaign , and that includes his press conference in @entity22 this week
" @entity25 also has an ongoing contract with @entity30 , advising on a range of strategic communications matters
" we share a common commitment with all three reforming candidates and @entity30 to bring about positive change at @entity10
" @entity10 did not immediately respond to @entity1 's questions as to whether @entity54 was using a pr firm and how he was funding his re-election campaign @entity30 does not appear to have a problem with both the campaigns of prince @entity19 and @entity15 being run by the same company with the organization preferring to support a change of direction within @entity10 rather than back one specific candidate
rather than consider the two men opponents , the @entity31 governing body is believed to see the emergence of both prince @entity19 and @entity15 as two men who are sharing the common goal of reforming @entity10 and providing open and democratic debate
in a statement , @entity30 told @entity1 : " @entity30 appointed @entity21 as a consultant in march of 2014 to help support and develop its international communications activities
" as part of the contract with @entity30 , @entity25 deals with various matters concerning @entity31 and global football
" while @entity50 's campaign is being run separately , all three candidates are expected to meet ahead of the election
@entity30 president @entity110 has been outspoken in his desire to see change at the top of world football and wants @entity54 removed from the top job when the election takes place on may 29
he is likely to hold talks with the candidates a month or so before the election to see whether they have received enough support from the 209 national associations
it is thought that at least one of the three might pull out before the contest and instead pledge his votes to the candidate with the best chance of defeating @entity54
while @entity10 's image has been tarnished by numerous scandals under @entity54 's leadership , the @entity130 remains favorite to retain his position
the resignation of ethics investigator @entity136 over the organization 's handling of its own report into alleged corruption surrounding the @entity142 bids brought great embarrassment
but @entity54 's presidential rivals appear to have their work cut out to unseat the incumbent given the bedrock of support he enjoys , particularly in @entity149
" @entity54 has been very key for the development of the game in @entity149 , " @entity150 , head of the @entity152 @entity151 told @entity1
" there 's no fear
there are 54 countries -- i 'm not going to say 100 % that it 's a secret ballot , it 's not an open ballot , but everybody i 've spoken to is in one direction
" you need to decide that this man is an @entity149 , he feels @entity149 , he has supported @entity149 , and i will give him that support
" all four presidential candidates will be traveling to meet associations and hold talks over the election in the next couple of months
in an exclusive interview with @entity1 last month where he announced his intention to stand for president , @entity15 spoke of the need for change at the top of world football
the 42 - year - old , who made 127 international appearances for @entity182 , is admired by his fellow professionals and those who work within the game
" i can say i 'm a real candidate after today and i 'm looking forward to opening the debate and trying to get the support of many federations to have the chance to be the president , " added @entity15
" i think to [ take ] this step you have to be prepared
of course i did my homework but i have a lot of things that i have to learn , to improve , but if your mind is open i think it 's much more easy
" i have my ideas about what is football and what is good for improving @entity10 but i think my experience of my career is a positive thing that allows me to understand a lot of the game
my first priority is to know from the federations what they need
" i think one important thing is to increase the solidarity payments to the federations , because right now @entity10 has so many financial reserves that belong to the federations
" prince @entity19 , who spoke exclusively to @entity1 earlier this month , said he would leave @entity10 altogether if @entity54 won re-election
" i think the main point is to have a new culture " @entity19 told @entity1 in an interview after he addressed the media for the first time since announcing his intention to run
" it 's about not having the game controlled by people 's personal opinions or the whims of the president
it needs to be inclusive for all
" " i 've tried as much as i can to reform it from within ... having seen what 's happened i 'm not going to allow another four years of this , " prince @entity19 added while talking about @entity10 's internal workings .
