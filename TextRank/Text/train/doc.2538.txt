@entity1 - linked militants justified their takeover of a strategic opposition - held town near the @entity6 border with @entity7 by accusing the @entity6 rebels who held it of being pro-democracy traitors who cooperated with @entity12 officials like @entity14 sen. @entity13
the ousted rebels " have called for democracy ... which conflicts with @entity15 teachings , " the @entity15 and @entity6 announced in an online statement monday
@entity15 said it " cleansed " the northern border town of @entity21 of more moderate fighters from the rebel @entity23 in the past week because the rebels " received @entity14 senator @entity13 and agreed with him to fight @entity24
" earlier this year , @entity13 made a surprise visit to this border region to lend support to @entity6 rebels
@entity23 rebels have controlled @entity21 and the @entity6 side of the @entity33 border crossing with @entity7 since seizing the town from the government of president @entity36 last year
@entity15 militants attacked the @entity6 rebels and drove them out of @entity21 after the rebels refused to hand over a @entity40 doctor that the @entity1 - linked group accused of being a @entity12 spy
the deadly power play by @entity15 left at least one prominent @entity6 opposition activist from @entity21 dead
the militant group also detained dozens of other @entity47 fighters and activists , some of whom still remain in @entity15 custody
@entity15 ' ranks are bolstered by foreign jihadi militants from @entity54 , the @entity55 and @entity56
the group was denounced by the @entity58 , a @entity12 - backed opposition group that operates largely in exile
" @entity15 no longer fights the @entity36 regime , " the coalition declared in a statement published friday
" rather it is strengthening its positions in liberated areas at the expense of the civilians
@entity15 is inflicting on the people the same suppression of the @entity69 and the @entity36 regime
" but it is unclear how much the coalition can dictate events on the ground inside @entity6 , where the north of the country is controlled by an assortment of rebel factions that often compete for weapons , territory and financial resources
the @entity83 border gate is one of the main conduits for international aid to the opposition - controlled enclave in @entity6
international aid organizations have established logistical offices in the nearby @entity7 city of @entity92 to coordinate deliveries of badly needed food and medical supplies to millions of displaced @entity6
the @entity96 has used the gate for previous shipments of what it describes as " non-lethal aid " to @entity6 rebels
the @entity15 statement included a sharp warning to members of the @entity6 opposition who work with @entity12 governments and organizations
" those who cooperate with the @entity14 will be treated like them as per the @entity111 , " @entity15 announced
several hundred @entity23 fighters still control the customs terminal at the border gate leading to @entity7
however , eyewitnesses tell @entity116 that @entity15 militants now control the town of @entity21 , located less than a five - minute drive away .
