-- as @entity2 residents wait for a huge oil slick to reach their shores , the spill and the massive response already have begun wreaking havoc on livelihoods in a region where jobs are largely dependent on two ocean intensive industries : seafood and tourism
@entity15 , a city council member in @entity16 , @entity17 , said saturday that local scientists are predicting that the seafood crop could take a decade to recover from the oil slick
" the last two years have been tough already , " @entity20 said , referring to the recession
" this will be catastrophic to the mom - and - pop businesses , which is 90 percent of the business down here on the island
" @entity28 gov. @entity27 said saturday that heavy oil is likely to begin hitting the state 's coast by sunday or monday
@entity33 coast guard commandant adm. @entity32 -- the @entity35 administration 's national incident commander for the slick -- said saturday that oil also is likely to reach shorelines in @entity38 and @entity17 in coming days
but some @entity2 oyster beds and other seafood harvesting grounds are already awash in oil , according to @entity41 , executive director of the @entity17 - based environmental group @entity42
" it 's already covering shrimp beds and shrimp grounds in the @entity2 , " she said
" so it 's here and it 's now and it 's happening
" @entity41 said that the oil could ruin oyster beds for up to two decades
forty percent of the fish harvested in the lower 48 states comes from the @entity2
vacationers , meanwhile , spend billions of dollars every year in the region
but this week , many @entity33 canceled plans to travel to the @entity2 over the summer
" i 'm pretty much on pause right now ... it 's just a big waiting game , " said @entity56 , a fisherman who leads boat trips out of @entity58 , @entity28
" i 'm extremely worried because i have customers that [ have ] already canceled trips , " @entity56 said saturday
" i should be out taking people fishing today and i 'm not
i 'm not making money today
i 'm worried about the ' now ' factor , you know ? " besides the oil , the deployment of hundreds of thousands of feet of floating booms along the @entity2 to protect sensitive land areas has kept many fishing boats tied up at the dock
in @entity75 's @entity74 , where saturday was the deadline for tourists to cancel summer plans at many hotels , phones were ringing off the hook
" in the hurricane season , you know you ca n't stop the hurricane , but you can prepare ... and we 're great at that , " said @entity81 , deputy mayor of @entity82 , @entity75
" but how do we deal with an oil spill ? it 's a helpless feeling
" blows to seafood and tourism are likely to be felt in other industries in the @entity2 and beyond
" it affects the people that truck it , the people that make the ice , the people that [ provide ] fuel -- the labor just to transport it is just monumental , " said @entity20 , describing the long chain of workers involved in harvesting and shipping seafood
" it 's not just the people that catch it and process it
