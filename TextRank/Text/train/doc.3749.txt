@entity0 -- president @entity2 lags in several polls on fixing the economy
his favorability rating is virtually even with that of presumed @entity8 presidential nominee @entity7
his signature health care reform law appears on the verge of being overturned
women , once central to his base , are now drifting toward his opponent
he has even lost support among once - passionate young voters
yet , according to a @entity20 / @entity19 poll released this week , 56 % of those polled believe the president will cinch re-election this fall , compared to 36 % percents who think @entity7 will win
some are wondering : " what gives ? " despite the heated campaign , lackluster performance on the economy and negative feelings many conservatives have toward the incumbent president , many voters still like @entity2 as a person
and , in the popularity contest that is @entity38 politics , that can go a long way
he croons the opening lines of @entity42 's " @entity43 " and the @entity44 goes crazy
flattering pictures of him with the first lady and his daughters spread across @entity48 like kudzu
he goes on late - night tv to slow jam with @entity52 , and then reclaims the overplayed mantle of the " cool " president
poll : @entity7 up , @entity2 down among women @entity2 even turned on the charm during an appearance tuesday on " @entity59 , " a move political experts say will help revive his popularity among women -- a key voting bloc
he answered pop quiz questions about reality star @entity65 's short - lived marriage
he deferred to the first lady on a question about the racy " @entity68 , " a novel currently on many women 's must - read lists
still , he is locked in a virtual dead heat with @entity7 in nationwide horserace polls and his approval rating is stuck around 50 % , according to the latest @entity1 / @entity76 poll
but @entity19 this week has the president leading the former @entity79 governor by 29 points when it comes to " likeability
" and an earlier @entity1 / @entity76 poll had @entity2 nearly 10 points ahead of @entity7 on the likeability factor
poll : gender gap and likeability keep @entity2 over @entity7 @entity90 columnist @entity89 recently dubbed @entity2 the " @entity94 president , " attributing his high favorability marks to his " post-boomer manliness
" " it 's been long established that voters want a president they 're comfortable with , " said @entity95 , a senior editor with the @entity96
" what 's his favorite pastime ? playing basketball
he likes hanging out with his kids
it 's clear he 's a parent like most parents
he talks about his wife
he 's very good at connecting with people , he 's a good speaker
" those factors lend to @entity2 's " nice guy " image , @entity95 said
it 's an image the @entity2 campaign worked hard to cultivate during the 2008 election cycle when he was portrayed by @entity8 as an @entity114 - educated , poor - bowling , elitist professor who looked down on people who " cling to guns or religion
" sending first lady @entity120 out on a charm offensive to make the rounds on talk shows and dispatching vice president @entity124 to places like eastern @entity126 , where he was slated to speak on the president 's economic record , has also helped , @entity95 said
but his opponent is launching his own charisma counter-offensive
now that the bruising @entity8 primary has ended , the @entity7 campaign 's efforts to soften their candidate 's image as a stiff and out - of - touch rich guy may be paying off , said @entity137 , an associate professor of political science at @entity139 in @entity140
@entity7 got chuckles when he appeared on " @entity142 " in december
his @entity144 list of things he 'd like to say to the @entity38 people included quipping " what 's up gangstas -- it 's the @entity150
" other personal touches include a blog by @entity7 's personal aide , @entity153 , which chronicles his time on the campaign trail with the @entity8 presidential hopeful and even features a stop at @entity159 in @entity160
@entity163 's popular @entity162 page includes recipes and pictures of patriotic - themed desserts
@entity137 attributes most of the gain in @entity7 's favorability to fact that he 's the likely @entity8 presidential nominee
" now that it 's clear to see that he is going to be the nominee , you 'll find @entity8 voters fall in line and like their guy a little bit more , " she explained
still , @entity7 's comments about his wife owning " a couple of @entity183 , " stories about elevators and six - car garages , bragging about his pals who own @entity186 racing teams and @entity163 's recent appearance on @entity189 ' " @entity188 " in a $ 1,000 designer t - shirt fueled critics who accuse the former @entity79 governor of flaunting his wealth
even in the midst of a struggling economy , @entity194 used his popularity and likeability to help propel him to a second term in 1984
and @entity200 won a come - back re-election in 1948 after a series of battles with @entity204 over post-war reconstruction
but plenty of well - liked presidents ended up as one - termers , said @entity209 , director of the @entity211 's @entity210
former president @entity212 , who had a friendly , affable persona , had a tough time overcoming his pardon of @entity216
former president @entity217 , whose popularity peaked after the first @entity219 , was ultimately felled by a sluggish economy
" presidential decisions are a product of economic conditions and job approval , " @entity209 said
" it 's wonderful to be liked , but it does n't affect the vote that much
