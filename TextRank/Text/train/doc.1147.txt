-- @entity1 agreed friday in an @entity3 courtroom to a plea deal in one of the most sensational kidnapping cases in recent memory
the deal , reached with prosecutors , would let him avoid the possibility of a death sentence and spare his victims from having to testify at a trial
the plea deal recommends that he be sentenced to life in prison without parole -- that he never get a parole hearing
it would also mean that a trial @entity1 was facing on august 5 would not happen and he would not face the possibility of being sentenced to death
judge @entity23 went over the deal with @entity1 , and told him that he would be labeled as a sexual predator
@entity1 replied that he understood
at one point , he interjected that he was " also a victim as a child " to which @entity28 responded that he could make whatever statement he wanted during the sentencing hearing
@entity28 also said that victims would be notified of the hearing and also would then have a chance to say what they liked
@entity28 went through charges @entity1 faces relating to the allegations he held three women captive for a decade and asked him how he pleaded
over and over , @entity1 replied : " guilty
" at another moment in the hearing , which lasted well over an hour , the judge asked @entity1 how good his @entity44 is
@entity1 replied that he is good at spelling and reading but his comprehension is bad because " my addiction to pornography and my sexual problem has really taken a toll on my mind
