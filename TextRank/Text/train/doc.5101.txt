-- @entity1 will launch @entity2 on february 7 , which will be the first of five launches this year before the shuttle fleet is retired
@entity2 will blast off from the @entity6 in @entity7 on a 13 - day mission to the international space station
the mission will include three spacewalks , @entity1 said
the shuttle will also deliver the final @entity13 portion of the space station
this portion will provide more room for crew members
@entity1 plans to retire its space shuttles @entity19 , @entity2 and @entity20 later this year
the space agency has been looking for places , such as museums , to house the shuttles after they are retired
@entity19 will be transferred to the @entity25 in @entity26
the privilege of showing off a shuttle wo n't be cheap -- about $ 29 million , @entity1 said .
