-- the @entity1 released thursday what it says is video showing gruesome images of many dead chickens -- and in some cases , mummified chicken carcasses -- at a farm in southeastern @entity8
the animal protection organization says the video is from an undercover investigation it conducted at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity8 , in february and march
@entity14 , on its website , describes itself as " a real working farm supplying fresh quality eggs , milk , drinks and premium batch - churned ice cream to select wholesalers and retail stores
" the video , played in a news conference , showed dead chickens in cramped cages surrounded by live chickens and eggs
many of the birds appeared to be trapped either in cage wire or in automated feeding machinery
" during the investigation , thousands of birds died of dehydration when there was a water system malfunction that people did n't notice for two or three days , " said @entity35 , vice president of the @entity1
" @entity43 's legs and wings and more were found stuck inside of the wires of the cages , trapping these animals , preventing them from gaining access to food or water
some of the floors in these barns were so packed with dead flies that our investigator described the experience as similar to walking on top of @entity59
" but @entity14 president and ceo @entity61 issued a statement disputing the @entity64 's claims
" the allegations by @entity1 are a gross distortion of @entity14 , our employees and the way we care for our birds , " the statement read
" there are still many unanswered questions regarding how and when this video was shot , edited and assembled
" the @entity64 is pushing for passage of a bill currently in the @entity75 that it says would lead to a friendlier system of egg production
the bill is supported by the @entity78 , which represents farmers responsible for more than 80 % of the country 's egg production
other influential food - industry organizations , however , are opposed to the legislation
the @entity85 , for example , issued a news release in january calling it a " farm takeover bill , " and saying " it would set a ' dangerous precedent ' for allowing the federal government to regulate on - farm production practices , including animal housing
" the bill calls for an increase in the size of chicken cages , with the aim of preventing cramped and unsanitary conditions in which chickens lay eggs
the law would be phased in over an extended period to give farms time to make the necessary changes
it is unclear when the @entity75 might take up the bill for consideration
@entity61 said in his statement @entity14 supports such legislation and asserted that more than 80 % of the chickens there are already housed in new , larger , state - of - the art facilities
still , @entity35 said the conditions on farms such as @entity61 's are n't acceptable and threaten the health of people
" there is a direct connection many times between how we treat animals and problems that we cause for ourselves , " he said
" oftentimes when we abuse farm animals , we 're not doing ourselves any favors in the process
" there 's a clear case to be made , for example , that increasing the amount of birds who are cramming in together , giving them less and less space , increases the risk of salmonella infection
in fact , at @entity14 we saw they were testing positive for salmonella at this facility
and so it 's important to recognize that , of course , the cruelty to animals by itself is extraordinarily problematic , but there 's also a consumer safety aspect to this
