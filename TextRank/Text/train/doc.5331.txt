-- @entity1 has been hailed as the greatest soccer player the world has ever seen following his extraordinary exploits for @entity6 champions @entity5
the 22 - year - old has scored 10 goals in his past four games , including two hat - tricks in consecutive @entity12 league matches
the diminutive @entity13 forward has kept @entity5 in the hunt for a second successive @entity16 title , and his two goals against @entity18 last wednesday helped put the @entity20 titleholders into the quarterfinals of @entity23 's premier club competition
blog : is @entity1 better than @entity25 ? sunday 's treble against @entity27 was his third this season , and his fifth since making his debut in 2004 , taking him to 25 league goals this campaign -- five more than closest rival @entity34 of @entity35 , and two past his tally from last season with 11 games still to play
@entity1 is now third on @entity5 's all - time scoring list , and has the chance to net his 200th goal for the club in wednesday 's league game against @entity45
after the @entity27 game , @entity5 president @entity46 compared @entity1 -- who was named 2009 's best player in the world -- with the club 's legendary former stars @entity25 and @entity50
" he 's the best player in the world right now and the best ever , " @entity46 told @entity5 's web site
" together with @entity50 and @entity25 , he 's the best we 've seen at the club
" he 's a player who can change everything in a game , but he also works for the rest of the team
he 's a real leader
" coach @entity61 said he had run out of superlatives to describe the performances of @entity1 , who has scored 11 of @entity5 's last 15 goals
" he 's been more than decisive , and you can tell he 's feeling fit the way he gets involved in everything
i 've run out of adjectives -- you 'll have to put your own , " @entity61 said
" that he 's capable of doing everything that he does at his age is something impressive
it does n't make any sense
" @entity61 revealed that @entity1 had been in doubt for the @entity27 game due to a gum infection in his mouth
" he was in a lot of pain
but in the morning i asked him how he was and he told me that he was better
before the game i asked if he wanted to play and he said yes , i asked him how many minutes and he told me the whole game , " @entity61 told reporters
" he always wants to play , whether it 's the @entity20 final or against a third - division side
for me it 's difficult to leave him out , seeing the form he 's in
he 's an amateur in this sense , he always wants to play
" @entity1 has not always carried his amazing club form onto the international stage with @entity13 , but he has the chance to redress that situation in june at the @entity95 in @entity96
" the person who most wants to see him succeed for @entity13 is @entity1 himself , nobody should doubt that , " @entity61 said .
