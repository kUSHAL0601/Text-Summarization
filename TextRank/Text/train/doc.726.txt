-- films have altered the course of human history before
the rise of @entity5 would not have been as rapid and absolute had it not been for the @entity7 's potent command of propaganda , including @entity10 's monumental glorification of the fascist regime , " @entity12
" and @entity14 's celebration of white supremacy , " @entity13 , " helped to resurrect the @entity16
both these films are repellent , yet are judged to be masterpieces of world cinema , and their directors among the greatest of all time
so it 's hard to imagine that a movie as slight and crude as " @entity26 " could serve as a similar kind of historical watershed
and yet , future generations may well look to it as marking the emergence of a new chapter in geopolitics , dominated by a fresh set of actors and wildly different forms of conflict
if the attacks of september 11 taught us to fear insurgent groups using improvised weapons against civilians -- @entity40 , the @entity43 , @entity44 -- what we 've learned from the " interview " fiasco is that even nation states and " traditional " terror organizations can now find themselves to be nothing more than blindsided bystanders in strange battles between entities with hidden ( or purposely misleading ) agendas
mysterious ad hoc hacker networks
and these struggles will play out in the dark , with far - reaching and unpredictable consequences
was the hacker attack that crippled media titan @entity64 insider sabotage , an attempt at extortion , a terrorist strike or , as more hawkish types have suggested , the overture to formal war ? were its perpetrators disgruntled employees , internet pranksters , black hat mercenaries or the shadowy digital armies of rival nations ? perhaps the most frightening thing is that , months after the assaults , we still do n't know exactly when they began , what their true objective was and , of course , who was actually behind them
@entity64 was quick to assign blame to @entity88 , based on the conclusions of federal investigators
president @entity91 issued a condemnation of the hermit kingdom 's " cybervandalism " and promised to " respond proportionately
" and , in a gesture of profound corporate cowardice , @entity64 yanked " @entity26 " after a number of movie theater chains said they would not screen the movie
since then , other researchers have raised serious questions about @entity88 's real role in the hacks , pointing to the fact that while @entity88 might have had a clear motive -- suppressing the release of a work that might embarrass its supreme leader -- early messages to @entity64 reportedly did not focus on " @entity26 , " and instead sought vague " monetary compensation
" meanwhile , publicly released evidence of @entity88 involvement seems flimsy , the country itself has hotly denied it is behind the hacks , and more recent theories have pointed instead to a possible inside job , or to hackers from other countries with greater resources and more ambiguous aims
the results of independent linguistic analyses performed on the messages sent by hackers make their @entity88 origin questionable , and even suggest they were translated from @entity126
( it 's also worth noting that @entity126 's @entity128 this week held a press conference slamming " @entity26 " as " aggressively scandalous , " while also denouncing the @entity131 accusations against @entity88 as being without " direct evidence
" as these theories and allegations have circulated , the playing field has continued to shift
a group claiming to be members of the enigmatic hacker coalition @entity138 vowed vague reprisal against @entity88
a few days later , @entity88 's internet access was shut down by a denial of service attack
as all this occurred , @entity64 changed its mind about releasing " @entity26 , " allowing 300 theaters to screen the film despite warnings of physical attacks on moviegoers , while putting it on @entity150 's @entity149 and @entity151
but the fact that it instantly leapt to the top of the popularity charts on both platforms has led some conspiracy minded people to wonder whether the entire episode was n't a pr stunt ( albeit one that got out of hand -- the revelations from the email leaks were far too damaging to have been released intentionally )
and this is where things get oddly meta
i mentioned that " @entity26 " comes off as a trivial work of frat - boy comedy , full of the toilet humor , misogyny , gay - panic japery and racial stereotypes that have marked other @entity176 / @entity175 collaborations
( however , unlike others who 've criticized it , i do n't think it is any worse than , say , " @entity180
" ) but the movie 's last scene ( spoiler alert ! ) , consciously or not , turns it into something with a darker kind of self - awareness
@entity176 's character , celebrity talk show host @entity187 , is shown reading the last page of his best - selling book about their madcap assassination adventure in @entity88 to a huge and rapt crowd
he begins as follows : " it was the beginning of a revolution
a revolution @entity196 [ @entity197 , @entity199 's producer , played by @entity175 ] and i started
" they continue by noting that this " revolution " was not one waged with ordinary weapons , but with the power of the media -- and with what can only be defined as trollery
" this was a revolution , " he continues , " ignited with nothing more than a camera and some questions
questions that led a man once revered as a god among mortals to cry and sh * t his pants
" it 's a concise summary of the new era in which we live , where the ability to manipulate media and technology has increasingly become a critical strategic resource , where combat is conducted not just on battlefields but on servers and screens and social networks , and where it 's increasingly impossible to tell the difference between pranks , crimes and acts of war
