@entity21 was one of the few ministers in @entity27 's @entity129 who had n't been connected to the @entity45
he resigned from the @entity27 government in the weeks before the coup , because a man associated with an @entity84 group tied to militants who killed tourists in 1997 was appointed as governor of @entity138 province
