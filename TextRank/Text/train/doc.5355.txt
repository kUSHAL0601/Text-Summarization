-- the state of @entity3 must fund some of @entity5 's defense in her first - degree murder trial for the death of daughter @entity5 , a judge ruled friday
" all costs submitted shall be in compliance with the @entity14 's caps and rates and are subject to further review , " @entity9 judge @entity8 said in a order issued friday
@entity18 's defense team told the court thursday that she was broke and could not bear expenses associated with her defense
in friday 's order , @entity8 granted @entity18 's request to be declared indigent , which means the state will pay expenses related to her defense on a discretionary basis except for private attorney 's fees
under @entity3 law , there is a presumption that a defendant is not indigent if he or she has assets of $ 2,500 or more , excluding the value of a home and one vehicle having a net value less than $ 5,000
the " expectancy " of money is also taken into consideration
defense lawyers testified thursday that there were not any book or movie deals on the horizon for @entity18
a spokeswoman for the @entity49 in @entity50 praised the ruling
" the defense is pleased that this ruling came after an analysis of supplementary documents detailing the defense 's income and expenditures , which were deemed by the court to meet the legal standards for the determination of indigency for costs , " @entity52 said
" after consistent misinformation from legal analysts , bloggers , and commentators , the defense hopes this ruling ends inappropriate speculation regarding any misuse of funds and looks forward to miss @entity18 's day in court
" @entity18 's lead attorney , @entity76 , and @entity78 death penalty attorney @entity77 said in a four - page motion that they are not asking the state to pay their legal fees
they asked for assistance with fees for the service of subpoenas , investigations , travel , experts to interpret forensic evidence , expert witness fees and the cost of depositions
the defense attorneys argued that @entity18 is entitled to financial assistance under the @entity98 's @entity97 , which protects her right to a fair trial
because prosecutors have indicated they are seeking the death penalty , @entity18 also is entitled to " the unique standard of care required for a capital defense , " the attorneys assert
@entity5 's body was found in a lot near her grandparents ' home in december 2008
the grandparents , @entity112 and @entity5 , have been supportive of @entity5 but now are fighting foreclosure , according to a complaint filed by @entity115
@entity76 testified thursday that the defense received and spent about $ 275,000 over the past year and a half
of that , $ 5,000 came from an anonymous donor ; $ 70,000 came from a former defense attorney , @entity120 ; and $ 200,000 came from @entity121 through a " deal " with @entity18
the terms of the deal were not released
that money , @entity76 said , was spent on defense costs including travel , depositions and retention of experts
" it 's been quite an expensive task , " he said
@entity76 , who testified that he has spent about 2,500 hours on the case , has been paid an estimated $ 89,454 , according to financial affidavits released by the court and written in what appears to be @entity5 's handwriting
@entity137 has received $ 22,500 but testified thursday that all of that money went back into costs associated with the case
" there 's not a dime " left , she said
@entity18 wrote that both attorneys " were or are being paid by myself " and said her income is " zero " and her assets are " zero
" she did not list her debts or liabilities
two more attorneys , @entity152 and @entity153 , testified that they are working pro bono -- for free -- on the case .
