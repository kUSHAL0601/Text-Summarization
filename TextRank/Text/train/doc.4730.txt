-- a man filmed a group of girls attacking a 12 - year - old girl in his neighbor 's garden , and told @entity7 , @entity8 , police he thought it was a prank
two of the girls have been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy , and two others have been charged with simple assault and conspiracy , said @entity19 sgt. @entity18
the 12 - year - old suffered two black eyes , a bruised nose and bite marks on her hands
@entity25 , the girl 's mother , said , " my daughter is doing ok
she does n't look very good , but she 's a strong child
" she said her daughter has a shunt in her brain to aid with a medical problem , but the shunt was not damaged in the assault
the man posted the video of the incident on @entity37 , where he shows his face to the camera and describes the attack , " kids are ( expletive ) sitting outside for like 20 minutes saying , ' do n't do this , do n't do that
you got ta keep going , you got ta keep fighting
' they 're like planning it so they can just record it
" while he speaks , girls can be heard shouting in the background
@entity18 said additional cell phone video of the attack was turned in to police after it was confiscated at @entity55
the principal 's office was closed when @entity0 tried to contact the school
@entity18 said the man is not being charged and is not involved in the case now that the video is no longer in his possession
@entity25 said she was " horrified " the man did n't try to stop her daughter 's attack
@entity25 said the leader of the girls invited her daughter to spend friday night at her house and that all was normal between the girls
she said there had been no major incidents between them besides what she said were the usual ups and downs of a young school friendship
@entity25 described her daughter as someone who " is very quiet
she likes to stay to herself
she tries to get people to like her
" on saturday afternoon , @entity25 said , the situation changed
" my daughter said everything turned bad in about 10 minutes
she was attacked and they would n't stop
she got up and ran
then they attacked her on the pavement
not even the man who videoed it
" @entity25 said the other girls posed as her daughter via text message , quickly canceling a request from her daughter to be picked up with a message saying , " can i please stay the night ? " after the incident , @entity25 's daughter started to walk home before being picked up by one of her friends , who she begged not to tell her mother about the incident because she was afraid of retribution , @entity25 said
when the girl got home , @entity25 said her daughter told her she was hit by a softball , but then began crying and explained what happened
@entity25 said there were no parents in the house at the time of the incident
the mother of the girl accused of leading the attack spoke to @entity0 affiliate @entity111 and said , " i love my daughter , too
but my daughter needs help
my daughter has done this too many times
she needs to be punished for this
" @entity18 said two of the girls had been turned in by their parents to police and charged as minors , while the other two are expected to be turned in soon
parents of the other girls were not available for comment .
