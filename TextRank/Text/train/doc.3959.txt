last week , i had the privilege to greet a group of about 100 @entity5 survivors who were meeting at the @entity7 chapel : the very structure that , seven months ago , was @entity9 's first @entity5 treatment unit
the group was diverse — elderly , young people , even little children
some educated , some not
roughly equal numbers of men and women ; some dressed up in nice clothes , some in t - shirts , shorts and flip - flops
some were clearly feeling happy just to have survived ebola , with smiles on their faces , while others looked like they were still experiencing some of the trauma and stigma of @entity5 : faces downcast , not making eye contact
as i met them , tears welled up in my eyes
these people had gotten through @entity5 just like i had , but here in @entity32 , where the resources , staff and treatment available were so much more limited
the gathering was initiated by the @entity37 of @entity32 , a local nongovernmental organization that has received funding to help @entity5 survivors
they were meeting with some of the survivors from the @entity42 in order to share a modest cash benefit , intended to help survivors rebuild their lives : replacing mattresses , clothes , furniture and phones , finding new employment , and trying to fit back into their communities
they also met with dr. @entity55 , another missionary doctor at @entity7
he let them know about a free survivors ' clinic at @entity7 to address complications of @entity5 , such as nerve damage or vision problems
on the national level , the @entity62 of @entity32 is well - organized , considering the brief time frame
it has a president , who presented me with his business card at the meeting
there are estimated to be about 1,500 @entity5 survivors in @entity32
in partnership with several international organizations , the association advocates for survivors ' mental and physical needs , and educates the public about @entity5 survivors to help reduce stigma
a few days earlier , i had met with another group of survivors : the @entity80 for @entity82
this was quite a different meeting
there were about 15 people there , many of whom i know well from having worked with them and treated them over the years since the program began in 2001
now that the @entity92 crisis is subsiding , they want to revitalize the group , which at times has had 80 to 100 people involved
in the past , @entity7 staff ran the support group and decided how to facilitate its activities , using funds from @entity99
but now these long - term clients — they are all on anti-retroviral therapy , some for years — want to become more independent , to be given more discretion to strategize and make decisions about how to use funding that is available
this was such an interesting and eye - opening discussion for me
early on , when we were just starting @entity7 's treatment program for @entity112 , many of these clients were quite ill , and needed nutritional support , medication and health care , and help with transportation to appointments and support group meetings
now the group has matured : many are very stable on their medication and really thriving
at this stage , they feel the need to be treated as equal partners rather than only recipients of charity
they want more input as to how the group might benefit from funds that come in
when a donation was made by @entity99 to the group about six weeks ago , they chose to make soap for laundry and dishes from locally sourced lye and palm oil , to sell it as a fundraising activity
the balls of soap sell for about 12 cents each
the group has sold most of the first batch , and they are projecting a profit of about 25 % over the cost of raw materials
they want to continue soap production , using the profits to help members of the group start businesses or attend college or other training programs
when i see the spark of initiative and determination in these people who were once so sick and discouraged with their condition , i get a new sense of what might be possible for them
what were the key ingredients in developing that spark ? our relationship started with unconditional love , and a real personal connection , as well as provision for some key practical needs , including sound medical care
and now it requires a readiness , and a means , to shift from charity to partnership
during the @entity5 crisis , we have seen that @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity32 , some of the least developed nations on the continent , did not have the capacity to fight the epidemic on their own
while the initial response to @entity5 required massive direct aid and assistance , let 's hope that we can also move on to real partnership in helping develop a locally led and driven health system that can do better at protecting its people from the next outbreak .
