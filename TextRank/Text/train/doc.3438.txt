@entity0 -- the @entity2 is planning to hold overdue elections this year , a move seen as a reaction to the political discontent taking hold across the @entity9 world
officials said the authority will hold legislative and presidential elections no later than september in the @entity13 and @entity14
the announcement comes a few days after officials said they intend to hold local elections in the @entity13 and @entity14
@entity18 , the secretary - general of the @entity19 , said polls will be held " to satisfy the will of the @entity2 people
" @entity2 legislator @entity23 said the @entity24 believe " it 's high time " for polls " because we need to re-establish the legitimacy of our institutions through elections
" " we are a big nation , we have lots of people with potential and ability and integrity and charisma and national commitment and i think we should come up with leadership that will do the job , " she told @entity1
@entity24 regard these moves as a response to ferment in the @entity9 world -- street outrage that sparked the overthrow of strongmen in @entity47 and @entity48 , a government change in @entity50 , and a promise in @entity52 to end the emergency rule there
also , leaders across the @entity9 world are envisioning reforms to address grassroots economic grievances
the election announcement was also made amid a persistent focus on resolving @entity2 disputes with @entity60
in another development on saturday that clouds the direction of @entity60 - @entity2 talks , chief @entity2 negotiator @entity61 , the face of the @entity2 people to many in the @entity13 , resigned from his post
the election announcement comes amid a deep political schism
the @entity13 government of the @entity2 is dominated by the @entity73 party of president @entity74 , and @entity14 is ruled by the rival @entity76 group @entity75
it 's unclear now whether the polls will be held in @entity14 since the @entity75 movement rejects the authority of the @entity2 government in the @entity13 city of @entity83
@entity75 spokesman @entity84 called the plan for elections " invalid and illegal , " claiming that @entity2 leaders president @entity74 and @entity88 lack the legitimacy to make such a move
he said that political reconciliation between @entity24 was necessary before elections could be held and characterized the announcement as a move by the @entity2 to prevent the wave of revolutionary changes taking place in the region from spreading to the @entity24
but @entity23 said the @entity2 is trying to persuade @entity75 to participate in elections and believes elections would help the state address its concerns with @entity60
" we are preparing also for statehood and we believe this is an instrument for national unity -- so all these things made it imperative that we do have elections between now and september , " she said
the vote would mark the first time elections have been held in the @entity2 territories since 2006
in that year , legislative elections brought @entity75 into power and led to international sanctions against the @entity2 until @entity75 agrees to the renunciation of violence , acceptance of previous agreements between the @entity2 and @entity60 , and the recognition of @entity60
various attempts at reaching an accord through @entity2 unity talks have ended in deadlock
@entity60 wields ultimate authority in the @entity13 despite significant local autonomy there
@entity60 withdrew its troops and citizens from @entity14 in 2005 , but attacks by @entity14 - based militants on the jewish state have prompted tough @entity60 military responses and a stiff economic embargo
" we are undergoing a serious political crisis given the fact that @entity60 is continuing settlement activities -- there are no negotiations and there is no international will to hold @entity60 accountable , " said @entity23 , who 's also a member of the @entity73 executive committee .
