-- @entity2 's decision to fine @entity4 striker @entity3 for revealing a sponsor 's name on his underpants during a @entity9 game may have opened a can of worms for football 's @entity12 governing body
@entity3 was fined $ 126,000 and banned from playing in @entity4 's next competitive game for flashing his sponsored waistband as he celebrated a goal against @entity17
for @entity21 bookmaker @entity19 , who has announced it will pay the fine on @entity3 's behalf , the hefty fee probably represents good value for the publicity the stunt has gained
already , @entity19 has announced on its website that @entity3 was wearing " lucky pants
" but a leading expert in sports business has warned that any form of " ambush marketing " has a danger of backfiring
@entity35 double dumps out @entity36 , @entity37 also exit " for brands entering into sports sponsorship , it 's all about eyeballs , " said @entity38 , professor in sports business strategy at @entity41 's @entity40
" it 's likely @entity3 's celebration was seen by at least 100 million pairs of eyes worldwide so that represents a very cost - effective piece of sponsorship
" the beauty of guerrilla sponsorship is not just in the execution but in the potential fallout and publicity that follows
the fact that @entity3 was fined and that we are all talking about it delivers value for money that other traditional methods could not provide
" but there are potential downsides too , @entity38 warns , not least the fact that @entity3 's fine eclipses the $ 31,000 @entity2 fined the @entity67 for disturbances in their match against the @entity70
recap ' @entity71 ' dramatic finale the @entity73 was on monday fined $ 37,000 after the setting off and throwing fireworks , displaying illicit banners and the invasion of the pitch by a supporter during the @entity80 match against @entity81 in @entity82
that punishment followed a fine of $ 150,000 and a suspended six - point deduction for the improper behavior of @entity88 's fans during the match against the @entity90
already , @entity4 fans are questioning why their striker has been fined more for flashing his underpants than nations whose fans have been involved in serious crowd disturbances
@entity98 's @entity97 , left out of @entity41 's squad for the tournament , weighed in on the matter on @entity102 , accusing @entity2 of not prioritizing tackling racism
" @entity2 are you for real ? ? ? Â£ 80,000 fine for @entity3 for underwear advertising ...
all of the racism fines together do n't even add up to that ? ! " the 33 - year - old said via his official @ rioferdy5 account
" uefa are not serious ... @entity112 was a great player but him & his colleagues alienate themselves with exactly this type of rubbish # priorities
" if racism made money for @entity2 like advertising does do you think @entity2 would take it as serious ? ? # priorities " the @entity67 is also under investigation into alleged racist chanting by its fans in the match against @entity126 , and @entity38 warned : " there is always a danger that people react adversely to a firm involved in ambush marketing and the real danger here is that the sponsor could become embroiled in a potential race row
" the results of guerrilla marketing can be spectacular , but there is always the danger of becoming embroiled in a much broader agenda
in that sense , it is a bit of a gamble
" as one of @entity12 's fastest growing bookmakers , @entity19 is well versed in what represents a worthwhile gamble
but it was quick to react to the punishment handed out , labeling it : " a hysterical and deeply cynical move by @entity2 dictated by pure commercialism
" @entity38 tweeted in response that those comments could equally have been made by @entity2 towards @entity19
@entity2 's @entity155 imposed the fine and suspension from the next competitive international match for which @entity3 is eligible , and has given the striker three days to appeal
but it 's not just @entity2 that @entity3 has offended by revealing his lucky pants -- @entity19 's bookmaker rival @entity162 is an official sponsor of the @entity37 national team
one way or another , the story is unlikely to be over just yet -- and that is either good news or bad for the sponsor , depending on which way you look at it
" as the reasoned decision concerning the @entity3 case has not been sent to the player yet , we are not in a position to comment on the matter , " said @entity2 in a statement
