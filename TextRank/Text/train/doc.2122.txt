-- @entity1 : @entity3 point guard , charged with criminal weapons possession over a high - powered semiautomatic handgun
@entity6 : @entity7 tight end , awaiting trial on first - degree murder in the execution - style killing of @entity12
@entity13 : @entity3 giant star receiver , imprisoned after pleading guilty on weapons charges for having a gun inside a @entity18 nightclub
these three are among the examples of high - quality , high - profile professional players accused of crossing a line -- in these cases while using firearms
every week , in fact , it seems there 's another athlete accused of some heinous crime
are sports stars more prone to dangerous , criminal behavior -- including those involving guns -- than your everyday @entity36 ? will they more likely carry guns and use them ? and are more and more of them breaking the law and spiraling out of control ? " statistically , absolutely not , " said @entity41 , a sport psychologist and clinical assistant professor at @entity44 ' @entity43
" but nobody gives a hoot
... these athletes are more celebrities than anything else
" sports stars have been hailed for decades in @entity51 society , and with that comes extra attention and scrutiny
still , in today 's 24 - hour news cycle -- in a media world with the @entity56 and @entity57 and @entity58 and @entity60 networks , not to mention the @entity62 of the world -- that spotlight has gotten brighter
and when someone such as @entity67 of the @entity68 is accused of knocking his wife unconscious or former @entity56 standout turned analyst @entity71 is charged in multiple date rapes , people take notice because : 1 ) their alleged crimes are egregious , and 2 ) they are known to millions of @entity51
that celebrity aspect is critical when you 're trying to put such stories into perspective , according to @entity79 , the executive director for the @entity81 at @entity83 's @entity82
because " celebrity culture drives the news cycle " and because star athletes are celebrities , he says , these kinds of stories are read and spread everywhere
yet even if it might seem that way , it does n't change the fact that -- when compared with crime rates for all adult males -- professional athletes are no more likely to kill someone , get arrested for a gun crime or be convicted of domestic violence
" it 's upsetting , and it stands out , " @entity98 says of news about alleged killings , rapes , abuse and other horrific acts involving athletes
" but that does n't mean it 's ( endemic )
" there have been examples in which that ubiquitous celebrity seemingly has come at a steep price
take @entity113 , a @entity115 star defender shot dead inside his @entity117 home during what appeared to be a botched burglary
there 's also @entity122 ' catcher @entity121 , who was kidnapped in @entity123
and it 's not just players who are targeted , as seen in the kidnapping of the mother of iconic @entity129 shortstop @entity128 for that reason , @entity41 says , many athletes legitimately " fear that they are going to be in danger
" " the problem is , they do n't know what they 're doing with their guns
" @entity13 could be exhibit no. 1 : he inadvertently shot himself , having never threatened anyone else
@entity140 , then a standout with the @entity141 , was charged with a felony gun violation after drawing guns in the locker room -- something he insisted was a joke
@entity98 said such cases reflect more on @entity51 's " gun culture " than its sports culture
while @entity155 statistics show the number of purposeful and accidental shootings have fallen in recent decades , " there is ( still ) an inordinate amount of kids being killed on a daily basis
" yes , @entity41 admits , sometimes an intense , hypermasculine pro athlete who acts like a warrior on the field has a fragile ego off it , unsure what to do when someone ( particularly a woman ) challenges him
" he feels insecure , he feels hurt , " said @entity41 , the author of " @entity165 in @entity166
" " as things escalate , maybe it becomes physical
" this is n't the norm , though
most past and present athletes carry themselves well or at least do n't commit crimes
when some of them do go down the wrong path , that 's more a function of the fact they are human , not that they are athletes
@entity98 calls " sports ... the ultimate common denominator , " because any given roster can represent society as a whole -- all colors , races , classes and creeds
some of these athletes commit crimes , just like some nonathletes do
as @entity41 says , " sports are a microcosm of society
and we live in a violent society
