-- returning home from the @entity3 , i discovered the level of @entity6 media coverage for a global sports event
ten days of competition , 21 sports , and 503 events crammed into five - and - a - half hours of coverage
to think that we have 227 athletes who just returned home after representing @entity14 at the largest @entity15 in history , where 2.7 million tickets were sold , and most @entity6 did n't even know about it
that hits home personally , not only because i am a @entity15 , but because four - and - a - half years ago i was like most @entity6 and did n't know about the @entity3
opinion : the @entity3 were brilliant , why were n't you watching ? before i was paralyzed , i did n't so much as know the word @entity3 even existed
i was raised in a well educated household in @entity24 , but i knew nothing about the @entity3 until after my paralysis in 2008
after i was paralyzed swimming saved me ; swimming gave me hope again and allowed me to believe in what my future could hold
from disaster to triumph : a week in the life of @entity34 swimming , and being involved in the @entity3 , changed my life and changed me as a person
silent voices i saw how getting involved in not only the @entity3 , but athletics changed my life
i have heard countless stories of amazing ability that my fellow @entity14 teammates displayed
but how many of them were and are heard ? how many paralympians are household names in the @entity6 ? how many households are aware of the @entity3 ? the biggest difference i noticed though was the appreciation for @entity15 athletes overseas
during the @entity3 , when i left the village and went into @entity51 , people knew about the @entity15 , not just knew about them but respected them and were following them
the media coverage was totally different there
you could n't turn on the television without seeing it , much like it is during the @entity58 here in the @entity6
for me it is my hope that i can continue to help push the @entity15 movement forward for generations of athletes to come , just as those before me paved the way for opportunities i have been fortunate enough to experience
so it is a weird feeling being back home
four years of waiting and working and just like that it is all over
i have spent time at home unpacking and organizing my things and it feels like yesterday i was packing my bags for the start of this adventure
i trained for four - and - a - half years and it is already over
i am back home and making plans as to what i do next , starting to plan my next four years as i begin training for the @entity80
overcoming adversity i will be honest , coming home from @entity51 is n't what i expected it to be
my goal was to come home as the @entity15 ' most successful athlete ; my goal was to bring home nine gold medals
as i got on the plane to return to @entity24 i carried one gold medal and one bronze , but i carried them with pride
what i had to go through to earn both of those medals makes them more meaningful than nine golds ever could be
that medal represents more than just a winning performance
that one gold medal represents hope , belief , overcoming adversity , a dream and my supporters who backed me throughout the entire journey
when i look at it i see everything i went through to get it , the ups and the downs , the joy and the pain
when i look at my gold medal , i see a dream that i made four - and - a - half years ago and the journey it took to achieve that dream
in life we all make plans
we have this idea of how things are supposed to go and when they do n't go according to plan we often find ourselves disappointed
i feel that it is in those moments that we find who we are
life does n't go according to a plan
we can map it out , we can plan it , we can even envision it but often we find that life has a plan of its own
my life this past month had a plan of its own
it did n't matter that i had planned that moment for the past four years , it did n't matter that i had done everything in my power to try and control the situation
when the day came to a close the plan i had envisioned was n't the plan that life had for me
bubble over these past few weeks , as i have tried to understand what happened and make sense of it all , i have realized everything happens for a reason
there is a reason i was reclassified in @entity51 , there is a reason life threw me another curve ball , and there is a reason i am sitting here in a wheelchair
as i came back home , i continued to reflect on @entity51 and felt many emotions
as an athlete i have put a lot of thought into what i can do different next time
what can i change in my preparations over these next four years before the @entity80 ? i have also found myself settling back into life
when i was in @entity51 we as athletes were in this little bubble , the village
we were away from the real world in many ways
we did n't think of what day of the week it was or what the date was , we thought of what day of competition it was
most of us were cut off from the real world because our lovely cell phones did n't work internationally
but then we return home and real life hits
you no longer are completely focused on competition ; you are no longer surrounded by other athletes in the bubble
