@entity0 , @entity1 -- a superboat custom built for the most recent @entity5 blockbuster was the star act at the @entity8 @entity7 , a three - day show at the weekend
the " @entity13 , " a 43 - foot @entity14 , is one of three used during the chase sequence in the 2008 film of the same name
and its owner , @entity15 , had his own action adventure while test - driving the boat off the coast of @entity20 in @entity21
@entity15 , who bought the vessel in late january but did not realize its celebrity origins at the time , says he found himself in a @entity5 - like scenario , when he unwittingly traveled into dangerous waters
he says , " it was a beautiful , nice day and we took the boat for a run
out of the harbor and into the bay , from out of nowhere really , there was a boat with men wearing balaclavas covering their faces and @entity37
" we were in restricted waters and the little hamlet bay nearby was actually part of naval waters , " he continued
" we were taken to be questioned and we did n't have the ship 's papers because this was a test drive of the boat so we had to get the coast guard involved
" then they asked ' have you been drinking ? ' we had to be taken to the hospital for a drugs test
we could n't even go to the bathroom without a guard outside
we got interrogated about why we were in @entity21 and we wanted to buy this boat , " he added
the fastest things on water eventually their eight - hour detention came to an end as authorities involved realized it was a simple case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
despite this slight hiccup , @entity15 says things have been smooth sailing since his return to the @entity67 and is delighted the boat was part of the show
since he found out about " @entity13 " 's @entity72 provenance , he has decked out the boat with custom @entity5 accessories
" recently we 've done up the boat and it has been liveried up with ' @entity13 ' along the side , monograms , @entity5 things , " he says
@entity15 declined to tell @entity2 how much he paid for the boat
other @entity79 are currently on sale for between Â £ 250,000 - Â £ 300,000 ( $ 400,000 - $ 475,000 )
" if some people get some sort of enjoyment out of seeing or use out of it , then we are happy ... it 's as fast as it looks and extremely comfortable , " he said
