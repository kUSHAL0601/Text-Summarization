@entity0 -- the light bulb above our dining room table begins to swing
then the whole room shudders , the walls vibrating violently
a vase of flowers wobbles on a top shelf
there 's a loud rumble and a roar
then the bookshelf tears loose from the wall , scattering books everywhere , before we hear a shattering crash
a few seconds later the floor begins to buck
the room jumps up and down and moves from side to side
@entity29 starts flying through the air
i dive under the table , hold a cushion over my head , shut my eyes and start laughing
when i open them i see @entity0 collapse in front of my eyes
then a buzzer sounds and an instructor comes into the room
my disaster preparedness instructor bends down and looks at me cowering under the table
she 's pleased with my performance
" well done , you survived your first earthquake , " she says with a smile
" not bad for a beginner
" more : the best sushi restaurants in @entity0 preparing @entity0 residents for disaster @entity0 has a number of unusual and relatively unknown attractions -- the world 's only tapeworm museum and a noodle museum housing the world 's largest collection of pot noodle cartons come to mind
but only one tourist site has been declared an official disaster zone
the @entity63 is located on the fourth floor of the city 's @entity66 - kan fire station
it 's open to the public and there 's no charge to experience two minutes of terrifying tremors
" residents of @entity0 are required to attend courses to enhance their disaster preparedness awareness , " says my instructor
" children and salarymen all come to learn what to do in the event of an earthquake
" the computer - controlled earthquake mimics a quake measuring 6.2 on the @entity86
there are 50,000 reported earthquakes in the world every year
they vary in seismic intensity
no area of the earth is entirely free from the threat , although some areas are more active than others
@entity97 has had more than 60 major quakes , with the first recorded in 684
the 2011 @entity100 quake registered a 9.0 magnitude and claimed nearly 16,000 lives
the world 's biggest earthquake is believed to have been the 1960 @entity105 in @entity106 , which was a 9.5
the quake that hit @entity109 in 1906 and ruptured a 70 - mile length of the @entity111 was an 8
other big ones have hit in @entity113 in 1755 , @entity114 , @entity115 in 1811 and @entity116 in 1899
the @entity113 quake -- which killed at least 60,000 people -- was so powerful that the water in @entity120 in @entity121 oscillated for two minutes
a serious earthquake with accompanying aftershocks is simulated every half hour every day except weekends and tuesdays at @entity0 's @entity126 center
there are similar centers in @entity129 and @entity130
" the @entity134 earthquake brought about catastrophic devastation , " my disaster preparedness tutor tells me
" we must all learn safety measures so we know what to do in such an emergency
it might save our own life and the lives of others
here we learn how to behave during a catastrophe
how to keep a cool head and a calm body
our programs improve all - round earthquake skills
" the center has a permanent exhibition to the 1923 @entity0 earthquake
on september 1 , 74,000 people died in seven seconds
fifty - four percent of the brick buildings and 10 % of all reinforced - concrete structures collapsed
one percent of the city 's houses were destroyed and 700,000 homes were burned down
the shock started a tsunami tidal wave that reached a height of 36 feet at @entity161 on @entity162 , where it destroyed a further 150 houses and killed 60 more people

we watch motorways buckle and skyscrapers cave in
it could be make believe
but there are no special effects
courses at the center include basic fire extinguisher training
there 's a special room where you 're given a canister and told to spray foam over anything and everything
" it 's very popular with the adults , as well as the children , " says my instructor
" but there 's a serious side
students learn how to protect themselves and prevent fires from spreading after an earthquake
we also use a smoke maze and a tunnel to help people get used to being in smoke and learning how to get out of smoke - filled buildings in an orderly manner
" we teach emergency first aid
and how to resuscitate injured people and administer cardiac massage
this is all to minimize the casualties when and if a quake strikes
we also have escape shoot drills
" we have a lot of people coming back
not because they want to learn more
they just enjoy being in an artificial earthquake scenario
would you like to enjoy another one yourself ? " she smiles
" i can arrange it
i can cause earthquakes ! " so once again i sit at the table in a mock - up of a typical small @entity97 apartment , complete with kitchenette
the young woman asks me if i 'm ready , then presses a button
the room begins to shake again
following instructions , i run to the stove to turn off the gas supply and then open the door
grabbing a cushion i find safety under the kitchen table
the walls tremble and then the floor
through the window i can see video footage of falling masonry and giant dust clouds
one moment a building is there and another it 's gone
the @entity0 area experiences minor tremors every day
my second one of the afternoon is over
i pass with flying colors and am equipped to deal with an earthquake if i ever find myself in one 's epicenter
" but it wo n't be so much fun , " my earthquake examiner says
" the real ones are no fun at all
