-- world no. 1 @entity1 will play second - ranked @entity3 in a rematch of last year 's @entity6 final on sunday as she attempts to become the oldest winner of the @entity9 grand slam
the @entity10 blew away the hopes of @entity12 , who had been hoping to become the first @entity14 player to contest the title match of the hard - court event , as she triumphed 6 - 0 6 - 3 in friday 's second semifinal
the defending champion , who turns 32 at the end of this month , made a blistering start against @entity12 but the fifth seed battled back in the second set -- @entity1 required seven match - points to reach her seventh @entity6 final
she has won four of those , suffering defeat in 2001 and 2011
" i got a little nervous there at the end but i was able to close it out , " @entity1 told the crowd
" i 'm excited to be in another final
we always have really good matches
" @entity35 's a great player and she lifts her game when it counts
i think that 's what makes the difference
" @entity1 has lost just four times this year -- two of those to @entity3 -- and dropped only 16 games in 12 sets on the way to the final
the @entity47 was largely untroubled in reaching her fourth grand slam final , beating @entity51 underdog @entity49 6 - 4 6 - 2 in a match marred by service struggles for both players
@entity49 , ranked 83rd in the world , was playing in her first major semifinal but had a 1 - 1 record against @entity3
" it 's been a long road to the final and it 's an amazing feeling to come out here and fight for that trophy on sunday -- i 'm definitely giving myself the best chance for my dreams here , " said the two - time @entity65 winner , who has a 12 - 3 losing record against @entity1
" today was a great match , a lot of emotions
i think the turning point was when i finally held my serve and won the first set
i stayed tough and played really well on return games and on important moments
" @entity49 's such a great fighter , getting to every ball , so i really had to keep my focus in the match
