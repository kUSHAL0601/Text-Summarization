-- the @entity1 has conquered the box office
a special nationwide @entity4 screening of the @entity6 50th anniversary tv special " @entity9 " grossed a stunning $ 4.8 million at the @entity8 box office
what makes this particularly impressive : that 's from one night
the 75 - minute " @entity9 " screened in 660 theaters as a one - night - only special event monday and averaged $ 7,155 per location , with 320,000 tickets sold
granted , the tix were $ 15 a pop , so that certainly helped
@entity0 : ' @entity6 ' : 15 facts you probably did n't know in fact , the @entity23 's cult favorite show was the no. 2 movie in @entity26 on monday , behind only @entity27 : catching fire
its gross is nearly as much as @entity31 in @entity4 made during its entire run earlier this year ( $ 5.5 million )
and it was more than indie fav @entity34 ( $ 4.3 million ) or bomb @entity35 ( $ 3.3 million )
and do n't forget : this screening was two days after the episode had already premiered on @entity38 , so most fans had already seen it
on limited saturday screenings , the show racked up $ 204,000 in the @entity8 box office and $ 2.9 million at the @entity45 box office
" it 's incredible that @entity6 has made history once again , setting record numbers across the board on @entity38 , in social media , and now in theaters
it 's a testament to the fans and their dedication for @entity6 , " said @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity26

that total rose to 3.6 million once including the show 's encore
