@entity1 , @entity0 -- for the first time , and for a limited period only , people in @entity4 will be able to get their hands on the @entity8 , @entity11 professor @entity10 's rugged little laptop that 's designed specifically for children
children in @entity14 using @entity8 computers
the @entity8 was designed for children in developing countries
and for each cutting - edge @entity8 purchased in the @entity19 , another will be given to a child in a developing country
the " @entity23 " scheme , which launches monday , is part of the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) project to equip the world 's poorest children with a learning tool
for $ 399 , customers can order a laptop for themselves ; bundled into the price is the cost of delivering a second @entity8 to a child a poor country
the laptops , which went into high - volume production on 6 november , go on sale online at 6 a.m. eastern time monday until november 26
founder of @entity25 , @entity11 professor @entity10 told @entity2 that the launch of the scheme was exhilarating
" it must be like a runner 's high , " he said
" a lot of muscles hurt
many people thought we would not get to the finish line
" @entity10 is convinced that providing children in poor countries with computers is a cost - effective and empowering route into self - learning
in january 2005 , he unveiled @entity25 , with the aim of building a $ 100 laptop and supplying it in bulk to developing countries
@entity25 has come under fire from some quarters for failing to make the laptop as cheap as promised , and some , including @entity63 ceo @entity62 , have dismissed @entity10 's $ 100 aim as unrealistic
but while the cost of the laptops is currently around the $ 180 mark , @entity10 remains determined that his $ 100 machine is attainable once mass production kicks in
the rugged , green - and - white @entity8 is made by @entity71 company @entity70 , the world 's largest laptop manufacturer and maker of laptops for @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity63 amongst others
@entity70 will build 40,000 units in the first month , then ramp up production to 80,000 in december and 120,000 in january
the @entity8 uses open - source software and has long battery life , a built - in camera , mesh networking and a simple user interface
it features a screen that 's clearly visible even in bright sunlight , uses a tenth of the power of a conventional laptop and can be recharged by hand when mains electricity is n't available
while the laptop was designed to appeal to children , with its tough exterior , bright colors , touchpad and cute bunny - ear antennae , @entity10 told @entity2 that expressions of interest in the @entity8 have so far come from a wide range of potential buyers -- and geek blogs are buzzing with anticipation of its release
some have questioned whether laptops are the answer to the developing world 's problems
but in countries where education is patchy in quality and provision , @entity10 sees the computer as an educational lifeline that could open up opportunities for children to learn independently
" it is a window of hope , " he says
" education is at the root of eliminating poverty
" @entity10 has admitted that firm orders from developing countries have not always followed their verbal expressions of interest
" i have to some degree underestimated the difference between shaking the hand of a head of state and having a check written , " he told the @entity129 in september
" and yes , it has been a disappointment
" but @entity10 hopes that the @entity23 scheme will kick - start more bulk orders for his little green machines
" it is like an avalanche , " he told @entity2
" not much snow needs to slide before a huge avalanche is created
we hope @entity23 will be like the first pieces of snow
" it 's the @entity23 link between a child in @entity4 and a child in a developing country that @entity10 hopes will sway people to purchase an xo
" in the @entity23 program , the likely recipient in the developed world is a child , " he explained
" for that child to be using the same laptop as a kid in @entity156 is especially meaningful
" customers wanting their xos for the holiday season have been advised to order early : the first 20,000 units should be delivered by @entity160 , with their partner computers heading to @entity162 and @entity163
later orders will follow in 2008
and @entity10 's message to those considering it as a gift this year ? " do n't hesitate
do n't buy it because it is an inexpensive laptop , " he told @entity2
" buy it to join a movement to change the world
