a @entity3 military intelligence plane nearly collided with a commercial passenger jet south of @entity1 on friday , the @entity1 air force chief said sunday
the incident in international airspace forced the passenger flight en route from @entity10 to @entity1 to change course , maj. gen. @entity5 said
but the @entity11 refuted the notion that one of its warplanes nearly collided with a passenger jet
and a spokesman for @entity18 said reports of danger to the plane or passengers were " blown out of proportion
" knut @entity24 said the flight was n't forced to change course , but that the pilot took normal advice from air traffic control
" no security borders were breached , " he said , adding that it was a " totally safe flight
" @entity5 said @entity1 fighter jets were immediately deployed to identify the aircraft and later determined it was a @entity3 intelligence plane
he said the @entity3 military aircraft 's transponders were turned off to avoid commercial radar
a @entity11 spokesman maintained the flight was a safe distance from civilian aircraft
" no prerequisites existed for an air accident related with a flight of a @entity3 warplane in the international air space over the @entity50 on friday , " maj. gen. @entity42 said sunday , according to @entity3 's state - run @entity44 news agency
" the flight was being made strictly in compliance with international air space rules , not violating borders of other countries and at a safe distance from traffic routes of civilian aircraft , " he said
@entity42 said the @entity3 plane was more than 70 kilometers ( 44 miles ) from the flight route of a passenger jet
@entity63 jets scrambled more than 400 times this year for @entity3 intercepts
