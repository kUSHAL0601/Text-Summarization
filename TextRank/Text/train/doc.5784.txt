-- @entity3 , a pioneering @entity5 and @entity6 doctor , has been released from an @entity8 prison , his family said sunday
both he and his brother , @entity10 , who is also a doctor , were arrested in 2008
they were charged with " communication with an enemy government " and for trying to " overthrow the government , " according to @entity15
@entity10 served most of a three - year sentence and was released in october 2010
since then , he has fought for his brother 's freedom
" my dearest friends , colleagues and family thank you so much for your tireless help and support
i am pleased to share our happiness that my brother got released today
i am very happy that other prisoners got released , too and now their parents , family members and friends got reunion after a while
what a lovely day ! " he wrote on his @entity36 page
a post attributed to the @entity39 family said that @entity40 was released after spending 1,160 days in prison
the brothers have been called pioneers for their community - based approach to @entity5 and @entity6 in @entity8
since opening a hometown clinic in 1999 , the men raised awareness about @entity5 , dispelling myths about the virus and treating people who are shunned because of it
they also reached out to their neighbors in @entity54 and @entity55 and worked with medical universities in @entity57 and the @entity58
earlier this month , @entity15 told @entity0 being free without his brother was the worst feeling and that sometimes he wished he was in and that his brother was out
" i have to be clear , " he said then
" all our work was focused on health and science
it was never about politics
when we were arrested , i was shocked and i thought they must have the wrong people
