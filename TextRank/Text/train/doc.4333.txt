@entity2 @entity1 @entity0 has defeated incumbent sen. @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity3 projects wednesday
" today , we are going to begin the process of turning our country around and building a brighter future for our children , " @entity0 said in a statement
an updated vote tally from the @entity5 @entity13 has @entity0 leading @entity4 , 48.6 % to 45.4 % , as of wednesday morning
republicans will now have at least 53 seats in the @entity15 next year , with one final race to be decided in @entity17 in a dec. 6 run - off
@entity4 , a first - term incumbent , faced off against @entity0 , a first - time candidate originally from @entity19 , who sought to nationalize the race by calling the senator a " rubber stamp " for president @entity23 , who polls poorly in the deeply red state
as a senator , @entity4 voted for @entity23 's signature health care law , the @entity28 , which has become a lightning - rod issue in the state and in other competitive races across the country
@entity4 is the fourth @entity34 @entity15 incumbent defeated in the nov. 4 election
for most of the contest , polling data showed him trailing @entity0 , leading @entity1 to identify the state as an opportunity to gain a @entity15 seat on the hunt to wrest back control of the upper chamber
during the race , @entity0 highlighted his conservative stances like reining in federal spending , limiting abortions and expanding infrastructure in rural areas of the state
@entity4 deflected attacks about his similarities to @entity23 by centering his campaign around local issues like his opposition to privatizing @entity56 , support for veterans programs and increased funding and research for oil and renewable energy in the oil - rich state
in a campaign ad , @entity4 drew a line in the sand between himself and the president , citing political differences on issues like @entity71 drilling and gun rights
" i am not his candidate , " @entity4 said , admitting that he did vote for the president in 2008 and 2012
@entity3 's @entity75 and @entity76 contributed to this report .
