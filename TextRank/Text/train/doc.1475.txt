they did n't go around the world , but then again it did n't take them close to 80 days
regardless , it 's likely @entity5 would be very proud of @entity7 @entity6 and @entity9 @entity8 , who broke records crossing the @entity11 together in a balloon
the two left @entity14 in their gas balloon , dubbed @entity16 , last sunday
six days later , they touched down just off western @entity17
" # @entity19 has landed safely just off the coast of @entity17 , " the team tweeted at 6:30 a.m. ( 9:30 a.m. et ) , this happy ending was historic , albeit not entirely surprising : less than two hours earlier , a post on the 50 - year - old @entity26 pilot 's @entity24 account said " # @entity19 has begun their ( descent ) and turn toward land
" later messages , as well as a live flight - tracking online , showed the balloon getting nearer and nearer to the beach
by the time @entity6 and @entity8 hit the ground , they 'd made history : having traveled some 6,646 miles ( 10,696 kilometers ) and spending 161 hours and 17 minutes aloft in the air together
@entity37 -- the mayor of @entity38 , @entity26 , which @entity6 calls home -- was in @entity17 to greet them and tweeted that the pilots brought the balloon down about two miles offshore , where they were picked up by a fishing boat and brought toward land
" @entity47 ! " read a tweet from the @entity46
" ... two world records for gas ballooning and the @entity11 crossed ! " others have gone farther and for longer in airborne balloons before ( though not the characters in @entity5 's classic book " @entity54 " ) , perhaps most famously late tycoon adventurer @entity55
but the others rode balloons that used hot air or some combination of hot air and gas
what makes two @entity16 is different in that there is no heat source such as a propane burner , only gas -- in this case , helium
pilots control their altitude by releasing some of the gas during the day ( when the sun heats up and expands the gas ) , or throwing off sand or water at night
" @entity78 ' straight gas ' balloons are the stuff of legend , " according to the project 's website
" ... old - fashioned ' gas ' balloons , filled with helium and without the benefit of burners , pit man against the elements at a very basic level with just bags of sand and a healthy dash of boldness as the ' fuel
' " even before touching down , two @entity16 had already set two major gas ballooning records
one was for how long they were in the air -- passing the previous mark of 137 hours , 5 minutes , 50 seconds by @entity100 on a 1978 transatlantic flight
according to rules set by the @entity104 , the record must be surpassed by 1 % in order to qualify as a new record
the @entity16 reached that point friday at 10:51 a.m. et , though technically it could take months before the @entity7 @entity109 reviews and documents it
a day earlier , the balloonists broke a 1981 record for distance traveled by a gas balloon
that previous mark of 5,208 miles ( 8,382.54 kilometers ) was way in the rear - view mirror by the time the voyage ended saturday
