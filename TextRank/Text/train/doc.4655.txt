-- who are the seven women who police say one @entity5 man has confessed to killing ? " they 're not forgotten , because they 're not nobodies
they 're somebody , " said @entity7 , whose 19 - year - old daughter @entity8 was found strangled at a @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity5 , over the weekend
" they 're somebody 's daughter , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity13 , " somebody 's mother , somebody 's sister
" here 's what we know so far about the suspected serial killer 's victims : @entity8 " she could walk into a room and just light it up with her smile and her laugh and just her presence , " @entity25 told @entity0 's @entity26
" @entity8 never met a stranger
and that was kind of part of her problem
she was a little naive on trusting people
" @entity38 , 19 , had recently moved back to @entity39 after graduating from high school and living for five years with her mother in @entity44 , @entity45
authorities say suspect @entity47 hired a prostitute through the backpage.com site serving @entity39 and arranged a meeting with @entity38 at the @entity9
that was a surprise to her mother
" i had no idea
that 's not the way i raised @entity8
she was n't raised up like that , " @entity25 said
" her three months out there , she never said that anything was wrong
she never gave me any inclination she was doing this or thinking about doing this
" but even if true , that information is irrelevant , the mother said
" what matters is that my baby be remembered for who she really is , " @entity25 wrote on @entity66 monday
" remember her smile , laugh , tender heart and the fact that she is no longer with us ! " in @entity66 posts , @entity25 described her daughter as a princess and posted a @entity79 video of her belting out a ballad
@entity38 's cousins told the @entity82 that she enjoyed singing , loved kids and eventually wanted to own a day care
" she had plans on going back to school , and we talked about it numerous times , " one cousin told the newspaper
" but i guess she started hanging with different people and it took her towards another way
" @entity96 the last time @entity99 saw her daughter , they were grocery shopping together in @entity101
" she said , ' i love you
i 'll be back , @entity103
' that 's what she said to me , and she left , and she went with her friend , " @entity99 told @entity0 affiliate @entity104
" but she did n't come back that night
" when she heard from her the next day , @entity109 was crying , sounded scared and wanted someone to pick her up , @entity99 said
she was never heard from again
@entity109 's family reported her missing in late january , boyfriend @entity111 told @entity0 's @entity114
at first , they held off because @entity109 had been known to leave her home in @entity101 for days or even a week at a time , @entity111 said
but as the days passed , he said , they became increasingly concerned and contacted police
" we know her daily routine
she would go out , you know , and hang out , go visit friends and things like that , " he said
" but she would always stay in touch with the family
" @entity109 , 28 , did n't work , @entity111 said
" it was more being home , being a mom , raising her son , doing things as a family , " he said
@entity99 said her daughter was mentally ill and often willing to trust people
" like i told ( the police ) there , she might be grown , but she had a mind like a 12 - year - old
she 's very vulnerable , but she 's a sweet person , " @entity99 told @entity104
" she 's very trusting
she never thought that somebody would hurt her if she never gave them no reason to hurt her
" authorities at one point suggested that maybe @entity109 had decided to leave and start a new life , but @entity111 said he did n't buy it
" @entity96 would not leave her son like that , " he said
" she was a loving , kind person ... a bighearted person
@entity96 was the kind of person that ... would give you her coat to wear if you did n't have one
" @entity111 told @entity0 affiliate @entity13 that he 's been struggling to tell their 2 - year - old son what happened
" i do n't know how to explain it to him right now
... he 's been asking for @entity103 a lot , and the only thing i can tell him is , ' mommy 's not here right now , ' " @entity111 said
@entity167 the 35 - year - old was last seen on october 8 , the @entity168 reported
she was reported missing two days later
her sister told the newspaper that @entity167 , who lived in @entity172 , @entity5 , ran a booth at a flea market
" she was a kind , loving woman , " @entity175 , a @entity39 police officer , told the @entity168
" she was my favorite sister
she was everybody 's favorite aunt
" her 2001 @entity179 was found parked in the driveway of a vacant house in @entity101 earlier this month
police with cadaver dogs had searched other vacant lots and abandoned homes to look for her , the newspaper said
they did n't find her , until @entity47 pointed them to an abandoned house in @entity101
the bodies of two other women were found at the same address
they have not yet been identified
@entity47 had " some sort of connection " with @entity167 , @entity197 chief @entity196 said , adding that authorities do n't know yet what the connection is
@entity203 @entity203 , 36 , was a resident of @entity101 and a mother of four , according to her mother - in - law , @entity205
@entity206 told @entity0 she had not heard from @entity207 since february but did not file a police report because @entity203 would often " disappear
" " i 've been kind of wondering what happened to @entity203
she kind of disappeared , " said @entity206
" i have n't talked to her since february
she would call me every couple of months
i was like her mother
her real family would n't have much to do with her
" @entity203 did not have a job , and according to @entity206 , she had two children from her marriage with @entity206 's son @entity218 , and two more children from different fathers
