@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity4 gov. @entity3 kicked off a @entity6 rally saturday in sen. @entity8 's hometown , encouraging disgruntled @entity9 to " take back our country " while attacking what she called the " @entity14 - @entity13 spending spree
" " there 's no better place to kick off the @entity22 than @entity8 's hometown , " @entity3 said at the rally , dubbed " showdown in @entity0 , " aimed at conjuring up support for the @entity18 's defeat in november elections
activists -- some of whom are calling the gathering the largest retirement party in the world -- hope it will carry a strong symbolic message
@entity8 , the @entity18 majority leader , is credited with helping push through @entity32 the controversial health care bill that president @entity14 signed tuesday , as well as the " fixes " measure that passed thursday
" @entity39 has broken faith with the people that they are to be serving , " @entity3 told the crowd , which numbered in the thousands
@entity3 said the message to government leaders was " loud and clear
" " the big government , the big debt , @entity14 - @entity13 spending spree is over
you 're fired , " she said , prompting cheers from the crowd
are you there or at another @entity6 ? share your video , images @entity3 's speech saturday echoed many of her recent appearances at @entity6 events as she promoted " common sense conservative values " and decried " elites in @entity39 " and big government spending
she addressed recent criticism of a post on her @entity66 page that called for conservatives not to retreat in the wake of the health care vote , but " reload
" some critics have suggested the post encouraged violent acts against those who voted in favor of the legislation
" let 's clear the air right now , " she said
" we 're not inciting violence
do n't get sucked into the lame - stream media lies about @entity9 standing up for freedom
it 's a bunch of bunk that the media is trying to feed you
do n't let them try to divert " attention from the issue
other expected speakers included gov. @entity88 , a @entity89 , who told @entity2 's @entity90 the event was " a great way to kick off a very intense political season
" in a statement to @entity2 , @entity8 said he was " happy so many people came to see my hometown of @entity0 and spend their out - of - state money especially in these tough economic times
ultimately , though , this election will be decided by @entity100 , not people from other states who parachute in for one day to have a tea party
" not far from the rally site , the @entity106 and the @entity8 campaign have set up a hospitality tent
" we are serving tea and donut holes in recognition that sen. @entity8 just passed health care reform , and [ that ] we 're closing the @entity117 donut hole , " said @entity109 , deputy communications director for the @entity8 campaign
it 's staffed , he added , " with real @entity100 from @entity1 and folks from @entity0 who support @entity8
" the senator , meanwhile , is spending saturday with the @entity123 's executive vice president , @entity122
the @entity8 campaign describes @entity122 as " one of the senator 's supporters
" the two are attending the grand opening of the $ 60 million @entity129 north of @entity130 that , according to the @entity8 campaign , would n't have opened without the senator 's help
@entity8 is arguably the @entity6 's top target
he carries a lot of political baggage in a year that finds much anger directed at incumbents
" he is one of the three faces of the @entity143 agenda in @entity39 , which right now is unpopular , " said @entity1 political newsletter editor @entity139
recent polls from the @entity146 organization show 33 percent of those polled have a favorable view of @entity8 , while 52 percent said they have an unfavorable view of the senator -- some of the worst numbers he has faced in years
" i do n't think many voters in @entity1 dislike me
i think we have an economic situation in @entity1 that is very difficult , " @entity8 told @entity2 in a recent interview in @entity130
the state 's economy is in dire straits
it leads the nation in foreclosures , and its 13 percent unemployment rate is second only behind @entity164 's
those vying to challenge @entity8 on the @entity89 side are pouncing
" he has lost touch with what is going on here in @entity1 , " said businesswoman and former state @entity89 chairwoman @entity167 , who is leading the pack among the @entity89 hopefuls
" it is all about jobs
his solution is to put the country more in debt -- to tax the country more -- to put our children and grandchildren at risk for years and years of being in debt , " she added
earlier this month , @entity167 told @entity2 she 's a proud member of the @entity6 movement
another @entity89 challenger , businessman @entity186 , said @entity8 has " alienated himself from the people of @entity1 , and the economy is getting worse and worse and worse
" also not helping @entity8 were two recent quips by @entity14 about not wasting money in @entity130
@entity8 , who is not facing a serious primary challenge , last year aired ads aimed at promoting what he has done to help improve the economy , as well as introducing himself to hundreds of thousands of new voters who have moved to @entity1 since his last election
" to say @entity8 is going to run a scorched - earth campaign against whomever this nominee is ... he has a reputation for doing whatever it takes to win -- no more so than this year
and he is going to have all the money to do it , " @entity139 said
for his part , @entity8 -- known as a tenacious fighter who has come out ahead in previous close elections -- will push the message against his opponents of how much he has done for the state
but he said he will not campaign differently than he has in the past
" people in the state of @entity1 know me , " @entity8 said
" i 'm not going to be changing who i am for an election
i 'm just who i was when i started this a long time ago , and i continue to be the same person i used to be , as i am today , and will work very hard to meet the additional requirements that come with a changing economy that we have
" the @entity22 is scheduled to end up in @entity39 on april 15 -- tax day
the group 's travel plans are part of its " just vote them out ! tour
" some local organizers prefer to call the @entity0 gathering a " conservative @entity226
" @entity2 's @entity90 , @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report .
