@entity0 -- @entity2 failed a court - ordered alcohol test last week , requiring her to go before a judge for a probation violation hearing thursday morning , according to a source close to the case
@entity2 's failed test , which the source said happened on june 13 , comes while the actress is confined to her @entity12 , @entity13 home because of a jail sentence imposed last month
the actress will appear before @entity18 judge @entity17 at 10 a.m. thursday , the same judge who sentenced her to 120 days in jail after she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace , a prosecution spokeswoman said wednesday
@entity2 was allowed to serve a reduce sentence at home because , as a non-violent offender , she qualified a home confinement program intended to reduce overcrowding
but it is not likely judge @entity17 has missed seeing media reports showing @entity2 socializing on the roof of her luxury home in recent days
" when my friends come over , they 're not drinking , " @entity2 told an interviewer with @entity32
" alcohol is not in my house , so it 's just not a part of my life
" that interview was given on june 18 , five days after she failed test
the actress , who turns 25 on july 2 , has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunk driving convictions , a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction
" because of budget constraints and because we 're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation , nonviolent offenders , lesser crimes , get 20 % of their sentence , " @entity50 's spokesman @entity49 said
without the latest violation , it was expected she would be released from home confinement in early july
she would then resume her work on 480 hours of community service the judge imposed
@entity2 entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge , but @entity17 made it clear in court last month that she did n't think drugs and alcohol were not the root of @entity2 's legal troubles
" she 's got other problems for which she self - medicates , " judge @entity17 said
@entity2 's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007
since then , she 's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehabilitation programs
a probation report released last month said the actress " appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues
" " it would appear that the defendant 's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity , " the probation report said , yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail
@entity2 tested positive for alcohol use , a violation of probation rules , in february , the report said
it also revealed that the drug test failure last august , which resulted in a jail sentence and court - ordered rehab , involved cocaine and amphetamines
@entity103 's @entity102 contributed to this report .
