in 2010 , a @entity62 video surfaced showing her saying that @entity66 should " get the hell out of @entity65 , " and that the @entity60 people should go home to " @entity68 , @entity69 ... and @entity70 and everywhere else
" @entity7 apologized for her remarks , writing , " they do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the @entity76 only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance

" @entity7 embraced the freedoms of a columnist with vigor
" i censored myself for 50 years when i was a reporter , " @entity7 told an audience at the @entity189 ( @entity190 ) in late 2002
" now i wake up and ask myself , ' who do i hate today ? ' " one afternoon in october 2009 , she targeted president @entity33 's spokesman , @entity192 , during the daily briefing
health care reform was being debated at the time , and @entity7 asked @entity192 every day whether a public option would be part of the package
in the back - and - forth that ensued , @entity7 said that she already had reached a conclusion but could not get a straight answer from the presidential spokesman
" then why do you keep asking me ? " @entity192 inquired
" because i want your conscience to bother you , " @entity7 replied
the room broke into laughter as @entity192 turned red
