relief workers said the fighting between the @entity3 government and rebels over @entity17 law has left @entity3 civilians with the choice of facing bloody battles or fleeing to squalid camps
the displaced people have found shelter in already overcrowded camps in and around @entity11 , while others have fled into neighboring @entity26 , according to the @entity6 @entity27 ( @entity27 )
@entity27 said that an estimated 34,000 people were displaced by the fighting between insurgents and @entity3 's government from may 8 - 14
although @entity3 's border with @entity26 is officially closed , an estimated 5,000 displaced @entity3 arrive every month in the @entity6 refugee camps in the @entity26 border town of @entity35 , according to @entity36 , known by its @entity38 acronym @entity36
" the situation is simply scandalous , " said @entity39 , who heads the @entity36 mission in @entity26
" these refugees have risked everything to escape the fighting in @entity3
now some are telling us they would rather take their chances in @entity11 than die slowly here
" one nurse called the refugee camps in @entity26 " public health time bombs
" " the refugees , many of whom are already suffering from serious war - related injuries or illnesses , are packed together without the bare minimum to survive , " said @entity51 , who worked for @entity36 at @entity52
" after all these people have endured , how can their most basic needs continue to be so woefully neglected ? " nearly a quarter of the more than 90,000 refugees at @entity52 suffer from acute malnutrition , according to @entity36
@entity36 is calling on the @entity6 high commissioner for refugees , @entity26 's government , and international donors to help alleviate the " dire living conditions " at the camps in @entity26 which house more than 270,000 @entity3 refugees
more than 100 people have died in the latest fighting in @entity3 , and hundreds more have been wounded in the bloody insurgency , government officials said last week
the violence stems from an interpretation of sharia , or @entity17 law
@entity3 's new president , @entity79 , recently approved implementing sharia , but the @entity81 rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form
on sunday , @entity81 seized control of @entity85 , the president 's hometown about 55 miles ( 88 km ) north of @entity11 , according to a local journalist
the violence is exacerbating the already precarious humanitarian situation in @entity3 , where an estimated 40 percent of the country 's population -- more than 3 million people -- need humanitarian support , according to the @entity6 the fighting erupted days after a mortar attack on @entity3 's parliament that killed six people and wounded more than a dozen others on april 25
the fatalities included a soldier and three children who were killed when the rounds struck a nearby school , a police spokesman said
members of parliament were meeting when the attack occurred , but none of them was injured , an official said .
