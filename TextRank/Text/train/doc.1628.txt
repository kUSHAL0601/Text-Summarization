-- for @entity2 , it used to be a tedious process : whenever she came across an interesting arts - and - crafts project or recipe on the @entity6 , she would save it for later by copying the link , pasting it into an e-mail and sending it to herself
after that @entity2 , a stay - at - home mom from @entity12 , would file the e-mail in a folder for future reference
it was n't exactly the most efficient system
then last year , during one of her browsing sessions , she read a blog post that gushed about a new website called @entity23
the virtual pinboard , where users can pin and organize images onto individual " boards , " did n't pique @entity2 's interest at first , but she quickly changed her mind
" someone described it as an online filing system , and i thought , ' that 's exactly what i need , ' " she said
soon @entity2 was pinning away and , like many @entity23 users , got quickly hooked
she first started with a @entity37 board where she pinned costume ideas
next , @entity2 created a shared color board for redecorating her daughter 's bedroom that she and her husband could add to
@entity23 also allows other users to follow each other 's boards and " re-pin " another person 's images
in no time @entity2 was sharing other people 's pins and following users with similar tastes
" it 's been really neat to see what other moms are pinning , " she said
" some days you run out of ideas and you do n't know what to do to fill the time before bedtime
i thought it was going to be just me organizing , but it 's really a community sharing all these different ideas that i did n't even know existed
" think of @entity23 as a way of cataloging your passions
members have used the website to plan weddings and holidays
others have pinned images of clothes , recipes , architecture , art , crafts , cars and even technology
thanks to media reports and the devotion of users like @entity2 , there 's been a lot of buzz around @entity23 in recent months
in october , @entity85 confirmed that @entity23 had received $ 27 million of funding from the venture capital firm @entity87
the pinboard website has been covered and praised extensively by media like @entity90 , and @entity91 , which called it " addictive
" pinterest co-founder @entity94 declined to cite specifics about the invite - only site 's growth
but @entity98 , an internet analytics firm , estimates that @entity23 received nearly 11 million total visits during the week ending december 17 , 2011 -- almost 40 times the number of visits six months earlier
@entity94 said what 's most exciting about his website is how it helps you find new influences for things that you like -- and in turn lets other people with shared interests provide feedback on your pins
" the things that you collect say a lot about who you are , " @entity94 told @entity0
" our job at @entity23 is to help you discover people who have similar taste
it creates an online catalog where every item is handpicked just for you
" the appeal of content curation @entity127 , a senior writer at @entity128 , is not surprised by @entity23 's success
in an analysis of the website in september , he wrote that @entity23 's " clean retro visual design " and our fundamental need to collect and organize are part of its appeal
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity127 added that collecting " affirms our relationship with the world around us
" @entity23 offers an easy way to digitally curate content without the pain of cutting clippings or saving endless web pages on your desktop , he said
" content curation is a timeless problem that a lot of people have tried to solve , " @entity127 said
" @entity23 brings a lot of high design to doing it and a lot of user experience
and with a larger group of people then there 's a never - ending supply of content to enjoy
" yet the concept of content curation is hardly new
@entity162 , vi.sualize.us , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 are among the other websites that offer visual bookmarking with a few clicks and have been doing so for a while
but @entity170 , director of corporate strategy at @entity172 , pointed out in a blog post a few weeks ago that @entity23 takes this further by giving structure to " push button content generation
" here 's what he means : clicking @entity23 's " @entity178 " button , which can be added to your browser 's bookmarks toolbar , will automatically grab the picture you want from the website you are on
what is different is that it immediately adds it to any of your @entity23 boards , allowing you to categorize your content then and there
the boards each have a separate page and can be easily accessed , shared and viewed on a sort of mother board on your @entity23 profile
" importantly , it was easy for new users to consume these sets of content visually as structured sets , and to share these sets with others , " @entity170 wrote
" this next wave of social curation will fundamentally change how users find and interact with content over time
" users : defining ' your own aesthetic ' blogger @entity213 , creative director of @entity215 , a design and marketing agency , often pins using the @entity23 mobile app. he calls using the website " instinctual
" @entity213 first started with home and graphic design pins related to his blog and then eventually created a board for his personal taste in fashion
" it helps you define your own aesthetic , " said @entity213 , who lives in @entity225 , @entity12
" i noticed patterns and recurring themes , so i got a stronger sense of what style i have
i would n't have necessarily been able to see that earlier
it 's nice to be able to put a sense of order to all the things you like
" business owners also are flocking to the website to lead new audiences to their products
@entity242 , the creative director and founder of @entity244 , an interior design company and blog , says she uses @entity23 to find inspiration for her business
as a designer , she uses @entity23 as a virtual mood board to develop concepts , and is often up till midnight just pinning
" @entity23 is a great tool for designers looking for new and different content , " said @entity251 , who lives in @entity252
" and it is a way to get into the mind of the designer and the brand of the company
my readers can actually see what the next trend is going to look like
" @entity94 believes @entity23 is different from other social networks because users are using the website to catalog their day - to - day activities
" i think it 's really cool that people are pinning the most important projects in their lives
" i think it 's a service that can really make your offline life more interesting
" @entity2 is one such user
she is determined to use @entity23 for more offline purposes
" i want to spend more time doing than pinning , to encourage time with my kids so that mom 's not just sitting at the computer , " she said
in fact , @entity2 went as far as to start a blog called @entity280 to make sure of that
the blog chronicles her @entity23 exploits , in which she picks interesting do - it - yourself pins , tries them out for herself and writes about the results
at present , @entity2 has blogged about more than 30 pins , from cleaning her ceiling fans with a pillowcase to an unsuccessful crock - pot lasagna recipe to dressing her daughters in her wedding dress , which has been her most popular post to date
" i thought it would be interesting to other moms to see me putting my own spin on it and sharing my success and failures , " she said
" i want to show that if i could do it , they could do it as well
" @entity2 added : " what i tell my friends [ is ] , they are not just pinning but creating
and that 's really where they 'll find the benefit from @entity23
