@entity0 -- @entity2 is under close scrutiny over how it will cope with the influx of travelers for the @entity6 , but at least it has one fan in @entity9 writer @entity8
@entity10 -- author of best - selling novels including " @entity12 " -- lived at the airport for seven days last year when he was @entity2 's " writer in residence
" " i loved it , " says @entity10
" i enjoyed living at the airport , i enjoyed the romance of opening my curtains and there was the runway
" during his stay he spent time with pilots , police and security services , but one of the highlights was a visit to the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) -- what @entity10 calls " the true @entity33
" read more : in numbers : @entity2 braced for @entity36 surge " everything passes through the @entity31 so you get rattlesnakes that some idiot smuggled back from the @entity43 desert , you get polo ponies from @entity45 and you get cheetahs that are en route from @entity48 to @entity49 that are in a box that 's too small and seized , " he says
@entity10 recalls following an @entity31 worker on a call out to a plane returning from @entity54 to capture two smuggled rattlesnakes that had got loose
" all the mad stuff happens on quite a frequent basis
( the @entity31 employee ) said the best thing to pick up a snake that 's loose on a jumbo is a pillowcase and he was just wonderfully matter - of - fact about it , " he says
but @entity10 also saw the darker side of the transport hub and says he was shocked to discover the lengths some people go to in an attempt to illegally stay in @entity9
" i saw a man from @entity73 , granted asylum in @entity75 , but he wanted to come to the @entity9 , " recalls @entity10
" under the terms of his residency in @entity75 he was n't allowed to come to the @entity9 and he ate his travel documents as he was getting off the flight so he could say , ' no , i 've just arrived from my war - torn homeland
' it 's quite common
" the experience of being there was so extreme , to be with an immigration officer when they 're interviewing someone and they know they 've got 50 condoms full of cocaine inside them and they will not admit it
" you do n't see humanity at its very best when you 're at an airport ... you see the immigration and customs officers are lied to most of the time
they see ( humanity ) probably at its worst , at its most criminal and venal
" read more : a day in the life of @entity2 another surprise for @entity10 was seeing a woman arrive on a flight from overseas dressed in a wedding gown because she wanted to marry prince @entity109 -- an apparently common occurrence ( it used to be @entity112 before he got hitched , adds @entity10
) the incident formed part of one of the short stories in @entity10 ' book " departures : seven stories from @entity2 , " inspired by his stay at the airport
another tale was inspired by his discovery that the airport 's air traffic control was manned by " youngsters in their cargo pants
" @entity10 says : " i thought that venerable elderly gentlemen that looked something like a @entity134 presenter would be in charge of the skies and of course , it 's all the children of @entity140 , kids that have grown up with computers
" there 's that moment where you look around the air traffic control tower , this wonderful panoramic view of the sun coming up , the skylight of @entity0 50 miles away , ( and you think ) where are all the grown ups ? " quiz : test your @entity2 knowledge but @entity10 was impressed with their professionalism and says many of @entity2 's employees were childhood airplane enthusiasts who never lost their passion
" the thing that is most striking about @entity2 is how totally obsessive the people are who work there , " he says
" it 's not just another job , for the firemen , for the pilots , for the air traffic controllers , for the people at customs , the people at immigration
they really feel as though they 're in touch with something epic , something that 's bigger than they are
" and he was impressed by the sheer size of the airport
@entity10 says : " the thing about @entity2 is that it 's a secret city more than an airport
it 's a place where 70,000 people work
it 's a place where 75 million people pass through every year
" it 's got its own methodology , its own rituals and is far more than just another hub
it 's like another city
