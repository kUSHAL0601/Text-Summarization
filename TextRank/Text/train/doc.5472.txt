-- good luck stopping the phenomenon that is one direction
according to @entity5 , the group has announced 2015 summer tour dates just two months after their highly successful @entity7 ended
the aptly titled @entity8 will travel across @entity9 and the @entity10 " the band will be playing a few of the same stadiums they did during ' where we are , ' including @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , " @entity5 reports
" however , many of the stops on upcoming tour are new such as @entity23 's @entity22 , @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity27 ' @entity26 , which has a capacity over 104,000
" this will be music to the ears of the tweens and teens who were n't able to snag tickets last time around
but it 's probably not so great for the parents who may have to foot the bill , which averaged over $ 100 per ticket
last year , the group was predicted to become the first boy band worth $ 1 billion , thanks in part to the tour and their film " @entity43
" with so much boy band heat , could there be a further resurgence ? we 're looking at you , * @entity50 .
