@entity0 -- the @entity3 will bypass environmental and land - management laws to build hundreds of miles of border fence between the @entity6 and @entity7 , homeland security secretary @entity2 said tuesday
a border fence stands at @entity9 , @entity7
more than 360 miles of fence are supposed to be finished by year 's end
" criminal activity at the border does not stop for endless debate or protracted litigation , " @entity2 said
" these waivers will enable important security projects to keep moving forward
" @entity2 cited a congressional requirement that 361 miles of fence be completed by the end of the year
he also pointed out that @entity21 had given him the authority to bypass laws
but the executive director of the @entity25 , an environmental group , said the move " threatens the livelihoods and ecology of the entire @entity6 - @entity7 border region
" " @entity30 chose to bypass stakeholders and push through this unpopular project on @entity33
we do n't think the destruction of the borderlands region is a laughing matter , " said @entity34
the @entity25 says the waivers will affect a range of federally protected lands , including national parks , monuments , wildlife refuges , forests and wilderness areas
the @entity25 says the waivers themselves are unconstitutional and has asked the @entity49 to rule on the question
this is the fourth set of waivers issued by the department , and is the most sweeping
@entity2 's orders tuesday affect two areas
first , the department proposes to place fencing , towers , sensors , cameras , detection equipment and roads along a 470 - mile stretch of the border in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity7 and @entity67
second , it plans to integrate a concrete wall into proposed levee reinforcements along a 22 - mile section of the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity67
the department said it is committed to working in an environmentally sensitive manner and cooperating with resource agencies so it does as little damage as possible
