-- @entity2 striker @entity1 has been ordered to pay @entity4 champions @entity3 a record $ 20.7 million after losing his final appeal in a five - year case relating to his positive cocaine test
the @entity9 @entity8 upheld the decision of @entity11 and the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) in ruling that the player must compensate his former club for breach of contract
@entity1 , 31 , who now plays for @entity17 , was sacked by the @entity19 team in 2004 after testing positive for the drug
he was given a seven - month worldwide ban from football before resurrecting his career in @entity24 with @entity25 and then @entity17
@entity3 's legal case was based on the fact that they paid Â£ 15 million to sign the player from @entity30 in 2003 and he had four years remaining on his contract when he was banned
a statement from the @entity9 court said : " the @entity34 has rejected the appeal filed by @entity1 against a sentence by @entity12
