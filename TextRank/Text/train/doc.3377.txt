-- thursday afternoon , @entity1 presided over the unveiling of @entity4 's official portrait in the @entity5 , a warm event that reminds us : it feels like years since president @entity4 regaled the world with his famous spoonerisms
his retirement has been defined by an awkward silence
while @entity14 's endorsement was trumpeted by @entity15 , @entity4 delivered his in just four words
" i 'm for @entity15 , " he shouted to a journalist as an elevator door closed between them
if , just for old time 's sake , @entity4 had said , " i 'm for @entity23 , " it would have been perfect
@entity4 's silence may be motivated by the recognition that much of the public does n't like him
he left office with the worst approval rating for a president since @entity30
but @entity4 could undergo a renaissance of enthusiasm
consider the shifting attitudes toward @entity34
when he left the @entity5 in 1952 , @entity34 was blamed for the recession and an ugly war in @entity37
his approval rate was just 31 %
by 1977 , @entity39 was hanging @entity34 's portrait in the @entity5 and the band @entity42 sang , " @entity43 needs you , @entity34 ! " the switch came partly because @entity34 , like @entity4 , had a gentle , honest personality that voters looked back on with fondness
but @entity34 also proved prescient in his conduct of the @entity50
@entity4 , likewise , might seem a better and more farsighted leader in a few years time
in the short term , the two things that will dominate popular memories of @entity4 are the credit crunch and the @entity56
@entity57 , @entity4 's ambassador to the @entity58 , admitted this week that his former employer had left @entity1 " a mess " to clean up
to be fair , @entity4 himself faced some events beyond his control : a recession in 2001 and the global collapse of financial institutions in 2007 - 2008
nevertheless , on his watch median household income fell , poverty rose and millions lost health insurance
one particularly ugly stat : in 2000 there were 11.6 million children living in poverty in the @entity43 , but by 2008 that number had swelled to 14.1 million
meanwhile , billions of dollars and thousands of lives were lost in the invasions of @entity78 and @entity79
even so , the future of democracy in both countries remains uncertain
in the course of " rooting out terrorism , " civil liberties were compromised
if you like your government limited and cautious -- in the style of @entity89 or @entity90 -- @entity4 was n't your kind of a conservative
however , as memories fade and new reasons to be angry take their place , @entity4 's time in office might start to look comparatively benign
the economic figures might have been bad when @entity4 left the @entity5 , but they 've only gotten worse
total debt was nearly $ 11 trillion in january 2009 , when @entity1 took office , and it 's more than $ 15 trillion today
in january 2009 , unemployment was 7.8 % and , after hitting a high of 10 % in october 2009 , is down to 8.1 %
people might not have reason to be nostalgic about @entity4 , but @entity1 has n't yet delivered all that change he promised
moreover , his foreign policy -- although involving fewer boots on the ground -- has dramatically expanded the definition of the enemy and the tools available to fight them
in the wake of the discovery of a creepy " @entity118 , " a number of liberal journalists have written that @entity1 is actually less ethical or constitutionally minded than his predecessor
@entity4 might have tortured enemy combatants , but @entity1 has targeted @entity43 citizens identified as terrorists
still , historical distance from @entity4 's presidency will let us put it in greater perspective
subjective bad memories will be replaced by objective analysis
and , objectively , he was a very important president
in foreign affairs , @entity4 defined the @entity131 in much the way that @entity34 shaped thinking about the struggle against communism for decades
after 9/11 , @entity4 could have determined the threat to @entity43 to be a limited terrorist opposition centered on @entity137
instead , he defined it as a grand existential conflict between democracy and radical islam : a clash of civilizations
many may argue that his analysis was flawed , but many in the @entity146 also bought it -- witness @entity149 's participation in @entity79 and @entity78 and @entity151 's ban on the @entity152
on @entity4 's watch a consensus developed that @entity156 extremism must be confronted
more importantly , the idea that the @entity146 would support democracy , regardless of the cost -- that the age of the great dictators was over - probably shaped the popular risings that took place across the @entity164 in 2010 - 11
would there have been an @entity166 without an @entity79 war ? maybe not
at home , @entity4 was surprisingly innovative , too
he spoke @entity169 and attracted unusual numbers of latino votes
he appointed two black secretaries of @entity173 and a @entity175 - @entity43 secretary of @entity176
he also gave to the right the concept of compassionate conservatism : the idea that instead of simply pushing for less government , the @entity181 should offer constructive proposals for what should take its place
a result is that the one place in the world where @entity4 is guaranteed a good reception is @entity190
in 2003 , just 50,000 @entity190 were on anti-retroviral drugs
thanks to the $ 18 billion in aid that @entity4 pumped into the continent , the figure had risen to 1.3 million people by 2007
the picture that emerges is a president who was , like @entity34 , ahead of his time in some regards but who was undermined by events that , in the beginning at least , were beyond his control
without 9/11 , @entity4 might have been a more benign @entity206 - style president who could have spent his energies pursuing two policies that @entity181 and @entity209 will probably have to come to terms with eventually : immigration reform and free trade with @entity213
the @entity131 undermined those domestic ambitions
however , it also gave him the opportunity to change the way we perceive the world
for good or bad , we 'll be living by the @entity4 model of international relations for many years to come
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .
