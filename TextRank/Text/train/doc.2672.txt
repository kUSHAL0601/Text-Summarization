-- one of the nurses duped by a prank phone call about @entity3 , apparently committed suicide on friday , and many social media users were quick to point fingers at the two radio hosts who made the call and then promoted it on @entity10
@entity12 radio station @entity11 posted audio of the call on its @entity10 page wednesday with the caption , " listen to the prank that the world is talking about
can you believe @entity20 and @entity21 got away with these dodgy accents ? " the hashtag # royalprank was retweeted more than 15,000 times on @entity25 after the radio station began promoting the call
it continued to be used after news of the nurse 's death
@entity3 , the pregnant wife of @entity33 's @entity32 , had been hospitalized with severe morning sickness
the prank became worldwide news as the nurse , believing the @entity38 were @entity39 and prince @entity40 , forwarded the call to a second nurse who eventually revealed details of the former @entity3 's condition
concerns over privacy and the media , which had surfaced in @entity48 during the @entity50 scandal and again when topless photos taken of @entity3 were published , were quickly reignited
but prince @entity40 himself joked about the incident after being contacted by the radio station
news of the prank was also widely shared on social networks , with at least 5,000 links created and shared between tuesday and thursday
at the time , royal commentator @entity59 said he did not believe the radio call had been intended as a serious invasion of privacy
the hospital identified the nurse as @entity65
as news of her death spread , commenters flooded the @entity70
a user named @entity72 posted , " shame for still having this sick call on website ! ! shame on the djs and shame on the radio station
" at 10:54 a.m. et , 700 comments had been posted since wednesday
by 11:15 a.m. et , the number had risen to more than 1,100 and was still growing rapidly
the facebook page @entity81 , also used to promote the two djs , did not have a post about the prank , but that did n't stop people from commenting there
the @entity11 posts , including the audio of the prank , were deleted by 11:41 a.m. although it is unclear what scrutiny @entity92 had been under since the prank , the hospital said in a statement that it had been supporting her
neither police nor the hospital had publicly blamed the radio station for @entity92 's death
but on saturday the hospital released this statement : " @entity102 's @entity101 cares for sick people , and it was extremely foolish of your presenters even to consider trying to lie their way through to one of our patients , let alone actually make the call , " wrote hospital chairman @entity100
management 's decision then to broadcast the recorded call " was truly appalling , " said @entity100 in the letter addressed to @entity113 , chairman of @entity114 , which owns the radio station
" the immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill - considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients
" the longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is , frankly , tragic beyond words
" lord @entity100 called on the radio station to take steps " to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated
" at @entity133 , a spokesman said , " the @entity134 and @entity3 are deeply saddened to learn of the death of @entity65
" the @entity25 account for radio host @entity137 ( @ @entity138 ) had included five updates about the prank on friday morning
by 11:22 a.m. , the account had been deleted
the account for co-host @entity81 ( @ @entity143 ) was also deleted
the station and its parent company , @entity114 released the following : " chief executive officer @entity147 has spoken with the presenters , they are both deeply shocked and at this time we have agreed that they not comment about the circumstances
@entity114 and the hosts have decided that they will not return to their radio show until further notice out of respect for what can only be described as a tragedy
" the full statement was also posted to the @entity10 page and in one hour received more than 4,400 comments and 234 shares
one comment linked to an online petition to fire @entity81 and @entity162
at the time of this writing it had received 1,985 online signatures from around the world
the introduction states , " journalists should be held to higher standards
" but there were also calls for a step back from the immediate tragedy
" do you know why patriots like myself defend this kind of speech until my dying breath ? " posted a @entity0 commenter
" to find that answer , ask yourself this : who decides what kind of speech is appropriate or inappropriate ? who decides what kind of speech is offensive or not ? what if you have the power to decide ? at what point does an opinion that differs from yours become offensive to you ? and what will be the penalty for my supposed offense ? " we can never afford to go down the road if defining right speech from wrong speech
it throws everything else into doubt and opens the doorway for tyrants and the fringe to persecute those who are not like minded
" the nurse , for whatever personal reasons she might have clearly over-reacted
but that is all it is
nobody should be prosecuted or penalized over this
" others fired back , arguing that not all speech is protected and that no one has immunity from the negative effects of reckless actions
still others said the discussion was pointless , since " @entity12 does not have explicit freedom of speech in any constitutional or statutory declaration of rights " another @entity0 commenter offered this : " let us also remember that she was not a native @entity48 speaker - she was front line reception at a major international private hospital where ability in many languages is the priority , and those calling may be all of stressed , powerful , and arrogant - not people to be called upon to give references before being given assistance
and that could not have been changed simply because a @entity33 royal was in the building
so the supposed point of the " prank " - @entity12 xenophobic mockery of an @entity48 accent - was actually a gross exhibition of cruel racism in a world far larger than they could apparently imagine , on top of a gross breach of medical privacy , data protection , and journalistic ethics , which the radio station should never have allowed , and no one should have re-broadcast
" " here 's a social experiment for you , " wrote @entity260 on the @entity81 page
" try treating people with common decency and respect
