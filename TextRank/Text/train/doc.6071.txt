-- the @entity4 gunman had " connections " to jihadists in @entity7 who shared a radical @entity9 ideology , including at least one who went overseas to fight in @entity11 , multiple @entity2 sources told @entity0 on thursday
however , @entity7 foreign minister @entity12 told @entity0 's @entity13 that there is " no evidence at this stage " that @entity17 was linked to a wider group , or network , of jihadists
" there 's no evidence at this stage for us to know that
obviously there 's an investigation going on , and we hope to learn more in the ... coming days
it was clear that , police authorities now have announced , that he was acting alone yesterday , " he said
according to two @entity2 counterterrorism officials , @entity17 was connected to @entity33 through social media
@entity33 is wanted by @entity7 authorities for traveling overseas to fight alongside @entity9 fighters in @entity11 , @entity37 , a @entity7 newspaper , reported
the sources said the two communicated via social media and the @entity41 , but it does not appear they were close
early indications are that @entity17 's connections to other extremists were " interactions " online , including extremist sites , a different @entity2 source said
the activity was " attenuated , " or limited , the source said , noting it appears , so far , that @entity17 had a low profile
there is no evidence so far that he had any " operational links " to other jihadists , according to the source , who drew a distinction between interacting online and plotting an attack
@entity2 officials are reportedly scouring databases and communications for possible links to @entity2 - based jihadists
other radicalized people connected to @entity17 are still believed to be living in @entity7 , @entity2 law enforcement officials said
" the investigation is ongoing and will rapidly determine if @entity17 received any support in the planning of his attack , " @entity66 commissioner @entity65 told reporters thursday
officials now have " information that suggests an association with some individuals who may have shared his radical views , " he said
@entity65 did n't say who these people are or how @entity17 may have interacted with them
the gunman authorities are still in the early stages of their investigation , but they are beginning to piece together the puzzle
they released surveillance video thursday that shows events on wednesday
in the footage , a vehicle pulls up near @entity89 , and a man exits , running with a large gun as people run from him
in other footage , this same man then gets into another vehicle , drives to a nearby building , gets out and runs armed into the building pursued by law enforcement
@entity12 , in a thursday night interview with @entity101 on @entity0 , described the chaos inside the building , saying @entity17 " ran right by the room where the entire government caucus was
we could hear the ringing out of rifle fire and then the huge amount of semiautomatic noise
" we did n't know if the door would be banged open and that we 'd all be sprayed , " he said
@entity12 said the sergeant - at - arms of the @entity114 shot and killed @entity17 at the door to the library , which contained a tourist group as well as employees
" you could have seen more than a dozen killed if he ( the sergeant - at - arms ) had n't taken such quick action , " @entity12 said
@entity17 was a @entity7 citizen who may have had dual @entity124 - @entity7 citizenship , said @entity65
the police commissioner said @entity17 was born in @entity126 and lived in @entity127 and most recently @entity128
@entity17 had been in the @entity7 capital since at least october 2 " to deal with a passport issue and ... he was also hoping to leave for @entity11 , " @entity65 said
@entity65 also said of @entity17 : " according to some accounts , he was an individual who may have held extremist beliefs
" @entity17 was applying for a passport -- an application that was under investigation -- at the time of the attack , but had not had his passport revoked , as has been previously reported , @entity65 said
" i think the passport figured prominently in his motives , " said the police commissioner
" however , we have not come to ground completely on his motivations for this attack
but clearly , it 's linked to his radicalization
clearly , it 's linked to his difficult circumstances
" according to @entity65 , investigators thus far have not found any connection between @entity17 and @entity152 -- who authorities say ran down and killed a @entity7 soldier in @entity156 on monday
who was @entity4 shooter @entity160 ? @entity17 was born as @entity162 in 1982
he had criminal records indicating infractions related to drugs and violence and other criminal activities , @entity65 said
in a pre-trial psychiatric evaluation performed in 2011 , a doctor noted @entity17 at that time had been " a devoted muslim for seven years
" the gunman 's mother , @entity172 , spoke to @entity174 by phone
she struggled to hold back tears and said she did n't know what to say to those hurt in the attack
" if i 'm crying , it 's for the people , " @entity17 reportedly said
" not for my son
" " i 'm mad at my son , " she said in a separate email to the @entity174 @entity185 : " we will not run scared ' @entity7 lawmakers returned to work thursday , giving a standing ovation to the ceremonial @entity89 official credited with taking down the gunman who killed a soldier and shook the @entity89 area
" we 'll be vigilant , but we will not run scared
we will be prudent , but we will not panic
and as for the business of government , well , here we are -- in our seats , in our chamber , in the very heart of our democracy , " @entity7 prime minister @entity185 told the @entity114 in @entity4
lawmakers stood and cheered sergeant - at - arms @entity200 , who officials say took down the suspect in the halls of @entity89 minutes after the killing of @entity7 army reservist cpl. @entity205 at a war memorial nearby
@entity200 , who regularly leads a procession into the @entity114 as sessions begin , stood with his ceremonial mace and appeared to be emotional during the ovation
he later released a statement saying he is touched by the attention
" however , i have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of members , employees and visitors to @entity219 , " @entity200 said
it was a step toward normalcy for a government district that was widely locked down for hours after the shootings at @entity7 's @entity224 and @entity225
authorities say @entity17 shot and killed @entity205 , who was standing guard at the war memorial on wednesday morning
the gunman then entered the nearby main @entity89 building in downtown @entity4 , where witnesses say shots were fired -- many by security officers -- before he was shot dead
a plainclothes constable who was working security at @entity89 was shot in the leg , according to a @entity114 official briefed on the investigation
the injury is not life - threatening , and the constable was treated at a hospital and released , the official said on condition of anonymity
the shootings left government workers and others locked inside offices for a large portion of the day while police searched buildings to ensure that no other culprit was loose
wednesday 's deadly attack was the second on @entity7 soldiers this week
on monday , @entity158 , a convert to @entity255 who @entity7 authorities said was " radicalized " hit two soldiers with a car in @entity156 , killing one of them , before he was killed
lawmakers pay respects to soldier there was an incident thursday morning as the prime minister and his wife were laying a wreath , in memory of @entity205
an eyewitness said a man began yelling
he reached into his jacket , then pulled out a white scarf , and wrapped it around his face
about a dozen police ran towards him , the eyewitness said
the prime minister and his wife had intended to stay longer , but his security team surrounded them and quickly ushered them out
" he 's lucky he was n't shot , " the eyewitness said of the man
the man was apprehended at the scene
@entity287 , @entity205 's uncle , told @entity288 that @entity205 's father is in @entity290 and might not yet know about his son 's death
" i do n't know if life is fair , " @entity287 , said his voice breaking with emotion
" he did n't deserve that
i do n't know how someone could have picked him out and just did that
" before @entity89 reopened , lawmakers gathered outside the memorial -- some holding flowers -- for a moment of silence for @entity205
" this was very off the cuff , " lawmaker @entity305 told @entity0 on thursday morning
" i think parliamentarians really just felt that before we walked into the @entity89 buildings , we had to pay respect to a young man who gave his life for his country
" @entity305 said the soldiers ' killings this week left the government with plenty of questions
" the questions we need to ask ourselves ( include ) , ' how are these people getting this crazy ideology that 's inspiring them to do these copycat killings ? ' " he said
another question , he said : what can society do to deal with people who find themselves on the fringes ? issues of mental health , he said , need to be addressed
" we can not let people like this fall through the cracks and end up doing deranged killings , " @entity305 said
@entity0 's @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 and @entity346 contributed to this report .
