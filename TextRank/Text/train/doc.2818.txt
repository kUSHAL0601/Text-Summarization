-- saturday night , @entity1 will wrap up their seven - date reunion tour with a headlining slot at @entity4
according to the group 's singer and guitarist @entity8 , fans who missed out on seeing them this time around will have plenty of chances later in the year
" the plan is to do 30 dates this fall , " he tells @entity0
" the anchors will be @entity15 and @entity16
what the other cities are , i ca n't tell you right now -- but we 're almost certainly doing @entity21
" the plan is to play mostly large theaters , as opposed to arenas and amphitheaters
" we want to keep it a little more intimate , " he says
" rather than going out and playing a huge something
there have been people from @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 saying to me , ' hey , you gon na come my way ? ' i have to say that with 30 shows , we 're gon na hit those cities
" choose @entity0 's cover : the @entity38 vs. @entity39
vote now @entity8 became a born - again @entity40 in the mid- 1970s , and since 1983 he 's worked as a pastor at @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44
" the church has been very supportive of this tour , " he says
" i have an assistant pastor that 's doing some of the sundays and we have a guest speaker come in too
everybody 's taken care of
" hours before taking the stage with @entity1 at the @entity54 tonight , @entity8 called into @entity0 to chat about the tour
let 's start at the beginning
where were you and what you were doing when @entity61 first contacted you last year about a @entity1 reunion ? i think i was probably just in my home studio office , probably working on some church stuff
this thing was not on my radar
i got one of those calls that @entity61 was calling me , so i got on the phone and we just started the conversation
he said that he 'd been talking to @entity73 [ @entity74 ] and they thought it would be really fun to do the @entity77
they wanted to know if i was into it
it 's kind of funny , ' cause @entity61 said , ' well , you know , we do n't have to do it this year if this is too soon
we can do it next year or the next year ... " and i 'm thinking , " @entity61 , i mean we 're not 20 years old again
we better do this while we still can ! " i think a day later we all got on the phone -- @entity73 , @entity61 and myself
we all agreed to do it
i was on my way to @entity90 in a couple of weeks , so right after i came back i had four days and then i went out to @entity92
we just kind of started rehearsing and it led to this
@entity95 in 43 years how long after the two @entity77 shows did you start talking about doing more shows this year ? between @entity99 and @entity100 of last year it was decided
i do n't know how it all got done
the three of us and our managers just kind of agreed to go ahead and take it to the next step
i imagine that @entity4 was the anchor for these six @entity92 shows this month
they all build up to it
it started in @entity111 , which is a little obscure and out of the way
then we went to @entity15 and there was a little more tension and publicly visible
now here we are at a smaller outdoor venue
it 's given us a feel building up to being outdoors at @entity4
photos : @entity120 how many days did you guys rehearse ? a solid week
it was to our advantage that we had played in october , so we had at least an hour 's worth of music that we 'd already started to rehearse
and then we just moved on from there
one of the neat things about what we 're doing is that we 're doing it ourselves
we do n't have 10 musicians and singers
we got five guys and what you hear is what you get
i think that is something really unique for what we 're doing right now
are you singing songs you have n't sung since in over 40 years ? oh , yeah ! with the @entity143 i do a medley of songs that i sang on the first @entity1 album
i do a medley of " @entity148 , " " do i have to come right out and say it and nowadays @entity149
" i also play a version of " @entity151 " because i just love that song
so with those four songs i was already familiar , but everything else was pretty much songs we have n't played for 40 years
what do you feel when you 're walking onstage with @entity61 and @entity73 ? this is something nobody thought would ever happen again
that 's what everybody is feeling
i saw a guy this morning that said he was coming to the show tonight
he said , " i had tickets 43 years ago in @entity169 to see you guys with the @entity172
" it was within a day or two of when @entity174 had been shot and we 'd cancelled the show
he said , " so i 've been waiting 43 years to see this band play
" i 'm so used to seeing @entity61 as the frontman
it 's cool to see him sing harmonies or just play the piano
he usually is n't a utility player like that
@entity61 made it clear at the first show -- and certainly this was our understanding going in -- that this was not @entity61 and @entity1 or @entity74 and @entity1
that 's the approach we 're taking
it 's a band and everybody fills their role
[ drummer ] @entity198 [ @entity199 ] and [ bassist ] @entity200 [ @entity201 ] fill their roles too
we just share the music and the lead singing
it 's a true band
that 's what 's really neat
i think we 're way past that
i mean , we were 20 - year - old kids when we started
we 're doing this because we want to do it and it 's fun and it 's unique and because we know there 's a lot of people out there that , like me , that never thought it would ever happen ! this has to be the most time the three of you have spent together since 1968
how are you guys getting along ? is it weird after all this time ? no , there 's nothing weird about it
from the moment i saw @entity61 at the rehearsal hall before the @entity77 we just started talking
there was nothing we had to work through or work out to get our relationship back together
then when @entity73 arrived it was the same thing
this has been a truly dynamic situation
everybody is just feeling the same
we left the show last night and @entity73 just had the biggest smile on his face
that 's just the way it is
i think this is the fun we thought we were going to have back in the @entity252
because of circumstances , it just did n't happen
but we 're having fun now
there 's energy in @entity61
there 's energy in @entity260
there 's energy in me
i feel young up there , man
are you at all nervous about playing @entity4 in front of something like 80,000 people ? i 'm not
you know , sometimes it 's more difficult to play in front of 80 people than it is 80,000
it 's just the way it is
with the nerves of intimacy it can be much more intimidating than playing in front of a sea of people
a lot of the reviewers have commented on how remarkably preserved your voice is
do you attribute that to good genes or clean living or just luck ? i think that 's the grace of @entity292
but i think i 'm singing better than i did in 1967
there 's more of a confidence there now
are you guys thinking about taping the shows for a live album or dvd ? well , there 's been no direct conversation that i 've had , but i know the shows are being recorded
do you think the setlist is going to change at all ? i know fans want to hear " @entity308 , " " flying on the @entity148 " and a few others
it 's certainly not going to change before @entity4 , but i would say that by the time we go out in the fall we will probably work in five or six more songs
we 'll probably work in " flying on the @entity315 is @entity314 , " " @entity316 " and " down to the wire
" we were just going over the chord patterns to that one yesterday
i 'm sure it 's hard to say at this point , but do you think that @entity1 is going to carry on in some form after this tour ? well , i do n't think you 're gon na be able to say that @entity1 is an entity that you can count on continuing
i mean , there might be some special things that we do -- but right now it 's just one day at a time
we all have different careers , and this is what we 're doing right now
what 's most heartwarming to me is the friendships
i mean , it 's just too much , man
