@entity0 , @entity1 -- unraveling the complex back stories of the more than 200 pardons issued by former @entity1 gov. @entity5 is revealing serious questions about how pardon review decisions were carried out
but perhaps no pardon is as confounding as the case of @entity10
the retired @entity13 investigator 's pardon has been called " heinous " by critics of @entity5
" someone did n't do their homework on this case , " said @entity16 state rep. @entity15
when @entity5 pardoned @entity10 in january , the convicted @entity22 felon was sitting in an @entity0 , @entity1 , jail cell for violating the terms of a previous @entity22 sentence and was awaiting formal charges from yet another drunken driving accident in october that ended in the tragic death of 18 - year - old @entity29
who 's at fault in that accident has yet to be determined
the teenage girl from @entity34 , @entity1 , had big dreams of saving money and going to college to pursue a business degree
the young woman 's death and the controversy surrounding the case have devastated @entity43 , @entity44 's mother
" she should still be here with me
she should still be here with me
this should not have happened , " @entity43 told @entity2 during an emotional two - hour interview
@entity10 was given a full pardon for a felony drunken driving offense dating from march 2009
that offense was @entity10 's third drunken driving arrest in a little more than year
the @entity54 and @entity5 have issued statements saying they did n't know @entity10 had another @entity22 arrest in october
it came after his pardon case had already been reviewed
@entity0 @entity61 sgt. @entity60 arrested @entity10 twice over a span of a year for @entity22
" right before i put the cuffs on him he said , ' do n't do this to me
' and my comment to that usually is , you did it to yourself , " @entity60 told @entity2 as he recounted details of the two arrests
for the third dui , @entity10 had been sentenced in march 2010 to a year of house arrest and four years in @entity1 's drug court program , an intense drug - and - alcohol - abuse treatment program with strict guidelines that convicted felons like @entity10 must follow
@entity10 was still going through the drug court program when he started applying for a pardon last summer
high - profile friends wrote letters to @entity5 touting what they called @entity10 's genuine lifestyle change
the letters detail what friends described as @entity10 's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a " freakish house fire " and after @entity10 's divorce , according to pardon and parole documents obtained by @entity2
one letter said @entity10 " no longer drinks alcohol " and " has turned his life around
" " @entity10 has led a tragic life
a life that has now been turned around by a grace that is bigger than him
he can now be a positive factor in many lives , " wrote retired @entity98 attorney @entity97
on september 30 , the @entity54 sent its review of the @entity10 case to @entity5
the board recommended @entity10 for a full pardon with a divided 3 - 2 vote
about a week later , on october 7 , @entity10 was driving under the influence again , according to the @entity107
@entity29 attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside @entity109 when @entity10 's truck slammed into the side of her car
@entity29 was killed and her older sister suffered serious injuries
@entity10 still has not been indicted by a grand jury in that crash
because his third dui was pardoned , a conviction in the latest dui case would technically be his third offense , but that would still make it a felony in @entity1
the @entity54 and @entity5 are at a loss to explain how @entity10 's pardon could have unfolded the way it did
state officials say there is not a mechanism in place to alert them of situations like this
a @entity133 spokeswoman referred all questions about the case to the @entity54
@entity137 ' pardon application packet sent from the @entity54 to the governor 's office is filled with references to the " expedited investigation into the circumstances surrounding @entity10 's crime , " meaning his third dui from 2009
according to a state prison official , the " expedited " rush was a result of a flood of pardon applications as the clock was counting down toward the end of @entity5 's final term as governor
@entity5 refused @entity2 's request for an interview but his spokeswoman , @entity158 , issued a statement
" in reviewing mr. @entity10 's case , gov. @entity5 took the @entity54 's recommendation into consideration , and he was n't aware of the subsequent charges , " she said
@entity166 , chairwoman of the @entity167 , issued a statement saying : " i can say that mr. @entity10 's application was supported by testimonials from trustworthy and outstanding members of the community
while the reported circumstances of that arrest are troubling , our system of justice does regard everyone as innocent until proved guilty
" @entity43 , @entity44 's mother , worries her teenage daughter 's death has been forgotten in all of this
she struggles to understand how state officials could not have known that the man involved in her daughter 's violent crash was the same @entity10 who had petitioned for a pardon
" she was a person
she was n't just some name on a piece of paper
a beautiful person , " said @entity43
her days now are often spent weeping over her daughter 's death
she cried throughout most of her interview with @entity2 as she showed photographs of the beautiful girl with big dreams
@entity43 described her daughter as an artist with a big heart , and she proudly talked about the powerful emotions she feels holding a collection of her daughter 's paintings
one of the paintings was a gift from @entity206 to her mother
instead of signing the painting , @entity44 left her handprint on the back
but perhaps the most poignant painting was of swirling blues and purples and oranges that reads " @entity215
" the girl with the artist 's heart is now mourned by her mother with a broken heart .
