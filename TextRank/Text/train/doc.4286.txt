@entity0 , @entity1 -- baptist televangelist @entity3 said sunday he will fight allegations that he coerced young male church members into having sex with him
" i am not the man that has been portrayed on television , " he told his congregation
speaking publicly about the accusations for the first time , @entity3 did not address the specific allegations contained in four lawsuits filed against him earlier this week
" i 've been accused , i 'm under attack , " he said , lowering his head and softening his voice behind the pulpit at the @entity18 in suburban @entity19
" i want you to know , as i said earlier , that i am not a perfect man
but this thing , i 'm going to fight , " he said
" i feel like @entity24 against @entity25 , but i 've got five rocks and i have n't thrown one yet
" with that , the 57 - year - old pastor put down his microphone and walked off stage , receiving deafening applause from the thousands who had come to hear him
the lawsuits accuse @entity3 of using his power and influence within the 25,000 - member church to lure young male church members into sexual relationships
the suits allege that the relationships , which began when the men were in their teens , lasted over many months
@entity3 took the young men -- all of them teens at the time -- on trips , including to @entity48 , according to the suits
long allegedly paid for their hotel rooms , and gave the young men gifts , including a car , cash and jewelry -- all in exchange for sexual favors such as massaging , masturbation and oral sex
the accusations were particularly controversial because @entity3 , who is married , has preached passionately against homosexuality over the years
in 2004 , he led a march to the rev. @entity64 's grave in @entity19 in support of defining marriage as being between a man and a woman
he once declared that his church had created a ministry that " delivered " people from homosexuality
he has a national presence , has been invited to the @entity73 , runs a popular television ministry , and oversees a worship campus that includes a school
in the parking lot after the services sunday , church member @entity77 told @entity2 affiliate @entity80 that he was " very satisfied with what i heard
" " it 's a very difficult moment for the church , for the pastor , but i know for sure they 're going to overcome it -- overcome it in a big way , " @entity77 said
@entity89 , 21 , who has attended @entity90 for nearly eight years , told @entity2 that after hearing @entity3 's sermon , " nothing has changed
" " my love for the ministry , my love for [ the ] bishop and his family has not changed , " she said
@entity89 also said she was " proud " of @entity3 for " the way he came out with his head up
... he showed the strength that i 'm accustomed to
" on saturday , @entity90 members also voiced support
" i stand behind the bishop because of the leader that he is
he is a true leader
the word that he gives is so rich , it is so life - changing , " church member @entity109 told @entity2
a former @entity90 employee , @entity112 , said he hopes the allegations are not true
" the evidence ... all of that is very troubling to many of us in the gospel community , the @entity121 community , " said @entity112
@entity3 gave 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. sermons on sunday
they were essentially the same
eliciting chuckles from the audience , @entity3 began both by joking , " i got ta talk to my family " of worshippers before addressing what other " folk " -- meaning media -- were there to hear
both sermons focused on " understanding painful situations
" he quoted @entity133 : " when you pass through the waters , i will be with you ; and through the rivers , they shall not overwhelm you ; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned , and the flame shall not consume you
" @entity3 encouraged congregants to think about natural disasters -- tornadoes and floods
he specifically named @entity144 and other " painful situations
" " bishop @entity3 will have painful situations , " he said
shouts of affirmation came from the audience
" we will walk through this painful situation , " he continued
then , the bishop quoted the 23rd @entity152
" @entity153 , though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ... " worshippers were on their feet
he urged them to stay committed to being " prayerful , " then briefly reminded them that it 's nearly election time in @entity1 , that it was important to vote and be involved
he then went back to speaking about himself
" some people think i 'm lost , " he said
it is those people , he said , who " will have an opportunity to come down to the altar
" @entity90 will continue to worship and thrive , he said
" we ai n't gon na stop it , " he said
the camera panned to the pastor 's wife @entity170
each sermon ran approximately 20 minutes
between sermons , @entity3 spoke briefly to reporters
" i want this to be dealt in the court of justice and not by public opinion , " he said
" i will say that i am going to fight , fight very vigorously against these charges
" @entity2 's @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .
