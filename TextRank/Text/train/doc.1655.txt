-- it will cover 2.8 million square feet and have its own power plant inside its massive , gleaming circular design
it will be covered in solar panels and house up to 13,000 people on a daily basis -- not to mention 6,000 trees
it 's been compared to a spaceship
and now , as @entity9 looks to make its innovative new headquarters a reality , it 's checking with the neighbors
due to be completed in 2015 , @entity9 's new headquarters may be one of co-founder @entity16 ' final , longest - lasting legacies
this week , @entity9 reached out to residents of @entity18 , @entity19 , where its current headquarters resides ( and will continue to after the new campus is built )
in a letter obtained by blog 9to5 @entity24 , the company seeks to allay some concerns that its neighbors have expressed since the plan was submitted to the city last summer
former @entity9 employee explains ' upside - down ' logo according to the letter , the four - story building will be a research facility that will not replace the existing campus on 1 @entity36
and it will not be open to the public , so there will be no museum or corporate store
the building will contain an auditorium that seats 1,000 and will be used for special events like product unveilings , though
the letter , from @entity9 chief financial officer @entity47 , says the company plans to break ground on the site as soon as @entity18 gives its approval , which is expected this year
neighbors are invited to send @entity9 a letter or go to the city 's website to express any concerns
in the suburban city of roughly 58,000 people , the primary concerns have focused on additional traffic and environmental impact , both of which @entity9 says it is addressing in the design of the campus , which is expected to get @entity66 ( @entity66 ) certification as an environmentally friendly project
the new campus was one of the last major initiatives for @entity16 , who died last year
in 2010 , when @entity71 abandoned its @entity18 campus , @entity16 quietly arranged to buy the site , according to @entity75 's biography , " @entity16
" " i want to leave a signature campus that expresses the values of the company for generations , " @entity16 told @entity75
a team of 50 architects was hired , and @entity16 , as was his habit , was intimately involved in the details , according to the book
much of the campus sits on the former site of an apricot orchard , and @entity16 required that 80 % of the campus be natural , with more than 6,000 trees
@entity9 hopes to raze 26 buildings on the site to make room for the " spaceship , " which will be surrounded by grass and trees
a june 7 @entity97 meeting was one of @entity16 ' last public appearances
at the meeting , he spent about 20 minutes introducing the project and answering questions
" it 's a little like a spaceship landed , " he said as council members got their first look at the design
" i think the overall feel of the place is going to be a zillion times better than it is now
" i think we do have a shot of building the best office building in the world
i really do think architecture students will come here to see this
i think it could be that good
