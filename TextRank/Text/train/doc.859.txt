-- during his professional tennis career that began in 1998 , @entity1 has done a whole lot of traveling
he has played in exactly 30 countries , a figure that does n't include exhibition tours or matches in nations such as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11
starting this weekend the seven - time @entity13 champion and 17 - time grand slam winner breaks new ground by competing in @entity16 in the exhibition @entity18 , and his fans in the world 's second most populated country can hardly wait
a first batch of tickets for his matches in the capital , @entity27 , sold out in 20 minutes
@entity1 is expected to play on two days
" for @entity16 , @entity13 is one of the biggest sporting events -- not just tennis events -- of the year , " @entity18 founder and former doubles standout @entity30 said in an interview with @entity0
" with @entity1 being as successful as he has at @entity13 just makes him that iconic figure in @entity16
" everybody is waiting for him to show up
" @entity1 is excited , too
he 'll be visiting @entity16 for a second time , having surveyed @entity39 's recovery programs in southern @entity16 in 2006 in the wake of the tsunami in @entity42 two years earlier
@entity1 sat down with @entity0 during the @entity43 last month to discuss his upcoming @entity16 trip and all things @entity16
he ca n't wait to land at the airport , for one
he likes @entity16 food -- not shying away from the spicy stuff once in a while -- recalls his time on @entity16 's chaotic roads and of course reflects on his @entity54 request in september that led to an array of colorful replies
q : @entity1 , three months ago you asked your @entity16 supporters on @entity54 to recreate some @entity16 experiences or take you to some popular sights via @entity62
the results were pretty memorable
what did you make of it ? a : i thought it was hilarious , actually
i wanted to explain to people that unfortunately i had limited time because i really need to practice and i need to get back to the family , but i 'm so happy to be coming to @entity16 , and it 's very exciting , so i was like , ' well how ? ' i know i ca n't see much or hardly anything rather than actually experience just the people , @entity27 , all that stuff
so i was like , ' you guys photoshop me and i think that 's like a good idea and then i 'll pick you guys and retweet
' the feedback that came was just [ he giggles ] hilarious
it was crazy , it was cool
there were many , many ones that were simply epic
i ca n't wait to go to @entity16
q : you wo n't have much time in @entity16 , but what are you looking forward to doing ? a : to me arriving at the airport is very exciting
i remember when i went to @entity9 for the first time a couple of years ago [ in 2012 ] in @entity92
i came out and i was like , ' this is it
' it 's so rare for me to go to a new country , new place , new city
it wo n't be my first time in @entity16 , but it 'll be my first time to play tennis , and that moment you walk onto the court or into the stadium -- that 's why i play tennis
i 'm going to @entity16 for that feeling -- playing tennis , showing what i can do , bringing over my personality , sharing the fun and all that with the people , and how are the people going to react ? and obviously i 'm going to meet a ton of people , get a sense for how it is locally there
it 's going to be crazy , but i 'm prepared for that
q : you mention that it 's going to be crazy
it could be quite crazy at the airport when you land
those are the things i do n't know
that 's why i do n't want to think about it much and just like go with the flow
when it happens , handle it
people know i 'm happy to come and if there are happy people that i 'm coming , that 's great
i 've had some experiences at hotels , airports , stadiums , but that 's why i think the @entity145 trip was huge or sometimes playing exhibitions is what i really enjoy doing because it allows me to play in places i 've never been to
i went to @entity150 , i went to @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity92 , @entity153 and @entity154 , and now i can go to @entity16
i 'm sure i 've forgot a few
for me it was special to play in @entity156 for the first time in 2006
i 've been on tour for a long time so sometimes you would think that it takes more to get me excited , which i guess is true to a degree
and this is definitely going to get me excited
q : in a broader perspective , what do you think of when you think of @entity16 ? a : i think of a warm place
i see a lot of people walking around barefoot because it is so warm
i remember i was not able to watch the road anymore because i was seeing guys like coming [ he makes a swerving motion with his hand then laughs ] ... i was like , ' @entity176 , i ca n't watch this anymore because we 're going to get hit at one point
' i was on the road for six straight hours to @entity181 and back from @entity182
it was unbelievable , but it was a great experience
i think of a lot of people
i think of people that are quickly excited , a cricket loving country
obviously that comes to mind as an athlete
so that 's what i think of and just how different the north is from the south , how different the dress is as well , how inland is different to the coast , fisherman to inside with the crops
q : have you seen a @entity204 movie ? a : maybe a few minutes here and there
i went to see one of these musicals in @entity209 years ago [ he suspects it was @entity211 ]
it was so much fun
q : how much do you like @entity16 food ? a : i like it a lot
sometimes i like to face the challenge of spice because i rarely have it
good @entity16 food is great
here this week already i went twice to @entity16 food [ note : the interview took place on the thursday ]
i had chicken biryani , and i like vegetarian as well
i had one of these vegetarian degustation menus , which is great
i ate all the naan breads , you name it
i really like @entity16 food .
