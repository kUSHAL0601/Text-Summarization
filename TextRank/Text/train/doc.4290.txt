an @entity0 who pleaded guilty to participating in a plot to kill the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity5 was sentenced thursday to 25 years in prison
attorneys for @entity8 , 58 , wanted a 10 - year sentence , but @entity5 district judge @entity10 agreed with the prosecution 's recommendation of 25 years
prosecutors said @entity8 tried to recruit a @entity15 drug cartel to bomb a @entity17 restaurant where @entity4 ambassador @entity18 dined
but the scheme unraveled when @entity8 's cartel contact turned out to be an undercover agent
@entity23 cases since 9/11 the judge noted that when @entity8 was told there would likely be a lot of casualties in the assassination plot , @entity8 said , " no problem
" @entity10 said that others who may wish to conspire to cause harm to the @entity5 or its interests " must learn the lesson this will not be tolerated
" " in a case like this , deterrence is of extreme importance , " the judge said
arrested in september 2011 , @entity8 pleaded guilty in federal court in @entity42 in october and admitted to conspiring with members of the @entity45 military in the formulation of the plot
@entity5 attorney general @entity48 said earlier that the plot had been endorsed by parts of the @entity45 government , but @entity45 has denied any involvement
@entity8 met " on a number of occasions in @entity15 with a @entity57 confidential source , " officials said in a federal complaint
posing as an associate of a sophisticated and violent international drug cartel , the source was hired by @entity8 and his cohorts to assassinate the ambassador , the complaint said
before sentencing , @entity8 apologized and took responsibility for actions he said he knew were wrong
" i ca n't change what i did , but i have a good heart
my mind is sometimes not in a good place , " he said
the defense request for a 10 - year sentence was based , among other things , on the idea that @entity8 's crime was a result of untreated bipolar disorder , as argued by the defense 's psychiatrist , dr. @entity82 , a @entity83 professor of clinical psychiatry
but @entity10 said he thought the state 's psychiatrist , dr. @entity85 , made the point that @entity8 did not have serious mental illness , and his mental state should have no effect on sentencing
@entity8 's age was not a factor in the sentencing because of the nature of the crime , @entity10 said
@entity8 's public defender , @entity97 , asked the judge if @entity8 could be incarcerated in a facility as close as possible to @entity100 , where he lived before he was arrested
@entity10 said he had no objection .
