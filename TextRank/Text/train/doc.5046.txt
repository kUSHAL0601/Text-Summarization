-- they may be famous , but even the world 's biggest names go weak at the knees for their favorite football team
@entity7 talks to @entity8 -- former spin doctor of @entity11 prime minister @entity10 -- about his ' manic ' love for @entity14 new boys @entity15
where does your love of @entity15 come from ? i was born in @entity20 in @entity21 and @entity15 were the big team in that region at the time and they were the ones i fell for
my first game was in 1961 when @entity15 were reigning league champions
i started going regularly when i was about five or six
how did you keep up to speed with all things @entity15 when you were in office at no. 10 ? i still managed to get to a lot of games during that period
saturday at three pm was the one time when the @entity34 switchboard knew there was no point bothering me
@entity37 [ @entity10 ] and @entity38 [ @entity39 ] both follow football pretty closely so i think they understood it
i think @entity43 maybe sometimes thought it was a little over the top
were there any occasions when @entity15 came ahead of any high - level meetings ? when we played @entity50 -- the game we won to get promoted to the @entity52 under @entity53 in 2000 -- up until then i 'd been in @entity54
@entity55 [ @entity56 of @entity54 at the time ] was a big @entity58 fan and he had tickets for a game the next day
i said to him : " @entity55 , i 've got to be at this game , these talks can not drag on and on
" as it happened i left early and by the time i 'd landed in @entity65 things had wrapped up , so he got to his game as well , but i did sneak off early it has to be said
what does it mean to you to have @entity15 back in the @entity14 ? it 's fantastic
when we were relegated from the top division in 1974 i did n't think we 'd come back
we had to win a game against @entity75 in 1987 to stay in the @entity76
i honestly think if we 'd lost that we 'd have gone into oblivion so to be back is just incredible
it means a lot to everyone who has followed @entity15 through such bad times
just how special was that win over @entity58 in @entity15 's first home game of the season ? playing @entity58 as our first game back was the best possible start to the season
its true they had a bit of an off day , but we played well , and we 've played teams who are better on paper but we 've beaten them on merit
our wage bill is the smallest in the league by a mile , we 've got a small stadium , we 've got the smallest squad and we 're the smallest town that has ever produced a @entity14 football club , so with all that it 's quite an uphill battle to stay up but i think we will , and by playing good football
who is your favorite player of all time ? it has to be @entity108 , he coincided with the period when i was really fanatical
he was one of these players that when he got the ball you just leaned forward a bit and you thought something is going to happen here and quite often it did
the other player i 'd pick is @entity116 , who is now head of youth development at the club
he was such an elegant player
what is your most memorable moment as a @entity15 fan ? there are loads
beating @entity124 4 - 1 away when @entity125 was in charge of them , is right up there
it was proving impossible to beat @entity124 and we absolutely hammered them
the @entity75 game , obviously , was the most emotional for every @entity15 fan
both play - offs at @entity135 have been great , too
i 've got loads of bad memories too , but i think it 's the bad memories are what make the good memories even more special .
