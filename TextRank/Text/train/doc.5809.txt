-- it could prove to be a pivotal moment in the @entity4 title race -- @entity5 escaped with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity7 on saturday after @entity9 's first - half goal was controversially disallowed despite clearly crossing the line
with champions and league leaders @entity7 leading 1 - 0 at the time , @entity5 keeper @entity11 desperately clawed back the @entity17 midfielder 's header from a corner -- and the referee waved play on to the dismay of the home players and their fans
" that incident that certainly falsified the result
either the line was drawn wrong and was a bit too big , " @entity7 coach @entity25 told reporters
" there is no need to see the replays
it was pretty obvious from all around the stadium
" the visitors also had a goal disallowed in the second half as @entity37 was deemed to be offside in a very marginal decision , but the substitute leveled in the 83rd minute with his 10th goal this season to maintain @entity5 's unbeaten record after 24 matches
@entity45 's team were reduced to 10 men five minutes later when @entity47 was sent off for a cynical foul on @entity49 , but held on to stay one point behind @entity7 with a game in hand
the @entity7 had taken the lead after 14 minutes when @entity54 fired in a deflected shot against his former club , whose defender @entity57 gave the ball away to @entity59 with a careless pass
january loan signing @entity9 thought he had added to midfielder @entity54 's eighth league goal this season , but the linesman did not flag for the goal despite replays showing the ball went well over the @entity5 line before @entity11 intervened
third - placed @entity71 and @entity72 both trail @entity5 by eight points , but can cut the deficit on sunday with victories against @entity76 and @entity77 respectively
in saturday 's other match , mid-table @entity78 snatched a 2 - 2 draw against @entity81 thanks to two late goals from striker @entity83
the @entity85 striker followed up his saved penalty to pull one back in the 78th minute , then took his tally to 14 for this season deep into time added on
@entity81 led in the sixth minute through defender @entity90 , then striker @entity89 made it 2 - 0 eight minutes after the break against his former team
in @entity94 , @entity93 moved up into the fourth and last @entity96 qualification place after snatching a 2 - 1 win at @entity99 rivals @entity98 in saturday 's late match
substitute @entity101 smashed in a freekick off the defensive wall in the 89th minute to seal the points after it had looked like the @entity107 - based hosts had earned a draw thanks to a 75th - minute header from @entity111 striker @entity110 , who came on as a substitute
it was @entity114 - based @entity93 's first win in nine @entity117 matches
@entity118 had temporaily taken fourth after thrashing bottom club @entity119 5 - 1 , but ended the day in fifth -- one point above @entity98
@entity121 and @entity122 remained in the bottom three after sharing the points in a 1 - 1 draw , while @entity125 and @entity126 had the same result in a mid-table clash
@entity94 's top three teams -- leaders @entity129 , champions @entity107 and third - placed @entity114 -- will play on sunday .
