-- " well , if it 's a comeback you want , then get your hands raised , " @entity0 declares on the @entity6 ' first album in seven years , " @entity7
" so should we raise our hands and call the band 's return a comeback ? despite the lyric , @entity0 says no. in @entity14 on monday morning , fresh off a performance for " @entity16 " -- which he jokingly called " @entity18 " -- the @entity6 frontman said , " it 's not like we were a band that broke up and got back together
we lost the plot a bit , and we needed a break , so we took one
we just needed time to find each other again
" plus , it 's good timing , given the coincidental and unrelated release of the movie " @entity31
" " it can only be good , right ? to have the name @entity6 out there again ? " the @entity6 broke through in 1996 with the quadruple - platinum album " @entity34 " before going on hiatus in 2007
during their time apart , @entity0 recorded two solo albums -- " @entity37 " and " @entity38 " -- while keyboardist @entity39 took to the road with the @entity41 , giving them time to explore music they could n't explore together
reuniting gave them a new sense of direction , " like a reset button , " @entity0 said
road - testing the new material this summer by mixing it up with hits such as " 6th @entity53 , " " @entity54 " and " the difference " on a mini-tour has given the band a chance to see how audiences respond or even who that audience is anymore
if @entity0 ever used to measure himself against his more famous father , @entity62 , that 's nothing compared with his previous chart - topping success , which made him a rock star as well as a heartthrob
" things have changed since ' @entity34 , ' " he acknowledged
" @entity68 brought our music to a lot of kids , and even then , we wondered if we were reaching the right audience
i do n't hate our old songs , and i do n't mind playing them
i do n't have that problem
" and with the new songs added , " i do n't think we sound like 1995 or 2002
it sounds like now , but filtered
" content with where the band is now , the @entity6 acknowledge the feeling in the new album title
@entity84 claimed recently that the @entity6 were considering naming the new album " @entity86 , " but @entity87 ( orchestrating a comeback of their own ? ) beat them to it , a claim @entity0 laughs about
" that 's a little bit of a misunderstanding , " he clarified
" ' @entity86 ' was on a list of about 20 possibilities , but we chose ' @entity7 ' for its double meaning
" plus , " @entity7 " has been used as titles for songs performed by the @entity99 and the @entity100 , so the musical legacy had appeal
for now , the band -- guitarist @entity6 , bassist @entity6 , new drummer @entity106 and @entity39 -- has enough cleverness to tide them over on " @entity109 , " which includes such rousing new tracks as " @entity111 , " " @entity112 " and " @entity113 , " featuring one of @entity0 's guitar heroes , @entity114
" @entity116 left a big impact on me , " @entity0 said , " and i feel like we came all this way because of them
i got a telecaster because of them
" " @entity113 " even includes a shout - out to @entity124 as well as songs paying tribute to @entity127
" you probably would be surprised to know i 'm a @entity127 fan , " @entity0 said
" but i ca n't play like @entity129
" most of album 's other lyrics address love and spirituality , " but no more than before , " @entity0 said
" spirituality and the @entity136 make for great songwriting
they ca n't be beat ! " yet even the most obvious lyrics should n't be taken too literally , he cautioned
" there 's no real narrative , " @entity0 said
" i mean , the lyrics are planned in advance , but they 're not about me , and you wo n't know the meaning unless i tell you
and they could mean anything
i could tell you , or you think you know , but i could be making stuff up
" @entity0 does n't look down upon fabrication , even the more scandalous form that recently affected his father when journalist @entity154 was found to have made up quotes from the elder @entity0 in his book " imagine : how @entity160 " and consequently lost his posts at @entity158 and @entity159
" why did he have to quit ? " the younger @entity0 asked
" it 's probably happened before ( to @entity163 ) , and i do n't know that he 's necessarily be by bothered by that or expect the guy to resign
" while @entity154 's fabrications went against the ethics and standards of his profession , the songwriting community is more open to invention and interpretation
to demonstrate , @entity0 took a song from the new album at random -- " @entity180 " -- and came up with a viable interpretation of it on the spot , giving it a cosmic yet nonsensical meaning probably unintended when he wrote it
" and who 's to say i 'm wrong ? but i could be lying , " he added , laughing
" but is n't it strange how it 's become the songwriter 's job to explain the songs ? it 's not like three - minute pop songs fall out of the sky , but i think if you have to explain the song , it 's not a good song
and some songs defy explanation
otherwise , we would n't have ' @entity197 ' " from the @entity199 song " @entity200
" now that the @entity6 are over their hiatus , @entity39 's other group , the aforementioned @entity201 , are going on theirs , as announced by @entity204 while performing in @entity205 on saturday night
but do n't blame the @entity6 for stealing him back
" i knew @entity207 ! " @entity0 said
" and he 's been able to manage juggling both bands before
so i hope we 're not the cause
