-- when 3 - year - old @entity3 fell ill with complications from cystic fibrosis , his parents did what any loving parents would do
@entity8 and @entity9 put their lives on hold to see their son through his medical travails
surgery after surgery , hospital after hospital , they remained by their child 's side as he fought to recover
this past march , at age 4Â½ , @entity3 lost his battle with this terrible disease
following the indescribable anguish that comes with the death of a child , @entity8 and @entity9 might have hoped to resume their jobs and begin the process of moving forward with their lives
what should have been a private and quiet period has instead been marked by a mountain of medical debt , home foreclosure and bankruptcy
like three - quarters of the families driven to bankruptcy by health - related costs , the @entity3 family had health insurance when @entity3 became ill. in fact , through a combination of employer - provided insurance , @entity46 coverage and state - sponsored care , the vast majority of @entity3 's medical expenses were covered
but to be by their son 's side during his treatments , @entity3 's parents both took time off from work
with their reduced income , it was impossible for them to make ends meet
according to a recent study by researchers at @entity66 and published in @entity67 , medical costs , including lost wages , copays , deductibles , premiums , coverage limits and uncovered expenses , contributed to more than 62 percent all personal bankruptcy filings in 2007
these costs can bankrupt even those with health insurance they thought was solid as a rock
as @entity74 moves forward with long - overdue legislation to improve and expand health insurance coverage , we should help the millions of @entity77 drowning in medical debt get a fresh start
by ensuring that the vast majority of @entity77 have access to affordable health insurance , the broad health care reform legislation being debated in the @entity81 will reduce the number of bankruptcies caused by medical debt
even so , uncovered expenses such as lost wages can drive people to bankruptcy
the @entity91 would make it easier for those with high levels of medical expenses to discharge their debt and move on with their lives , by lifting unnecessary and burdensome procedural requirements for people who become insolvent because of unavoidable health costs
for example , under the current system , a prospective bankruptcy filer must complete credit counseling , a requirement that includes a fee and is geared to people whose irresponsible spending led to bankruptcy
for @entity8 and @entity9 , the counseling was a cruel reminder of their loss
they were unable to , and should not have had to , answer the question : what could you have done differently to avoid your financial hardship ? to add to the heartlessness of this nonsensical , government - imposed obligation , the credit counseling was an online program
a person would have seen how inappropriate it was to be asking that question
in addition , the proposed legislation -- which has been offered as an amendment to the larger health care bill and also is pending before the @entity127 as a stand - alone bill -- would give the medically bankrupt increased flexibility in paying attorneys ' fees and a greater chance of retaining their homes
the bill , which would cost the taxpayers nothing , does not propose a bailout or handout
it would merely adjust the current bankruptcy rules to make the process less expensive and more accessible for those on the verge of losing everything because of uncontrollable medical expenses
we hope that @entity74 will swiftly approve this common sense dose of compassion
