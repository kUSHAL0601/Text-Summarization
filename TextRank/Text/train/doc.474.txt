-- a federal judge dismissed a case of cyberstalking on @entity5 ruling that even though some tweets caused emotional stress , they are still considered free speech
the case involved @entity10 , a @entity11 leader based in @entity12
@entity10 aroused the ire of @entity14 , a man who , according to the memorandum opinion issued in the case , befriended @entity17 in 2007 before the two had a falling out
using various pseudonyms on @entity5 and on blogs , @entity14 published more than 8,000 tweets and posts about @entity17 often wishing death upon her
( one tweet , for example , read , " do the world a favor and go kill yourself
p.s. have a nice day
" ) @entity17 cooperated with the @entity31 , which had @entity14 indicted and put in jail in february on interstate stalking charges , a statute of the @entity35
@entity14 sought to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that it violated the @entity39
the judge in the case , @entity42 , agreed with @entity14 's assertion , concluding that the @entity39 " protects speech even when the subject or the manner of expression is uncomfortable and challenges conventional religious beliefs , political attitudes or standards of good taste
" @entity42 also cited the fact that @entity10 is a public figure ( she was the subject of a book published in 2000 ) and ruled that @entity14 's remarks did n't constitute a " true threat
" factoring into @entity42 's thinking was his assessment of @entity5 and blogs , which he likened to billboards
billboards , he reasoned , do not send messages and " does not communicate , except to those who voluntarily choose to read what is posted on it
" in reaction to the ruling , @entity10 was " appalled and frightened , " according to her lawyer , @entity68 , who spoke to the @entity69
@entity70 , one of @entity10 's attorneys , says it has n't been determined yet whether an appeal to @entity42 's ruling will be sought
@entity14 's public defenders , meanwhile , are working on getting him released from jail , according to the report
what do you think ? should posts on @entity5 and blogs be protected even if they appear to be threatening ? let us know in the comments
