@entity0 -- in @entity0 the smell of fish wafting from the docks and the canneries is the smell of money
and lately , the town has smelled a lot less fishy
high seas high jinx : @entity11 gives his shipmate @entity12 a haircut at sea using a sail bag as a barber cape
over fishing , new quota systems and changes in expected weather patterns have all played a role in changing the face of this once swashbuckling @entity26 town , fishermen say
" last summer we thought that pollock fishing was over for good , it was so bad
time to turn out the lights and go home
but then they cut the quotas by 30 percent and now there are some small signs of more small fish , so maybe they are coming back , " said @entity32 , who coordinates with fishing captains who unload their catch at the @entity37 docks in @entity0
" the fishermen have to go further north toward @entity44 now to get the fish that are near the ice
it used to be the boats would go out 100 miles , now they go out 500
it could be partly due to temperature change and weather patterns
" @entity0 saw a revival in popularity with the reality show the @entity55 , but even the high - fiving enthusiasm of the deck hands on the tv show ca n't match what the town was like in the glory days
" those were the days , in the mid 1980 's , there was booze , drugs and partying
you had lines of coke going down the bar and no one said anything , " says @entity67 , captain of the 24 - ton fishing boat the @entity69
" people were making big money and spending it as fast as it came in
i earned $ 78,000 as a deckhand the first year i was here but i ca n't remember where it went
those days are long gone
" aboard the @entity85 , as we sail north through the @entity86 , we 're finding other things are not quite like they used to be
for starters , we 've been becalmed for much of the trip when we were expecting to encounter strong winds on the @entity91 and @entity86
we have motored nearly half of our 2,300 miles so far
more importantly , the ice we were bracing ourselves for may not be where we expected to find it
while this is good news for the expedition from a sailing perspective , it 's less attractive for wildlife such as polar bears , seals and walruses that use the ice as a platform for hunting , mating and migration
" the present extent of northern sea ice is very similar to the extents at this time in 2008 and in 2007
it is close to values seen also in 1995 and 1990
it is about five per cent below the long - term average of 12.2m square kilometers , " said dr @entity114 , a research scientist with the @entity115 near @entity116 , @entity117
september 2007 was the first time that the @entity121 was open water from end to end
an ice forecast issued by the @entity126 on july 1 showed earlier than normal break up in many key areas in the @entity129
" in the @entity129 region , the breakup pattern is one to three weeks early in many coastal areas and by as much as one month in isolated areas , " the report said
but we 're still some 400 miles from the @entity136 and a month from entering the heart of the @entity121 , which gives the @entity129 plenty of time to surprise us .
