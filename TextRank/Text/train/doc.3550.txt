@entity1 @entity0 vowed tuesday to fight with her head " held high " to prove her innocence after @entity6 @entity5 judges ruled tuesday she should stand trial again for the death of her former roommate in @entity6
@entity10 spent four years in prison before an appellate court overturned her murder conviction , citing lack of evidence against her in the 2007 death of @entity20 student @entity18 in @entity21
@entity10 , who returned to the @entity1 in 2011 and has been living in @entity22 , was not in court for tuesday 's ruling
the @entity5 judges in @entity26 also ordered that her former boyfriend , @entity27 , who was acquitted with her , face a new trial as well over @entity31 's death
@entity10 said it had been " painful " to hear the news that the court had ordered a retrial , in a statement issued through the family 's @entity37 spokesman , @entity36
timeline : @entity18 murder case the prosecution 's case against her " has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and unfair , " she said in the statement , and an " objective investigation " and " capable prosecution " are needed if any questions remain about her innocence
" the prosecution responsible for the many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them , for @entity27 's sake , my sake , and most especially for the sake of @entity18 's family
our hearts go out to them , " she said
" no matter what happens , my family and i will face this continuing legal battle as we always have , confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity
" ' psychological impact ' @entity10 's attorney , @entity68 , earlier told @entity69 that @entity10 was " upset and surprised because we thought that the case was over
" but , he added , " at the same time , as she 's done in the last five years , she 's ready to continue and we are ready to fight
" @entity68 said he did not expect his client to leave @entity22 for @entity6 " for many reasons , " although she is free to travel
experts disagree over extradition for @entity0 " she 's a very young girl and she 's looking to have her life , " he said
" this has a psychological impact on her
" prosecutors have argued that despite the appellate decision , they still believe @entity10 and @entity27 are responsible for the death of the 21 - year - old student
another man , @entity87 drifter @entity18 , was convicted separately of @entity31 's killing
@entity89 admitted having sexual relations with @entity31 but denied killing her
@entity31 's older sister , @entity91 , said tuesday that the family welcomed the news of the retrial because they still hoped to discover the full story behind her death
" we are never going to be happy about any outcome because we have still lost @entity18 but we obviously support the decision and hope to get answers from it , " she told @entity69 affiliate @entity98 from the family home in @entity100 , south of @entity101
" there are still so many unanswered questions
all we have ever wanted to do is do what we can for @entity18 and to find out the truth of what happened that night
" @entity18 's conviction was on the basis that there was more than one person there so that is something that needs to be looked into
" the @entity118 ' family lawyer , @entity117 , earlier said they wanted a retrial because they believed the ruling that acquitted @entity10 and @entity27 was " superficial and unbalanced
" @entity0 : fascination with ' the evil female ' judge @entity123 told the court he would publish the reasoning behind his decision within 90 days , after which the parties would have 45 days to present their case
the retrial is not expected until sometime early next year , to be heard in an appellate court in @entity132
after that , both parties would again be able to appeal at the @entity5
@entity135 , a law lecturer at @entity136 and an expert on the @entity6 legal system , said that the judges ' decision to order a retrial is " not unusual when a case is very complex and there is a clear contrast between different accounts of the factual scenario
" while the @entity6 @entity5 decides on points of law , the boundaries are not always clear , @entity135 said
" in this specific trial , the use and interpretation of evidence was discussed , " but the picture should become clearer when the full reasons for the court 's ruling are issued in the coming weeks , he said
@entity10 may be ordered to return to @entity6 for the retrial
if she refuses , the @entity6 government could appeal to the @entity1 government for her extradition
but even if it does , @entity10 might still not end up before an @entity6 court
double jeopardy ? @entity1 officials might reject such a request because it violates the @entity1 legal principle that a criminal defendant ca n't be tried twice on the same allegation , said @entity171 , a contributor for @entity173 's " @entity174
" @entity6 lacks the absolute prohibition present in @entity1 law preventing authorities from retrying a criminal defendant who has been acquitted of a charge
2011 : was @entity6 fair to @entity0 ? " we have principles that are well - founded within our @entity182 , one of which is double jeopardy , " @entity171 said
" so as a result of that , i think it would be highly objectionable for the @entity1 to surrender someone to another country for which justice has already been administered and meted out
so i do n't think or anticipate that that would happen
" another lawyer for @entity10 , @entity194 , said monday that her client was confident in the @entity6 legal system and hoped one day to return to @entity6 as a free woman
the @entity5 did not order her retrial tuesday on a charge of defamation
@entity10 's conviction for defaming @entity18 , a club owner whom she accused of killing @entity31 , was upheld in october 2011 by the same appeals court that cleared her of murder
2011 : @entity0 judge explains murder acquittal the case began in 2007 , after @entity10 moved to @entity21 to study at the @entity210 of @entity21 for one year
@entity10 , then 20 , shared a room with @entity20 student @entity31
that november , @entity31 's semi-naked body was found at the home , with her throat slashed
police arrested @entity10 and @entity27 , who was her boyfriend at the time
two years later , they were convicted of murder , but they were cleared when they appealed the verdicts in 2011
' lack of evidence ' in legal paperwork published in december 2011 , the judge in the case wrote that the jury had cleared the pair of murder for lack of evidence proving they were guilty
@entity10 's family said last year the appeal was unwelcome , but no cause for concern
" the appeal of @entity0 's acquittal by the prosecution was not unexpected as they had indicated from the day of the verdict that they would appeal , " a family statement in february 2012 said
2011 : @entity10 makes emotional return to @entity22 @entity10 has spent the last year and a half trying to resume a normal life , studying creative writing at the @entity246 in @entity22 , her hometown , according to family spokesman marriott
she also has written a book on her ordeal , titled " waiting to be heard , " which will be published next month
according to @entity264 , @entity10 " tells the full story of her harrowing ordeal in @entity6 -- a labyrinthine nightmare of crime and punishment , innocence and vindication -- and of the unwavering support of family and friends who tirelessly worked to help her win her freedom
" the publisher did not have any immediate response to the news that @entity10 now faces a retrial
@entity269 , @entity27 's father , told @entity69 in a phone interview last year that the family was " not happy about the decision ( to appeal )
my son is trying to get back to normal life
" " we can do very little in this situation , " he said , but as @entity6 citizens , they would have to accept the court 's decision
" we hope that the high court will finally put the words ' the end ' to this story
