@entity0 -- a coalition of nearly 70 former federal prosecutors and judges has publicly opposed their former boss , the @entity7 government , in a dispute over prosecutorial misconduct
at issue is when defendants cleared of wrongdoing can sue the @entity13 for " bad faith " acts that taint the integrity of the judicial system
the @entity7 @entity18 has been asked to take up the appeal
a federal judge had awarded @entity21 nearly $ 602,000 in damages and fees after a jury acquitted the @entity26 doctor on charges relating to the fatal drug overdose of a patient
@entity21 later claimed two assistant @entity7 attorneys and a @entity32 agent " acted vexatiously " after the original indictment was filed
judge @entity34 concluded , among other things , prosecutors violated disclosure requirements by withholding information from the defendant and the court and by launching a separate " tactical " effort to disqualify the doctor 's attorney just before the trial was to begin
gold called the government 's conduct " profoundly disturbing , " raising " troubling issues about the integrity of those who wield enormous power over the people they prosecute
" a federal appeals court in @entity55 eventually threw out the lawsuit , saying the trial judge overreached , and that the overall prosecution and allegations on the original indictment were " objectively valid
" the @entity13 is now expected to ask the justices to dismiss the appeal
a federal law known as the @entity63 allows for damages , including attorney 's fees , when a court determines the entire government 's " position of the @entity7 was vexatious , frivolous , or in bad faith
" the narrow scope of the law has made it generally difficult for defendants to recoup the costs of botched federal criminal prosecutions by the government
but the group of onetime prosecutors and judges opposing the government on thursday filed a so - called " amicus " legal brief backing the doctor , saying in this case the damages award was appropriate
" the amici are deeply concerned that the @entity89 's decision will allow serious prosecutorial misconduct to be excused and , in so doing , will undermine public confidence in our system of justice , " said attorney @entity85 , representing the legal coalition
" if allowed to stand , the [ appeals court 's ] holding will disempower district judges , and send a clear signal that even grave prosecutorial misconduct will generally be overlooked , given the relatively lax standards for instituting federal prosecutions , " he added
it is somewhat unusual for this large a group of onetime federal prosecutors and judges to come together and strongly oppose the @entity13 's actions in a criminal case
@entity21 is also being supported by other groups , including the @entity109 and the @entity110
the @entity112 administration has not yet formally reacted to the original appeal by @entity21 or the supporting parties
government appellate lawyers have until september 10 to file their official response .
