-- @entity1 officially said monday that it has " profound regret " for practicing slavery , and became the first state north of the @entity5 to pass such apologetic legislation
the legislation does not need the signature of @entity1 gov. @entity8 to become official
a committee of the @entity10 last thursday approved the resolution , just one of several steps lawmakers had to take by monday , the last day of the current legislative session
the @entity10 and the @entity15 voted overwhelmingly -- 29 - 2 -- to approve the resolution
the resolution states that " the fundamental values of @entity19 were shattered ; they were brutalized , humiliated and dehumanized
" @entity1 , it reads , had 12,000 slaves , one of the largest populations in the northern colonies
the state was also the last to emancipate slaves , in 1846 , it says
if the resolution had not passed , the process would have had to begin again
the resolution did not need gov. @entity8 's signature and will become official when filed with the secretary of state
the symbolic atonement follows apologies for slavery made in 2007 by legislators in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40
