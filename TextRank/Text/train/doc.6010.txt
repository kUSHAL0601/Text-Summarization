-- @entity1 holds a unique place in @entity4 's culture
it was a bit of an afterthought , originating in 1910 -- some 40 years after @entity7 -- after a woman in @entity9 , @entity10 , campaigned that dads needed to be honored , too , she was right
we could n't possibly ignore @entity13
we love him , too
he deserves more than second billing
still , we all know @entity15 gets the most attention
she gets the perfume , she gets the flowers , she gets the candy , the new dress , the heart - felt cards and even breakfast in bed , ( maybe )
it 's @entity13 who takes the kids and goes searching with them for @entity7 presents
but @entity13 ? well , he gets a tie
or maybe some t - shirts , golf balls , cologne , or a lounging shirt
a few joke greeting cards
@entity15 reminds the kids , and hands them a little money to shop with , saying , " get him something he 'll enjoy
" yeah , it will be a tie
or , if he 's lucky , his young ones may do a handmade gift
that ceramic cup that leans just slightly to the left
our public portrayal of fathers has shifted during my life
tv fathers have " evolved ' from real people like sheriff @entity55 , @entity58 's dad @entity56 and @entity59 " @entity60 , to cartoon dads like @entity62 , and @entity66 's caricatures in " @entity13 ! " and " @entity64
" none of the latter are exactly the firm , wise , wisdom - dispensing fathers of the " back - in - the - day " tv dads
but my dad was the real deal
and he never allowed his nine kids to forget
today 's fathers are having a rough go being kindly portrayed in the media
thank @entity78 , we do we have president @entity80 for a national model
he both dotes on and takes a firm loving hand to our first - family daughters
and every once in a while , he gets to parent a " son
" i recall his having a sort of father - son talk with a crying boy who 'd lost an egg at the @entity95 easter egg roll , telling him -- like a father -- to " shake it off
" i also recall the president saying on tv , with @entity100 sitting right beside him , ( foolish man ) that he put more thought into his gifts , than he got back -- producing a very frosty look from the first lady
but , it was probably true
it was in my family
there are , of course , instances of bad fathers , men who were n't up to the job
those who abandoned their kids , or were often drunk
those who were present with necessities , yet absent from their children 's lives
@entity78 bless them for missing out on the most rewarding parts of being a male , and @entity78 bless their kids for surviving and maturing in spite of this
president @entity80 knows about this -- he was raised largely without his father -- as does @entity128 , whose father died three months before the 42nd president was born
it 's true you never know the full depth of a parent 's touch in your life until they 're gone
even if you cared for them in their old age , there 's never a way to prepare yourself for the death of a parent
if you 're a girl , you 're always @entity132
you 're vulnerable , no matter how worldly , or sophisticated , or strong you 'd become along the way
my dad , @entity146 , let me know how proud he was , even as he kept me from being too big for my britches
my father would have celebrated his 83rd birthday this weekend
it 's been two years since his death , but i think of him every day
@entity146 loved sports , he enjoyed cooking and loved his family
and most of all , he devoted most of his life to trying to help others
on this @entity1 , i think of my @entity13 , my grandfathers , uncles and my two brothers who are good dads to their kids
i also think of all the fathers whose sons were taken in service to this nation
@entity146 would approve of that
i think of the fathers of the boys and girls killed in @entity170 , and 74 school shootings since then
i think of all the fathers who 've lost daughters and sons to illnesses , or accidents -- far too often a father 's only child
i also think of the fathers whose sons turned mass murderers , despite every effort to parent a son who 'd make a good citizen
there ca n't be a worse hell on earth than that
then , i turn my prayers and attention back to the fathers still parenting
i think and pray for the fathers across the nation who are raising @entity4 's next generation , and of those still advising the current , grown up , generations
there 's no more important job in the world than raising a child , even when you 're the president
there 's no more important job than being a father
@entity1 to all the dads , granddads and soon - to - be - fathers
join us on @entity213 / @entity212 .
