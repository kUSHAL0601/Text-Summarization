-- the three women and a child who were freed monday after years of imprisonment inside a @entity5 house may have remained trapped had it not been for the efforts of a man who was visiting two women on the porch of a house across the street
" one of the women i was with told me that something was happening in front of the house , " @entity13 , 32 , said on @entity0 's " @entity14 " on wednesday
@entity13 told @entity0 en @entity21 that , seeing a woman screaming for help from inside the house across the street , he went to the door of the house and asked her if the house was burning
" she told me no , that she had been held , kidnapped , for 10 years , " the @entity29 man who has lived in the @entity30 since 2011 said in @entity31
@entity13 said that the woman had cracked opened the inner of two front doors but that the outer door was closed with a chain
" i tried to open the door , but i could n't , so i gave it a few kicks , " he said
" she succeeded in escaping through the bottom of the door , and once she had escaped , she remembered the girl and returned into the house , picked up the girl and left
and when she left with the little girl , she said , ' let 's get out of here because , if this guy comes , he 's going to kill us
if he finds me here , he 's going to kill me and he 's going to kill you
' " the woman , later identified as @entity56 , apparently was making reference to the owner of the house , whom police have identified as @entity56 , and who has been charged in the case
@entity56 held on $ 8 million bond @entity65 then crossed the street with her child , 6 - year - old @entity67 , and went to the house of @entity70 , the neighbor @entity13 had been visiting , where she called 911
but @entity13 's job was not done
once police arrived and began talking with @entity65 , the girl , dressed only in diapers and a t - shirt , began screaming , he said
" i tried to control the girl , " he said
" i tried to calm her until her mother finished with the police
" police then entered the house at 2207 @entity83 and escorted out the other two women : @entity56 and @entity56
" they took @entity56 and @entity87 out covered up , " he said
" i did n't see their faces
" @entity13 said that he has visited his friend in the neighborhood nearly every day , but had never before seen anyone other than @entity56 at the house across the street
" he entered through the back , " he said
" no one ever saw anyone ( else ) enter or leave there
... there was never anything that would attract attention
" asked if he considers himself a hero , he allowed that , " i feel a little proud
" but , he added , " the important thing is that she is alive
" @entity13 's account was corroborated by @entity108 , who is also from the @entity29
@entity13 said he is unemployed , having recently been laid off from his job as a tree trimmer for a power company
another neighbor , @entity56 , has received the lion 's share of media attention for his role in freeing the group
but @entity56 showed up after @entity65 had already escaped , according to @entity13
suspect 's daughter : no monster in our blood there is no dispute that @entity56 also contacted police
" hey bro , " @entity56 told a 911 operator

... she said her name is @entity147 or some s -- t. i do n't know who the f -- k that is , i just moved over here , bro
you know what i mean ? " he then answers the 911 operator 's questions about @entity65 , what she looked like and what she was wearing
" are the people that she said did this , are they still in the house ? " the 911 operator asks
" i do n't have a f --- -- g clue , bro
like i said , i just came from @entity128 's
" the operator then asks him to check to see whether @entity65 needs an ambulance
she 's in a panic , bro

" " we 'll send the police out , " the operator responds .
