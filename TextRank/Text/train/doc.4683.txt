@entity0 , @entity1 -- parents danced with their young children to the infectious hip - hop beat of @entity6 on the main stage
the @entity9 ' @entity8 is immersed in the music at @entity11
twentysomethings wearing feathers in their hair jumped up and down to @entity16 emcee @entity15 in the @entity18 tent
in the portable toilets , an impromptu discussion broke out about the " awesomeness " of @entity9 singer @entity8 the mercury may have hovered close to 100 degrees , and somewhere outside the desert oasis of the @entity11 there was a global recession , but you 'd never know it from the carefree crowd on day 3 at the @entity29 in @entity0 , @entity1
although exact figures have yet to be released , about 50,000 revelers turned out for the final day of the 2009 festival for an eclectic lineup that included former jam front man @entity34 , rap pioneers @entity35 , a reunion of @entity39 indie darlings @entity40 and a nearly three - hour set from @entity41
promoters say the turnout exceeded expectations , and this year 's attendance figure might be the third largest in the festival 's 10 - year history
the three - day ticket price may have been steep -- roughly $ 300 , including service charges -- but when divided among the 131 acts on the bill , that breaks down to less than $ 2.50 per act
this was also the first year concert promoter @entity55 offered layaway , which is how 18 percent chose to pay
the strong showing is good news for @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and other festivals taking place this spring and summer
@entity11 was also moved up one weekend , which allowed for more kids on spring break to attend
although @entity11 is one of several music festivals in the @entity70 , it still carries a certain cachet that 's hard to match
perhaps it 's the scenery -- listening to music on a grassy polo field surrounded by swaying palm trees and craggy desert mountains
or maybe it 's the thrill of discovering new artists and rediscovering old ones standing shoulder - to - shoulder with friends , strangers and the random @entity84 celebrity
or maybe it 's the wacky moments that seem to happen only under the blistering desert sun. where else could you get @entity90 -- a well - known vegetarian -- complaining in the middle of his friday set that the smell of burning animals was making him sick , and that he only hoped it was human ? the @entity90 was referring to meat grilling in a food booth across the polo field
and when troubled @entity99 neo-soul singer @entity98 dropped out of her saturday performance because she could n't get a visa , @entity97 stepped into her slot on the main stage -- but she apparently was n't happy about the upgrade
despite a massive , adoring crowd and a highly charged set , the new mom exclaimed , " this is the main stage ? next time , i 'm back in a tent ! i prefer the sweat ! " this was after her tongue - in - cheek nod to @entity98 , where she sang , " they tried to make me do the @entity115 , i said , ' no , no , no. ' " then , there were the memorable music moments
friday headliner sir @entity118 did n't end his playful , hit - filled set until about 54 minutes past the midnight curfew -- for a potential fine of $ 54,000
( according to @entity126 , media relations officer for the @entity125 , the promoter agrees to pay $ 1,000 for every minute past 12 a.m. ) on saturday , @entity128 , @entity129 , indie pop band @entity127 drew an overflowing crowd to the @entity131 , charming the audience with its delicate , baroque harmonies
sunday headliners @entity41 played 31 songs from the group 's vast catalog -- concentrating heavily on early material , and for the most part , staying away from the biggest radio hits
they , too , played well past curfew -- continuing with their third encore even after the sound from the main @entity147 system was cut off
@entity40 -- whose four members reunited last year after a decade apart -- was also a crowd pleaser , although an interlude where they played a single chord at maximum decibels for a mind - numbing 15 minutes left fans scratching their heads
@entity157 is the only artist who 's performed at all 10 @entity11 festivals -- in @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , as his alter ego @entity157 and in other incarnations
this year , he dueted with @entity164 on the main stage , then headed over to the dance tent , where he joined his wife , @entity167 , for an electronic set
" i would probably silently be very depressed if they would n't invite me , to tell you the truth
my mental health depends on them , " he said with a laugh
despite a time of belt - tightening , festivalgoers are finding a way to let it all hang out
according to @entity180 , the local newspaper , even two former first daughters could n't resist the draw of the desert
it said @entity184 and @entity185 dropped into @entity11 on saturday -- complete with @entity186
@entity126 could n't confirm the report , but he did say , " i would n't be surprised if they did show up
dignitaries just kind of show up like everybody else
