@entity4 law currently allows those with a medicinal marijuana prescription to legally grow up to six plants or have up to one ounce , according to the affiliate
the proposal will not only open doors for recreational use , it provides more options for medicinal marijuana users with limited access , @entity17 told the affiliate
