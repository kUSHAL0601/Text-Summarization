veteran news producer and former @entity2 chief @entity0 will become the president of @entity4 in january , the network announced thursday
" @entity0 's experience as a news executive is unmatched for its breadth and success , " said @entity6 , chairman and ceo of @entity8 , @entity4 's parent company
" in a career that has seen significant professional success in both broadcast and cable , @entity0 has demonstrated his ability to run multiple lines of business and fiercely defend journalists and journalism
" @entity0 succeeds @entity22 , who has headed @entity4 since 2003
as president , @entity0 will oversee 23 branded news and information businesses , including @entity4 's @entity27 television network , @entity24 , @entity28 and @entity29
the latter includes @entity31 , one of the world 's leading news websites
" i am thrilled to join the distinguished team of journalists across the worldwide platforms of @entity4 , " @entity0 said in a statement
" the global reach and scale of the @entity4 brand is unparalleled in all of news
outside of my family and the @entity45 , there is nothing i am as passionate about as journalism
" his first challenge is likely to be turning around @entity4 / @entity27 television ratings , which have been declining in recent years
@entity0 , who had most recently produced @entity51 's new daytime talk show , had been widely rumored to be in line for the position
it 's been that kind of whirlwind life for @entity0 , who has had a rocket - like rise in the news and entertainment business
@entity0 , who was born and raised in the @entity61 area , started his professional career as a researcher for @entity2 's @entity65 operation in 1986
within three years he was a producer for the " today " show ; three years after that , in 1992 , he became its executive producer at age 26
he helped propel the morning show to the no. 1 position , which it consistently held through the rest of his tenure
in 2000 he was promoted to the head of @entity77 -- essentially the network 's programming chief -- and followed that with continued ascensions until becoming head of @entity2 in 2007 , overseeing the broadcast network including its news division and all its cable entities , such as @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87
@entity0 had his struggles during his latter years at @entity2 , with the broadcast network falling into fourth place in the ratings and a much - publicized controversy over late - night programming involving @entity94 and @entity95
nevertheless , his news judgment and leadership made the " today " show the most profitable show on television
@entity0 's portfolio will include all @entity4 networks and digital properties
the original 24 - hour news network , @entity4 has the greatest reach of any domestic news network
the @entity4 brand on television extends to 100 million households in the @entity27 and 265 million households abroad , with significant online and mobile reach and a global newsgathering network with 45 locations .
