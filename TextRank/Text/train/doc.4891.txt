hundreds of students and youth organizers were arrested outside the @entity2 sunday as they protested against the @entity3 under review by the @entity6 administration
some demonstrators zip - tied their hands to the @entity2 fence , and others acted out a " human oil spill , " lying on black tarps in front of the @entity2
nearly a thousand students began their march at @entity16 and proceeded to the outside of secretary of state @entity20 's @entity19 home , where they created a smaller human oil spill
marchers then headed to @entity24 for a rally
afterward , around a third of the crowd then peacefully moved to the @entity2 fence
participants said they hoped that a strong statement from younger voters would further pressure president @entity6 to reject the project
" ( this is ) a youth - organized action to tell president @entity6 to reject the @entity3 , " said @entity32 , who participated in @entity33 , the name of the rally
" because the youth vote was a crucial part in both of his elections , we know that we elected him and we voted for a climate champion , not another pipeline president
" the $ 5.3 billion pipeline , which would begin in northern @entity46 , @entity47 , would transport tar sands oil over 1,179 miles through @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 to connect with existing segments in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56
once completed , it would carry 830,000 barrels a day to @entity58 and @entity59 on the @entity60
proponents of the pipeline point to the thousands of potential jobs that could result from its construction
environmental groups oppose the pipeline because extracting and refining the tar sands oil emits 17 % more of the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change than conventional oil production
environmental advocates also say projects like the pipeline reinforce @entity77 dependence on fossil fuels rather than encourage green technologies
the project by @entity81 still needs federal approval because the pipeline would cross an international border
the @entity85 released an environmental report on the pipeline january 31
the public now has 90 - day period for public comment and consultation
@entity32 expressed considerable skepticism about the report
" the report that came out of the @entity85 is as dirty as the pipeline itself , " he said
" any suggestion that an 800,000 barrel a day oil sands pipeline will not contribute to climate change is incorrect
" @entity20 , who is known for his effort to combat climate change , will determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest and make a recommendation to @entity6
the final call rests with the president .
