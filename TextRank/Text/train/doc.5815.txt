defense secretary @entity0 is acknowledging he may have to consider recommendations to place ground forces in @entity3 to help forces there locate targets if , in fact , the chairman of the @entity8 makes that recommendation
but these would not be fighting forces , @entity11 said
" there will be no @entity16 combat troops in @entity3 or @entity17
" gen. @entity18 has suggested at least twice that a recommendation of ground troops could come , although he has emphasized he has not made that proposal yet
he has also said that he does n't " foresee a circumstance when it would be in our interest to take this fight on ourselves with a large military contingent
" the general landed in @entity3 on saturday to make a first - hand assessment of the situation
" if we get to any other variation of recommendations from @entity18 , we will deal with it , but we are not there yet , " @entity11 told @entity31 in an interview saturday at the end of a daylong seminar on national security strategy at the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38
@entity43 : no change of mind at the @entity47 summit in @entity48 , president @entity43 said that he had not changed his mind about @entity16 ground forces when it comes to @entity3
he still does not plan to deploy them , and @entity18 " has not advised me that i should be sending @entity16 troops to fight , " he said
but the president did not rule it out completely , if confronted with the most dire of dangers
" there are always circumstances , in which the @entity16 might need to deploy ground troops , " @entity43 said
" if we discovered that @entity62 had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon , and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands , then yes , you can anticipate that not only would chairman @entity18 recommend me sending @entity16 ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands , but i would order it
" @entity43 critics @entity11 declined to answer whether any of the top leadership of the @entity74 have been killed by @entity16 airstrikes in @entity17 , but said the group still poses a serious threat
" we know they are planning and plotting attacks against our interests , @entity81 specifically
so , yes , that is why we target them
" @entity11 was joined in the seminar by @entity86 sen. @entity85 from @entity87 , former defense secretaries @entity88 and @entity90 , as well as homeland security secretary @entity91
the issue of whether the @entity93 and the @entity94 have a sufficient strategy to deal with @entity62 dominated much of several panel discussions
in blistering criticism of president @entity43 and the @entity94 , @entity85 said , " no one outside the @entity8 believes we have a strategy " to defeat and degrade @entity62 , as set forth by the administration
@entity88 and @entity90 have recently written books which have criticized @entity43
in his remarks , @entity90 likened @entity43 to president @entity104 in what he called " micromanagement " of military policy and targeting during the @entity108
@entity91 said " uppermost " in his mind is that a lone wolf attack inspired by @entity62 could strike the @entity16 at a moment 's notice
