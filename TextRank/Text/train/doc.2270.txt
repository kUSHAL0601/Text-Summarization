-- the news of @entity4 prime minister @entity3 's resignation spurred fierce weekend clashes in his hometown , the coastal city of @entity8
residents lobbed rockets and fired bullets at one another saturday , leaving at least three people wounded , state news agency @entity14 reported
the city is home to both @entity17 and @entity18 , and sectarian tensions have worsened in recent months as the civil war in neighboring @entity22 rages on
the @entity17 support @entity22 president @entity23
the @entity18 want his ouster
the @entity4 government has remained officially neutral in the conflict -- even as it has firmly , but quietly , supported @entity23
and @entity3 , while a @entity18 , led that effort
his departure , therefore , comes at a sensitive time for @entity4
analysts say the longer the @entity22 conflict rages , the more destabilized @entity4 will become
deadlock prompts resignation @entity3 announced the resignation of his government friday after he said he could not negotiate a breakthrough on two fronts : -- preparations for the country 's june parliamentary elections -- extending the term of the head of @entity4 's internal security forces
the group to blame in both cases is @entity46 , a powerful @entity47 political party that has links with the @entity23 government and dominates @entity4 's government
in the case of election preparations , lawmakers have been unable to come to an agreement on an election law
in the second instance , @entity46 distrusts maj. gen. @entity57 , the security forces head
@entity57 , like @entity3 , is a @entity18
" the prime minister can not work in such conditions
he needs to respect the constitution , " his spokesman , @entity62 , said
complicated politics politics in @entity4 is complicated as it constantly struggles to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects
by law , the prime minister must be a @entity71 , the parliamentary speaker a @entity47 , and the president a @entity74
@entity3 became prime minister two years ago , after @entity46 brought down the previous unity government
since then , he has maintained a balance between pro- and anti-al - @entity23 factions
his government , says @entity80 expert @entity79 , was more interested in keeping @entity4 from getting dragged into the conflict
but in recent months , he has been at odds with @entity46
and the latest issues brought the tension to the surface
the @entity22 connection the major concern for @entity4 is that @entity22 's troubles will reopen the wounds of @entity4 's 15 - year - long civil war , which ended in 1990
aside from its southern border with @entity93 , @entity4 is entirely surrounded by @entity22 , and was considered part of " greater @entity22 " until the end of @entity96 it became an independent country in 1943 but has been strongly influenced by @entity22 both politically and militarily for much of the time since
@entity22 troops were deployed in @entity4 between 1976 and 2005 , primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop @entity4 's long civil war -- but maintained a significant presence long after the fighting stopped in 1990
this all changed in 2005 after former prime minister @entity105 was killed by a car bomb in @entity107
anti-al - @entity23 elements in @entity4 accused the @entity22 government of being behind the attack , and popular protests -- along with international pressure -- forced the @entity22 military to withdraw from the country
since then , @entity4 's two most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided in their attitude toward @entity22 : the ruling pro-syria alliance led by @entity3 and a group of @entity120 factions led by @entity121 , son of the assassinated former prime minister
in addition , thousands of refugees have poured into @entity4 since the conflict in @entity22 began
costly uncertainty in this climate , any instability in @entity4 politics can only exacerbate the spillover from the @entity22 war
" now it is important for dialogue to begin for a salvation government to be established during this difficult period , " @entity3 tweeted after submitting his resignation
@entity138 secretary general ban ki - moon also called on cooler heads to prevail
" at this challenging time for the region , the secretary - general calls on all the parties in @entity4 to remain united behind the leadership of president ( @entity148 ) @entity147 , " a statement from his office said
@entity0 's @entity149 contributed to this report .
