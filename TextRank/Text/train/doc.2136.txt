on a holiday marking the birth of a nation of immigrants , protesters and counterprotesters began a new round of angry demonstrations friday in a @entity9 town that was scheduled to receive new busloads of migrants arrested for entering the country illegally
the small @entity9 city of @entity14 , named after a @entity15 whose family set up a sheep ranch there in 1873 , is now a national flashpoint in the @entity21 immigration crisis : protesters are denouncing the federal transfer of detained migrants to their town for processing at a local @entity27 office
demonstrators successfully blockaded busloads from entering the town earlier this week
a second convoy of federal buses carrying migrants to a @entity21 @entity27 station in @entity14 was expected friday , and @entity14 resident @entity35 joined protesters to express his outrage about illegal border crossings
a surge of undocumented @entity41 immigrants has created a federal crisis , and some of them are supposed to be processed in @entity14
" there 's a right way and a wrong way to come into this country
if you are going to come in the wrong way , we 're not going to stand for it
that 's just how it is , " @entity35 said
" there ( are ) thousands and millions of other people who 've done it the right way
but for people to just come in here and ask for a free handout , that 's my money
" @entity62 of @entity63 defended the immigrants ' rights to due process -- and noted how the @entity21 was built by immigrants
" it 's not a us versus we situation
it 's everybody together , " said @entity62 , who described herself as an undocumented student
police arrested at least one protester friday morning
no further details were immediately available
exchange of hard words the protests have been emotionally charged , with racial slurs uttered against @entity85 defending the rights of the arrested immigrants , some of whom may be refugees , the immigration rights advocates say
but on @entity89 , protesters held placards saying , " it 's not about race
" others said , " no human is illegal , " and " no white supremacy
" police secured the road so the entry to the @entity27 office was clear , though a smaller group of protesters found a way to camp on the side of the road
a quarter of a mile away , a yellow police line held back the larger demonstration of dozens of protesters , and by friday afternoon , police put up a second yellow tape and stood between the two factions of demonstrators to stop their pushing and shoving
protesters chanted , " @entity21 ! @entity21 ! " counterprotesters chanted , " @entity116 , " which translates as " the ( @entity118 ) race united will never be defeated
" apparently supporting them , men and women in @entity122 costumes trimmed with feathers danced to a drumbeat
police warned participants not to fight
some of them suffered heat exposure in the 100 - degree sunshine and found relief under a tent
" we do n't want anyone to get hurt
there 's children here , " a police officer told protesters
both sides waved @entity21 flags , but one demonstrator held a shredded @entity21 flag , angering an adversary who yelled : " absolute disgrace ! " @entity145 @entity144 did n't mind spending the @entity89 in a protest that was hot by any standard
" it 's @entity89 -- for whom and why , " @entity144 said
" this is a refugee crisis that we 're dealing with ...
if these people were from say , @entity155 , trying to get here from the violence that ruptured the @entity155 , maybe these people would be for that
" @entity14 's concerns and compassion residents object to how @entity21 agents may " dump " the @entity41 immigrants into their community once their processing is completed , a practice that was true in the past , said @entity14 mayor @entity167
both sides of the protest , he said , seek a legal , efficient process for the overflow of arrested migrants
" we 're sending people in inhumane conditions and dispersing them across the nation , " @entity167 said
on tuesday , the federal government began busing 140 migrants for processing in @entity14 every 72 hours , raising concerns about operational capacity , @entity167 said
the initial federal plan called for 500 people , which was lowered to 300 , but the city strongly opposed those plans
" the concern we have is the sustainability of 140 every 72 hours , " @entity167 said
" we do n't see this stopping any time soon
" @entity167 said earlier this week that his city " continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local @entity27 office
" a subsequent protest in agreement became raucous tuesday ; a counterprotester was spat upon
@entity167 described portions of that protest as " unfortunate " and " deplorable
" the city had offered @entity21 officials a mobile health clinic to help them provide health screenings and inoculations for the migrants , but the federal approval process would have been too long
" the world has never been able to see how compassionate our community is because we never got there , " @entity167 said
the first protest federal officials were n't disclosing arrival times friday for the immigrants or even the cities receiving them , citing safety concerns in light of tuesday 's protests in @entity14
the town became a battleground over immigration that day as angry crowds chanted , " go back home , " and forced buses carrying immigrants to turn around
counterprotesters squared off with demonstrators , leading to a shouting match over the nation 's immigration system
as chaos ensued , federal officials rerouted the 140 undocumented immigrants to @entity21 processing centers at least 80 miles away , in the @entity237 and @entity238 areas
a tide of @entity41 illegally entering the @entity21 has overwhelmed a system already buckling under the weight of the nation 's 11 million undocumented immigrants
unlike undocumented @entity245 migrants , who are often immediately deported , the @entity21 detains and processes @entity41 , who are eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices
protests and tension many never show up and join the undocumented population , according to the @entity254 , the union representing @entity27 agents
the immigrants rejected by @entity14 protesters were initially held in @entity257 , where @entity21 facilities are overflowing , forcing detainees to be sent to other states for processing
the government does n't have the room to shelter the children with adults : there 's only one family immigration detention center , in @entity268
to assist the unaccompanied children , the @entity270 administration opened shelters last month on three military bases because federal facilities more designed for adults were overrun with minors
tuesday 's busloads did n't include any unaccompanied minors , said @entity14 police chief @entity278
the children on the buses were apparently in the company of relatives or other adults , said an official with the @entity254
immigration rights advocates denounced the protesters
" it is deplorable that people espousing anti-immigrant hate language created unnecessary tension and fear for immigrant mothers and their children , " said @entity288 , a community representative of the @entity289
" even more concerning is that elected officials in the city of @entity14 instigated this tension
mothers and their children on these buses have suffered through enough trauma
" journey from @entity257 the @entity21 government earlier flew the 140 @entity41 immigrants from south @entity257 to @entity237
federal agents were busing them to @entity14 for processing at the @entity27 station when the standoff took place tuesday
after the buses turned around , the immigrants were taken to a @entity21 @entity27 station in @entity237 , said @entity312 of the @entity254
the @entity21 is struggling to accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants , particularly a wave of unaccompanied children from @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319
the @entity21 government does n't have enough beds , food or sanitary facilities
authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children will cross the border without parents this year in what the @entity327 has called an " immediate humanitarian crisis
