take a moment and think of an @entity3 author
have you got the name in mind ? keep it there for a minute
in years gone by , chances are cultural icons like @entity13 literary giant @entity11 or @entity3 @entity15 laureate @entity14 might have popped straight into your head
but lately new names from across the continent are becoming part of popular literary consciousness
" @entity24 , " " @entity25 " and more recently " @entity26 " have brought international acclaim for @entity13 author du jour , @entity23
she joins a growing list of popular @entity3 authors -- including @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 -- who have been steadily picking up steam -- and fans -- across the globe over the last several years
' democratization of culture ' but where has this new wave of @entity3 writers come from ? for @entity45 , an award - winning blogger specializing in @entity3 culture and the diaspora , they were always there -- the rest of the world just did n't know how to find them
" the world is far more interconnected thanks to technology and social media , " @entity45 told @entity0
" it 's an exciting time ... people are checking out alternative literature and @entity60 -- in its position as a kind of underdog -- provides that perfect place to go and seek alternative voices that help people make sense of the world
" it 's kind of democratization of culture so people can not ignore voices coming from other parts of the world , " added @entity45 , also known by her digital moniker @entity70
" and when something is good , it obviously catches people 's attention
before it would not have reached any mainstream ; now it is , thanks to bloggers and local content production
" read this : ' humans of @entity91 ' photo series true , indigenous content producers and independent publishers have slowly developed in recent years all across the continent
in @entity96 and beyond , enthusiastic readers can pick up a copy of @entity98 , a pan-african gazzette by @entity100 that 's successfully putting a spotlight on an eclectic mix of writers , photographers and illustrators from the continent
concurrently in @entity108 , there is the @entity109 , a @entity110 - based organization that works to promote up - and - coming local writers through its publication , @entity113 ?
more and more , stories are resonating with readers because they reveal the day - to - day issues faced by locals , according to the journal 's managing editor , @entity118
" just think about stories off the page , or off the book , when you think about how stories organically take place , " he explained
" these are stories with a kind of narrative that people tell each other in public spaces , like churches , bars , on the street
all these stories are really locally grounded and are actually kind of written in the immediate concerns of what 's happening about
" celebrating @entity3 writers but it 's not just literary collectives that are driving interest towards contemporary authors
many in the publishing industry cite the numerous international awards , which now frequently acknowledge and celebrate @entity3 writers -- for helping develop the surge in popularity for authors
one such annual event is the long - running @entity152 which aims to " promote the best in new @entity3 literature , to identify and champion the most talented writers on the continent , " according to the award 's director , @entity157
" new writers are emerging all the time , " she said
[ writers ' ] collectives like @entity163 are starting up and publishing online ; publishers are branching into new areas -- romance , sci - fi , crime fiction and literary fiction is thriving
" new voices , new genres take for instance @entity108 writer @entity172 , the recipient of this year 's @entity152
speaking at @entity174 's @entity173 last month at the " @entity177 " book festival attended by all five shortlisted contenders , @entity172 was among those calling for a more assorted literature output
" i do n't know what ' @entity180 ' means , " she said , " but i think there are many ways of thinking about it
i would hope for it to diversify -- i 'd like to read more science fiction , multiculturalism
" @entity189 writer @entity188 , a contender for this year 's prize , agreed
" i would hope for more diverse literature -- by this i 'm saying a lot more stuff in different genres , " he explains
" there 's the pulpy , entertaining stuff that goes to the masses but at the moment , we have a situation in which you do a story and someone says : ' what does this tell you about @entity60 ? ' which is problematic
" for @entity208 writer @entity207 , also shortlisted nominee , just talking about @entity3 literature is " a bit of an absurd idea
" she explained : " you could say @entity215 literature is like talking from @entity216 all the way to the @entity218 -- no one really does that and it 's a bit tricky with @entity3 literature
it 's 54 countries and so you know , there 's so much scope and range of voices
" meanwhile , @entity118 , also shortlisted for this year 's @entity152 , said that this desire for different styles and genres was already on its way -- and growing
" a lot of people now are very interested in afro - futurism , " he said
" a lot of sci - fi , a lot of fantasy , a lot of erotica , and then a lot of cross genre -- a kind of cross pollination of genre , " added @entity118
" you will also see [ more ] forms -- you will see some straying to visual storytelling online that attempts to do what a book does
" @entity157 said that this new generation of writers is helping to change perceptions about the continent
" @entity60 are now telling their own stories , and this side of @entity60 is opening the eyes of international readers who are seeing the continent in different lights as a consequence , " she said
" not just as a place of war , disaster , genocide and famine , but one of hope , beauty , romance , tragedy , poverty , laughter , struggle , and upliftment
