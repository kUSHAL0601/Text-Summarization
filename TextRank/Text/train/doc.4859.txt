-- a little boy named @entity2 , adopted from @entity3 several years ago as a toddler , celebrated @entity5 this year with his family in my home state of @entity9
across the ocean , his little brother @entity10 , 5 , did n't even know it was @entity5
he simply woke up and lived yet another day of his life in a state orphanage , dreaming of his brother and the parents he met last year , knowing that they are waiting for him in a home somewhere far away
@entity2 's parents found out about @entity10 too late to adopt the two brothers together
but as soon as they learned about @entity10 , they knew they would adopt him , too
they were still in the midst of a drawn - out , three - year process to adopt @entity10 when on december 28 , @entity3 president @entity25 signed into law a ban on all @entity29 adoptions of @entity3 orphans
the news of the ban devastated hundreds of children and families like @entity2 and @entity10 's
dozens of families were only days or weeks away from flying to @entity3 for the final court date that would have allowed them to bring their child home
many of these families have shown me pictures of these children they already love so much
these are children who have known only the life of an orphanage since birth and whose disabilities make it unlikely that @entity3 families will adopt them
these orphans now sit and wait , clinging to photos of their @entity29 parents , asking when their mama and papa will come for them
according to the @entity58 , 740,000 children live in @entity3 without parental care
the @entity3 @entity60 estimates that 110,000 of these children live in state orphanages
in contrast , only 7,400 domestic adoptions took place in @entity3 in 2011 , with an additional 3,400 adoptions of @entity3 children by families from abroad
for an orphan , there is no substitute for a family
not even the best orphanage can provide a child what a loving mother and father can
staff , not parents , run orphanages
and despite any government 's best intentions , hunger , neglect , extreme heat and cold and other forms of deprivation are common features of institutional life
but even more crushing is the lack of security , connection and deep emotional bonds that can grow only within a family
children who grow up in orphanages tell stories of never having heard the words " i love you " and never receiving a single spontaneous hug throughout their childhood
a government can pay someone to wash and feed children , but it can not pay someone to love them
children with disabilities face an even bleaker fate
for a host of reasons , children with disabilities are rarely if ever adopted in @entity3 and elsewhere
because of the harsh realities of institutional life -- limited staff ; scant resources for food , utilities and other needs ; little to no medical care -- a large percentage of orphans with disabilities do not even survive childhood
this means that for children with @entity129 , cerebral palsy , blindness , deafness or other disabilities , being adopted by an @entity29 family may be the only chance they will have not only to receive specialized therapy and life - saving medical care but to know the unconditional love , acceptance and joy of being a cherished member of something special called family
it is these orphaned children -- the weakest of the most vulnerable -- whom the @entity3 adoption ban has punished
in june , i traveled to @entity3 with a bipartisan congressional delegation , taking part in meetings related to national security in the wake of the @entity154 bombings
we also made it a point to reiterate our profound hope that the @entity3 government will reconsider the adoption ban , and at the very least , allow for the completion of the cases for the children and families who were near the end of the adoption process
i emphasized in these meetings our desire to provide whatever post-placement reports and information might be necessary to provide the @entity3 government their desired assurances of the well - being of adopted children
i 've also introduced a bipartisan resolution emphasizing much of the above , and most importantly calling on @entity3 to remember that every child deserves to be in a loving , protective and permanent family
i am confident that @entity177 leadership will move this legislation forward and that president @entity179 and secretary of state @entity180 will proactively reaffirm our commitment to building a better future for every child in desperate need of a family
even in the complicated tides of modern political life , the weakest and most vulnerable members of society must never be forgotten or cast aside
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .
