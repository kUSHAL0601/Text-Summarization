-- while we do n't yet know the full scope of damages inflicted by superstorm @entity5 , it is clear recovery costs in the @entity9 region will be in the billions of dollars
according to @entity11 secretary @entity10 , recovery after @entity5 will be " if not the most extensive and expensive , one of the most in our nation 's history
" but despite the staggering losses , the region has everything going for it to recover quickly
disasters happen all over the world , but their impacts vary greatly , driven by the interplay between the natural environment , economic and social forces , and institutions in each country
the 2010 @entity27 earthquake was devastating , killing more than 300,000 people
@entity27 is the poorest nation in the @entity29 ; resources for construction are limited and building codes absent
recovery has been extremely slow : six months after the quake , about 98 % of the debris remained , making much of capital city @entity36 impassable
even two years later , up to 500,000 people were still homeless
compared with the death toll of 300,000 in @entity27 , the 1995 earthquake of nearly equal magnitude in @entity41 , @entity42 , killed just 6,434 people
the recovery in this highly developed city was incredibly fast
many experts in @entity42 predicted that it might take up to 10 years for @entity41 to rebuild and for its economy to fully recover
to the surprise of many , in less than 15 months , manufacturing in greater @entity41 was 98 % of its pre-earthquake trend
the rubble had been removed within just two years of the quake
while wealth is critical in protecting life and capital , other factors are also important : well - developed insurance markets , trade openness that speeds the flow of emergency resources , and effective management in preparing and responding to disasters are also critical
the government must be effective in allocating resources and conducting recovery operations
research shows that countries with greater local government autonomy are far more effective at protecting people in natural disasters than more centralized government systems because local authorities more familiar with local needs can respond quickly and effectively
@entity76 , who studied the @entity41 earthquake , says human capability and the country 's cultural attributes are the most essential elements to quick recovery ; while individuals ' skills are very important , the relationships between people and the ability to work together are essential to community recovery and resiliency
@entity76 says : " destroy any amount of physical capital , but leave behind a critical number of knowledgeable human beings whose brains still house the culture and technology of a dynamic economy , and the physical capital will tend to re-emerge almost spontaneously
" capital accumulation is especially easy the second time around because the primary goal is to duplicate an investment pattern , not design it from scratch
. @entity103 , in which the bomb took a much larger fraction of both human and physical capital , was a bustling commercial metropolis just five years later
the @entity110 city of @entity111 , reduced to rubble in @entity113 , did not even bother to remove the debris for some years
instead , it moved major sections of the city and was booming again in the early 1950s
" although @entity103 lost many people , those who remained still possessed the essential elements needed to stage a recovery
of course , the economy suffers in the periods immediately after a disaster
in the @entity9 region , flood damages , limited transportation and power outages will continue to hold down productivity
but as money from insurance , savings and government begins to flow into the region , economic activity will rebound
this is not to say people will necessarily be better off , but they could be in time
despite the damages and destruction , there may yet be a silver lining
when building and infrastructure are destroyed , superior materials and technology are often used in reconstruction
this can improve productivity in the long run
people who live in disaster - prone regions tend to invest more in education , an important driver of economic growth
disasters also motivate people who might not normally interact with one another to work together to resolve challenges
recent research shows how societal trust increases after disasters
after @entity164 , city leaders in @entity162 who had disagreed on how to fix the troubled @entity162 school system came together and agreed to replace it with a new structure
two - thirds of city schools in 2004 were rated " academically unacceptable " by the state
by 2010 , only 4 in 10 were rated that way , and the percentage of students attending a low - performing school had been cut in half
the @entity9 region has as all the essential elements required for a quick recovery : one of the most highly educated populations in the world , relatively nimble and autonomous state and local governments , highly developed insurance markets , and excellent infrastructure and trade @entity184 to speed the inflow of resources
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191
