@entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 officials are set to sit down together in @entity0 on friday to discuss immigration and other issues , according to a @entity8 spokesman
" the @entity3 views the migration talks as an important opportunity for both the @entity3 and @entity4 governments to discuss policies and procedures that promote safe , legal , and orderly migration , " @entity8 spokesman @entity9 told @entity1 sunday
relations between @entity0 and @entity17 have deteriorated in recent months , in part because of @entity4 's detention of @entity3 contractor @entity20 , who has been held in @entity4 prison since december
the two countries have not formally held immigration talks since february and next week provides another chance for the @entity3 to call for his release
" the @entity3 is focused on the welfare of @entity20 and we believe he should be released and permitted to return to his family , " @entity9 said
" this is a matter we have raised on multiple occasions with the @entity4 government and that we will continue to raise with them
" in recent weeks , the @entity3 did have discussions with @entity4 about the @entity38 oil disaster
and earlier , the two countries talked about earthquake assistance to @entity40
" we intend to review trends in illegal @entity4 migration to the @entity3 , and to improve operational relations with @entity4 on migration issues , " @entity9 said about the agenda for friday
" other matters of mutual concern may arise in our meetings , but the main purpose is to discuss migration issues
