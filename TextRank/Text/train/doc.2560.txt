-- @entity2 lt. gov. @entity1 is expected to " categorically deny " allegations monday that she gave @entity5 's mayor an ultimatum regarding @entity8 recovery aid
@entity1 's denial flies in the face of claims made by @entity5 mayor @entity12 , who said sunday that @entity1 told her to support a redevelopment project backed by @entity14 or lose @entity8 recovery funds
@entity12 also connected @entity14 to the threat , saying that @entity1 told her the message was coming directly from @entity14
appearing on @entity0 's " @entity18 , " @entity12 said , " she said that to me -- is that this is a direct message from the governor , " @entity12 said , referring to lt. gov. @entity1 , who @entity12 said approached her in a parking lot in may to deliver the message
@entity5 mayor : ' it 's true ' @entity14 administration withheld @entity8 funds the alleged incident happened last may after @entity1 toured a grocery store that had reopened after suffering $ 10 million in flooding damage from @entity8
the lieutenant governor recalls having a conversation with @entity12 that day , but says she remembers @entity12 arguing that @entity8 recovery aid and redevelopment were the same issue , according to the source close to @entity1 , who was not authorized to speak publicly
" @entity1 remembers in their conversation that she was talking about redevelopment and making investments in @entity5
she remembers @entity12 pressing @entity1 for money for @entity8
@entity1 remembers saying you ca n't tie the two together , " the source said
" and she remembers @entity12 continuing to press and showing her a map of the city and pressing for aid for @entity8
" catching up with the @entity14 scandal @entity1 remembers it as a " friendly conversation , " the source said
" @entity12 was laser - focused on getting @entity5 money for @entity8 recovery and that is not the role @entity1 plays in the administration , " the source said
she remembers telling @entity53 that the administration would like to do more to redevelop @entity5 , but she does n't recall talking to her specifically about the @entity55 project
but the source said @entity1 , a veteran prosecutor and former county sheriff , is still going through her records , preparing for a possible subpoena
in remarks monday morning -- at a volunteer event in @entity61 , @entity2 honoring the @entity63 national day of service -- @entity64 is expected to make the point that , " my job in the governor 's office is to oversee redevelopment and reinvestment in @entity2 , " the source said
in fact , a governor 's directive prevents @entity64 from working on the @entity8 recovery efforts because she was personally affected by the superstorm -- her home in @entity77 was damaged by the storm , the source said
she was at the @entity5 grocery store in her role as an advocate for the state 's business community
" @entity1 ca n't talk about @entity8 , " the source said
" she ca n't do it
" and @entity64 twice returned to @entity5 after that may visit -- once spending more than two hours touring farmers ' markets with @entity12 -- and the @entity5 mayor never brought up the may conversation or indicated that it had upset her , the source said
@entity12 's comments saturday and sunday are a change from what she told @entity0 on january 11
she said then that while she wondered whether @entity8 aid funds were being withheld because she did n't endorse the governor 's re-election , she concluded that " i do n't think that 's the case
" " i do n't think it was retaliation and i do n't have any reason to think it 's retaliation , but i 'm not satisfied with the amount of money i 've gotten so far , " @entity12 told @entity0 then
she did not mention her concerns about the redevelopment project
@entity0 " s @entity104 contributed to this report
