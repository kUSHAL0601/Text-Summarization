-- regardless of whether or not you 're religious , you ca n't help but feel a sense of awe when coming face to face with the grand statues that devout throughout the ages have built in honor of their deities
and these monuments just keep getting bigger
the @entity11 government recently unveiled the world 's largest trident -- a religious statue depicting @entity15 -- at a @entity16 in @entity17
the trident is made from five different minerals , weighs more than six tons and stands 12 meters ( 42 feet ) tall

@entity28 ( @entity29 , @entity30 ) this statue , measuring 42 meters ( 137 feet ) in height , is said to be the world 's tallest depiction of a @entity23 deity
fifteen skilled sculptors from @entity37 carried out construction on the @entity28 , found outside @entity30 's famed @entity39
the statue took three years to complete and the finished product -- made up of 250 tons of steel , 1,550 cubic meters of concrete and 300 liters of gold paint -- was unveiled during the annual @entity45 in 2006
incidentally , it 's just meters away from what must rank as one of the world 's strangest statues -- a five - legged bull

a local @entity106 monk called @entity119 believed that the presence of a stone @entity79 would calm the rivers it overlooked
@entity123 ran out and @entity119 killed himself in despair , but when a local governor decided to undertake completion of the project , @entity119 's wish came true -- though not quite in the way he intended
during construction , so much rock was removed from the cliff face and deposited in the river below that the water became shallower and easier to navigate
