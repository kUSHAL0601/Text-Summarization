-- goals from @entity2 and @entity3 gave hosts @entity5 a welcome boost as they moved top of @entity8 with a 2 - 0 victory over @entity10 on thursday
in the opening match @entity5 threw away a 4 - 0 lead to eventually draw with @entity13 , but home fans were able to celebrate second - time round as they clinched a comfortable two - goal win in @entity16
@entity5 , who played under the gaze of president @entity19 , began the game brightly and almost took the lead in the opening minutes when @entity2 volleyed @entity3 's cross only for @entity10 keeper @entity23 to smother the ball
the team known as the " @entity26 " continued to dominate the half and went close again in the 33rd minute when @entity28 teed up @entity2 but @entity23 was equal to his powerful shot
@entity5 's attacking approach was maintained after the half - time interval and they broke the deadlock three minutes into the half through @entity3
the energetic @entity28 broke down the left flank before he whipped a dangerous cross into the penalty area which was met by the head of @entity3 who directed the ball past @entity23
former @entity39 striker @entity2 doubled the advantage in the 54th minute when he held off a strong challenge from @entity10 captain @entity42 and produced a neat close - range finish
@entity5 coach @entity44 was forced to withdraw @entity3 through injury on the hour mark but it was the only sour note in what was morale - boosting win for the hosts
the tournament , which has continued despite the withdrawal of @entity53 after a deadly machine - gun attack , continued with @entity55 clashing with @entity13
defender @entity56 scored the only goal of the game as the @entity55 registered their first victory of the tournament with a 1 - 0 win over in @entity61
@entity13 were unable to match the heroics of their first match as they went down to a disciplined @entity55 side
the @entity66 had the early pressure and @entity69 's second - minute free - kick caused problems in the @entity72 defence but @entity73 was unable to find a teammate with his pull - back after beating @entity55 keeper @entity76 to the loose ball
however , @entity55 -- known as the @entity55 -- dominated the remainder of the half and went close moments later when @entity82 's swerving , dipping cross almost caught out @entity84 in the @entity13 goal as it struck the top of the crossbar
@entity89 's side continued to press and were rewarded with the opening goal of the game in the 43rd minute when @entity92 brought down @entity93 in a dangerous position
@entity82 delivered another dangerous ball into the penalty area and @entity56 was able to evade the @entity13 defenders and head the ball past @entity84
@entity100 's side began the second half with renewed purpose and @entity13 's @entity103 forced a fingertip save from @entity105 from a narrow angle shortly after the half - time break
but it was a rare chance as @entity56 and @entity109 marshalled the @entity55 defence superbly , despite the introduction of @entity113 striker @entity112 for @entity13 , to hold on for the win .
