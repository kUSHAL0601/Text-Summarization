-- a leading @entity3 - @entity2 civil rights group is advocating intense grassroots engagement among police and @entity2 @entity3 neighborhood leaders to thwart the emergence of homegrown @entity9 terrorists
a report , issued friday by the @entity13 , reflects the shock among @entity15 over the @entity17 massacre , the arrests of five @entity2 @entity3 in @entity11 suspected of plotting terrorist attacks , and the arrests of eight @entity21 - @entity2 men on charges related to what prosecutors said were efforts to recruit youths to fight for a @entity21 guerrilla movement
titled " @entity28 to strengthen @entity2 : forging an @entity35 between @entity15 and @entity36 , " the paper stresses a division of labor and a collaboration between police and community groups
police should fight crime , including terrorism , and neighborhood leaders should deal with the causes of radicalization , it says
at the same time , both need to work hand in glove , the paper said
" we will capture the narrative from those who seek to misguide the young people , " said @entity48 , the head of the council 's @entity51 office
he was speaking friday at a news conference in @entity51 that introduced the 32 - page paper
" one incident of violent extremism is one too many , " said @entity58 , the author of the report and the group 's government liaison
" our community needs to develop more sophistication in dealing with this challenge
" @entity58 , who also spoke at the news conference , said there needs to be a greater emphasis on community policing , an idea that calls for closer ties between neighborhood residents and cops on the beat
developing closer relations with local @entity3 would help police tap " unique cultural and linguistic " skills that can spot and head off trouble
the study said police must surmount community distrust , which it says is common and calls " an automatic barrier to police community outreach
" " unfortunately , in the current political climate , the actions of certain law enforcement agencies -- whether spying on peaceful activist groups and houses of worship without reasonable suspicion , or religious profiling -- have added to difficulties , " the report said
such a " heightened sense of fear and grievances also creates a greater pool of alienated people terrorists can tap into for recruitment , " @entity95 's report said
@entity48 and @entity95 said concern about radicalism in the @entity3 community is n't new : books have been published about the subject , and imams at mosques have raised the issue for many years
speaking at the news conference , @entity48 said that @entity3 leaders need to " think outside the box " and engage young people in cyberspace , on social networking sites and in other social circles where they are coming together
and both men said that all @entity3 groups need to work together to help confront problems like the emergence of radical thought and identify sources of discontent
@entity58 said the @entity2 @entity3 community can learn from the experience of the @entity127 @entity3 community
while there was initial surprise that local @entity3 were involved in the july 7 , 2005 , @entity131 bombings , @entity3 there later realized that militant leaders were tapping into the problems caused by youthful alienation and social issues such as racism , drug use and premarital sex
@entity58 cites a study that says many militants had been secular before they embraced radical @entity9 , but they typically lacked mainstream religious knowledge
he said making communities " religiously literate " would help fight radicalism
" @entity3 communities must do their part to reach out and continue to assist law enforcement to bring real terrorist perpetrators to justice , " @entity58 wrote in the report
" the role @entity3 communities should play is in counterradicalization efforts through better religious education , social programs and long - term constructive political engagement
