@entity0 -- @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , their 1980s - style hair shoved under their caps , look forever young in a substantial baseball card collection that 's missing an owner
since june 24 , the @entity11 has been trying to find the rightful owner of well more than 500 cards , each carefully placed in a plastic protective sleeve
a visitor to @entity17 found the cache of cards in a grassy area and notified police , who combed through crime reports but have thus far struck out on identifying the owner
" we do n't know if it fell off the back of a car , " lt. @entity25 said wednesday , indicating it 's his guess that they were stolen
police publicized the find wednesday and included photos of some of the collection
they are n't releasing all the information because they want to be sure whoever comes forward can provide extensive details before they turn them over
the @entity43 and @entity44 cards are of @entity46 players from the 1980s and 1990s
players include @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49
@entity25 wo n't hazard a guess on their value , but he indicated some might be worth about $ 1
of course , a few could be worth more
if no one successfully claims them , the cards may be auctioned and serious collectors would get a better handle on their worth
" so much depends on condition , " @entity25 told @entity1
the department spokesman said he 's not an avid baseball fan
after all , he grew up in @entity0 , which twice lost the @entity62 to other cities and whose @entity64 have been dependable cellar - dwellers
he is friends with @entity69 fans and has at least one connection with one of the finds
" that @entity75 card is pretty cool , " @entity25 said , referring to the outfielder who starred for the @entity69 in the ' 70s
anyone with information or believes the set is theirs can contact the department 's @entity80 at ( 202 ) 727 - 4383 between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. et monday through friday
@entity1 's @entity82 contributed to this report .
