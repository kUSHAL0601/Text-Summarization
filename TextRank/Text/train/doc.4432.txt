-- opposition to the @entity2 , which would move crude oil from the @entity5 oil sands in @entity6 to refineries on the @entity8 if approved by president @entity9 , has long relied on questionable information about our project and the @entity6 oil sands
a @entity0 op - ed by @entity15 has made some claims that need to be disputed
he and other opponents insist oil transported by @entity2 is destined for export
nothing could be further from the truth
the reality , as @entity24 ceo @entity23 has said , is not a drop of the oil transported through @entity2 would be exported -- period
when he was asked at a news conference whether @entity2 oil would be exported , @entity23 said : " not a chance
i have talked to every one of our customers , both producers and refiners , i 've asked them the question again : ' do you have any intent of shipping any of this crude oil offshore ? ' and the answer is absolutely not
" opponents also say the pipeline is not safe for the environment , but the undeniable reality is the science demonstrating @entity2 is a safe and environmentally responsible project
the @entity47 's final supplemental environmental impact statement is a culmination of more than five years and contains 20,000 pages of analysis , with input from more than two dozen state and federal agencies
the environmental and market issues have been exhaustively reviewed and concerns debunked
the impact statement explicitly states that building @entity2 is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands based on expected oil prices , oil - sands supply costs , transport costs and supply - demand scenarios
nor will @entity2 affect " the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the @entity68 ... " and when it comes to producing heavy crude , the @entity47 impact statement recognizes that only oil sands production trends downward on carbon intensity
@entity6 emits just 2 % of global greenhouse gases , and the emissions from oil sands contribute 0.16 % to global emissions
for context , three coal - fired power plants in the @entity68 emit more greenhouse gases than the entire oil sands industry
with regard to rail , the impact statement was abundantly clear that the expansion of rail facilities will be able to transport the capacity of @entity2 and then some
nearly 1.2 million barrels per day of rail loading capacity , about 1.5 times the size of @entity2 , will be available to move @entity6 crude oil to markets by the end of 2015
the latest @entity68 @entity96 energy forecast shows the @entity68 will import millions of barrels of oil for decades during its transition to a lower carbon future
the responsible thing to do for the environment , the economy and the public is to build the safest , most efficient infrastructure to transport it
at @entity24 , we 're investing billions of dollars in renewable and emission-less energy sources in @entity108 , including wind , solar , hydro and nuclear power to bring clean energy to millions of homes across the continent
we 're also focused on upgrading @entity68 energy infrastructure so that during the transition , the @entity68 can get more of its oil from a trusted ally : @entity6
that 's the responsible path forward and why @entity2 continues to enjoy strong public , congressional , labor and business support -- and why this project continues to be in the @entity68 ' national interest
we urge @entity9 to give a green light to the @entity2
