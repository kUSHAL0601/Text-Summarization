@entity0 remembers exactly what he did a year ago tuesday
he ran down fences , drove through fields and over curbs to get his family out of the way of the historic tornado that tattered @entity8 , @entity9
the dark gray monster that killed 24 , including 9 children , was in his rear - view mirror , lathing a 17 - mile wound into the landscape that was more than a mile wide in places
once it was gone , the @entity16 returned to their hometown just south of @entity19
the whirlwind -- an @entity22 tornado , the most destructive on the @entity24 scale -- had sheared houses , schools , businesses into sticks , bricks and shards that lay jumbled and jagged in the straight - line rows of their subdivision streets
the @entity16 ' home and everything in it was gone , but something else was on @entity0 's mind -- his neighbors who were missing
he and other survivors ran up and down the street
" if you can hear me , call out , " he cried to anyone who might have been stuck under rubble and still alive
the damage was so complete that when rescuers moved in , city officials raced to print new street signs to help guide them through the apocalyptic landscape
a key home improvement a year later , it 's tornado season again , and @entity0 's wife @entity51 seems happy about the new addition to their new home , which is still under construction
" we 're gon na build our storm shelter right here kind of between the second and third cars so we can still get in even if there 's cars here , " she said , as a contractor worked inside the incomplete house
storm cellars are all the rage in the neighborhood now
other homes - in - progress dot the subdivision , where new houses stand surrounded by threadbare lots
one bald slab sports a rusty storm cellar door -- apparently the only thing the tornado left standing there
nothing else has been added to that empty foundation
the terror was too much for some residents , and they are n't rebuilding , because they 're not coming back
last year 's cyclone injured 353 of them , and @entity8 is as prime target for twisters , right in the middle of " tornado alley
' @entity87 cat and mouse some of them may have recalled the may 1999 tornado that killed dozens in @entity8
lt. gov. @entity91 has said it had the strongest wind speeds of any twister in history
it was part of a spate of dozens of twisters in tornado alley in just a few days that year
or they may remember the 2003 tornado that was less deadly but ripped up buildings
or fright may still be in their bones from the tornado that ripped apart another @entity19 outlier last year one day before death visited @entity8 from above
and trauma might still be fresh on their minds from the perhaps even bigger monster that missed @entity8 by a hair 11 days after its ravishing -- the so - called @entity115 tornado on may 31 , 2013 , that razed mostly sparsely populated countryside
@entity115 was " one of the most powerful tornadoes sampled by mobile radar and also the widest known tornado on record , " the @entity117 said
it seems that to live in @entity8 is to play cat and mouse with deadly storms with heart - rending consequences
seven of the nine children killed in last year 's tornado died when it flattened one single school building
more than 70 students and teachers hunkered down at @entity134 , when the torquing winds pushed walls and ceilings down on top of them
@entity140 had no storm shelter a year ago
that will change when the school is rebuilt
commemorations and a new start remaining @entity8 residents will celebrate their resilience on tuesday with commemorations that start at 10 a.m. local time ( 9 a.m. @entity149 )
gov. @entity150 and @entity8 mayor @entity151 will commemorate the dead , as the local fire department tolls a bell in their honor
a chaplain will hold a prayer
then a shovel will plunge into the dirt for the groundbreaking of the new @entity161
a year ago , the tornado tore the old one to pieces and tousled automobiles onto its ruins
rescuers were forced to take @entity8 's injured to other hospitals in the region
in its place stands a barren empty lot of red earth
something new will start to take form there on tuesday
honest advice from @entity177 to @entity8 one year later : ' something good 's got ta come out of this '
