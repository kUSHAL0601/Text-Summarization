@entity21 , @entity22 : on @entity24 , online , on @entity25 ; here , there and everywhere , this is @entity0 ! thank you for spending part of your thursday with us
from the @entity31 , i 'm @entity32
first up : health care address @entity35 : first up , health care reform reclaims the spotlight as president @entity38 takes up the issue in a speech to @entity41
this debate has been heating up for months , with politicians and citizens weighing in with their opinions
it 's an incredibly complicated issue , so we 're gon na look at some of the main points right now
some people think the country 's health care system is fine the way it is
others think it 's broken , but what they do n't agree on is how to fix it
for example , how much would it cost to reform the system , and where would that money come from ? should there be a government - run health insurance program ? and if so , how might that impact private insurance companies ? those are just a few of the questions facing lawmakers
president @entity38 says he is n't the first president to take on health care , but he hopes to be the last
he 's been pushing for reform since he took office , and he believes the time for action is now
@entity6 president @entity38 : the time for bickering is over
the time for games has passed
now is the season for action
now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the @entity6 people that we can still do what we were sent here to do
now is the time to deliver on health care
@entity92 @entity35 : after the president wrapped up his address to @entity41 , the @entity93 offered a response from @entity6 representative @entity97
the @entity99 representative , who has more than 20 years of experience as a surgeon , says he agrees with parts of president @entity38 's plan
but he thinks it also presents several problems
last night , he outlined some alternative ideas about how to improve the health care system and how to lower its costs
@entity110 @entity109 , ( r ) @entity99 : we need to establish tough liability reform standards , encourage speedy resolution of claims , and deter junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of care
real reform must do this
let 's also talk about letting families and businesses buy insurance across state lines
i and many other republicans believe that that will provide real choice and competition to lower the cost of health insurance
@entity132 @entity133 , @entity22 : time for the shoutout ! @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 are all members of what governmental body ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity41 , b ) the @entity6 @entity149 , c ) president @entity38 's @entity147 or @entity148 ) the @entity146 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! along with six other justices , these people compose the @entity6 @entity149
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! campaign finance @entity35 : it 's their job to interpret our country 's laws , and one case the justices are looking at right now could have a major impact on elections , including the ones coming up next year ! it 's all about how much money corporations can give to candidates
right now , there 's a limit on that , but some people argue that violates the @entity173
@entity174 is on the case
( @entity176 ) from citizens united ad for " @entity179 , the movie " : who is @entity179 ? @entity174 , @entity181 , @entity182 : it started small
during last year 's presidential primaries , a federal court said campaign finance laws barred this ad for an anti-hillary @entity189 movie by an advocacy group , a non-profit corporation
from citizens united ad for " @entity179 , the movie " : if you thought you knew everything about @entity179 , wait ' til you see the movie
@entity196 : but now , the @entity149 could make a monumental change in how money influences politics , deciding , in the name of free speech , whether there should be any limits at all on corporate campaign spending
@entity205 , democracy 21 , @entity207 : allowing corporations to flood our elections and use campaign expenditures to buy influence would fundamentally undermine our democracy
@entity196 : @entity205 of @entity214 warns overturning a century of precedents would shut average citizens out of the political process
@entity218 : the little guy would have no role here , because the dominant force in our politics , the dominant force in @entity182 decision - making , would become corporations
@entity196 : but @entity229 of @entity230 , the group behind the anti-hillary @entity189 movie , argues that anyone pooling resources , including unions , the health industry , advocacy groups like the @entity236 , has free speech rights
@entity238 , @entity230 : i actually went out and looked for this fight , because i do n't believe the government should have the right to impede people 's entry into the process
and that 's what the @entity247 is trying to do here , squelch our first @entity250
@entity196 : interestingly , the @entity252 agrees
a final ruling is expected in a couple of months , and legal observers say conservatives could hold the key , with enough votes to possibly declare much of current campaign finance law unconstitutional
@entity174 , @entity0 , the @entity149
( @entity260 ) @entity261 @entity35 : six months ' worth of rain in two days ! that is what residents in parts of @entity266 are dealing with
this massive downpour triggered flash floods in the country this week , claiming more than 30 lives
in this video - look at this - you can see how the water rushed through a low - lying valley
it flipped and ripped up dozens of cargo trucks
hundreds of other vehicles were washed out into the sea
the country 's prime minister said emergency workers rescued around 1,300 people from the floods
he 's already pledged money to get help and relief to the affected regions that need it
@entity291 @entity292 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a rock band originally from @entity295 , @entity296
i made my first @entity6 appearance in 1964
20 of my songs landed at number 1 on the @entity6 charts
and i was inducted into the @entity302 in 1988
i 'm the @entity303 : @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 ! the @entity303 : @entity308 @entity35 : they were a rock band
now the @entity303 are in @entity308 ! a new game featuring the famous @entity303 is out this week
it lets players jam out on dozens of the group 's biggest hits
plus , it gives younger audiences -- you -- a chance to check out some of rock and roll 's most famous songs nearly four decades after the band 's last gig
that 's not the only reason the @entity303 are back in the spotlight
all 15 of their albums have been re-mastered and put back on store shelves
purifying invention @entity35 : meanwhile , a famous inventor wants to do some re-mastering of his own
but we 're not talking about digital , we 're talking liquid
more than a billion people around the globe do n't have access to clean drinking water
sure , there 're water water everywhere , but if it 's not clean , it can cause serious consequences
@entity344 looks at one idea designed to quench the problem
( @entity176 ) @entity344 , @entity0 correspondent : water : it 's the most abundant resource on the planet , yet every year , millions of people die because they do n't have access to clean water
so @entity353 , the inventor of the @entity354 , decided to take this problem on with a machine he calls the " @entity357
" @entity353 , inventor : we believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its goliath of a problem : bad water
@entity366 : he says the machine can turn contaminated water like this dirty river water into clean drinking water by boiling , distilling and vaporizing it
@entity373 : in goes the bad , and as you can see , out comes the good
@entity366 : the machine is smaller than some other water purifying systems , making it more portable
@entity373 : it 's ideally suited to go to places in the developing world
@entity366 : @entity353 says it requires very little electricity and maintenance to function
but until he finds partners and distributors to keep costs down , @entity386 wo n't be available to the people who need them most
@entity373 : we 've got to find better strategies to deal with this incredibly unique and valuable resource called water , that we 've all come to take for granted , but we 'll not be able to do that in the future
@entity366 : @entity344 , @entity0
( @entity260 ) before we go @entity35 : before we leave you today , we 've got a story about something that 's pretty darn fast
@entity401 may be the quickest person on the planet , but he 's got nothing on @entity404
the cheetah charged into the record books yesterday as the world 's fastest land mammal
she made the 100 - meter dash in 6.16 seconds
then she went out and shaved some more time off in her second attempt
now for reference , sprinter @entity412 did it in 9.58 seconds
think you could outrun her ? you 're welcome to give it a shot
goodbye @entity35 : but you 've got to make sure that she does n't break any rules
after all , she 's a cheetah
okay , we know a lot of you probably saw that coming , but you just ca n't miss the opportunity to make a cheetah pun
it 's where we cross the finish line for today , but we 'll be back tomorrow to close out the week
we look forward to seeing you then
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity32 .
