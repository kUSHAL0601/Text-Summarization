-- there 's a popular @entity3 proverb that seems particularly relevant to this @entity4 : " if you think you 're too small to make a difference , try sleeping in a closed room with a mosquito
" beyond their power to annoy , mosquitoes and other insects carry an outsized ability to kill , disable and disfigure people in massive numbers
human history is closely linked to diseases carried by vectors such as the sand flies at the heart of blinding and disfiguring diseases referenced during biblical times , fleas responsible for bubonic plague in @entity24 , and the mosquitoes that carry one of today 's most well - known diseases , malaria
what most people do n't know , however , is that there are several other vector - borne diseases that have a staggering impact on the world 's poorest people
called neglected tropical diseases , or @entity39 , this group of parasitic and bacterial infections plagues one in six people worldwide , including more than 500 million children
these diseases , such as lymphatic filariasis , also known as elephantiasis , can cause severe deformities in sufferers and are one of the major reasons for lower economic productivity among adults and decreased school attendance among kids in poor and even middle - income countries , and pose a primary obstacle to achieving many of the @entity56 , particularly for education , nutrition , and maternal and child health
potential success story it 's easy to focus on the bleak side of @entity39 , but the truth is their control and elimination potentially represents the next major public health success story
there is now a worldwide effort to neutralize the threat posed by @entity39
a consortium of partners -- including the @entity75 , @entity76 , and 13 pharmaceutical companies -- came together two years ago to enact the @entity78 , a sweeping commitment by public , private and government partners to achieve control and elimination of 10 @entity39 by 2020
in the time since , nearly 1.35 billion pills to treat several @entity39 have been donated annually by the pharmaceutical sector , with a commitment to provide 14 billion treatments on average over 10 years
the value of these donations has been estimated at $ 19 billion through 2020 and is a primary reason for driving down the cost to treat and protect one person against multiple @entity39 to less than 50 cents per year
correspondingly , more than 70 countries have enacted plans to integrate @entity39 funding into their national budgets and focus greater health resources on @entity39 - related health programs , and we are seeing major progress in how @entity39 programs are integrated with other health and development initiatives involving water , sanitation and health ( @entity107 ) , nutrition and education
all of this is big news
since @entity39 pills do not require any clinics or medically trained personnel to administer , and are shelf - stable for long periods of time in hot climates , the task of getting them into the hands of the neediest communities is dramatically easier than other major health interventions
when treatments are given to a community over a sustained period of five to seven years , elimination of @entity39 as a public health threat is achievable
in the case of vector - borne diseases , it means that the insects and snails that normally transmit parasites from one human to another can no longer infect the population with the parasitic loads usually derived from other infected people
ending the diseases with all the recent momentum for combating @entity39 , we are now closer than we have ever been in history to finally seeing the end of these diseases
but we still have formidable barriers to overcome if we expect to reach broad control and elimination targets by the end of the decade
the global cost to achieving the 2020 @entity39 goals is relatively minimal relative to other health interventions : we have a funding gap of only $ 200 million per year to cover the expense of distributing the donated medicines to affected communities
bridging this gap requires new partners to join the effort
ntds offer one of the best returns on investment available in public health
imagine : for only 50 cents per year , we have the potential to free a person to work more productively or excel in school , providing a path to increase lifetime earnings
such a minimum investment yields the kind of returns that free the poorest communities to help grow , and participate in , market economies
for political and business leaders , @entity39 treatment should be seen as a basic investment that strengthens a country 's potential labor and consumer force , tapping new sources of gdp growth
it is paramount global leaders prioritize @entity39 on the post- 2015 development agenda to make @entity39 a plague of the past
all of the right factors align -- from donated , safe treatments and readily available school - based distribution points to an unmatched return on public health investment
with greater commitment by national governments , multinational and bilateral donors , corporate partners and philanthropists , we can reduce suffering on a mass scale and help millions of people achieve their full economic and social potential
