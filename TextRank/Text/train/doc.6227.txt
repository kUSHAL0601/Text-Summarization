-- " there are so many ways of being despicable it quite makes one 's head spin
but the way to be really despicable is to be contemptuous of other people 's pain
" -- @entity9 no doubt most people who listened to @entity12 's self - serving monologue during his sentencing hearing on " consensual sex , " and " harmony in that house , " wondered at his sanity and his definition of " monster
" @entity20 , however , is judged by reality testing and not by caring or compassion
human cruelty is not a disease or a mental illness , although it is a plague on humankind
as someone who has worked with violent offenders for 35 years , i can tell you unequivocally the number of offenders who deny , minimize or justify their behavior far outweigh the number who take responsibility
never mind the tortuous loops the mind has to jump through
if the sex was consensual , what exactly were the chains and locks for ? there is no limit to the mind 's ability to rationalize
a man who beat a 3 - year - old to death told me that he only committed violence when " the situation called for it
i never did anything i did n't have to do
" when asked how he feels about the boy 's suffering , he replied , " i guess i do n't feel anything
" when asked if he saw himself as a criminal , he said , " i know that 's what i 'm seen as but no , i do n't
" a man whose brother took him in when he had no place to go after being released from prison raped his benefactor 's 12 - year - old daughter -- his niece -- and stabbed his brother 12 times when he came to her rescue
when asked why he did this , he replied : " i was drinking
... you ca n't blame anybody for the rain
you ca n't blame anybody for nothing
" we are familiar with whole cultures justifying violence as extreme as genocide
why are we surprised when individuals do the same ? violence is almost always denied or rationalized -- after the fact , if not before
even violence that appears impulsive is usually related to thinking patterns and beliefs that justify it
such rationales are important to protect self - image
again it was @entity9 who said , " no man is a villain in his own eyes
" as to @entity12 's claim that he had an illness , a sexual addiction , there is a difference between urges and behaviors
@entity12 could have dealt with his urges by seeking help
medication and treatment have been available for sex offenders for well over a decade
would they have worked ? who knows ? he did n't try
he made a decision to live out his sexual fantasies , not to try to control them
in treatment , at the least he would have learned how not to reinforce the fantasies through violent pornography
at least by telling someone , he would have had some check on his behavior
@entity12 may not have chosen the fantasies that dominated his dreams , but he chose to act on them -- for more than a decade
even the most persistent urges are not present 24 hours a day
all @entity12 needed was for 51 % of him to have an attack of conscience for a few minutes and want to release those women long enough to open a door
in more than a decade he never had it
in fact , he tormented his victims not only in sexual ways but in nonsexual ways as well : he showed them tv coverage of their families grieving
he told one that her family did n't care about her
he fed them once a day
he beat a pregnant woman until she miscarried
none of these speak to sexual urges ; these acts speaks to psychopathic traits : the lack of a conscience , lack of caring about other human beings , callousness , lack of guilt and lack of remorse -- in short , malevolence , the desire to harm another human being gratuitously while being contemptuous of her pain
even now , he has shown no genuine remorse or regret
what we saw at the hearing instead was a cocoon of aggressive narcissism wrapped so tightly @entity12 could proclaim with a straight face that chained women were having sex with him consensually
yet at the same time he asked for their forgiveness
no doubt there are those who will advise the victims they must forgive in order to move on
forgiveness is not a gift ; it must be earned
atonement and change must precede forgiveness or else it is an empty gesture
it is difficult to imagine how much @entity12 would have to change for forgiveness even to be legitimately on the table
i 'm not sure his sentence is long enough for that to happen , and to date , he has not taken a single step
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .
