-- president @entity1 will deliver a eulogy on sunday for the 29 workers killed in a mine explosion in @entity5
before the service in @entity7 , the president and vice president @entity9 will meet privately with the miners ' relatives
" all the hard work
all the time spent underground
it was all for their families
for a car in the driveway
for a chance to give their kids opportunities they never knew ; and enjoy retirement with their wives , " @entity1 will say in his eulogy , according to excerpts that the @entity23 made available
" it was all in the hopes of something better
these miners lived -- as they died -- in pursuit of the @entity35
" the april 5 blast at the @entity37 was the worst @entity39 mine disaster since 1972 , when 91 miners died in a fire at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44
@entity1 ordered a review , saying the mine explosion was due in part to failures by both the management and loopholes in existing laws and regulations
" we can not bring back the men we lost
what we can do , in their memory , is thoroughly investigate this tragedy and demand accountability , " the president said soon after the explosion
@entity1 called @entity62 , the coal producer that owns the mine , a " safety violator " and described the safety record at the mine as " troubled
" @entity62 later called @entity1 's criticism " regrettable " and defended its safety record
" we fear that the president has been misinformed about our record and the mining industry in general , " the company said .
