@entity1 's democracy movement has raised issues such as income inequality and an increasing cheerless economic outlook , especially for the younger generation
not coincidentally , these are the same issues that are causing @entity8 to despair over their future
despite the fact that , according to the @entity13 , @entity8 lays claim to the dubious honor of being the most expensive city in the world , there is no minimum wage in @entity8
is it any wonder then , that amongst comparable economies , the island - state has one of the highest levels of income inequality ? @entity8 has the highest proportion of millionaires in the world but nearly 5 % of the workforce have an annual income of less than u.s. $ 5,000 , according to a 2011 report by @entity32
and it 's not just the lower - income workers who are getting pounded
the middle - class squeeze is as prevalent as ever
nearly 50 % of @entity8 subsist from paycheck to paycheck , saving less than 10 % of their monthly incomes
an alarming 14 % have no savings at all
if and when an economic whirlwind visits , many will be left unable to cope
working conditions have also deteriorated
for years , @entity8 workers have worked more hours than in most countries , and , perhaps unsurprisingly it has resulted in an extremely unhappy workforce
the death of innovation what facilitated such a dismal outcome ? one major factor is the lack of dissenting views
the ranks of the opposition , civil society and labor movement have been decimated in the last 50 years through imprisonment without trial and criminal prosecution , and nearly every newspaper , tv channel and radio station is owned and run by the state
without an opposing voice , the echo chamber in government simply grew louder
@entity8 's first prime minister @entity68 has argued that the practice of democracy serves only to undermine political stability and , therefore , economic progress
the strategy that @entity68 articulates , what might be called the @entity8 model , bifurcates the economics of a community from its politics , the goal being to maintain absolute power while pursuing economic growth
but this authoritarian system has backfired
it has robbed the @entity8 society of the verve needed to take the economy to the next level where ideas and innovation are essential
@entity90 said that @entity8 could not produce a company like @entity92 because the system has destroyed " creative elements " that give rise to innovative companies
while @entity8 's mercantilism appears the epitome of success , it is an economy unable to regenerate itself
the situation has deteriorated to the point that it has to rely on foreigners to stimulate growth
@entity68 , its first prime minister and architect of the country 's one - party rule , said , in a stunning admission , that " without [ foreigners ] , the jobs will not be there to begin with
" @entity8 is like a ponzi scheme which needs new immigrants just to keep the economy ticking over , but which also reduces the quality of life for its current citizens
and yet , there are no signs that the current prime minister @entity122 , @entity68 's son , understands the urgent need for reform
" i do n't think there is salvation in saying we need more democracy and that will make these countries prosper , " he said in a recent interview
among those words is surely a line of self - interest
@entity1 's chief executive leung chun - ying was , perhaps , a little more candid when he said that the poor would have to be listened to if elections in the territory are genuinely free
clearly , @entity8 and @entity1 are at a crossroads
while the path of democracy may not be a panacea for all of society 's ills , political freedoms , especially in an age of innovation and rapid change , are crucial to keep the economy moving forward
the road of keeping the people silent , on the other hand , is a one - way ticket to mediocrity and eventual irrelevance .
