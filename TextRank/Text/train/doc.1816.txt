@entity0 , @entity1 -- scientists in the @entity3 are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes
the @entity6 has reported that around half of the world 's population is at risk of malaria
the laser , which has been dubbed a " weapon of mosquito destruction " fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of its wings
the laser beam then destroys the mosquito , burning it on the spot
developed by some of the astrophysicists involved in what was known as the " @entity28 " anti-missile programs during the @entity30 , the project is meant to prevent the spread of malaria
lead scientist on the project , dr. @entity33 , told @entity36 that the laser would be able to sweep an area and " toast millions of mosquitoes in a few minutes
" malaria is a life - threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people from the bites of female mosquitoes
it is particularly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and kills an @entity51 child every 30 seconds , according to the @entity6
there are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally , resulting in more than one million deaths , the @entity6 reports
responding to questions about any potential harm the laser could pose to the eco-system , @entity33 said : " there is no such thing as a good mosquito , there 's nothing that feeds exclusively on them
no one would miss mosquitoes , " he said
" in any case , " he added
" the laser is able to distinguish between mosquitoes that go after people and those that are n't dangerous
what remains to be seen is how precise we can get
" he added that other insects would not be affected by the laser 's beam
@entity33 said the lasers could be mounted on lamp post-type poles and put around the circumference of villages , to create a kind of " fence " against mosquitoes
the research was commissioned by @entity87 , a @entity88 , @entity3 - based company that was founded by @entity89 , a former @entity90 executive
his previous boss , @entity91 , who funded the research , asked @entity89 to look into new ways of combating malaria .
