-- " i love you @entity3 ! ! " that 's how @entity5 closed a @entity7 post on saturday , a day after his @entity9 family -- fresh off a beachfront vacation -- experienced the unthinkable when a display board crashed down on them inside @entity14 's @entity13
the crushing weight of the digital sign killed @entity18 and left his mother , @entity19 , in critical condition at a @entity13 hospital , officials said
" words can not describe the pain we feel , " @entity5 wrote saturday on @entity7 , urging people attending church to wear sports jerseys to services in tribute to his sports - loving son
" thank you all for the love and support
keep praying and praying and praying
" posts on what appears to be @entity38 's @entity37 page said that her mother , @entity19 , broke both her ankles and her left pelvis ; her brother @entity42 suffered a concussion ; and another brother , @entity44 , broke his left leg and nose
@entity47 , from @entity49 hospital , told @entity0 on saturday night that @entity42 and @entity50 were in fair condition
" seeing all these little kids in the hospital breaks my heart , " @entity52 wrote
what caused the large digital sign -- which showed when and where flights were arriving to and departing -- to collapse around 1:30 p.m. ( 2:30 p.m. et ) friday ? on saturday , authorities still did n't know
" ( @entity65 ) president and ceo @entity66 and the staff are continuing to work with officials to investigate , " said @entity61 , the chairwoman of the authority 's board
" this includes discussions with contractors , subcontractors that are responsible for the modernization of the ... airport
" the incident happened in a new part of the airport , in a public area before security checkpoints
according to @entity0 affiliate @entity80 , the area opened up march 13 and includes a covered parking deck , children 's play area , eating establishments , a new baggage system and other features
@entity87 was riding up the escalator when he saw the display board fall , telling @entity0 affiliate wiat that one family was especially affected
" the family was crushed , little kids crushed underneath the sign
and everybody was scattering to lift it up , " @entity87 said , adding that he was among those who helped
video footage showed people sweeping up the area and a cut - out spot along a wall with protruding wires , where the sign once stood
whatever the reason , it was clear the @entity108 , @entity9 , family was in the wrong place at the wrong time
@entity13 mayor @entity111 said he 'd met with @entity3 's father , describing him as a " heartbroken " man who " wants and deserves answers
" " i can not come close to understanding his heartache , " the mayor said in a statement
" but i will get answers
" @entity18 was a fifth grader at @entity120 , a catholic school in @entity122 , @entity123 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity124
father @entity125 , a priest of the affiliated parish , described him as a " normal kid " who 'd been on the city champion basketball team and was always at @entity130 on sunday mornings
" he lived a good moral life , " @entity125 told the @entity122 station
" he was shaped with the behaviors and the attitudes and the strength of what helps make society a good one
" in the days prior , @entity5 had put up several messages and photos on @entity7 about the family 's vacation in @entity142 , @entity143 -- including several showing two of his sons playing in the @entity147 water , with no one else in sight
his post saturday , by contrast , reflected his grief and affection for his late son
" i miss and love @entity3 so very much
" @entity0 's @entity155 contributed to this report .
