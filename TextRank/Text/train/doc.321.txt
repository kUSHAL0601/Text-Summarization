-- the midflight breakdown of a @entity3 pilot has sparked concerns about psychological screening for flight crews
capt. @entity8 's erratic behavior prompted flight 191 from @entity10 to @entity11 to make an unscheduled landing in @entity13 , @entity14 , on tuesday after crew and passengers intervened and subdued the 49 - year - old pilot
@entity8 " yelled jumbled comments about @entity19 , september 11th , @entity20 , @entity21 , and terrorists , " according to a federal criminal complaint filed against @entity8
one passenger quoted @entity8 as saying , " @entity26 --- --- now for @entity19 , " the complaint said
" it just seemed like something triggered him to go off the wall
he would be calm one minute and then just all of a sudden turn , " said passenger @entity30
@entity3 pilot charged with interfering with flight crew @entity3 has not elaborated on the pilot 's condition , but ceo @entity36 referred to the incident as a " medical situation
" the pilot 's behavior points to possible psychological distress , doctors say
the episode could be the result of bipolar disorder or a recent start on antidepressant medication , said dr. @entity48 , a psychiatrist at the @entity49 and @entity0 consultant who has not treated @entity8
medical illnesses such as brain tumors , subtle seizures or hormonal imbalances could also have caused @entity8 's behavior , @entity48 said
all airline pilots are required by the @entity57 to have a first - class medical certificate that must be renewed annually for pilots younger than 40 and every six months for pilots 40 and older
@entity3 follows all @entity57 pilot requirements , the airline said
pilots must be examined by an aviation medical examiner as part of that process , and a candidate 's psychological condition is assessed
the exam does not include a formal psychiatric evaluation , although the examiner should " form a general impression of the emotional stability and mental state of the applicant , " according to @entity57 's @entity76
bipolar disorders , psychotic disorders , personality disorders that involve " acting out " and substance dependence generally are disqualifying conditions , according to the guide
in these cases , the examiner would either deny issuing the certificate or defer it and report evidence of significant problems to the @entity57 , the guide says
" if the person is exhibiting any signs of psychosis , thinks he 's on the moon , is disoriented in time and place , if he 's taking any medicines -- and the @entity57 is very strict -- the computer wo n't even let me give an exam if medicines are not approved
it 's very strict under those circumstances , " said dr. @entity101 , an @entity57 - approved @entity10 family doctor who performs about 40 pilot exams a year
@entity101 said one pilot grieving the death of his father raised a red flag for him and he deferred certification to the @entity57
" pilots as a rule are extremely stable people , " said retired airline capt. @entity110 , a 33 - year veteran
" by the time a person becomes a commercial pilot , they 've gone through so many filters
" however , the agency 's strict criteria prompt some to hide their conditions , according to two pilots who spoke to @entity0 on condition of anonymity out of concern for their own careers
one veteran with three decades of experience said he 's known just a single fellow pilot who sought treatment for depression
the treatment lasted eight or nine months , and he never told his employer , the pilot said
" a guy has worked his whole career toward what he 's gotten , and he 's dealing with issues , what does he do ? if he says , ' hey , i 'm depressed , ' then the @entity57 pulls his medical certificates and then there goes his career
" another veteran pilot echoed that sentiment : " yes , pilots are flying around depressed because if they do ( admit depression ) , they 'll be grounded
" " pilots are generally well psychologically screened for all the right reasons
if this pilot did indeed snap , it does n't surprise me
there 's tremendous pressure out there in the pilot group , and that 's something the public should care about , " the pilot said
in its medical examiners guide , the @entity57 says pilots being treated with four specific antidepressants may receive medical clearance , which would be decided on a case - by - case basis
@entity8 's breakdown comes just weeks after an @entity166 flight attendant 's behavior alarmed passengers and prompted flight crew members to restrain her while the plane was taxiing
one passenger said the flight attendant described herself as bipolar and said she had not taken her medication
other accounts referred to her talking on the intercom about the plane crashing
@entity166 has not identified her , and no charges have been filed
she remains employed by the company , the airline said wednesday
@entity181 said the airline follows all @entity57 rules
unlike pilots , flight attendants are not required to pass medical examinations before they fly , according to the @entity186 , a union that does not represent @entity166 workers
" however , flight attendants do have to go through recurrent training each year to refresh their emergency situation skills , " said @entity186 spokeswoman @entity188
they are also required to receive proficiency certification from the @entity57
she added that " in most cases , " flight attendants could be treated for various conditions and still perform " as first responders efficiently , " noting that red flags would probably come up during the initial six - to eight - week training period or during a probationary period of up to a year
in addition to the pressure of performing the duties of flying itself , airline employees face the added stress of trying to survive in an industry fraught with restructuring , bankruptcies and other uncertainties
" this industry is very turbulent , " @entity188 said
" and after 9/11 , these workers really went through a very difficult time personally and professionally
" @entity0 's @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .
