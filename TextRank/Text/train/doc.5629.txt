@entity0 , @entity1 -- a veteran social activist in @entity1 has launched an indefinite hunger strike to seek tough , overarching laws to tackle corruption as a rash of scandals undermined the reputation of the country 's government
on tuesday , activist @entity12 began his " fast - unto - death " at @entity0 's @entity14 landmark
his campaign , supported by numerous social reformists , has come in the wake of a series of high - profile alleged scandals that have rocked prime minister @entity23 's administration and investor confidence in @entity26 's third largest economy
@entity12 is demanding that a long - pending citizen ombudsman legislation , called the @entity29 bill , be widened in its scope
@entity12 and his supporters reject the bill in its present form because it does not empower the proposed bodies to prosecute corruption suspects
anti-graft crusaders have come up with their own draft of the legislation that seeks to create citizen ombudsman completely free from political influence and with wide - ranging jurisdiction
" this fast - unto - death is a reflection of the people 's anger at growing , all - round corruption ... at a time when the scourge is eating into the vitals of our society , " said political commentator @entity43
a day before @entity12 , 72 , began his hunger strike , the office of the @entity1 prime minister expressed its " deep disappointment " over the protest
@entity23 's office noted in a statement that the prime minister met with @entity12 and his colleagues last month
" i appreciate and share your concern on corruption , " the statement quoted @entity23 as having told @entity12
nonetheless , a subsequent meeting between social activists and a federal committee ended unsuccessfully over demands the government accept their version of the bill in totality , @entity23 's office said
as politicians from different parties visited @entity12 at @entity14 , the reformist announced he would allow no leader to share his platform
rather , @entity12 alleged corruption was all pervasive in @entity1 's political establishment with only few exceptions
last weekend , a former government minister in @entity1 was among a dozen defendants charged in a multi-billion - dollar telecom scandal
@entity86 , a former telecommunication minister , is accused of being involved in a scheme involving the underselling of cell phone licenses at the height of @entity1 's lucrative telecom boom
police have questioned several high - profile executives in connection with the suspected below - price sale of radiowaves in 2008
politicians , bureaucrats , and corporate officials linked to the probe have denied any wrongdoing
according to a government audit , the treasury lost as much as $ 31 billion from the 2008 sale of the second - generation wireless spectrum
the damning audit report came on the heels of allegations of massive fraud in sports and real estate
two parliamentary committees are conducting separate inquiries into the case
investigators are already probing complaints of financial malfeasance in the @entity118 that @entity1 hosted in october last year
several politicians , military officials , and bureaucrats have also been the subjects of a separate inquiry for allegedly taking apartments meant for war widows .
