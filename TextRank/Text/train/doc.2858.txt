-- election night could be a long one
many of the polls continue to show a tight race with the candidates remaining in a dead heat in the swing states
whoever wins the election , it might not be by much
close elections have produced challenges for the victor once he starts his term in the @entity15
if voters do n't provide a clear mandate , presidents often find that they have added challenges when dealing with @entity20 , as legislators have far less fear about the commander in chief
in 1916 , for example , president @entity24 won reelection against former @entity28 @entity27 by 23 electoral votes and 3.1 percent of the popular vote
the victory , which depended on @entity24 's assurances to keep the @entity33 out of war , hardened the lines of partisan battle
republicans returned to @entity38 angry about how he had used the potential for war against them , even as he ushered the nation into @entity45 soon after the election
during the war , and especially during the fight over the peace treaty that followed , @entity24 found little cooperation from republicans who felt confident that they could take him on in the home front
opinion : @entity55 's pointless speculation over election outcome when @entity60 sen. @entity59 defeated vice president @entity61 in 1960 by 84 electoral votes and only 0.2 percent of the popular vote , the conservative coalition of @entity58 and @entity50 in @entity20 read the close outcome as evidence that the young senator did not have a popular mandate
the fact that @entity58 did n't enjoy any coattails from his victory even made liberals and moderates nervous about going out too far on a limb for the president
on domestic policy , @entity59 found most of his legislation stifled in congressional committees through the time of his assassination
opinion : both parties have a huge race problem when former @entity86 gov. @entity85 squeaked out victory against president @entity88 in 1976 , the same pattern recurred
though @entity85 had excited many @entity58 during the primary by promising voters that they could trust him in the aftermath of @entity92 , he won by only 2.1 percent of the popular vote and 57 electoral votes
the nation was " hopeful , sort of , " quipped @entity96
during his first two years , @entity85 struggled to win support from his own party on issues like energy conservation , while @entity50 such as @entity101 felt emboldened to take him on over issues such as tax cuts and foreign policy
from the moment he entered office , the fragility of his election victory motivated @entity110 and @entity50 opponents , who both played a role in his defeat in 1980
@entity114 gov. @entity113 came under fire in 2000 when the @entity28 ordered an end to a recount in @entity118 , resulting in his winning the presidency against vice president @entity120 by five electoral votes
@entity113 lost the popular vote to @entity120 by 0.5 percent
many @entity58 felt that the election had been stolen from them
@entity113 was not deterred and governed as if he had a mandate , pushing through a massive tax cut in 2001
his political standing was helped by the fact that the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , created a sense of national emergency and inspired a " rally around the leader " effect
but stalemate soon set in , as @entity58 had little appetite to help him
opinion : what 's really at stake in election 2012 the 2004 election , which @entity113 won by 35 electoral votes and 2.4 percent of the popular vote , also generated controversy as some @entity58 felt that there had been voter suppression and rigged voting machines in the crucial state of @entity148 by @entity50 - supporting groups
republicans claimed there had been voter fraud in other states , like @entity154
@entity113 never received the political capital he expected from his reelection victory and saw most of his domestic legislative proposals languish
opinion : @entity159 vs. square @entity160 in today 's political era , every president -- even those who enjoy landslide victories -- faces immense challenges working in the current congressional environment
partisan polarization , interest - group politics and the 24 - hour media make legislating difficult
but narrow elections only make things worse , and this would be the case for either a second term for president @entity175 or a first term for @entity160
the situation would be even worse if certain states are contested , as occurred in 2000 , and if the chaos from @entity181 results in logistical problems in parts of the @entity184
the winner would walk into a toxic @entity38 environment with the perception that their mandate is thin
added to all of this is the fact that the winner of the electoral college vote might not be the winner of the popular vote , as has occurred a handful of other times in @entity33 history
of course , the polls could be off and we might be heading to another @entity201 defeats @entity203 moment , such as occurred in 1948 when the president proved the pollsters wrong and enjoyed a comfortable reelection victory
but since that 's probably not the case , we 'll be heading toward some rough times on @entity210 in the years ahead
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .
