-- revising its policy on circumcision for the first time in 13 years , the @entity1 now says that the preventative health benefits of infant circumcision clearly outweigh the risks
the @entity1 is also emphasizing that the procedure should be covered by third party payers , including @entity10 , so more families have access to it
however , the organization stopped short of recommending circumcision routinely for all infant boys , saying it 's still up to parents to weigh the health , cultural , and religious implications to make the best decision for their child
circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin , a small flap of skin that covers the tip of the penis , generally performed in the days after birth
many @entity31 and @entity32 circumcise their sons because of their religious beliefs
other parents choose to snip for hygiene reasons , believing it 's easier to keep a circumcised penis clean , or cosmetic ones , wanting junior to " look like dad
" the @entity1 's previous policy statement , published in 1999 and affirmed in 2005 , took a more neutral stance on circumcision , noting " potential medical benefits , " but saying it 's " not essential to the child 's current well - being
" however , an @entity1 task force formed in 2007 examined scientific studies conducted between 1995 through 2010 to evaluate if a revision was needed
the new , stronger language is a result of emerging evidence that found links between circumcision and decreased risk of urinary tract infections , some kinds of cancer , @entity52 , @entity53 , and other sexually transmitted diseases
parenting.com : why one mom decided to circumcise " the evidence was becoming clearer , and it 's now obvious there 's a preventative effect , " says dr. @entity64 , chairman of the department of pediatrics at @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 , and a member of the @entity1 task force
the circumcision controversy once routine , circumcision rates have been declining since the 1980s
the @entity79 estimate that a little more than half of all infant males are circumcised now , although that figure is likely low since it only counts in - hospital circumcisions
globally , about 30 % of men are circumcised , although rates range drastically from country to country
passionate opponents of circumcision , who sometimes describe themselves as " intactivists , " call the procedure barbaric and liken it to female genital cutting
the internet , and its increasing use as a resource for medical decisions , has helped anti-circumcision groups get their message out
" we believe that circumcision of children violates numerous legal rights of the child and is highly unethical , if not unlawful , " said a public notice posted by doctors opposing circumcision in anticipation of the @entity1 's announcement
some groups have even tried to make the practice illegal
activists in @entity111 proposed a measure to ban circumcision , but it was struck down by @entity115 governor @entity114
courts in @entity117 recently called circumcision " grievous bodily harm , " and ruled that the " fundamental right of the child to bodily integrity outweighed the fundamental rights of the parents
" because circumcision is such a sensitive issue , moral or religious concerns might be more important than medical studies to many parents
" it 's a reduction of risk , not an elimination , " says @entity64
" we recognize some people have very strong personal feelings about this issue , and those should be used in any decision - making
" what the research revealed many studies on the benefits of circumcision have been performed in @entity142 , where , because of the prevalence of @entity53 and other stds , the effect can be seen more quickly
the task force found evidence that circumcision has a preventative effect on : @entity53 : studies in @entity142 and a @entity79 math model study found that circumcision reduces hiv infection among heterosexual men
parenting.com : @entity156 decides not to circumcise his sons @entity52 : another @entity142 study found that circumcision reduces the spread of human papillomavirus , some strains of which can cause cervical cancer in women
other sexually transmitted diseases : a variety of studies suggest that circumcision is linked with decreased risk of contracting syphilis and genital herpes
@entity172 : although still uncommon for boys , utis are more common among uncircumcised males in the first year of life
treatment at this age can be painful and require hospitalization
penile cancer : an association was found between circumcision and decreased risk of this rare type of cancer
prostate cancer : a new study suggests that circumcision could be tied to a slightly lower rate of prostate cancer
while critics say circumcision decreases sexual pleasure , there are currently no scientific studies to support this claim
in fact , study participants in @entity142 who had been circumcised as adults reported either no effect or increased pleasure
insurance implications one major impetus for new policy , according to @entity64 , was to send a message to state lawmakers that circumcision should be an option for all families
currently , medicaid programs in 18 states in the @entity212 do not provide coverage for routine circumcision of infant boys , and so " families who could not afford it were having the decision made for them , " says @entity64
in fact , over time , a higher circumcision rate might actually save money
a new study from researchers at @entity224 found that not circumcising would result in an average of $ 313 per person in related health costs over a lifetime -- an extra $ 2 billion at current circumcision rates
however , opponents of circumcision may take issue with taxpayer dollars being used to pay for a procedure they find immoral
despite the @entity1 's recommendation , universal coverage is unlikely to be a reality any time soon , as states look for ways to cut back
" i 'm concerned 2012 is not the best environment for getting state lawmakers add additional health care costs to @entity10 , " says @entity64
