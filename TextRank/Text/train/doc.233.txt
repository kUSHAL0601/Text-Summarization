@entity1 refugee camp , @entity2 -- i 've spent the past week working in the @entity1 refugee camp in northern @entity2 , about six miles from the @entity7 border
the camp was opened less than a month ago to receive @entity7 fleeing the violence in their country
built on a barren desert plain without a tree or shrub in sight , it can seem an unwelcoming place to arrive , even for a refugee
dust storms and scorching heat have taken their toll on refugees and aid workers here
but given that less than 4 % of @entity2 land is arable the terrain is not a surprise
over 20,000 @entity7 refugees have moved into @entity1 camp already , and the pace of new arrivals to the camp has more than doubled , with more than 14,000 arriving in the past week alone
yesterday , we received over 3,000 new arrivals overnight , up from an average of 600 per day just last week
the refugee flow to @entity2 has a direct correlation with the situation inside @entity7
as fighting has escalated around @entity7 's southern city of @entity43 , where the uprising began almost 18 months ago , the number of refugees here is increasing dramatically
we are all bracing for a potentially massive influx in the coming days
yesterday , i met many newly - arrived refugees , some just children , who told me how had they witnessed family members and neighbors being killed in @entity7
one 7 - year old girl told me she saw her neighbor 's throat cut in front of her
her family fled in the dark of night , walking several hours before they could cross into @entity2
like every refugee i have met here , they were n't able to bring any belongings -- they came with only the clothes on their backs
humanitarian aid organizations and @entity66 agencies have been working around the clock to accommodate the sudden increase in new arrivals of refugees , while also working to improve the conditions
but the camp is growing exponentially and it is hard to keep up
i met with camp manager @entity74 of the @entity75 yesterday -- he told me , " we need more of everything
" more tents , improved water systems , more safe spaces and playgrounds for children and psycho - social counseling for children who have been traumatized are all top priorities
i have spoken with many mothers here , and most report that their children have terrible nightmares and are not behaving normally -- either they are being very aggressive and misbehaving , or they are silent and afraid , running and hiding at any loud noise
@entity91 , a refugee mother of five children , told me that when her family was trying to escape to @entity2 , they were shot at and her eldest son , @entity93 , was hit in the head by a bullet
the blood from his wound sprayed on his younger brother who is just 6 - years old
@entity93 survived and they made it across the border , but his little brother often wakes up screaming " there is blood on my shirt
" @entity91 does n't have any money to buy new clothes , so the little boy still wears the blood - stained shirt from that night
nearly half of the camps ' residents are children , and there is next to nothing for children to do here
providing an outlet for kids who have been through unimaginable , violent events and left everything they know behind is critical to helping them recover and just be kids
we have built one playground and another is almost completed
there are also child - friendly spaces that offer activities to kids
they are hard to miss in the camp -- just follow the unexpected sound of laughter and you will find swarms of kids singing , swinging , sliding and occasionally arguing over who 's turn it is
more playgrounds and child - friendly spaces are being planned as the camp population grows
improvements to the camp continue despite the massive amount of work going into accommodating new arrivals
the quality of the food has been a major complaint from many refugees in the camps
currently , they receive hot , pre-cooked meals that are distributed throughout the camp , but now communal kitchens are being built so families can cook for themselves
electricity is now installed in 40 per cent of the camp , making life a bit easier
charging mobile phones seems to be the primary use so far , based on what i have seen in the tents i visit
dust and sand storms are one of the greatest challenges of living in the camps
it is not just a discomfort , but it has become a health issue and camp doctors report that they are seeing many cases of respiratory problems , especially in infants and small children , due to the dust
many days it is hard to see more than a few meters in front of you in the camp , as the air is thick with sand and debris that is carried by the strong winds that blow through the barren camp
one mother told me , " not even a camel could live in this place , it is so hot and dusty
" the camp has been bringing in tons of gravel that is being spread on the ground to help alleviate the problem
water is one of the most pressing long - term issue that faces the refugees , as well as the local @entity2 communities
@entity2 has inadequate fresh water supplies for its own population , and the refugee community is putting increased demands on an already short supply
water is currently being trucked into the camps from local wells in the community , but @entity213 will be drilling a new well and developing a water system with other organizations that will serve the camp , and alleviate the need to take scarce water from the host community
the work ahead , to provide all the desperately needed services for the refugees is daunting , but it is under way
each day i am in the camp i see progress being made , even as we struggle to meet the pressing needs of all the new arrivals
no one knows how long the camp will be here and when the @entity7 refugees will be able to go home
many anticipate it will be a long haul , but all of us , especially the @entity7 here , are hopeful they can return soon
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .
