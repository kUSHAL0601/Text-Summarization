-- this week , @entity0 is exploring @entity2 exceptionalism -- the concept that the @entity2 is exceptional when compared to other nations and is uniquely destined to bring democracy to the world
that notion of @entity2 exceptionalism was promoted by the nation 's founders and earliest leaders
it 's especially evident in the places where the @entity13 first landed and built their first settlements , where explorers traveled westward to fulfill the country 's manifest destiny , and to purchase or take land by force
" the @entity2 sites that evoke a sense of @entity2 exceptionalism are many ; they include places that mark the history of our struggles to secure and protect liberty , and places that evoke the promise and opportunity that generations have found in @entity2 , " says @entity20 , a @entity21 history professor , a senior fellow at @entity21 's @entity23 and author of " @entity25 : first among @entity39 , " " @entity38 : a @entity40 " and other early @entity2 history books
we asked several @entity2 historians where they enjoy exploring the history of the @entity2
here are some of their favorite spots : @entity50 there 's nothing wrong with enjoying some of the @entity2 ' more well - known monuments to its history
a trip to @entity50 could include a visit to the @entity57 , the @entity58 , the @entity59 and the @entity60
the @entity61 displays the @entity62 , the @entity63 and the @entity64
( if this history lesson bores the children , promise them a visit to the @entity68 later
the site of the first permanent @entity74 settlement in @entity2 , the 1607 @entity69 colony is still revealing new information about the site
" just last year @entity69 announced the discovery of the remains of the first protestant church built in @entity2 , the church where the @entity82 princess @entity83 was baptized and married to @entity84 in 1614 , " @entity20 says
" when i visited the site a few years ago , i found it quite moving to stand on the banks of the @entity87 and think of the tiny band of @entity74 settlers arriving there , not having any idea the epic history of @entity2 that was to follow
" the @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95
if you want to see where the @entity97 first made a home in the @entity99 and the @entity100 that symbolizes their journey , join the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit @entity104 each year
if you want to see where the @entity97 first landed in november 1620 and spent a few weeks before heading to @entity100 , head to @entity94 , on the tip of @entity107 completed in 1910 commemorates the landing , their five - week stay and the creation and signing of the @entity113
founding father @entity25 retired to @entity114 after a lifetime of public service , including five terms as @entity70 governor and 25 years in the @entity70 state legislature
@entity25 resumed his private legal practice and died at @entity114 in 1799
" in the quiet rolling hills of @entity124 , @entity70 , that surround @entity114 , you can appreciate the attraction the land held for [ @entity25 and many of the @entity127 ] , " @entity20 says
" you can also better appreciate the quiet , grinding tragedy of @entity2 slavery in this environment ; slaves toiled on the @entity114 plantation , enabling @entity25 and the other founders ' @entity2 dreams
there are so many places to explore where @entity140 and @entity141 first searched for a water route to the @entity143 starting in 1804
@entity145 professor @entity144 found some of their history at the @entity149 while sorting through correspondence between @entity141 and fur traders for her last book
" these were @entity137 's ' before the trip letters ' , " says @entity144 , who won the @entity154 this year for her book " @entity156 , and @entity157
" " i literally could n't believe i was touching @entity141 's handwriting
following his career after his famous trip , i listen to him get very upset about what was happening to the @entity163 people after the @entity164
" ( @entity141 served as @entity163 superintendent for everyone west of the @entity167 for many years , she says
) the @entity169 's @entity168 crosses 11 states , while the @entity171 also incorporates state parks in @entity50 and @entity173
about five miles south of @entity175 , @entity173 , @entity174 marks the 1805 - 06 winter encampment of the expedition
in the middle of the @entity182 , @entity180 passed and president @entity183 signed into law the @entity185 , which granted 160 acres of free land to citizens and people applying to become citizens who fulfilled certain requirements
( the rules had the effect of disqualifying citizens of the @entity194 , which had left the @entity195 to join the @entity196 , until legislation was passed in 1866 allowing them to apply
) it 's the 150th anniversary of the act , which is commemorated by the @entity178 in southeast @entity179
this list by no means covers all of the possible sites embodying @entity2 exceptionalism
where are some of your favorite sites in @entity2 history and why do you enjoy them ?
