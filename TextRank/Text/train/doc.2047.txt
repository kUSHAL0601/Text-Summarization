@entity0 -- the security situation in war - ravaged @entity4 shows no sign of improvement as fighting has intensified between rebel groups and the @entity11 government , the @entity0 @entity2 was told tuesday
" we are alarmed , " @entity13 ambassador @entity12 said after hearing the report
" this deteriorating security situation is unacceptable and it needs to be effectively addressed
" @entity0 @entity17 ban ki - moon pointed out in his latest report that incidents of violence over recent months have surpassed bloodshed in the same time period last year by far
" may was in fact the deadliest month in @entity4 since @entity24 [ joint @entity0 - @entity26 mission ] has deployed , " @entity22 said
about 400 people lost their lives in may and another estimated 160 died by the government 's aerial bombardment in june , officials said
envoy @entity32 said @entity0 staffers and aid agencies are frequently denied access by the government in @entity37 to the areas where fighting is taken place
@entity41 criticized the @entity11 government for failing to investigate and prosecute cases where peacekeepers are attacked
" the @entity4 process is at a critical juncture , " @entity32 said
" at precisely the same time as as the security situation has deteriorated , prospects for a negotiated settlement appear to have improved slightly
" the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) is currently meeting with the @entity11 government in @entity52
" this has provided an important boost to the process , " @entity32 said
@entity56 ( @entity57 ) , however , has walked out on the @entity52 talks and started attacking the government again , @entity32 told the council
the faction of the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) under @entity63 has tried to take advantage of this renewed fighting and attacked the @entity11 forces as well
the rebels have said the government favors @entity69 over black @entity70
the two big movements , @entity57 and @entity62 are not participating in the talks , sabotaging the peace process
@entity32 asked the @entity2 to appeal again to the movements to join the negotiations so that an arrangement can be hashed out before the end of this year
the @entity2 has to decide later this week if the mandate of @entity24 will be extended for another year
@entity41 recommended that the mission continues to " expand the work that it has painstakingly begun
