@entity0 -- @entity3 government ministers fought back sunday against accusations they had taken their eye off the @entity7 security ball , rejecting accusations they were warned nearly a year ago about the security giant contracted to provide guards for the @entity11
@entity12 , the security contractor , admitted on wednesday that it would not be able to provide more than 10,000 security staffers by the time the @entity14 begin in less than two weeks
the government hurriedly announced it would bring in 3,500 military personnel to boost security for the @entity11
sports secretary @entity18 said sunday it should be no surprise that some contractors were unable to meet their commitments
" it 's completely normal that you 're going to find some contractors on a project of this size who are n't going to be able to deliver what they promised , " he said on the @entity25 's @entity24 show
he praised the contractor as being " honorable " for having admitted the problem , apologizing and covering the costs of bringing in military personnel
and he reiterated that the government learned only last week that @entity12 would not meet its commitment
" @entity40 told us right up until last week that everything was on track , " @entity18 said
the contractor said saturday it stands to lose up to $ 77 million after failing to recruit enough staff
also on sunday , the @entity46 rejected a newspaper report that it had been cautioned about @entity12 in september of last year
the @entity46 , which is responsible for domestic security , said it was " inaccurate " that a report by the police watchdog agency @entity53 " should have raised alarm bells about the readiness of @entity12
" the report " into @entity14 security preparedness -- which has never been published -- raised serious issues over @entity12 last year , " the @entity54 said
" while an early inspection highlighted issues to be addressed , a report in february 2012 said that @entity62 was on track to deliver the required number of security personnel , " the @entity46 said in a statement
@entity62 is the @entity66 , which is running the @entity11
@entity12 chief executive @entity67 said saturday he was " deeply disappointed " the firm was unable to live up to its contract with @entity62
" we clearly took in a contract in good faith , " @entity67 said
" we were a vital part of securing the games
the military would have to be called in to help us through that process
we know a number of these soldiers had had to cancel leave to come back and help us with the process ... we feel we caused a huge problem
" @entity67 acknowledged the company was at fault and said it was grateful the military is providing support
" we are sorry they had to give up leave , truly , " he said
" it is down to @entity12 ... we were contracted to deliver staff
we should have done that
" @entity14 organizer defends security contractor the military deployment means that 17,000 military personnel will be on duty in the @entity3 during the @entity11 , compared with the 9,500 currently in @entity96
a @entity98 spokesman said the security operation will not impact operations in @entity96 , which is the main effort for the military
some personnel who would have had leave over the @entity7 period will have the leave rescheduled , the spokesman said
@entity12 had been expected to recruit a staff of about 10,400 as part of a total security force of 23,700 for the @entity7 and @entity11
the staffers were to provide venue perimeter security , including manning x-ray machines , conducting spectator and vehicle searches and operating closed - circuit television , said @entity12 spokesman @entity117
the contractor said this week that while 4,000 are already at work across 100 venues , more than 9,000 are still going through the training and vetting process
in a statement saturday , the company said it had " encountered significant difficulties in processing applicants in sufficient numbers through the necessary training , vetting and accreditation procedures
as a result , we will be unable to deliver all of the necessary workforce numbers
" @entity3 : 3,500 extra troops called in for @entity7 security that failure is likely to cost the firm between Â £ 35m and Â £ 50m ( $ 54 million - $ 77 million ) , it said
@entity12 " deeply regrets that , despite the relentless efforts of so many of its people , it is unlikely to deliver in full its obligations to @entity62 , to the government and to everyone with an interest in these games
" @entity3 is on a heightened state of alert ahead of the @entity11 , which open on july 27
home secretary @entity150 said thursday that " there is no question of @entity7 security being compromised
" but opposition lawmakers have described the situation as a " shambles , " saying it raises concerns over the government 's grip on the preparations for the @entity14 and @entity161
@entity62 chairman @entity162 said friday he was " extraordinarily impressed with " private contractor @entity12 so far
@entity162 said he was happy with the security staff on site and that while @entity12 has " challenges , " it would get there
@entity7 organizers have agreed to give 10,000 tickets to the armed forces to compensate for the short - notice deployment , the @entity98 said
the questions over security staff come as @entity3 gears up to welcome many of the visiting teams ' officials this weekend ahead of the athletes ' arrival on monday
one headache was removed for organizers with the reopening friday of the main highway linking @entity183 airport with central @entity0
the busy @entity184 had been closed for a week for emergency repairs to a viaduct
is olympic - level security already under way in @entity3 ? @entity1 's @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .
