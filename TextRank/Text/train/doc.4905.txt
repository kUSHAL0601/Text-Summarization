-- @entity1 warned tuesday it would strike against an " enemy " threatening it if needed to protect its national interests -- even if the enemy did n't attack first
gen. @entity6 , a deputy head of @entity1 's armed forces , said his country " will no more wait to see enemy action against us , " according to the semi-official @entity11
" given this strategy , we will make use of all our means to protect our national interests and hit a retaliatory blow at them whenever we feel that enemies want to endanger our national interests , " @entity6 said
5 voices : will tensions lead to war ? @entity11 added that in november , @entity28 ayatollah @entity27 had " warned enemies about @entity1 's tough response to any aggression or even threat
" " @entity1 is not a nation to sit still and just observe threats from fragile materialist powers which are being eaten by worms from inside , " @entity27 told students at a military college in @entity31 , according to @entity11
" anyone who harbors any thought of invading the @entity1 -- or even if the thought crosses their mind -- should be prepared to receive strong blows and the steel fists of the military , the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , and the @entity46 ( volunteer ) force , backed by the entire @entity1 nation , " @entity27 said , according to the report
@entity6 's remarks come amid high tensions between @entity1 and much of the world
the @entity53 , @entity55 powers , and @entity56 have helped lead efforts to pressure @entity1 into taking part in serious negotiations over its nuclear program
@entity1 insists its program is for civilian purposes , but numerous countries are concerned @entity31 is working to build a nuclear weapons arsenal
@entity56 has made clear it is considering an attack on @entity1 's nuclear program
both countries often openly antagonize each other
on sunday , @entity31 cut off crude exports to @entity73 and @entity74 companies in retaliation for a new round of sanctions imposed on the regime
officials with the @entity80 , the @entity82 's nuclear watchdog , began a second round of talks monday with @entity1 officials
the @entity80 said the talks were an opportunity to get more clarity about the " possible military dimensions to @entity1 's nuclear program
