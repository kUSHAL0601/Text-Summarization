@entity0 -- @entity3 gov. @entity2 once again flashed the pugnacious attitude that 's made him a gladiator to some and a bully to others on wednesday , telling a heckler to " sit down and shut up
" the heckler was criticizing @entity2 's handling of @entity11 on the second anniversary of the storm that devastated the state 's coastline
he held a sign that said : " @entity17 families back in their home -- finish the job
" the @entity21 group @entity20 posted a video of the incident
@entity2 warned the man that things would " get very interesting and very fun " if he did n't sit down -- but the heckler , seated in the front row during a speech in @entity29 , was n't deterred
" i 'd be more than happy to have a debate with you any time you like , guy , ' cause somebody like you does n't know a damn thing about what you 're talking about except to stand up and show off when the cameras are here , " @entity2 said
" i 've been here when the cameras are n't here , buddy , and done the work
" @entity2 told the man he 's " glad you had your day to show off , " but that he needed to " turn around , get your 15 minutes of fame and then maybe take your jacket off , roll up your sleeves and maybe do something for the people of this state
" and @entity2 went on : " so listen , you want to have the conversation later , i 'm happy to have it , buddy
but until that time , sit down and shut up
" the man appeared to speak directly to @entity2 , with @entity2 acknowledging him , before the man moved out of the crowd
" i 'll tell ya , " @entity2 said in apparent response to the man , " there 's about a thousand things i 'll do tonight
going to dinner with you is about number thousand and one
" local news outlets identified the man as @entity67 , a former @entity68 councilman whose history of protests includes being deported from @entity71 after railing against @entity74 's labor practices in the country .
