-- @entity1 's week went from bad to worse saturday
three days after it was ousted by @entity2 in the @entity4 quarterfinals , @entity1 lost 1 - 0 at lowly @entity5 in @entity7 's @entity6 to give @entity2 's second club a huge boost in the title race
@entity2 can move four points clear of @entity1 on sunday , a lead that would render the teams ' clash on the final day of the season meaningless -- if @entity16 is out of contention
@entity16 replaced @entity1 in second by defeating @entity19 4 - 0 at home later saturday but was still without the injured @entity21
@entity16 has 79 points to match @entity2 , though trails through head - to - head record and has played a game more
a combination of inspired goalkeeping by backup @entity28 and @entity1 misses -- from the likes of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 -- ensured a night of frustration for @entity35 's men , who must pick themselves up in time for wednesday 's @entity37 final against @entity16
a headline on @entity1 's website saturday proclaimed , ' the ball did n't want to go in
' @entity1 registered nearly 30 shots but only one player scored in the game : @entity44 in the 16th minute
@entity5 entered saturday three points above the relegation zone
" this is a step backwards , " @entity32 told @entity47
" sometimes it 's hard to find an explanation when you lose but we just could n't get the goal
" teams like @entity5 who are playing for their @entity6 survival live and die on chances like the one they scored but that was too much punishment for us
" we tried everything we could to score
it hurts having taken this step backwards with so few matches left
" surging @entity2 visits third - last @entity67 on sunday , hoping to take three more points
@entity67 has won once in the league since the end of november
@entity71 wins the @entity73 classic after winning the league title in record time in late march , @entity74 lost its lengthy unbeaten streak , lost in the league for the first time this season and , some would say , struggled to eliminate @entity81 in the @entity4 quarterfinals
saturday saw another wobble , as @entity74 was soundly beaten by @entity71 3 - 0 at home in @entity73 's biggest club game
for @entity71 , meanwhile , it was the perfect response to exiting in the @entity4 this week to @entity16
@entity87 -- guilty of a miss or two against @entity16 in the second leg when another @entity71 goal would have forced extra time -- @entity92 and @entity93 scored for @entity71
@entity74 ended the evening with 10 men after @entity95 was given a straight red for striking @entity87 in the face in added time but worse news for @entity74 was keeper @entity101 's calf injury
he had to be substituted at halftime
@entity74 and @entity71 are expected to meet again this season , in the @entity105 finale .
