bombs exploded near two shuttered embassies in @entity2 thursday morning , according to state media and eyewitness accounts
@entity7 state media , citing witnesses , said a car bomb exploded near the @entity10 embassy in central @entity2
the second blast occurred near the embassy of the @entity13 in the western part of the capital , according to residents
no injuries were reported in either blast , but photos posted to social media appeared to show extensive damage around both buildings
a resident who lives near the @entity13 embassy said in a social media posting that the blast shattered some windows in nearby buildings
the explosions come a day after bombings killed at least five and wounded more than a dozen in two eastern @entity7 cities that are strongholds for @entity7 's @entity33 government
most embassies in @entity7 have closed due to the ongoing fighting there between @entity37 and the internationally recognized government more than three years after rebels -- backed by @entity41 aircraft -- toppled the regime of @entity43
in august , @entity47 @entity45 and @entity46 officials said they believed @entity10 and the @entity13 had been carrying out secret airstrikes against @entity50 militants
@entity10 officials have denied any involvement in @entity7 airstrikes .
