-- bordered by @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , and with a heritage of diverse influences including a long period of @entity9 colonial rule and an economically powerful @entity11 community , @entity1 is one of the most multicultural nations in southeast @entity14
comprised of two regions separated by 640 miles of the @entity17 , with @entity1 to the west and @entity20 @entity19 to the east , the country is a federation of 13 states that is home to an estimated population of 25.7 million people
from the 18th until to the 20th century , the region formed part of what was loosely known as @entity9 @entity30 -- a divided collection of colonized states
by 1948 , these @entity9 - ruled territories were bought together under a single administration called the @entity35 , which gained independence in 1957
@entity1 was formed in 1963 when the former @entity9 colonies of @entity38 and the states of @entity40 and @entity41 on the northern coast of neighboring @entity19 also joined
the country 's infancy was dogged by @entity46 insurgency , @entity3 confrontation with @entity1 over claims to the island of @entity19 , @entity51 claims to @entity40 , and @entity38 's secession from the @entity53 in 1965
with a strictly neutral attitude towards foreign affairs , @entity1 has since enjoyed a sustained period of relatively untroubled international relations
however , the multi-religious , multi-ethnic nation has still had to contend with its own internal tensions
ethnic malays make up 50 percent of the population , @entity11 a further 23 percent , with @entity63 and indigenous peoples forming the remainder , according to the @entity66
in 1969 anti-chinese riots took place amidst growing frustration over the economic success of ethnic @entity11 in @entity1
this led to a controversial policy of positive discrimination , which saw minimum quotas introduced for @entity61 in business , education and the civil service
during the 22 - year term of prime minister @entity79 -- between 1981 and 2003 -- the country diversified from dependence on exports of raw materials such as palm oil , tin , petroleum and gas , to expansion in manufacturing , services , and tourism
today the bustling capital of @entity93 , a former tin - mining town , is dominated by gleaming skyscrapers
among them are the tallest twin buildings in the world -- the @entity98 -- a potent symbol of @entity1 's development
although the country 's export trade was hit hard by the loss of demand accompanying the global downturn , @entity1 remains one of @entity14 's " most vibrant economies , " according to the @entity66
having won every election since independence , the @entity108 national coalition dominates the political landscape -- which operates under a constitutional monarchy based on the @entity9 parliamentary model
after winning the 2004 general election by a landslide , however , the coalition was returned to power in 2008 with a significantly reduced majority
for the first time since 1957 , the ruling alliance lost its two - thirds majority of the seats in @entity123 ( required to amend the @entity124 ) , and five of 13 federal states to the three opposition parties , which together form the @entity128 coalition
despite this apparent political sea - change , a series of defections from other parties and by - election results since 2008 have left the @entity127 just five seats short of regaining their two - thirds majority
@entity1 's large @entity138 population live alongside people of other religions including @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143
the rich mix of ethnicity , religions and historical influences is most vividly displayed in the nation 's lively and animated culture
the self - styled " @entity155 " , @entity1 boasts hundreds of colorful celebrations throughout the year , ranging from religious holidays like " @entity152 " to secular parades such as the " @entity154 "
@entity1 is home to a @entity157 cultural world heritage site covering two towns
@entity161 and @entity162 , in @entity160 state , are " exceptional examples of multi-cultural trading towns in @entity14 , " says the prestigious @entity166 body
" [ they are ] forged from the mercantile exchanges of @entity30 , @entity11 , and @entity63 cultures and three successive @entity171 colonial powers for almost 500 years , each with its imprints on the architecture and urban form , technology and monumental art. " displaying the same fertile blend of influences , @entity1 has " one of the best assortments of delicious cuisines in the world , " according to the @entity182 travel guide
a smorgasbord of @entity190 flavors , with dishes that include beef rendang ( richly spiced dry beef curry ) and nasi goreng ( spicy , stir - fried rice ) , @entity1 's trade commission hopes that the national cuisine will eventually become one of the world 's most sought after
@entity1 's natural habitat is even more diverse than its culture
according to the @entity202 , it is one of the 17 " megadiverse " countries which together harbor more than 70 percent of the earth 's species
over 58 percent of the land is occupied by tropical rainforests , that include long stretches of peat swamps and mangroves
tourism is booming in @entity1 and , as the @entity214 sums up , it 's not difficult to understand why : " @entity217 island resorts and endless white , sandy beaches offer a taste of paradise , while beneath warm coral seas , world - class dive sites await exploration
@entity224 , the oldest rainforest in the world , city skyscrapers and majestic mosques and temples , plus a gorgeous coastline are enough to tempt even the most jaded visitor
