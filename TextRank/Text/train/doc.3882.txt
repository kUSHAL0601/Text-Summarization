-- @entity2 president @entity1 has leapt to the defense of the @entity6 @entity5 team following @entity8 's controversial win at the @entity10 @entity9 on sunday , accusing its critics of hypocrisy
@entity2 was fined $ 100,000 by motorsport 's ruling body the @entity13 , and referred to the @entity15 for further investigation after race stewards deemed it had breached rules banning team orders to drivers at @entity22
@entity24 's @entity23 , who was leading @entity8 at the front going into lap 49 of 67 , appeared to allow his @entity2 teammate to pass him to win the race
but @entity1 told @entity2 's official website : " enough of this hypocrisy
the result is down to the efforts of all our people , who never give up
" now we have to continue working like this , to improve the car so that it is competitive at all the circuits we will encounter
" @entity2 fined as @entity8 denies @entity23 in @entity22 controversy @entity1 said the move was common practice within the @entity6 team
" i simply reaffirm what i have always maintained , which is that our drivers are very well aware , and it is something they have to stick to , that if one races for @entity2 , then the interests of the team come before those of the individual , " he said
" in any case , these things have happened since the days of [ 1930s driver @entity53 , and i experienced it myself when i was sporting director , in the days of @entity56 and not just then
" @entity8 's win put the two - time world champion back into contention for this year 's title
the 29 - year - old is now within 34 points of championship leader @entity63 of @entity64 while @entity23 , who finished second on sunday , remains eighth with eight races left
@entity8 , who also won in @entity66 , secured his second win of the @entity5 calendar after @entity23 let him pass shortly after receiving a coded message by race engineer @entity70 via his car radio
@entity70 was heard saying to @entity23 : " @entity8 is faster than you
can you confirm you understand ? " once @entity8 overtook him , an apologetic @entity70 added : " good lad -- just stick with it now , sorry
" @entity5 championship standings after @entity22 the incident seemed to be a tactical decision by @entity2 , with @entity8 leading @entity23 by 31 points in the overall standings before the race
despite the @entity6 team claiming it was not a team order , race stewards decided @entity2 was in breach of @entity86 which states that " team orders which interfere with a race result are prohibited "
it has since instigated widespread criticism within the sport , with @entity92 boss @entity91 telling @entity94 race broadcaster the @entity95 afterwards that " it 's wrong for the sport
