-- on the face of saturday 's qualifying results , @entity2 's hopes of closing the gap on the all - conquering @entity4 at the @entity8 team 's home grand prix seem as distant as they have most of this season
@entity12 will start sunday 's race at @entity14 fifth on the grid , and a place behind teammate @entity17 , while @entity18 and @entity19 will have the front row to themselves
@entity12 , 46 points behind @entity23 championship leader @entity18 , had appeared to make up ground on the @entity25 in the morning practice session but qualifying did not go to plan
the @entity28 had hoped to use " towing " tactics behind @entity17 to boost his lap times , but the @entity32 got too far ahead in the third session and ended up setting a faster pace
@entity23 interactive : @entity14 @entity12 was heard complaining on his team radio , " @entity17 is too far away ! " -- and then reportedly called his crew " idiots , " though he said it was actually " geniuses
" however , the two - time world champion later downplayed the incident and insisted he was happier this weekend than after the previous race in @entity44 , where @entity12 qualified ninth and @entity17 10th
" here at @entity14 the slipstreaming strategy is often used : having a car three to four seconds ahead of you allows you to gain a few tenths and for that i must thank @entity17 , especially in @entity53 when i came up behind @entity55 's @entity54 and he waited for me , " @entity12 , @entity12 , who won the race for @entity2 in 2010 and @entity46 in 2007 , said on his team 's website
" the radio messages have been misunderstood , as is often the case when you do n't experience something first hand : the word ' genius ' refers to the fact that we could have got out before @entity64 had gone by on his quick lap , but this should not raise any doubts about the impeccable job from the whole team
" today , we were able to run competitively in all three sessions and get closer than ever before to the rear wings of the @entity72
for the first time , there are not so many cars between them and us
" nevertheless , @entity12 's best time of one minute 24.142 seconds was well adrift of @entity18 's 1:23.755 , while @entity19 clocked 1:23.968
@entity18 is seeking his third victory at @entity14 , having won there in 2008 with @entity54 and again in 2011 on the way to his second of three consecutive world titles
" we did n't expect to be so strong here , with both cars on the front row , " he said after earning his fourth pole this season
" we 've had years where we 've had a good car , but not a car that 's competitive in low downforce trim , so in that regard we did our homework
" @entity92 , whose @entity93 is powered by a @entity2 engine , provided the surprise of the day as he clinched third place on the grid in 1:24.065
" i did n't expect that after a very difficult friday , " said the @entity25 , whose teammate @entity98 qualified 17th but will start a place higher following @entity102 's penalty
" yesterday we struggled a lot with the car and the guys have done a fantastic job turning it around to give me such a competitive car today
" while @entity92 boosted his chances of a best finish since placing eighth in @entity113 in march , @entity109 boss @entity108 lamented his team 's worst qualifying performance this season
@entity117 missed final qualifying for the first time in 67 races , and will start 12th on the grid after his run of four successive pole positions ended in miserable style
@entity64 was back in sixth , having missed most of the morning practice due to hydraulics problems
" that was our worst qualifying session of the year , " @entity108 said
" with the standards we set ourselves , that makes this result a real disappointment
" @entity117 refused to blame @entity102 for the incident that cost the @entity134 driver a three - place penalty , demoting the @entity25 to 17th as punishment for impeding the @entity138 driver as he tried to set a timed lap. " i just did n't get a lap together in @entity143 today and it 's hugely disappointing , not just for me , but also for the team and i can only apologize to them as we had a quick car today , " said the 2008 world champion , who won the race last year while at @entity46
" i came off at @entity147 on my first run which damaged the car and it was a downward spiral from there really
" @entity152 , who will replace his fellow @entity153 @entity19 at @entity4 next season , bounced back from a difficult friday by qualifying seventh for @entity54 -- his teammate @entity55 was 10th
@entity46 's struggles continued , with @entity159 eighth and 2009 world champion @entity160 ninth
@entity163 's title hopes receded even further as the @entity164 was back in 11th for @entity165 , with teammate @entity166 13th .
