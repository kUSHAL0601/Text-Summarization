@entity0 , @entity1 -- storms were forecast saturday for areas already suffering from the swollen @entity5 , as @entity1 's governor urged caution
the rain comes as the @entity5 was cresting in @entity9 , @entity1
the water was cresting at 61.8 feet , or 13.8 feet above flood stage there , according to the @entity13
there were some early signs of recovery farther north in @entity0 , where the river had already crested , though the floodwaters are expected to remain for weeks
the @entity21 backwater levee near @entity0 had hit its peak , @entity2 affiliate @entity19 reported
" these levees are going to be more and more saturated every day
there will be continuing wave action up against them and so people should n't drop their guard , " gov. @entity24 told reporters in @entity26 friday
although many displaced residents in @entity0 are eager to return to their homes , until the water level recedes , only emergency officials will be allowed , @entity19 reported
" it is illegal to drive a boat in flooded areas and it will remain so until that executive order is lifted , which wo n't be soon , " @entity24 said
the governor also warned of health risks to both the emergency responders and residents
" we 've had reports of water samples where the e. coli level was 200 times normal
this stuff is nasty , " @entity24 said
the governor himself owns a lake home that has been flooded
the @entity5 is not expected to return to its 43 - foot flood stage in @entity0 until after june 14 , which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks , said @entity59 , a @entity13 hydrologist
it crested at 57.1 feet thursday
the river is more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927
" we 're in need of , first off , a place to live
and then second off , pretty much everything you would need in a home , " evacuee @entity68 told @entity2 affiliate wapt
@entity0 resident @entity73 told the station his home had several feet of water in it
" in a way , it feels like a big loss , but with @entity81 you ca n't do anything about it , " he said , @entity77 reported
severe storms are likely saturday and sunday in the @entity5 , @entity84 and @entity86 valleys
up to 3 inches of rain per hour are possible , with heavier storms on sunday
the rain could lead to secondary crests and higher crests along the @entity1 from @entity93 , @entity94 , southward , @entity2 meteorologist @entity89 said
some greeted the cresting floodwaters -- which have damaged hundreds of homes and displaced 2,000 @entity0 residents -- with relief
others just went to work
@entity102 , owner of @entity104 's @entity103 in @entity0 , told @entity2 affiliate @entity105 that his business has picked up some with the floods
" we stay busy most days anyway , but there 's been a lot of people downtown , " he said
" i see a lot of local people
some of them are tourists
everybody wants to come see the water
" local officials caution that some area residents may have to wait to return to their homes
flooded houses pose a variety of dangers , they said
rising floodwaters bring debris , hazardous waste and gas leaks , and force snakes or other potentially dangerous animals from their habitats and into residential areas
" right now we 're moving to the recovery stage , " @entity0 mayor @entity132 told @entity2
" our first priority , i believe , should be public safety , to continue to encourage our residents and onlookers to stay free of the water
" law enforcement officials are patrolling evacuated areas to help ensure that abandoned homes and businesses are n't burglarized , @entity132 said
and each flooded property must be assessed before an owner can return to it , he said
@entity148 , which includes @entity0 , has " several hundred homes that have water " and about 2,000 residents have been displaced , sheriff @entity147 said
county residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do , but none have experienced it at this magnitude , according to @entity147
a slide was detected on the mainline @entity1 levee at @entity160 , the @entity161 said thursday
that occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded , spokeswoman @entity162 said
crews are working around the clock to help fill the gaps
if the levee fails , thousands of homes and more than one million acres would be flooded , according to @entity172 , the @entity173 's chief engineer
" so it 's very important we hold this levee together , " he said
farther south , where the @entity5 has not yet crested , residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by
@entity181 gov. @entity180 has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding stemming from the @entity184 , where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing @entity187 farther downstream
so far , the @entity190 has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags , 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric - lined baskets , the governor 's office said
approximately 1,150 @entity196 members have been mobilized
mandatory evacuations were in effect saturday in @entity200 and the @entity201 , the @entity197 said
officials will decide whether evacuations are needed in @entity203 on monday
spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks , meaning it will be some time before the river falls below flood stage , allowing evacuees to return
the flood is the most significant to hit the lower @entity5 valley since at least 1937
it has affected nine states so far : @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity94 , @entity84 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity181 and @entity1
@entity2 's @entity218 contributed to this report .
