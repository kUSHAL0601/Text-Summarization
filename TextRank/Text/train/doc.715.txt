@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 keeps a broken teacup tucked away for safekeeping
one day , she will look at it , maybe even smile , and recall how life 's rhythms shifted with the earth in january
she was unlike many of her @entity1 compatriots who were barely squeaking by
she had everything : an education , a decent job as a nurse , a three - bedroom home she rented with her teenage son , who was in school
but when the massive earthquake struck , @entity3 's house collapsed
for the first time in her life , she had nothing
she ran through the streets clutching the hand of her injured son , following the crowd to @entity28 , a large plaza near the heavily damaged presidential palace
she spent the first night sitting on a low concrete wall
in the morning light , she saw the panicked look in the faces of thousands of people and she thought the worst
" life was done , " she said
" there was going to be no tomorrow
" she was well - off
but a natural disaster had plunged her to the depths of poverty
nor are the makeshift camps that sprouted all over the capital
when @entity2 first met @entity3 , just two weeks after the quake , she was sleeping on dirt , under a few sheets of plastic
she had managed to buy a black faux patent leather handbag in which she kept a few personal items : shampoo
and two wallet - size photos of herself and her son that she rescued from the rubble of her house
there was nothing else in her tent
" it was as though i had gone to hell , " she said
@entity3 did not know how to live in squalor
it was not as though she had come from @entity68 , @entity0 's biggest slum , where many people , even before the earthquake , slept under tarps or on the streets
" it was harder for middle - class people like me , " she said
" it 's more difficult for those who had something before
i spent my money on my house , and the rest i saved for the future
" robbed of her privacy , she struggled to attain some kind of dignity
when the private hospital where she worked , the @entity85 , reopened , she made sure to bathe there in the morning and then again before leaving for the night
there , she did not have to wash in public
mornings , afternoons , nights -- they were all the same in the tent city
nothing to do but endure
@entity3 watched the people around her
they lived among flies and filth , but they fed their children and cleaned their tents
they made the most of what they had left : their lives
she understood then that there was a @entity108
and that she , too , had to give thanks that she was not crushed in the rubble and that her son 's injury was not life - threatening
she understood that life was not done
at the end of march , after more than two months in the tent city , @entity3 moved to her sister 's flat when it was deemed safe
there , @entity3 began to feel halfway back to having a proper existence
she has the use of a kitchen , a bathroom
when the city 's flickering electricity is on , she can even watch a bit of television
she sleeps in a netted tent set up behind a locked gate in the front yard
inside are fresh white linens
in late april , when @entity2 caught up with her again , she could manage a smile , but anxiety still defined her face
she did n't know yet how she would regain her life
in @entity1 , she says , there is no such thing as insurance
no one will pay her a cent for the estimated $ 20,000 loss in personal property
she understands why impoverished people in the camps do not want to leave
there , at least , they have access to food , water and basic goods distributed by aid agencies
the wealthy fled the country or are able to sustain themselves otherwise
but for those in the middle , the struggle is particularly hard , @entity3 says
last november , her ex-husband died unexpectedly
he used to help pay expenses for her son
to make matters worse , even private hospitals in @entity0 are suffering because people are flocking to public ones for free service
@entity3 's monthly income , about $ 600 before the quake because she worked two jobs , has dipped to about $ 87 , and rents are sky - high because of the demand for housing
but she will never return to a tent and tarp encampment
" not me , " she says with defiance
" she despised every moment at @entity28 but appreciates the way the experience changed her perspective on life
" i probably spent too much money on making myself and my surroundings beautiful , " she says
she wants to say something else , but the words never leave her lips
she hates that her future is so uncertain
if nothing else , she will leave her job and the city in which she was raised and go to live with her father in the town of @entity191 in western @entity1
she has already sent her son to live with another sister in @entity194 , away from central @entity0
she also sent the broken teacup there
for now , she does n't need to look at it
she does n't need any reminders .
