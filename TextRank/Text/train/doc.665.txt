-- @entity1 has released @entity2 , an update to its mobile os that fixes a series of issues that drained the @entity7 's battery
@entity2 is the first update to @entity1 's @entity9 , which brought the notifications tray , increased performance and @entity12 to the @entity14 , @entity7 and @entity13
in addition to fixing the @entity17 battery issue , 5.0.1
adds multitouch gestures to the original @entity14 , fixes @entity12 bugs and improves voice recognition for @entity22 @entity7 users
this is the first @entity9 update available both via @entity24 and over-the - air
not long after the release of the @entity28 , users began reporting that their phone 's batteries were draining faster than before
this issue affected not just @entity28 users though , but anybody using @entity9
@entity1 eventually figured out that there were bugs in @entity9 that were causing the battery drain and enlisted developers to help them find the bug
on november 2 , @entity1 admitted that @entity9 had battery performance issues and announced that the company would fix the problem with @entity2
@entity1 has released several betas of the updated os in the last week
our testing of the beta has shown that @entity2 provides a noticeable improvement to the @entity7 's battery life
we 're still testing the updated os though , and will let you know what else we find
