-- @entity2 soccer star @entity1 has " come out " as gay on the day he retired from the game friday
the former @entity6 winger represented @entity2 on 18 occasions , including at the @entity8
but @entity1 , who was released from his deal by second - tier club @entity10 last summer before taking up a spot with third - tier @entity12 , revealed on his blog that he is homosexual and keen to seek a life away from football
" secrets can cause so much internal damage , " @entity1 wrote on his blog
" people love to preach about honesty , how honesty is so plain and simple
try explaining to your loved ones after 25 years you are gay
" try convincing yourself that your creator has the most wonderful purpose for you even though you were taught differently
" i always thought i could hide this secret
football was my escape , my purpose , my identity
football hid my secret , gave me more joy than i could have ever imagined
soccer 's last taboo : why gay players stay in the closet " i will always be thankful for my career
i will remember @entity38 , the @entity39 , and most of all my teammates
i will never forget the friends i have made a long the way and the friends that supported me once they knew my secret
" now is my time to step away
it 's time to discover myself away from football
it 's 1 a.m. in @entity47 as i write this and i could not be happier with my decision
" life is so full of amazing things
i realized i could only truly enjoy my life once i was honest
" @entity53 is a b * * * * but makes life so simple and clear
my secret is gone , i am a free man , i can move on and live my life as my creator intended
" @entity1 ' announcement has seen former teammates flock to show their support , with @entity2 international defender @entity61 , tweeting : " extremely proud of the courage from @ robbierogers
truth is not always easy to display , but truly strong people always find a way @entity66 " @entity2 midfielder @entity68 added on @entity69 : " much love and respect to my boy @ robbierogers ! proud to be your friend bro
" @entity1 ' retirement means there are still no openly gay players participating in professional football in @entity80 with the exception of @entity83 - based @entity82
' @entity84 reveals he is gay it was hoped that @entity82 's coming out , which attracted headlines the world over in march 2011 , would pave the way for other gay footballers to take similar steps
but not since the tragic loss of @entity93 has a top - flight league witnessed an openly gay professional football player
@entity93 , who committed suicide in 1998 , became the first Â£ 1 million black player in the history of @entity100 football when he signed for @entity101 in 1981
while at @entity101 , constant rumors and speculation surrounded his private life with concocted allegations of affairs with conservative mps
@entity108 after admitting he is gay with the rumors continuing throughout his career , he finally came out in 1990 and continued to play for a whole host of lower league clubs
" you have to understand , " he said in an interview before his death , " that footballers are very narrow minded people
it 's the nature of the business
when you put yourself in the firing line , you are open to attack
i know i 'm there to be shot down in flames
" following his passing , one particular group of fans would recite the chant : " he 's gay , he 's dead , he 's hanging in a shed , @entity126 , @entity126
" expert : use gay slurs controversy to tackle homophobia in sports while there has been huge progress since those dark days , the presence of homophobia in football has not been extinguished
only this week , police launched an investigation into allegations that a @entity145 footballer made homophobic gestures towards @entity148 fans during an @entity100 second division match
view : hi - res gallery of openly gay athletes @entity148 , which is situated on the south coast , has a large gay population and its fans are often targeted with homophobic chants
" i think there 's a big culture shift needed within football from the grassroots to the top of the game , " @entity156 of @entity157 told @entity0 " the top of the game is a symptom of a much wider issue about lack of awareness and ignorance around the ability of gay men to participate and excel at football " when you 've got a lack of gay players at the top level , then it 's easy for that environment to be quite negative
" i imagine there are players who are reticent to come out
" opinion : why the fuss about gay marriage ? while other sports have embraced their gay stars , such as @entity186 in basketball , @entity188 in tennis and @entity190 in rugby , football has yet to move with the times
off the field , the @entity194 @entity193 backed a bill to legalize gay marriage earlier this month as society continues to move forward
and while football has yet to move with the times , progress is being made
@entity202 and @entity203 clubs in the @entity194 have created several initiatives to combat homophobia , working alongside charities such as @entity207
" within football , people do n't understand the seriousness of homophobia , " added @entity156
" the things fans shout at players , they believe it 's not hurting them and they do n't care if they 're gay or not
" homophobia is used to put players down and it 's a way of deriding players
that 's cultural all the way through football and happens in other sports
" when a player gives a pass away or falls over , fans use homophobia abuse to put them down and it 's that which we want to stop
" one of our key things is changing chanting in the stadium
stop and think before you chant
" @entity235 youngster @entity234 fined for calling teammate ' gay ' a particular success story in @entity100 has been the creation of the @entity239 , where " gay friendly " teams compete on a regular basis
@entity1 ' story has been met with admiration from fellow gay football players , but his retirement from the game means that the community is still waiting for a player to come out and continue playing
" the great pity with @entity1 is that he felt it was an ' either or choice , ' " @entity251 , who plays for @entity252 in the @entity239 told @entity0
" reading his blog , it felt as if he thought he had no choice but to quit football if he wanted come out
" he could have easily retired without coming out but he 's been very brave and hopefully set us in the right direction
" he has n't forced us to the point where a gay man runs out in front of 30,000 people to play football " and the fact that no professional player has come out in recent years means there are still issues to deal with
" but we will come to that day when we do have openly gay players in the top divisions and we 're moving in the right direction
