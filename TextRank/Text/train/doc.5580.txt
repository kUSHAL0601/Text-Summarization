if you 're skeptical , lo and behold @entity3 , the diminutive doyenne among the major @entity5
here , no town surpasses 10,000 people
by law no building is taller than a coconut tree
the spotlight shines not on the manmade , but on nature 's great outdoors
be it emerald valleys overlooking the @entity18 or turquoise waters lapping 50 miles of ivory sand along the @entity21 , @entity3 's epic landscape pops with a @entity22 punch that 's all natural
the following ( in no particular order ) are 10 of our top recommendations for an unforgettable @entity3 experience
@entity0 : @entity27 for beach haters 1
best beach consistently named as one of @entity27 's best beaches , @entity30 comprises four beaches and each one has its charms to satisfy everyone
a serene slice of paradise with modern conveniences , @entity37 is likely to hit most of what 's on that beach day checklist
walk or run the two - mile stretch of sugary sand , pack a picnic lunch or adopt a laissez - faire ' tude and practice the art of doing nothing
the ' pavilion ' acts as a home base for the day if some in your group ca n't resist wandering off for a fruit - stand smoothie at @entity57 or a stand - up paddle surfing lesson
best botanical wonder it 's clear why @entity3 is nicknamed the ' @entity62
' who could possibly imagine so many incarnations of green ? in @entity67 , @entity66 is the nature - made equivalent of a man - made palace , featuring living ' rooms ' with foliage borders accented with waterfalls , pools , fountains and statues
the adjacent @entity77 is vast and less manicured , holding the largest collection of native @entity5 flora in existence
in @entity81 , do n't miss the most - @entity5 garden of the three , @entity83 , the only non-irrigated location ( no need , as the @entity18 has rain to spare ! )
best coastal hike @entity88 lithified sand dunes
if that sounds too academic , wait till you see them up close
@entity93 is @entity3 's last accessible undeveloped coastline , where the effects of 5 million years are obvious
from your perch on the cliffs , peer down at the pounding surf and rock - strewn inlets , where monk seals occasionally haul themselves out to rest
soon you 'll reach @entity103 , where a pristine swath of velvety sand meets scattered rocks and relentless waves
raw , rugged and remote , @entity93 is utterly memorable
it 's a wonderful place to escape the resort beaches and public parks , but tread lightly on this sacred sanctuary
best native forest soggy , muddy and misty , the @entity113 might not sound appealing , but this otherworldly rainforest is an unforgettable haven for native plants and rare birds
at 4000 to 4500 ft in elevation , @entity119 is not actually a swamp but rather a rainforest bog , filled with ferns , moss - covered tree trunks and vividly blooming ' ohia lehua
before the early 1990s , only scientists , intrepid hikers and pig hunters braved the thicket of brush and deep murk
since then , a wooden boardwalk has made @entity119 more accessible while it also protects the fragile terrain
be prepared for sun , rain , hundreds of steps and , if the clouds refrain themselves , an awesome view
best kid pleaser one kid wants to snorkel , another lives to rollerblade , and the third wants simply to build sand castles all afternoon
but at @entity145 in @entity146 , it 's a cinch to satisfy ' em all
the lifeguard - staffed beach is protected within a stone breakwater that forms two calm , shallow lagoons , ideal for munchkin snorkelers or learn - to - swimmers
near the water , two giant playgrounds capture the imagination , with unique wooden mazes and bridges , kid - made ceramic mosaics , and classic swings and slides
along the sand , there 's a paved path , safe for pedestrians , cyclists , rollerbladers and dogs on leashes
bring fixings for grilling , kick back and marvel that this wonderful place wo n't cost you a cent
@entity0 : maui for foodies 6
best fitness challenge a siren song of sorts , the @entity178 is inaccessible to vehicles and can be seen only by boat , helicopter or hike
that 's why it draws some of the fittest and strongest from around the world , who 've been lured by the notoriety of mastering this challenging stretch at ocean level
if you 're fit enough to be mistaken for a superhero , a kayak tour around the @entity178 could be your cup of tea ( or energy drink )
the tour is offered only from may to september , so if you 're here during that time frame -- and if triathlons , marathons and the like are part of your more - than - once - a - year routine -- then this might be for you
added bonus ? the two - hour beach lunch break
best nightlife local artists on - island joined up to dominate the main street real estate when the mom - and - pop businesses of the historic @entity215 town of @entity216 were dropping like flies
now every friday is the @entity219 as galleries are open late and the strip is awash in looky - loos with a hankering for art. once dubbed the ' @entity225 on @entity3 , ' @entity216 's rep has evolved in recent years and it 's now better known as an ' art central ' of sorts
peruse the galleries housing everything from kitsch @entity231 to @entity233 - inspired watercolors , or locally - inspired interpretations of cubist , impressionist and expressionistic movements
best scenic drive driving northwards from @entity239 , you 'll emerge from a canopy of trees that rise from an undulating landscape , through a wild stretch slicing past a jungle - like mass over the river , beside the ocean
after the vine - laden @entity247 , you 'll see patches of verdant fields where horses graze under tropical fruit - bearing trees , and teasing views here and there that let you just snatch glimpses of the @entity256
continue onward to @entity30 , passing first its famous historic bridge , then the six one - way bridges beyond ( follow local courtesy and allow eight cars to pass first )
explore for a bit at the wet caves or the inspired @entity83 , winding up your afternoon at far - flung @entity264 -- the ultimate sunset perch
best bargain meal big - name chefs often serve up tuna tartare
but locals consider such fancy foods as overpriced renditions of @entity5 - style ʻahi poke , chunks of succulent raw tuna , seasoned typically with soy sauce , sesame oil , green onion , sea salt , ogo ( seaweed ) and inamona ( ground - roasted kukui )
traditionally , @entity282 used only the latter three ingredients , but as different immigrants arrived with their own staple seasonings , recipes evolved into today 's tastebud - tangling varieties
@entity287 is an everyday dish , purchased at deli counters and places like the @entity21 's @entity291
typically under us $ 12 per pound , take - out poke makes a first - rate meal on the run
best hike to remember a vertiginous tease , the hike from @entity264 to @entity298 can elicit awe , anticipation and impatience
but after you 've climbed energetically around each rising , undulating curve , it delivers
you arrive at one of the most captivating sights the @entity18 has to offer
at 2 miles in , @entity307 is the first stop on the 11 - mile @entity309
you 'll have to hike through a seemingly overgrown forest dense with everything from bamboo to wild orchids to reach the 100ft @entity314 , so try to follow the stream and listen for the sound of rushing water
those with hiking boots , agile feet and avid quadriceps will probably hike this roundtrip in four hours
word to the wise : be generous with mosquito repellent , sunblock and wear a swimsuit underneath
pack a light snack , camera and water bottle
