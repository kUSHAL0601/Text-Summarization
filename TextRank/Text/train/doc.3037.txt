@entity0 -- at least 36 people have died after two passenger boats collided off @entity0 's @entity4 on monday evening , throwing more than 100 people into the sea
the crash happened on a night when @entity0 's busy waters were even more crowded than usual , as the city celebrated @entity11 's @entity10
one of the vessels , owned by the @entity13 , was carrying company employees and their families to watch the scheduled fireworks display when it was struck by a passenger ferry traveling from @entity18 to @entity4
government officials said the collision occurred off @entity4 's coast at around 8:20 p.m. local time
" i thought we 'd hit a rock or a lighthouse , " said @entity23 , a school teacher who was on the passenger ferry that crashed into the @entity13 vessel
he said the force of the impact threw him out of his seat at the back of the ferry , which was not very full of people
as the damaged ferry began to move toward the pier in the small town of @entity37 on @entity4 , @entity23 said he could see the other boat had started to sink into the water vertically , like the @entity40
according to the @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , which led the rescue , the vessel sank quickly after the impact
it said low visibility and many obstacles on board made it difficult for rescuers
the @entity43 said its rescue boats , including a diving support vessel , arrived on the scene at 8:41 p.m. local time and managed to pull 123 people from the water
twenty - eight people were declared dead at the scene , and eight others were certified dead upon arrival at the hospital , according to a statement early tuesday from the @entity0 government
the survivors were taken to five hospitals around the city , with nine said to have serious injuries , the government statement added
" after 10 minutes out a boat crashed into ours from the side at very high speed , " one male survivor told the @entity71
" the rear of the ferry started to sink
i suddenly found myself deep under the sea
i swam hard and tried to grab a life buoy
i do n't know where my two kids are
" residents on @entity4 reported being woken up in the middle of the night by the massive rescue operation going on offshore
on tuesday , the front of the stricken vessel was still sticking out of the water , tethered to a big barge just a few hundred meters from @entity4
police vessels surrounded the scene , and divers were conducting a search
the authorities have not ruled out the possibility that some people may still be inside the vessel or missing
the passenger ferry was able to dock safely
government officials have not yet confirmed if passengers aboard that vessel were injured , but @entity23 said nobody around him appeared to have been hurt
the narrow sea lanes leading into @entity0 's main deepwater harbor are some of the busiest in @entity105 , with giant commercial freighters , ocean liners , passenger ferries and private boats of all sizes sharing the same waters
@entity0 is home to more than 200 outlying islands , including @entity4 , which lies to the southwest of @entity18 -- the city 's financial center
@entity18 is located to the south of @entity118 harbor , with @entity119 forming its northern shores
to the north of @entity119 lie the @entity122 , which stretch all the way to mainland @entity11
