my military minder tells me to turn my camera off , and it soon becomes clear why
the poverty i see through the bus window is not the view of @entity7 the regime wants to be seen
we are traveling from @entity10 , three hours north of @entity11 , back to the capital , but the main road and the sanctioned route has been flooded
this is the only way back
buildings are in disrepair ; some barely look inhabitable
residents of this small town walk or sit by the side of the road , many seeming to have little to do
a number of official - looking men dressed in brown @entity26 suits stand silently on street corners
it is impossible to know who they are or which element of the party or military they might work for , but they clearly seem to be observing
a sneak peek through the keyhole despite the driver traveling as quickly as possible through these inhabited areas , you could still sense the local community being monitored
dozens of men are working on the outskirts of town , building a stone wall between their crops and the swollen river
boulders and stones are carried by hand and stacked without adhesive
this intensive labor force is seen repeatedly in the @entity7 countryside , but i see no heavy equipment to help building or farming
one man trims hedges with a rusty scythe ; other men repair part of the pavement with small hand - held pickaxes
cars are rare ; most people either walk or cycle
surviving the streets of @entity7 back in the countryside , i am surprised by how much land has been farmed
the @entity72 says a quarter of the country 's children are severely malnourished , and yet as far as the eye can see are fields of maize , rice , wheat and corn
in the midst of the @entity7 rainy season , the landscape is lush , and it raises the question of how this food , once harvested , is distributed
while driving to @entity10 , an area the regime wants to see tourists flock to , we 're stopped at a number of military checkpoints
each time , we are told we can not go on as the roads are flooded , but each time , our minders talk us through until it becomes clear there has been significant damage
one side of a dual carriageway has completely collapsed 20 feet into the river below
two soldiers sit on their bikes and look on helplessly
this is considered one of the main roads in @entity7 , but the damage caused could take months to fix , according to a military official accompanying us
the town of @entity10 is filled with bunting and posters for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the @entity113 , a day @entity7 calls " @entity114
" women crouch by the side of the road clearing the grass of weeds ; others sweep the streets with a tree branch
celebrations clearly extend far beyond the capital city
the landscape itself is stunning
@entity128 mountains rise from the fog covered river , a river that feeds the local community
one small boy fishes using a crudely made net , walking backward through the shallows , dragging the small net attached to a piece of wood in the hope of catching something
nearby , a family washes their clothes in the river , suggesting running water is a luxury in this region
the hotel we are staying in has an intermittent supply
farther downstream , a man has brought soap to the water 's edge to wash his hair and his clothing
a security official appears from nowhere to stop me filming
i see two different @entity158 on this trip : the sanctioned tourist view of the beautifully groomed gardens of the @entity163 temple , with their perfectly preserved shrines
and the poorer view i see flashing by the bus window .
