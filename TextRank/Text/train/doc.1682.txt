a federal judge monday blocked one of the most well - known tools used to crack down on illegal immigration by the man who calls himself @entity7 's toughest sheriff
@entity10 sheriff @entity9 must stop enforcing @entity11 's identify theft laws , @entity7 district judge @entity8 ruled monday , granting a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against @entity9
the lawsuit , filed by the @entity17 immigrant rights group , argues that the laws are unconstitutional and have been used by @entity9 and his office to target undocumented immigrants in workplace raids
@entity9 's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment
in the past , he 's defended the workplace raids and said his department has been forced to step in because federal authorities have n't done enough to enforce immigration laws
@entity8 said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that the state 's identify theft laws are preempted by federal laws , and that @entity9 must stop enforcing the laws until a final decision is reached in the lawsuit
@entity37 , executive director of @entity17 , described the judge 's ruling monday as an " enormous victory
" " @entity9 and ( @entity43 ) @entity42 are being stripped of the tools they use to illegally terrorize immigrant workers and families , " he said in a statement
" we hope that justice will continue to prevail , that not one more worker is arrested for providing for his or her family and that the racist , anti-immigrant machine for which @entity11 is known is dismantled completely
" @entity9 's tough , headline - grabbing punishments have earned him diehard supporters and fiery opponents
he 's issued pink underwear to the men detained in the county 's jails and said he is saving taxpayers money by removing salt and pepper from prison meals
last year , he said inmates who allegedly defaced @entity7 flags placed in their jail cells would be punished with a diet of bread and water
in 2013 , a federal court in @entity72 ruled that @entity9 's handling of people of @entity76 descent was not tough enforcement of immigration laws but instead amounted to racial and ethnic profiling
the judge later ordered a federal monitor to keep tabs on @entity9 's office and make sure officers were n't racially profiling anymore
last year , he filed a lawsuit against @entity7 president @entity87 over his executive actions on immigration
but a judge dismissed @entity9 's lawsuit in december , ruling that @entity9 did n't have standing to bring the lawsuit and could n't show he 'd been harmed by @entity87 's changes
in a court filing last month , @entity9 said he was disbanding his office 's criminal employment unit , the squad that conducted the workplace raids , because federal court decisions had already blocked certain @entity11 laws
@entity0 's @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and contributed to this report .
