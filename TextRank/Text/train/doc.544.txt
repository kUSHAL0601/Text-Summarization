-- for the past three years some of the world 's most resourceful software engineers and mathematicians have worked feverishly in the spirit of friendly , @entity6 competition -- and in pursuit of a $ 1 million prize -- to improve the @entity10 movie recommendation system by 10 percent
@entity10 says it will announce the winner of its $ 1 million @entity12 at an event september 21
it 's been a long journey , but it 's almost over
@entity10 said tuesday it would announce the winner at an event in @entity19 on sept. 21 -- where details about the @entity12 2 sequel would also be unveiled
as things stand now , nobody outside of @entity10 knows which team will win the million - dollar prize , but the winning entry will power @entity10 's upcoming movie recommendation engine
because nothing about the contest barred entrants from licensing their technology to companies other than @entity10 , both qualifying teams could find plenty of licensees -- even if they come in second
and not much separates the two top teams
@entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 and @entity41 combined to form @entity38 's @entity42 , the first team to qualify for the prize on june 26 with a 10.05 percent improvement over @entity10 's existing algorithm
this triggered a 30 - day window in which other teams were allowed to try to catch up -- and indeed , a team called @entity50 , made up of lower - ranked contestants , submitted a higher score of 10.10 percent as time ran out -- a hair better than @entity38 's @entity42 ' final score of 10.09 percent
before sept. 21 , @entity10 must decide ( assuming they have n't done so already ) which of the two qualifying teams has the best algorithm based on how they score on various undisclosed tests
the company must also determine whether the winning team 's results are reproducible , meaning that its algorithm handles new data as well as it did the test data
when we wrote about this last month , after the window for qualifying closed , @entity10 declined to say whether it will reveal details about its methodology for picking the winner ( whichever team loses , they 're going to want to know how , exactly , that happened -- as will curious onlookers around the world )
a @entity10 spokeswoman told us , " we are definitely going to touch on the methodology in the press conference , " and offered to let us interview @entity10 executives to find out more about how they picked the winner
@entity10 vice president of communications @entity80 told us last month that the company is pleased with the results of the contest , and apparently , it hopes there 's more where that came from
at the same @entity19 event where it will announce the @entity12 winner , the company plans to unveil details about @entity12 2
writing on @entity10 message boards , chief product officer @entity90 already offered some hints : " the next contest will be a shorter , time - limited race , with grand prizes for the best results at 6 and 18 months
while the first contest has been remarkable , we think @entity98 will be more challenging , more fun , and even more useful to the field
" more than 40,000 teams from 186 countries competed for the first @entity12
some contestants doubted that any team would be capable of surmounting the 10 - percent - improvement barrier , but two teams managed to do so
clearly , @entity10 has stumbled onto a winning formula here , and will walk away from the contest with a measurably improved movie recommendation engine -- and recommendations are a linchpin of its business
as the field of " prize economics " evolves , offering organizations increasingly efficient ways to solve their problems , we expect results like this to become more commonplace
