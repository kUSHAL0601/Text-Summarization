-- the killing of 298 innocent people on board @entity4 was a crime , a consequence of the war against @entity8 that @entity9 started , and which he supplies , directs and controls
the @entity14 president bears full responsibility for this war , including the downing of the @entity19 airliner
the main problem with our reaction to @entity14 aggression is not even the mildness of our sanctions , but the lack of clarity of their purpose
our message to @entity9 is very confused
do we want him completely out of @entity8 , or do we want his help in dealing with that country ? they are two very different requests
despite @entity9 's offenses , @entity36 leaders apparently still want him to play an active role in securing peace and stability
according to the @entity46 , on july 17 , " president @entity41 called on president @entity9 to take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation , including pressing separatists to agree to a cease - fire
" after the @entity19 airliner was shot down , @entity48 chancellor @entity47 urged @entity9 to use his influence with the rebels to ensure a cease - fire
in recent appearances on several tv shows , @entity54 secretary of state @entity53 asked @entity9 to take " immediate and clear action to reduce tensions in @entity8 , " " to step up and make a difference , " and " to use all his influence
" despite their harsh words for @entity9 , leaders of the @entity63 still want his help
@entity67 prime minister @entity66 summed it up best when he said : " we sometimes behave as if we need @entity14 more than @entity14 needs us
" @entity9 is only too glad to put on sheep 's clothing and assume the role of peacemaker that he has pretended to be throughout the war that he himself started
according to him , annexing @entity76 , shooting down airplanes and supporting separatists has only one purpose : to protect the @entity8 people from alleged right - wing extremists
if you want @entity9 's help , beware of what you are asking
he would be glad to broker a " diplomatic solution " with the separatists , thus legitimizing his terrorists and entrenching them on @entity8 territory
if that option does n't work , we can imagine the following completely different scenario : @entity14 tanks roll over @entity93
instead of supporting the separatists , @entity9 arrests leaders of the @entity93 republic and persecutes them for terrorizing the local population
blaming the @entity8 government for its inability to protect people from the terrorists , he establishes full control over the territory , and leaves @entity14 troops there to secure law , order and tranquility
how would the world react to such a " peacekeeping mission " ? would the @entity8 army fight @entity14 troops ? would western political leaders accept this as a plausible option ? i do not know
but what is more important , @entity9 does n't know either
we should make very clear that we would not accept @entity9 as a peacekeeper and we want him out of @entity8
@entity36 governments should not implicitly accept the aggressive doctrine called the " @entity120 , " which was endorsed by @entity9 , and which gives him the right to intervene into the affairs of virtually any sovereign nation , as he did in @entity8 , using the pretext of protecting @entity14 - speaking citizens
the major concern of @entity36 leaders is that by taking a strong stand against @entity9 , we may lose him as a useful partner in the world arena
we should n't worry about that
history clearly demonstrates that in all major international trouble spots in which we accepted @entity9 as our partner , @entity14 has always taken the side of the @entity63 's enemy
such has been the case with @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141
it was only natural for @entity9 to use any invitation on our part as an opportunity to damage us
one should not expect anything different from a person with the background of a @entity151 officer , for whom @entity54 always has been enemy no. 1 , and for whom @entity154 is a pillar of his power
if @entity54 is @entity14 's enemy , @entity156 can not be our ally
whether we like it or not , such relations are reciprocal
and from an enemy we do not need help
we need only check its aggression
for that purpose we should take the following steps : 1
publicly recognize that @entity9 is not our ally or partner , but rather our foe , and make this position clear to him and to the rest of the world
ensure that our demands to @entity14 be absolutely clear
stop supporting separatists in @entity8
we do not need @entity9 as a broker or peacemaker
@entity9 must completely get out of @entity8 territory and @entity8 politics
make clear that @entity9 's help is not needed in any other part of the world
exclude @entity14 as our partner or as a mediator from any international arrangements and negotiations
reiterate our position of not accepting the annexation of @entity76
demand that it be returned to @entity8
stop propagating @entity9 's propaganda
instead , counter it with all the power of @entity54 's media
expand broadcasts by @entity194 and other radio stations
make it clear that we consider the " @entity120 " policy a threat to world peace and stability
insist that @entity14 officially renounce that doctrine and repeal supporting legislation as necessary conditions for @entity14 's readmission to the community of civilized nations
to stop aggression against @entity8 and to prevent aggressions against other countries , make @entity14 pay a high price by introducing sector and other serious economic sanctions
be ready to accept the cost of those sanctions
take immediate steps to reduce that cost and any dependence on @entity14
develop new energy sources and transportation systems in @entity54 and @entity221
provide help , including military assistance , to those who are under immediate attack or potential aggression by @entity14
revisit communism , an ideology that remains important in @entity14 as well as other countries
educate new generations about its atrocities and bankrupt ideology
opponents of strong action against an aggressor wrongly equate political confrontation with war
they believe that admitting that the second largest nuclear power is our enemy would usher in another @entity242 and make the situation much more dangerous
history teaches us , however , that to ignore reality and appease our enemy is a more dangerous approach than to clearly articulate our principles and disagreements
when in 1983 the @entity249 shot down @entity250 , @entity251 denounced them as enemies of the @entity54 and the entire world
@entity251 's strong stand against the @entity249 communism that threatened us for decades with nuclear war helped stop its expansion and eventually led to its complete capitulation
if we could stand against the mighty @entity249 , we can manage @entity9 's much weaker @entity14
in february 2000 , only two months into his presidency , @entity9 presented one of his first state awards to air force gen. @entity262
in 1983 , @entity262 was commander of @entity263 in @entity264
his order to the fighter pilot was : " destroy the target ! " the target was @entity250
join us on @entity271 / @entity270 .
