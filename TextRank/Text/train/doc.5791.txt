@entity0 -- the @entity3 government has put immigration reform and the economy at the heart of its plans for the new parliamentary session , which opened wednesday with the @entity9
the address by @entity11 for the ceremonial state opening of @entity13 is written by the government , although read out by the monarch
at the center of the government 's legislative agenda is a new bill with " tough new measures to continue immigration reform and prevent illegal immigrants accessing services they 're not entitled to , " the @entity15 said
" the bill will ensure that this country attracts people who will contribute and deters those who will not , " the queen said
the legislation will also " contain measures to make it harder for people to prevent their removal with spurious appeals , reduce the complexity of immigration law and make clear that foreign national offenders should be deported , except in extraordinary circumstances , " the @entity15 said
a move to the right on immigration may be a response to the political threat posed by the @entity3 @entity41 , known as @entity42 , which has made gains in local elections at the expense of the conservatives
@entity42 has promised steps to limit the number of migrants entering @entity3
measures to make deportation easier may also reflect the @entity15 's long - running , and so far unsuccessful , efforts to deport radical @entity54 cleric @entity53
a series of legal appeals have kept the @entity58 national in the country
lawmaker @entity60 , of the opposition @entity61 , criticized the measures outlined in the @entity9 , saying they fail to tackle key issues around the exploitation of foreign workers and illegal immigration
" immigration is important for @entity3 and needs to be controlled and managed so it is fair for all , " she said
welfare reforms the government will also work to boost @entity3 's economic competitiveness so it can continue to succeed in the world , the @entity9 said
" to this end , it will support the growth of the private sector and the creation of more jobs and opportunities , " the queen said
in addition , the government intends to pass new measures to tackle anti-social behavior , cut crime and reform the police
the legislative agenda also includes more measures to reform the state benefits system , " helping people move from welfare to work , " the speech said
the government 's sweeping welfare reforms , affecting state help for the disabled and unemployed , have already been controversial in @entity3 , which is struggling with a large budget deficit
the @entity46 govern in coalition with the @entity99
@entity11 to miss @entity100 heads meeting the @entity9 also said the government " will continue to make the case for @entity103 to remain in the @entity3
" @entity103 will go to the polls next year to decide whether @entity103 should stay in the @entity3 or become independent
prime minister @entity106 has previously said he wants @entity103 to remain part of the @entity3
the queen 's appearance at @entity13 , accompanied by her husband , prince @entity110 , came a day after @entity111 said it was reviewing the number of long - haul flights she takes
the monarch will miss a meeting of @entity100 heads of government in @entity119 in november , sending her son , prince @entity120 , in her place
