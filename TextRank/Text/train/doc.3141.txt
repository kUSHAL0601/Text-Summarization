@entity0 urged @entity1 to keep its word this time and withdraw troops along @entity6 's eastern border , saying it has seen no signs of soldiers returning to their bases
president @entity12 ordered tens of thousands of troops near the @entity6 border to return to their bases , his spokesman @entity10 said monday
the withdrawal has started , he said , and could take some time to finish
but despite @entity19 's assertion , there were no signs of the troops ' withdrawal , @entity0 secretary general @entity16 said hours later
the @entity24 administration was skeptical about @entity12 's order , while @entity26 said it 's monitoring the area to ensure troops are returning to their permanent bases
" as you know , we have heard that promise before and have yet to see any indication that it 's been fulfilled , " said @entity30 , the @entity31 spokesman
@entity16 reiterated the need for the withdrawal and said he would " be the first " to welcome it
" i think it 's the third @entity12 statement on withdrawal of @entity1 troops ... but so far we have n't seen any withdrawal at all , " he said
" withdrawal of @entity1 troops will be the first step to de-escalating the situation
" @entity6 's presidential election scheduled for sunday is crucial , @entity16 said , and @entity1 and @entity6 separatists should practice restraint to ensure it goes on as planned
" we urge the armed @entity49 separatist groups to stop their illegal activities
... @entity1 should stop their support for these armed groups , " he said
" @entity1 should demonstrate a clear will to let the presidential election to go forward
the presidential election constitutes the best chance to find a sustainable solution to the crisis in @entity6
" @entity1 's ' significant forces ' @entity12 's decision to amass 40,000 troops along @entity6 's eastern border triggered fears of an invasion ahead of the election
@entity19 defended the troop buildup , saying it was a routine exercise that has since ended
two weeks ago , @entity12 said @entity1 troops had pulled away from @entity6 's border and were merely conducting " regular exercises at the test grounds
" at that time , @entity0 and @entity74 officials said they saw no sign of widespread troop withdrawals
but a senior @entity78 administration official disputed @entity1 's assertion that they were routine exercises " the fact is that @entity1 has been maintaining significant forces in forward deployment areas along @entity6 's border , " the official said
" they have not been conducting routine training activities
they 've been up on the border in a menacing posture , and we 've been concerned about this military buildup and have been consistently calling on @entity1 to remove its troops back to their home bases and end this threatening behavior
" the official said the @entity31 is monitoring the issue for evidence of withdrawal
" as you 'll recall , they 've made similar claims before
they made them at the end of march and did n't follow through , so we 'll be tracking this closely over the course of today and the coming days , and we 'll want to see clear , firm evidence of this move before we make any judgment , " the official said monday
the @entity78 , which along with other @entity74 countries has sanctioned @entity1 for its disputed takeover of @entity114 , has threatened additional punishment for @entity1 if it fails to pull its troops back from the border
tensions in the east @entity1 officials have said they reserve the right to protect the interests of @entity1 citizens and @entity1 - language speakers in @entity6 's east , which traditionally leans toward @entity19
tensions in that region remain high , with ongoing reports of violence and growing human rights abuses
anti-terrorism operations that started in april in the @entity132 and @entity133 regions have killed 24 @entity6 servicemen so far , said @entity135 , head of the @entity136
he did not provide any more details
in one of the latest incidents , @entity1 separatists clashed with @entity6 border guards saturday after a separatist leader was detained at a checkpoint
@entity144 , the self - declared governor of a " people 's republic " in @entity133 , was detained by security forces in @entity147
attackers freed him after a firefight , but he was wounded and went to @entity1 for medical treatment , separatist spokesman @entity148 said
over the weekend , the @entity152 accused @entity6 troops of attacking @entity6 citizens and questioned whether sunday 's scheduled elections could be held amid the chaos
" such punitive action against its own citizens shows the hypocrisy of the @entity26 authorities , " a ministry statement said , referring to an international pact agreed to last month that called for an end to violence
