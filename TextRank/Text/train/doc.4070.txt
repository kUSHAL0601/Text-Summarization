@entity0 made our teenage dreams come true at the @entity5 halftime show sunday with dizzying pyrotechnics , dancing sharks and enough outfit changes to give @entity9 a run for her money
expectations were mixed going into the show
would she fall flat like the @entity16 ' footballs or take off like a firework ? she had the support of well - wishers like ex @entity20 , who promised baffled @entity21 that the halftime show would be " amazing
" but really , we were just eager for a reprieve from the lackluster first half between the @entity26 and the @entity16
regardless of whether you appreciated her artistry , the show delivered throughout on memorable ( and meme - worthy ) moments , from @entity33 's entrance atop a robot tiger , dressed in a suit of flames , until her exit on a star that drew comparisons to @entity43 's " more you know " logo
much of the credit goes to guest stars @entity47 and @entity48 , whom some deemed more worthy of the spotlight
first up was @entity47 , who joined in a duet of " @entity51
" people were excited if not somewhat confused by the pairing
then , @entity33 transitioned to a tropical landscape of dancing beach balls , palm trees and sharks for " @entity58 , " and everyone started wondering whether we were in a " @entity62 " or on a bad acid trip
luckily , @entity63 chimed in to assure us that yes , the landscape was real , and he knows because he was there
then , @entity48 arrived to help @entity33 get her freak on , much to everyone 's delight
some would say she stole the show
but , the real kicker was her exit on a star that drew comparisons to @entity43 's famous " more you know " star
what 's the verdict ? overall , most seemed to delight in roasting @entity33 , and were generally pleased that the show delivered enough moments to make into memes and objects of mockery
our friends at @entity87 probably said it best : " @ katyperry 's dancing sharks are the thing to beat this # superbowl sunday
