@entity0 -- clothing retailer @entity4 has fired an @entity6 company accused of using child labor to make clothes , the company 's president said
@entity9 of the @entity10 said these were among the children working in an @entity6 factory , making clothing
" it 's deeply , deeply disturbing to all of us , " @entity4 president @entity15 said sunday after watching a video of children at work in a @entity20 , @entity6 , sweatshop
" i feel violated and i feel very upset and angry with our vendor and the subcontractor who made this very , very , very unwise decision , " @entity15 said
@entity15 blamed the alleged abuse on an unauthorized subcontractor for one of its @entity6 vendors and said the subcontractor 's relationship with the @entity4 had been " terminated
" she said the garments allegedly produced by the children represented a small portion of a single order placed with the vendor and that the clothes would not be sold in stores
" we strictly prohibit the use of child labor , " @entity15 said in a statement
" @entity4 has a history of addressing challenges like this head - on , and our approach to this situation will be no exception
" in 2006 , @entity4 ceased business with 23 factories due to code violations
we have 90 people located around the world whose job is to ensure compliance with our code of @entity59
" the report first appeared sunday in @entity62 's @entity10 newspaper
watch how children worked as virtual slaves Â» the @entity10 spoke to children as young as 10 who said they were working 16 hours a day for no pay
the paper described the workplace as a " derelict industrial unit " where the hallways were flowing with excrement from a flooded toilet
one 10 - year - old boy told the paper he was sold to the company by his parents
" ' i was bought from my parents ' village in [ the northern state of ] @entity83 and taken to @entity20 by train , " @entity10 quoted the boy as saying
" the men came looking for us in july
they had loudspeakers in the back of a car and told my parents that , if they sent me to work in the city , they wo n't have to work in the farms
my father was paid a fee for me , and i was brought down with 40 other children
" another boy , 12 , said he worked from dawn until 1 a.m. and was so tired he felt sick , according to the paper
but if any of the children cried , he told @entity10 , they would be hit with a rubber pipe or punished with an oily cloth stuffed in their mouths
the children were producing hand - stitched blouses for the @entity108 market in the @entity109 and @entity110 at @entity4 stores , according to the newspaper
the blouses were to carry a price of about $ 40 , @entity10 reported
the @entity4 faced criticism for similar practices in 2000 , when a @entity117 documentary uncovered young girls producing @entity4 products at a @entity121 factory
but since then , @entity15 said , the company has developed comprehensive policies to prevent abuse and protect workers ' rights
@entity15 said violations of those policies are now " extremely rare
" she said she does not support closing any factories in @entity6 in response to the allegations because it would deprive those working in proper conditions of their income
the gap also operates @entity138 and @entity139 stores
it has 3,100 stores around the world
