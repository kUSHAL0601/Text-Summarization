@entity0 -- despite being urged not to hoard bottled water , residents of @entity4 's capital on wednesday snapped it up in droves after testing showed radioactive material in tap water at levels unsafe for infants
the city 's water agency said the spike was likely caused by problems at the @entity18 nuclear plant , located 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) away
earlier wednesday , @entity0 government officials advised residents not to give tap water to infants or use it in formula after tests at a purification plant detected high levels of radioactive iodine
grocery store owner @entity28 said he noted a sudden increase of customers
he had 40 cases of water in his store , but they were gone quickly
meanwhile , officials evacuated some workers at the @entity18 plant wednesday afternoon as a black plume of smoke billowed above one of the reactors , plant owner @entity34 said
the cause of the smoke was unclear
the team of seven workers were planning to inspect gauges and instrumentation at reactor no. 3 , but were unable to determine conditions in the control room before evacuating , officials with @entity34 and @entity4 's @entity46 said
workers have been scrambling to cool down fuel rods at the nuclear plant since a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and massive tsunami on march 11 knocked out cooling systems
some radiation has been released , officials said , but it was unclear whether radiation levels spiked after the black smoke was spotted wednesday
@entity4 's nuclear agency said radiation levels near the plant had not changed , public broadcaster @entity64 reported
but in @entity0 , concerns over radiation surged
government samples taken tuesday night found 210 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of water -- two times higher than the limit that the government considers safe for infants
the amount of iodine detected was lower than the level considered safe for adults : 300 becquerels per kilogram
a liter of water weights 1 kilogram
a becquerel is a measurement of radioactive intensity by weight
the level set for infants is " very conservative , " said dr. @entity90 , radiation oncologist at @entity92 in @entity93 and a @entity1 consultant , but elevated radiation levels are considered a problem for small children , as their thyroid glands are more susceptible to radiation
" erring on the side of caution for the extreme degree for children makes good sense , " @entity90 said
for adults , " as far as the immediate health risk , something that would make people sick , i do n't think that would come close to it
" in response , @entity0 's government will distribute 3,500 - milliliter ( 1 - gallon ) bottles of mineral water to 80,000 households in the city with infants , @entity4 public broadcaster @entity64 reported thursday
the government has said that , due to the high radiation levels , tap water should not be given to children 1 year old and younger
authorities have advised day care centers and other such facilities not to use tap water for drinks or to prepare baby food
more bottled water is expected to be distributed to families in the future , according to @entity64
also wednesday , @entity4 's government expanded food shipment restrictions after the health ministry said tests detected radioactive materials at levels exceeding legal limits in 11 types of vegetables grown near the @entity18 plant
prime minister @entity143 asked @entity144 to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley , chief cabinet secretary @entity142 told reporters wednesday
the government of @entity150 also told residents not to eat leafy vegetables , he said
@entity142 said radiation levels in the food would not cause health problems right away , but if radiation rises , " we are looking at the possibility of levels reaching levels that may harm human health
" the decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast @entity4 hit by the earthquake and tsunami
@entity18 ranks among @entity4 's top producer of fruits , vegetables and rice
@entity144 , south of @entity18 , supplies @entity0 with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is @entity4 's third - largest pork producer
" this is our livelihood , " a @entity18 farmer told @entity4 television network @entity178
" it 's a huge problem that we are unable to ship all our produce
we raised ( this produce ) with our own hands
it 's unbearable that we would have to throw it all away
" @entity187 on wednesday said it was restricting food and milk imports from certain prefectures over the radiation concerns
the @entity192 previously announced import alerts covering milk , milk products , fresh vegetables and fruit from prefectures near the reactors
police say the dual disaster has killed at least 9,487 people and left at least 15,617 missing , many of them killed as a wall of water rushed in following the quake
meanwhile , about 387,000 evacuees are staying at 2,200 shelters , @entity4 's @entity208 reported
relief efforts to help them and other victims continued , with @entity192 military helicopters delivering food , clothes and supplies to some of the hardest - hit areas
" we remain focused on fewer than 10 cases of @entity192 citizens that remain unaccounted for in the areas hardest hit by the earthquake and tsunami , " @entity220 spokesman @entity219 told reporters wednesday
in addition to the stories of people struggling to survive in quake - ravaged towns in northeastern @entity4 , the plight of workers braving high radiation levels to solve problems at the troubled plant has also drawn attention
@entity34 said wednesday that two workers were injured at the plant while working with an electric panel
the workers , whose injuries did not involve exposure to radiation , were treated by a doctor at the nearby @entity247 plant
" we are constantly switching over all the time , since the work can not be stopped , " one worker told @entity178
" it has settled down quite a lot compared to the beginning , and we could even begin to see a bright hope that maybe it would somehow work out in a little bit , " another worker said in what the network touted as the first televised interviews with workers
but authorities said wednesday that work was far from over at the plant
members of @entity0 's fire department planned to start spraying water into the spent - fuel storage pool outside the plant 's no. 3 reactor wednesday , according to @entity268 of @entity4 's @entity46
power has been restored in the control room at that reactor -- which officials say could be a key step in bringing cooling systems back online
" until we get power restored to the power plant , continuing doing what they have been doing for the last 12 days is , quite honestly , the only game in town , " said @entity275 , a former senior operator at three @entity192 nuclear power plants who has been following the situation at the @entity18 plant
" it 's absolutely essential that they keep the reactor covered with water as well as continuing to refill it , " he said
" but getting the power restored and getting the equipment moving so they can get back on track is essential
at that point , we can determine the emergency is in the final stages
" he predicted power would be restored gradually to the plant over the next few days
" the power source is going to the main control room because that is the main nerve center of the entire plant , " he said
" once they get that restored , then we have some instrumentation and we can figure out what 's going on in the power plant that up to this point has been almost impossible to figure out
" once that is done , he said power will be sent to individual pieces of equipment and the situation will be analyzed
he estimated it could take two weeks or more to get the plant " in a stable , cold shut - down configuration
" " it is an industrial catastrophe , " said @entity319 , a nuclear engineer who directed the initial cleanup and response of the @entity323 plant in @entity324 following a partial core nuclear meltdown in 1979
" it 's a huge plant , and it 's been basically destroyed internally and has high contamination levels inside
there are areas in the building where no human 's going to go for a long time
" but , @entity319 told @entity1 , " it 's also not a health catastrophe -- as long as the people follow the instructions from the government , they 're going to be safe in @entity4
" the no. 3 reactor has been a priority for authorities trying to contain damage to the plant and stave off a possible meltdown
its fuel rods contain plutonium mixed with uranium , which experts say could cause more harm than regular uranium fuels in the event of a meltdown
" we have progress in stabilizing cooling capacity
we most progressed in the no. 3 reactor , " @entity142 said
" on the other hand , we are trying to figure out ... the cause of the smoke
" with the nuclear plant 's six reactors in various states of disrepair , concerns have mounted over a potentially larger release of radioactive material from the facility
efforts over the past several days have focused on restoring power at the facility while fire trucks and cement pumps sprayed water on spent fuel ponds , which contain used fuel rods with radioactive material
embassies from more than two dozen countries have either closed down or moved operations to cities south of @entity0 since the earthquake and the resulting nuclear crisis , the country 's @entity379 said wednesday
" there are 25 embassies which either temporarily shut down or moved its function outside of @entity0 , " @entity379 spokesman @entity387 told @entity1
seven of those 25 have moved to cities such as @entity393 , @entity394 and @entity395 , @entity387 said
@entity1 's @entity396 and @entity397 contributed to this report
