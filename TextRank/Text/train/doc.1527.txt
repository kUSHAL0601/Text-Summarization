from the outside , the home at 2207 @entity1 looked like most any other in @entity6 's @entity5 neighborhood
from the inside , it looked like hell
there were the makeshift alarms rigged to the front and back doors
the porch swing blocking a stairway
heavy fabric obstructing the kitchen and the second floor
a plastic toilet in a bedroom
doors without handles , but with padlocks , dead bolts and slide locks
solid wood covering second - floor windows , assuring no light would enter even on bright , sunny days
and there were the restraints -- duct tape , plastic zip ties , metal chains fastened to a basement pole and bedroom walls -- to ensure that @entity37 , @entity37 and @entity37 would n't leave
but , despite @entity37 's efforts , they did
on may 6 , @entity40 alerted passers - by by banging on the front door then crawling out with her 6 - year - old daughter
police officers arrived and went upstairs , where @entity37 jumped into their arms -- holding them tight and thanking them for ending her 11 years of terror
a pale , quiet @entity50 emerged from a room a short time later
today , all three women are free
and @entity37 is paying a price for what he did : life in prison without parole and 1,000 years , as finalized in a @entity6 court thursday
@entity37 sentenced to life plus 1,000 years the sentence follows a deal in which @entity37 agreed to plead guilty to 937 charges to avoid a trial and a possible death penalty
the prosecution did n't have to present evidence thursday , but they did -- laying out in vivid detail the twisted torment that @entity37 , @entity50 , @entity40 and @entity40 's young daughter , fathered by @entity37 , went through -- in testimony , impact statements and a sentencing memorandum
" the days never got shorter , " said @entity37 , the lone victim to speak in court
" the nights turned into days
the days turned into years
the years turned into eternity
" lured into home , restrained and assaulted it started on august 22 , 2002 , when @entity37 saw the then 21 - year - old @entity37 at a @entity78
she was trying to find the social worker in charge of her son , then not even 2½ years old , @entity6 police @entity83
@entity37 asked around for directions , and @entity37 responded that he knew where to go
@entity37 knew his daughter , @entity88 , so she took up his offer for a ride
they ended up at the @entity1 home @entity37 had bought a decade earlier
did @entity37 want to go inside to get a puppy for her son , @entity37 asked ? she did , and went in
but instead of giving her a puppy , @entity37 tied her up with an extension cord
a few hours later , @entity37 was taken down to the basement , where she was restrained with a chain and with plastic ties around her wrists , said @entity85 , his department 's lead investigator on the case
@entity37 put a motorcycle helmet over her head
and then he sexually assaulted her -- for the first of what would be scores of times
@entity37 : ' after 11 years , i 'm finally being heard ' the following april , @entity37 spotted @entity37 walking along a @entity6 street in her @entity110
she was 16 ; he was 42
did @entity40 know his son , who 'd also worked at @entity110 ? what about his daughter @entity113 ? @entity40 said she knew them both , and she accepted his offer for a ride after he told her @entity113 was at @entity37 's home
@entity40 went in , but saw no sign of her friend , ending up in an upstairs bedroom
@entity40 asked to go home and when @entity37 did n't comply , she tried to run away -- her exit stopped when she slammed into a closet instead
then @entity37 sexually assaulted her , putting duct tape over her wrists , legs and mouth and a motorcycle helmet over her head
@entity40 was carried to the basement and tied to a chain attached to a center support pole
a third , eerily similar chapter of this story played out about a year later
this time the victim -- @entity37 -- was younger , at age 14
and she was even closer to @entity37 's family , as one of his daughter @entity144 's best friends
that spring afternoon , @entity50 and @entity145 had been together and hoped to spend the afternoon at @entity50 ' house
when that plan did n't pan out , the two walked separate ways
@entity37 spotted the two together , then apart
he admitted driving past his daughter to get to @entity50
she got in the car after he asked for help finding his daughter , then got out of it when he asked for help carrying a speaker from his home into his car , testified @entity85
once inside , @entity50 became uncomfortable and wanted to leave
@entity37 steered her , unwittingly , into the basement -- where she was tied up with a chain and plastic ties and sexually assaulted
constantly fearing for their lives the young women 's nightmares did n't end there
the sexual abuse was rampant , as was the violence and threats thereof
@entity37 had a gun that he 'd show to @entity37 , @entity50 and @entity40 , threatening to shoot them if they ever tried to escape , prosecutors said
at times , they 'd play @entity173 roulette -- where one bullet is loaded , the cylinder is spun and a person pulls the trigger to see whether the gun fires a shot
each woman was given one meal a day
they could n't use the lone bathroom downstairs , and were allowed to shower at most twice a week
after sexually abusing them , @entity37 would sometimes throw money at them -- money that he 'd take back if they wanted him to get anything on the outside
" he made them believe that their physical survival depended on him , " @entity191 prosecuting attorney @entity190 wrote in the prosecution investigation report and sentencing memorandum
" and he threatened to end their lives if they did not comply with his every demand
" when @entity37 became pregnant , @entity37 acted
he said they devised a plan together , which ended after " several days " following a diet of only tea and a regimen of knee bends and jumping jacks
but according to authorities , @entity37 ( and @entity50 ) explained it very differently : @entity37 punched , kicked and jumped on her stomach , forced her to do exercises and starved her for days
this happened multiple times , @entity37 told @entity85 , each time culminating in the loss of a baby
@entity37 's guilty plea included two counts of aggravated murder
she was n't given any prenatal care , but was allowed to carry the baby
and on christmas day 2006 , the little girl was born in a plastic baby pool ( to contain the mess ) inside the @entity1 home
@entity37 served as the midwife , albeit under great duress
the child was n't breathing when she emerged , until @entity37 breathed into her mouth
all the while , @entity37 loomed over her
" i remember @entity37 saying if that baby died , ' he was going to kill me ' , " recalled @entity6 police officer @entity229 , one of the two officers that went inside the home and rescued @entity37 , during her testimony thursday
that baby , miraculously , survived
and so did @entity37 , @entity40 and @entity50
" i spent 11 years in hell , " @entity37 said thursday , proclaiming herself a survivor before addressing @entity37
" now your hell is just beginning
" ' the damage that was done does not go away ' over all these years , @entity37 would go about his life -- working as a school bus driver , jamming in bands with names like @entity246 and @entity247 , going to church on sundays -- and return home to abuse the young women sexually , physically and emotionally again and again and again
in court on thursday , he tried to explain his behavior by saying , " i am not a monster
" @entity37 claimed his addiction to sex had compelled him to do things he understands were " 100 % wrong , " even as he denied torturing or beating his three captives
still , by pleading guilty to the hundreds of charges , @entity37 has officially admitted to committing numerous sordid crimes
plus , the stories of the victims and the ample evidence presented by law enforcement officers paint a vivid , horrifying picture of what these women went through
so how did they make it ? while the four captives were typically kept apart , they did help and draw strength from each other
@entity37 , the oldest of them , served as a doctor , nurse , midwife and pediatrician for @entity40 and her young child , dr. @entity273 testified thursday
and she literally put herself in between @entity37 and @entity50 , taking on physical and sexual abuse herself to protect her friend
in court thursday , @entity37 credited @entity50 -- whom she shared a dark room measuring about 7 feet by 11½ feet -- for saving her life
" i never let her fall , and she never let me fall , " @entity37 said
" she nursed me back to health when i was dying from his abuse
my friendship with @entity291 is the only good thing to come from this situation
" the captives kept diaries documenting the forced sex and anticipation of more abuse , the days and nights bleeding together amid the darkness , of being chained to walls and being treated like animals
and , somehow , they also kept hope
as @entity37 said , " we said we 'll all get out alive some day and we did
" @entity273 , a pioneer in trauma science , lauded the three women 's survival and coping skills as " marvelous , compelling examples of resilience , of imagination , of humanity
" still , while they 're no longer at 2207 @entity1 , their suffering from their years there is n't over , he said
" the damage that was done does not go away
they have life sentences , " said @entity273
" ... i think they will -- with the love and support of the whole community -- they have a good chance to live a good life
but that does n't mean that they 'll ever be free of the damage that was done
