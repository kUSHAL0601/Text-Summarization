@entity0 once said that we can understand some parts of nature and the universe , but we ca n't comprehend them
for instance , take the fact that in the next 12 years , we 're projected to add another billion people
since a billion seconds equal 31.7 years , at the rate people are arriving , we ca n't even count them
or that the @entity11 now says that if we want to stay below a 2 - degree @entity14 ( 3.6 - degree @entity13 ) increase in average global temperature , we ca n't emit any more carbon dioxide than what 's released by burning 1 trillion tons of carbon
but we 've already used more than half our allotment
there 's a direct link between those two hard - to - grasp figures -- the more humans , the more carbon
every mile we drive , ours cars emit about a pound of carbon dioxide
the average @entity30 driver clocks 12,000 miles per year , pushing six tons of carbon out of his auto 's tailpipe
the quarter - billion cars in the @entity30 expel 150 million tons a year
in the whole world , there are now well over 1 billion cars
those numbers are mind - boggling , even before we add the exhaust from our industries , power plants , and home heating and cooling
no , we ca n't easily comprehend the sheer scale of the problem , let alone imagine what we can do about it
but maybe this helps to frame it
according to the @entity54 , to stay on the safe side of a 2 - degree @entity14 increase , we 'd have to go back to the amount we were expelling in 1990 -- and then cut that in half
how might we possibly do that ? it will depend on how wisely we address the matter of those billion new humans
here are four ways to cut greenhouse gases , from the most unlikely to the most plausible : the first is to trap them before they float skyward and start acting like glass in a greenhouse
this is possible -- theoretically
we know how to capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks ( though not from all those cars )
we 'd then have to dig deep holes to pump it underground and somehow keep it there
one way is to inject the gas into underground saline aquifers , turning their contents into salty carbonic acid , which would then react with surrounding rocks until the carbon dioxide becomes entombed in solid carbonates
that 's very neat but very expensive
the only attempt in the @entity30 , in @entity84 , was abandoned in 2011 by @entity85 because it would have cost two - thirds of $ 1 billion , even with the @entity86 footing half the bill
realistically , we 'll never afford this -- and we 're one of the rich countries
imagine the rest of the world doing it
the second possibility is finding new ways to produce clean energy
we must keep trying , but so far we ca n't concentrate enough diffuse sunlight or intermittent wind to run all our cities and factories ( and it 's hard to hang solar panels or wind turbines on cars )
also , a 2012 paper in @entity105 by former @entity107 chief technology officer @entity106 and @entity109 physicist @entity108 showed that the carbon debt incurred by construction of renewable energy plants , including mining their materials , takes decades to amortize before their energy is truly emission - free
and exotic methods such as controlled nuclear fusion , which powers the sun 's core , are enticing but perpetually decades away
third , we can use incentives such as carbon taxes and moral persuasion to bring down energy consumption
again , these help , and must be encouraged
although a number of countries and some @entity30 states have passed carbon taxes , consumption is exceedingly hard to control in a world where , for example , even the world 's poor masses , increasingly living in cities , manage to get cell phones
whether the power is pirated or not , they plug in their chargers nightly
despite all our best efforts to conserve and consume less , global carbon emissions reached a record high in 2012 , and keep climbing
@entity144 , however , if we ca n't control consumption , we can control the number of consumers
this is technology we already have , and it 's cheap
every woman , everywhere , could have contraception
most of us would find coercive government limits on child bearing abhorrent
but giving women access to contraception and to education makes draconian edicts unnecessary
an educated woman has an interesting and useful contribution to make to her family and her society
since she ca n't easily do that with seven children hanging on her skirts , most women who get through secondary school want two children or fewer
providing access to contraception and educating women may be the fastest path to giving our planet a break
in september , the @entity11 presented compelling evidence that seas are rising faster than ever in human history
the last time there was this much carbon in the atmosphere , at least 3 million years ago , oceans were 30 to 100 feet higher
much of the world 's most widely consumed foodstuff , rice , is grown near sea level , and the cost of protecting it with coastal dikes would be astronomical
this month , a team of @entity191 climate modelers added in the journal nature that in just seven years the tropics will be experiencing average temperatures unprecedented in recorded history -- and within a generation , so will the entire planet , unless we stabilize greenhouse gases in the next 20 years
population management ca n't do it all ; we need a full - court press on all fronts
but if we want a secure future , we need to start with the fastest , most affordable way we know to limit carbon emissions : by bringing fewer emitters into the world .
