@entity1 is looking into launching iphones with a 4.7 - inch and a 5.7 - inch screen , @entity0 reports , citing sources with knowledge of the matter
the company is also considering launching a cheaper variant of the @entity9 , that would cost around $ 99 and come in 5 - 6 colors
the moves are described as being " under discussion , " meaning they may never actually happen
if they do , however , it would mean @entity1 has more or less abandoned its position as the standard - setter in the smartphone market and become just another trend - follower
long - known for its limited palette of products , @entity1 always focused on the premium segment of the market , claiming the form factors of its devices , as well as the prices , are just right
for example , @entity26 currently offers smartphones and phablets with more than 10 different screen sizes , while @entity1 has only two : the 3.5 - inch @entity31 and the 4 - inch @entity9
the @entity9 was launched last september , and @entity1 is widely expected to unveil a new @entity9 around that time this year
one of @entity0 ' sources claims the company " constantly changes product specifications almost to the final moment , " so — as usual — no one except @entity1 really knows whether we 'll also see a bigger or a cheaper @entity9 in september as well
how do you feel about a 4.7 - inch or a 5.7 - inch @entity9 ? how about a cheaper , colorful one ? share your thoughts in the comments
