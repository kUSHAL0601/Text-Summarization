@entity0 , @entity1 -- two @entity5 @entity4 helicopters arrived saturday to assist with humanitarian and rescue efforts in flood - ravaged @entity1 , which canceled celebrations of its 63rd birthday
a statement from the @entity10 says the two aircraft are part of the contingent of 19 helicopters , ordered to @entity1 on wednesday by @entity16 secretary of defense @entity15
seven of the 19 craft are now in the country
one other @entity4 helicopter and four @entity21 @entity4 helicopters arrived earlier this week
twelve @entity23 helicopters will arrive over the next few days
since august 5 , @entity16 military helicopters have rescued more than 3,500 people and transported more than 412,000 pounds of emergency relief supplies , according to the @entity10
one - fifth of @entity1 -- which is about the size of @entity29 -- has been flooded in relentless monsoon rains , the @entity27 says
nearly 1,400 people have died and 875,000 homes have either washed away or are damaged , according to @entity1 's @entity33
millions more are still at peril as the bloated @entity36 is cresting this weekend in parts of @entity38
in some areas , the @entity36 has expanded from its usual width of one mile to 12 miles
homes , crops , trees , livestock , entire villages and towns have been transformed into vast lakes
the worst floods since @entity1 's creation have disrupted the lives of about 20 million people , prime minister @entity48 said saturday
surrounded by a tragedy of epic proportions , @entity1 canceled saturday 's celebrations of independence , hard won from the @entity57 in 1947
they might have otherwise attended parades , burst firecrackers and waved the green and white flag proudly
instead , president @entity64 , under fire for a perceived lack of government response , toured flood - ravaged @entity65 in the north , where the crisis began more than two weeks ago
he urged @entity1 to remember the afflicted
" the best way to celebrate the @entity70 this year is to reach out to the victims and help them to help themselves , " he said , according to the @entity68 of @entity1
" i stand with you and the people of @entity1 stand with you as well , in your hour of trial , " he told flood victims in @entity73
" do not lose hope as the entire nation stands with you
" @entity48 said that even some religious events connected to the @entity81 holy month of @entity82 were canceled
he said money that might have been spent on @entity84 , the feast that breaks the daily fast between sunrise and sundown , should be used to alleviate suffering
meanwhile , the @entity27 said secretary general @entity87 intends to visit @entity1 sunday and see the devastation firsthand
his trip comes as @entity27 and other humanitarian agencies are racing against time to prevent more death and suffering
" relief supplies must reach women , men and children as soon as possible , in order to avoid further death caused by waterborne diseases and food shortages , " said @entity93 , the @entity27 ' humanitarian coordinator for @entity1
" the death toll has so far been relatively low compared with other major natural disasters , and we want to keep it that way , " he said
@entity1 emergency officials predicted the second wave of floodwaters gushing down the @entity36 could reach the southern town of @entity111 by saturday evening
hundreds of thousands of people living along the @entity36 could be stranded , along with the tens of thousands stranded by the first wave , said @entity115
@entity116 of the @entity1 navy
many residents have ignored government warnings to evacuate the area , causing a big concern , @entity116 said
" the time to act is now -- this is a disaster of unimaginable proportions , " said @entity122 , head of the @entity1 @entity123
thousands of flood victims huddled in sludgy camps or in jam - packed public buildings
others slept under the stars next to the cows , sheep and goats they managed to rescue from rising waters
but when they might be able to return to dry lands at home remained a big question
@entity1 's monsoon season is only half way over and more rain is on the way
@entity2 's @entity142 and @entity143 contributed to this report .
