@entity0 -- both the @entity3 and the independent @entity4 are investigating an aborted landing by a plane carrying first lady @entity7 because it was too close to a military plane ahead , officials announced wednesday
neither plane was in danger in the incident monday at @entity12 , according to both agencies
" we consider any incident like this a serious incident , " transportation secretary @entity14 said in confirming the @entity3 review
" it 's under investigation , we will get to the bottom of what happened and how it happened , and obviously make sure it does n't happen again
" later wednesday , the @entity3 said in a statement it will now require supervisory oversight in monitoring flights transporting the vice president or first lady
such supervision is currently required in monitoring flights carrying the president , the @entity3 said
@entity14 emphasized that the first lady was never in any danger and said he had yet to hear from either @entity7 or the president about it
@entity38 press secretary @entity37 confirmed wednesday that @entity39 , the vice president 's wife , also was on the plane as she and the first lady returned from a series of media events supporting military families
the @entity4 also is launching a probe into monday 's incident , which occurred " after an air traffic controller had sequenced it too close to another military plane , " the agency said in a statement
according to the @entity4 statement , the plane transporting the first lady -- the military version of a @entity60 -- " was directed to abort its landing attempt after the required minimum separation between it and a c - 17 military aircraft that was landing ahead of it was compromised
" it said the incident involved @entity3 air traffic controllers at the @entity65 regional radar facility in @entity66 and the @entity12 tower in @entity68
the planes -- which were both trying to land -- were three miles apart , when they are supposed to be five miles apart , a senior administration official told @entity1
the official added it was believed to be an air traffic controller mistake
asked why the separation rules governing plane landings were not followed , @entity14 said : " that 's what we 'll figure out in the investigation
" the @entity3 said in a statement controllers at the air force base instructed an incoming @entity60 to perform a " go around " " because the plane did not have the required amount of separation " behind the military plane
" the aircraft were never in any danger , " the agency said
the landing was briefly aborted and the plane carrying the first lady had to circle , according to the senior administration official
@entity7 's plane , known as a @entity95 , was part of the @entity97 , not the regular @entity99 fleet used by @entity100 at @entity12 , said maj. @entity101 of the @entity102 at @entity12
the @entity3 did not want @entity7 's plane to be caught in the " jet wash " of the @entity105 as it landed , @entity101 said , referring to air turbulence trailing in the wake of the plane 's jet engines
" it 's important to know the @entity3 made the right call and at no time was the first lady 's life in danger , " @entity101 said
when the @entity65 radar facility handed off the plane to the @entity12 tower , the planes were three miles apart , a government official told @entity1
" both facilities knew how far apart they were " at the time of the hand - off , the official said
but the official declined to say why the hand - off occurred
the @entity65 could have slowed @entity7 's plane down or order it to turn earlier , the official said
why that was n't done is under investigation , but " it was a controlled situation , " the government official said
@entity1 's @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .
