@entity0 , @entity1 -- the firefighters are on the offensive
over several hellish days , the @entity5 singed more than 15,000 acres north of @entity0
what 's left behind , in some areas , " looks like a nuclear bomb went off , " according to @entity10 county sheriff @entity9
then came some rain , more clouds , less wind and -- very much related to all of that -- marked progress friday
that continued into saturday , as defined by a few simple measures : no more structures destroyed , no more area burned and more inroads corralling what 's left
" today , we 're optimistic , " said @entity22 , the federal incident commander overseeing the fight
then , as if addressing the fire itself , he added , " we 're ready for it ... show yourself , we 'll be there to fight right back
" in the first few days after the first broke out , for still unexplained reasons , crews had zero containment on the @entity5 as it ravaged woods and neighborhoods
@entity37 spokesman @entity36 told @entity2 it appeared to be the most destructive in the history of @entity1 -- a state that 's all too familiar with devastating wildfires
residents hope for best , brace for worst as of saturday afternoon , authorities had counted 473 structures totally lost due to the four - day - old blaze , with another 17 partially damaged
the reason for that mix -- why , for the most part , homes were either destroyed or escaped unscathed -- was the speed and intensity of the flames , @entity9 explained saturday
in some areas , there 's no number on the house , no mailbox and next - to - no other signs that someone had lived there , just a few days ago

" that is the level of incineration and destruction that took place in some areas
" but things changed for the better friday
in the morning , the blaze was 5 % contained
by evening , it was 30 %
that pivotal number continued to improve through midday saturday , when @entity22 said there was 45 % containment
video shows firefighters fending off fire from house 's deck not just that , but authorities are noticing fewer hotspots and fewer flare - ups than they have in days
all of it is positive news , even as @entity22 warns that there 's still material sitting on the ground , waiting to be burned , if conditions suddenly change or firefighters let down their guard
the prospect of progress is all the more appreciated , given the other wildfires still burning in @entity1
the @entity101 , southwest of @entity0 , was 40 % contained after a week in which it scorched more than 3,200 acres -- including a beloved carousel and at least 20 buildings , according to gov. @entity106
" it 's burned to a cinder , " he said friday of the area
the governor has declared a disaster emergency in @entity112 , northwest of @entity113 , due to the @entity114 that 's burned hundreds of acres there
the latest flare - up is the @entity117 in the western part of the state
no structures are reported destroyed yet in that blaze , but gusty winds , low humidity and warm temperatures have firefighters on edge
while all those fires pose dangers in their own ways , the @entity5 is still by far the biggest and the most dangerous -- which is why thousands in that area remain evacuated , because their homes remain in areas where it is too perilous to return
" it 's been a pretty good emotional roller coaster , " said @entity134 , one of those who live in the @entity5 evacuation zone and now has little to do except hope and wait
woman records wildfire evacuation getting him and others off of that wild ride , by saving their homes , remains the primary mission of those on the front lines of the blaze
more than 1,000 personnel -- more than at any point this week -- were part of the firefighting effort saturday
they included boots on the ground , as well as helicopters and tankers overhead
said @entity9 : " we 're hoping to gain inches each day to get people 's lives back to normal , where it can be returned to normal
" study warns of continued wildfires in western @entity164 @entity2 's @entity165 reported from @entity0 , and @entity166 wrote in @entity167 .
