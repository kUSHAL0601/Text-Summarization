the first @entity1 war combat veteran to serve in the @entity2 introduced legislation on thursday aimed at reducing the number of military veterans who commit suicide
no matter the cost of the measures urged in the sweeping bill , " that is the cost of war , " @entity11 sen. @entity10 of @entity12 told @entity14
every day , 22 veterans commit suicide
to @entity17 , that is more than a number
from 2004 to 2005 , he commanded an infantry battalion of the @entity21 in @entity1
when the unit returned home , one of @entity17 's soldiers committed suicide
when @entity17 became adjutant general of the @entity21 , a few more guardsmen died by suicide
read more at @entity14 's ' @entity29 ' " far too often , we 're leaving our veterans to fight their toughest battles alone , " @entity17 said
" returning home from combat does not erase what happened there , and yet red tape and government dysfunction have blocked access to the care that saves lives
it is our duty to come together for real solutions for our heroes , " @entity17 told @entity14 on thursday
the @entity45 for @entity47 's @entity46 is collaboration between @entity17 and the @entity1 and @entity49
founded in 2004 , @entity50 is the first and largest organization for new veterans and their families , with 270,000 members nationwide
the next step for @entity17 is to get a co-sponsor for the bill
he said he 's already received bipartisan support behind the scenes
the veterans organization is working on getting a similar bill in the @entity62 , said @entity50 political director @entity63
what 's in the bill ? among the bill 's key objectives is to give veterans more time to receive mental health treatment
currently , when a service member separates from active duty -- whether they are transitioning to being a veteran or becoming a reservist or a member of the @entity21 -- they have five years to receive care from the @entity78 , @entity63 said
sometimes it can take longer than five years for service members and veterans to realize they 're experiencing the symptoms of @entity83 and other mental injuries
read the bill ( @entity86 ) about 25 % of @entity50 's members , @entity63 said , have experienced a delayed onset of ptsd after getting out of the service
many times , five years is just not long enough for veterans who are dealing with the stigma of mental health issues
it can take many years to emotionally come to grips with the diagnosis alone , and then it takes time to find and receive the right care
to address that , @entity17 's bill would extend the time to receive mental health treatment from five years to 15 years
watch : veteran talk about long struggle with @entity83 before receiving help the legislation also seeks to improve the quality of mental health care providers by making their jobs more competitive with the private sector , @entity63 said
right now there are more than 1,000 open jobs at the va for mental health care jobs , including psychiatric nurses , physician assistants and psychiatrists , among others , she said
the bill will introduce a pilot initiative that would allow a student to have their loans repaid if they work for the @entity78 , @entity63 said
it also calls for annual reviews of care programs within the @entity127 and the @entity78 to ensure resources are being used effectively to help service members and vets struggling with mental health issues
further , the legislation points out that the @entity78 and the @entity127 use two different computer systems and mandates that those systems be amended so that they speak to each other more seamlessly
the legislation would also try to streamline the way the @entity127 and the @entity78 prescribe medication
currently , they use different drug prescription protocols , @entity17 and military experts told @entity14 , and that can create a difficult situation
for example , a service member overcomes the hurdle of admitting they need care , seeks help from a @entity127 doctor and , after several tries , gets on a drug that works for him or her
when that warrior become a veteran , they go to a @entity78 doctor only to be told that the drug the @entity127 doctor gave them is not available under @entity78 protocols
the bill was introduced the same week that @entity1 and @entity49 held its annual @entity163 initiative
teams comprised of four veterans whoses live have been rocked by a fellow warrior 's suicide met with lawmakers in @entity169
the veterans shared their stories , and implored those in power to do something substantial to address the problem
dollar costs and mental costs it 's unclear how much it would cost to do everything the bill lays out , according to @entity181 , @entity17 's spokeswoman
@entity17 is waiting for the @entity182 to provide a figure , she said
but the senator stressed that it will cost far more in years to come if changes are not made soon to improve mental health care
the legislation comes at a time of fierce belt tightening in the armed forces
in february , the @entity127 said it would reduce the size of the @entity193 to @entity195 numbers , retire the a popular a- 10 " @entity197 " attack jet and reduce some benefits for warriors
" this is a budget that recognizes the reality of the magnitude of our fiscal challenges , the dangerous world we live in , and the @entity47 military 's unique and indispensable role in the security of this country and in today 's volatile world , " secretary of defense @entity201 said in february
" there are difficult decisions ahead , " he said
" that is the reality we 're living with
" downsizing due to modernization and budget constraints began under @entity222 's predecessor , @entity221
the @entity1 and @entity224 wars are the longest continuous battles the @entity47 has fought
the @entity1 war lasted from 2003 to 2010 and @entity224 has been raging since soon after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks
president @entity228 has said that the @entity47 could withdraw all troops from @entity224 by the end of 2014
more than 2 million @entity47 have served in combat in those two wars
researchers estimate that as many as 300,000 service members may meet criteria for ptsd and between 200,000 and 300,000 have suffered a traumatic brain injury from mild to severe , according to dr. @entity237 with the @entity238
the nonprofit think - tank @entity239 estimates a third of veterans likely have @entity242 , ptsd or depression , which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000
a large body of research indicates @entity83 is associated with increased likelihood of suicidal behavior
beyond the bill @entity17 was sworn into the @entity2 in january after @entity12 gov. @entity250 named @entity17 , his lieutenant governor , to serve the remainder of sen. @entity253 ' term after he became @entity47 ambassador to @entity255
@entity17 is running for election in november
@entity17 's legislation , @entity50 's @entity63 told @entity14 , has bipartisan support
and the goal is to get it passed by @entity260 , far before an election is a concern
@entity17 said lawmakers must also address suicides amongst military family members , too
the @entity127 is currently not tracking the number of suicides among relatives
@entity14 recently explored the topic and spoke to dozens of relatives who said they had contemplated or attempted killing themselves
warrior suicides and military family member suicides are " connected , " @entity17 said
speaking about a warrior under his command who had been deployed three times whose wife was left to care for triplets , @entity17 said he understood that families have been under extreme stress for years
the relatives have made " enormous sacrifices , " he said .
