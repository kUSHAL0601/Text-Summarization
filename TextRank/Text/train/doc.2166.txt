-- with a bit of technical ingenuity , @entity2 web giant @entity1 has developed a moving map of travelers as they return home for @entity8 , which begins this week
the map , which updates hourly , works by pulling location data from users ' mobile phones as they travel across the country
users can click to see which routes and cities have the most traffic at any given moment
the @entity8 , also known as spring festival in @entity2 , is a hectic time for the country of over 1.3 billion people , as hundreds of millions leave the cities to visit their relatives , many of whom remain in the countryside
although the country is rapidly urbanizing , a huge number of city - dwelling @entity2 are considered migrant workers , and do not enjoy full legal and social rights in urban areas
( in @entity2 ) @entity2 's struggle to urbanize migrant workers remain vulnerable
