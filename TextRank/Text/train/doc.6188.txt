-- a man who 'd been grazed with a bullet helped subdue a gunman
an intern tended to the wounded congresswoman whose staff he 'd joined just days before
a woman put an extra ammunition clip out of the gunman 's reach , and a doctor who 'd witnessed the shooting performed cpr on the injured
@entity14 salutes the following people who responded to saturday 's shooting at a political event outside a supermarket in @entity19 , @entity20 -- a shooting that killed six people and wounded 14 others , including @entity24 rep. @entity23 -- with acts of courage
retired army col. @entity27 and @entity28 @entity27 and @entity28 were two of the men who helped subdue the gunman during a pause in the shooting , according to witnesses
@entity27 , 74 , was at the event to meet @entity23
he hit the ground when the shooting started and felt a sting on the back of his head -- he 'd been grazed by a bullet
when the shooting stopped , @entity27 stood up and found the shooter was right in front of him , he said
" one other individual that was there to meet with the congresswoman took one of the chairs that they had been sitting on , folded it , and hit ( the gunman ) ... right on the shoulders , " @entity27 told @entity0 's " @entity53 " on monday
it 's not clear who hit the gunman with the chair
@entity27 , bleeding from his wound , grabbed the suspect 's left wrist , " and with my right hand i hit him right between the shoulder blades , and he was going down , " @entity27 said
when the suspect was on the ground , another person took a gun away from him , @entity27 said
@entity28 helped to subdue the gunman , according to media reports , but his exact role is n't clear
various people kept the gunman down for a few minutes until authorities arrived
@entity27 said the real hero is " the individual that picked up the chair and hit ( the gunman ) , and the other individual who helped me take this individual down to the ground
" a man authorities accuse of being the gunman , @entity81 , was arrested and has been charged in federal court in connection with the shooting
@entity27 was treated for the bullet graze and released
@entity88 @entity88 was one of the people who helped keep the suspect pinned to the ground after he had been taken down
@entity88 was inside a nearby @entity92 when he heard the gunfire
he said he ran outside and saw people wrestling with the suspect
" i laid on him and held him down , and made sure the gun was down , " he said
@entity97 @entity98 , 61 , is credited with taking an ammunition clip from the suspect after he was wrestled to the ground
@entity98 said that she dropped to the ground when the shooting started
she was about 20 feet from @entity23 , who was shot in the head
when the suspect was sent to the ground , the men subduing him shouted for others to get the gun and a clip that had fallen to the ground
the suspect had pulled the clip out of his pocket , @entity98 said
" i was able to kneel up and was able to take the magazine ... before he did , " @entity98 said
@entity98 then knelt on the suspect 's knees a while before realizing that @entity27 needed help with his wound
" so i asked another gentleman to kneel on ( the suspect 's ) legs
i went in and got some towels from @entity126 and made a compress for @entity128 and held it on his head until the police came , " she said
@entity133 @entity133 , a 20 - year - old @entity134 junior , had just started as an intern with @entity23 ' staff that week
he initially used his bare hands to stop blood gushing from @entity23 ' head after she was shot
@entity133 , who trained as a certified nursing assistant , lifted her head to make it easier for her to breathe
eventually workers from the nearby @entity126 supermarket arrived with clean smocks to cover @entity23 ' wound
@entity133 continued to apply pressure to the wound
" my main thing was just to keep her as alert as possible and just keep trying to interact with her
... the entire time i was with the congresswoman , she was still responding , " @entity133 said
" she was obviously in a lot of pain , so i let her know to squeeze my hand as hard as she needed to
" after an ambulance arrived , @entity133 rode with her to the hospital
" people have been referring to me as a hero
i do n't think that i am
i think the people who are heroes are people like @entity164 , who have dedicated their lives to public service , " he said
" it just makes me happy to know that i could help her in any way that i could
" @entity20 gov. @entity170 acknowledged @entity133 in a speech before state lawmakers on monday , saying he " showed no fear in the face of gunfire
" " his quick action in going to @entity23 ' aid likely saved her life , " @entity170 said
dr. @entity179 @entity179 was one of the people who helped hold the suspect down after the takedown
he also administered cpr to some of the wounded
@entity179 said he was at the event to meet @entity23 at the urging of a friend
he said he was standing at the side of @entity23 ' table when the shooting started
" i looked up just as the gunman was firing the shot at @entity194
... to be honest i froze for just a second , not quite understanding what was going on
he continued to fire sort of rapidly , really at point blank range , " @entity179 said
after the suspect was brought down , @entity179 helped to restrain him
but the physician soon afterward started tending to the shooting victims
" in treating gunshot wound victims , it 's basically stopping the hemorrhage , and getting @entity205 there as soon as possible
that 's basically the treatment ; there 's not much else you can do , " @entity179 said
" ( for ) those who had actually stopped breathing or had no pulse , cpr was initiated
" @entity0 's @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and the @entity219 contributed to this report .
