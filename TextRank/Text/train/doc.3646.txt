@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 public , especially those in the social networking community , are abuzz over the case of a man charged with killing a girl in a hit - and - run : he is the son of a local deputy police chief
@entity11 , 23 , is accused of " perpetration of traffic accident , " a charge punishable by three to seven years in prison
during the two - and - a - half hour trial wednesday in the northern city of @entity18 , @entity11 admitted causing the death of @entity20 , 20 , according to @entity1 media reports
it 's more than just a tragic traffic accident
" there is a lot of popular anger about ' guan er dai , ' the children of officials who sometimes literally get away with murder , " says @entity27 , founding editor - in - chief of @entity29 , a @entity1 media website
he said the online uproar is focused on " how likely it is that @entity37 will get away with a light sentence , and whether blood money will secure his freedom
" official media have reported that @entity11 was drunk when he ran over two female students on the @entity45 campus , killing @entity20 and injuring fellow student @entity46
@entity11 allegedly tried to speed away from the scene
it was also reported that , when students and campus security guards stopped him , he shouted at the guards , " my daddy is @entity54 " -- referring to a local deputy police chief
when indignant @entity1 internet users got wind of the story , they blogged and reposted it widely
before long , " my - daddy - is - @entity54 " went viral
" it spread on the @entity63 -- on blogs , forum websites and the @entity67 - like microblog service @entity68 , " recalls @entity27 , a long - time observer of @entity1 's social networking sites
" the public expressed outrage on the @entity63 , and the traditional news media and the government reacted to the internet coverage of the event
" despite the government 's efforts to contain the fallout , the incident drew widespread criticism among @entity1 's estimated 420 million internet users
" my daddy is @entity54 " became one of the top search items on most popular @entity1 search engines , a viral catchphrase synonymous to abuse of power
some composed sarcastic poems and songs
others parodied the father - son duo in videos posted in cyberspace
the case became a cause célèbre among @entity63 users who viewed it as an example of official abuse
it also put the spotlight on the growing gap between the rich and the poor
@entity103 , the victim 's 23 - year - old brother , complained : " in society they say everyone is equal , but in every corner there is inequality
how can you live in this country and this society without any worry ? i feel like there should be deep reflection on this
" @entity0 resident @entity120 , a white - collar worker , agrees
" the case is symbolic , " he tells me
" in @entity1 it 's all about who your father is
without a good father , you already lose at the starting line
without a good father , you have to work 10 times harder than those born with good fathers
" the @entity1 authorities have tried to assuage the public ire
days after the accident , the @entity133 showed @entity11 under police detention , profusely apologizing and expressing remorse
his father @entity54 also appeared in a nationally broadcast tv interview , breaking down and bowing deeply to apologize to the victim 's family
" as for my child 's education , as a father i failed , " he cried
" i am very sad , very guilty , very ashamed
" he promised not to shield his son from the law
in november , according to @entity1 media reports , @entity54 reached a civil settlement with the victim 's families , agreeing to pay 460,000 yuan ( us $ 67,700 ) in restitution for the @entity20 family and 92,000 yuan ( us $ 14,000 ) to @entity46 's family
he did not attend wednesday 's court hearing
the victim 's brother @entity103 attended
" my family and i want justice , " he was quoted by the @entity1 media as saying
the state prosecutor asked for a three - to - seven year prison sentence for @entity11 , according to the @entity160 , while the defendant 's lawyer called for leniency , noting that he has expressed remorse and compensated the victims ' families
it is not known how soon the court will render its sentence
years ago , incidents like this would have been non-events
victims would have been intimidated and forgotten
" this is another landmark example of the @entity63 playing a significant role in curbing official abuses , " says @entity27 of @entity29
with the @entity63 and social network sites at the disposal of millions of ordinary citizens , abusive officials and their children are now getting caught in the act more and more often
" there have been enough similar cases over the last few years that -- according to @entity1 media reports -- some government officials have now acquired ' internet phobia , ' " observes @entity27
" they fear of having their wrongdoings exposed by angry netizens
" but @entity0 resident @entity120 is enthused : " i raise my hand and shout : long live the @entity63 ! "
