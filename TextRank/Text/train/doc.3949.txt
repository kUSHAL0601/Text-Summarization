-- the latest legal battle over same - sex marriage is in the hands of a panel of @entity6 federal appeals court judges
@entity7 , a 2008 measure approved by @entity6 voters that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman , was the focal point of monday 's @entity15 hearing
opponents of the measure want the court to uphold a federal district judge 's august decision , which ruled that the proposition violated the equal protection clause of the @entity24 @entity23
supporters note that the proposition was approved by 52 percent of voters , and argue that it protects the " institution of marriage
" " i believe it 's to preserve the institution of marriage for the purposes that it has always served , " attorney @entity35 said , arguing that the key reason marriage exists in society is " that sexual relationships between men and women naturally produce children
" attorney @entity45 , representing opponents of proposition 8 , argued that the measure is unconstitutional and denies " the fundamental right of ... citizens to marry
" " @entity6 has engraved discrimination on the basis of sex and sexual orientation into its fundamental governing charter , " he said
ultimately , the judges ' decision could hinge as much on who 's arguing the case as what their arguments are
the first half of monday 's hearing focused on the legal standing of the parties appealing the federal district judge 's decision
that 's because @entity7 is in a " paradoxical situation , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity66 said
" the usual defendants when you challenge a law of the state are the governor and attorney general of that state
but the governor and attorney general of @entity6 , @entity80 and @entity81 , both agree with the plaintiffs that @entity7 is unconstitutional , " he said
so in their place , other groups have stepped in to defend the measure
the question , @entity66 explained , is " do they have the legal right to be there ? " along those lines , the three - judge panel opened monday 's hearing with tough questioning of parties seeking to appeal the decision , including @entity96 and @entity97 , deputy clerk and deputy commissioner of civil marriages for @entity100 , @entity6 , where voters overwhelmingly approved @entity7
" what 's your best case to allow for your standing in federal court ? " one judge asked attorney @entity35 , representing @entity96
" your honor , i do n't have a case , " @entity35 responded , referring to relevant past court decisions
@entity35 later urged the panel to consider the @entity6 @entity114 's earlier ruling in favor of @entity7 " if you do n't agree with me that we have standing
" later judge @entity117 questioned attorney @entity118 , who represented @entity119 , about how a deputy clerk , instead of the clerk , could have legal standing in the appeal
@entity118 told the court that the county clerks are local officers , but they perform state functions such as civil marriages
monday 's hearing was the latest in a long - running battle over same - sex marriage in @entity6
the state 's high court had allowed same - sex marriage , but then the 2008 @entity7 voter referendum passed with 52 percent of the vote
the @entity6 @entity114 subsequently allowed that initiative to stand , saying it represented the will of the people
two same - sex couples filed a federal challenge , saying the law violated 14th @entity143 constitutional protections of due process and equal protection
on august 4 , @entity24 district judge @entity146 agreed , ruling that the voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage violated the equal protection clause of the @entity24 @entity23
" @entity7 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license , " @entity146 , who was appointed to the federal bench by former president @entity151 , wrote in his 136 - page opinion
" indeed , the evidence shows @entity7 does nothing more than enshrine in the @entity160 the notion that opposite - sex couples are superior to same - sex couples
" same - sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the @entity166
the five states are @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171
@entity146 's landmark ruling led to a swift federal appeal that could ultimately reach the @entity114
@entity0 's @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .
