-- two @entity2 lawmakers , upset that @entity3 was not picked as one of the retirement homes for @entity7 's space shuttles , introduced legislation friday that would bring the @entity10 shuttle to the city for 15 years
@entity7 announced tuesday the locations to receive the four remaining space shuttles -- three historic orbiters and the program 's test vehicle
the space shuttle @entity17 will be displayed at the @entity18 in @entity19 ; the @entity20 , at the @entity21 in @entity22 ; the @entity10 , at the @entity23 's @entity25 @entity24 in @entity26 ; and the test shuttle enterprise at the @entity28 in @entity29
" the @entity23 is @entity31 's museum
over the years of their history , they have readily loaned major @entity31 artifacts to the @entity31 people
what better community to host an orbiter than @entity3 , @entity2 , " rep. @entity37 , @entity38 , said in a statement
" @entity31 is a great country
it is a fair country , and this is a solution that is both great and fair
" @entity3 is home to the @entity45 , which is where @entity7 's @entity46 is located
" the goal of this bill is to reverse an unjust decision which would have an adverse economic impact on the city of @entity3
the @entity45 and its committed workforce have been a key component of the space shuttle program since it started in the 1980s , " said rep. @entity52 , @entity38 , who introduced the legislation along with @entity37
earlier this week , 17 members of the @entity31 @entity59 @entity2 delegation sent a letter to @entity7 administrator @entity61 to express their disappointment and to say they were prepared to use their power in @entity64 to " stop this wasteful decision
" the decision the lawmakers seem most concerned about is the one to send the test shuttle enterprise to @entity29
the enterprise now is on display at the @entity23 's @entity25
the @entity72 , which never flew in space , will be moved to @entity29 so the @entity23 can make room for @entity10
" it defies logic for a shuttle to go to @entity29 , a place with no connection to @entity7
it 's like putting the @entity84 in @entity85 , " rep. @entity80 , @entity81 , said in a statement
housing a space shuttle is not just an honor -- it means money , according to the executive director of @entity29 's @entity28
@entity90 estimates that once the shuttle is in place , her museum will see an additional 300,000 people and $ 106 million in economic benefit
that is a benefit @entity98 believe is rightfully theirs
rep. @entity99 , also a @entity2 @entity100 , bluntly reiterated that in a statement , saying , " no city in the world deserves a shuttle more than @entity3 , certainly not @entity29
