with a congressional hearing set for week 's end , president @entity0 vowed monday to hold the @entity3 accountable if reports of political targeting turn out to be true
" if in fact @entity3 personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups , then that 's outrageous
and there 's no place for it , " @entity0 told reporters
" and they have to be held fully accountable
because the @entity3 as an independent agency requires absolute integrity , and people have to have confidence that they 're ... applying the laws in a nonpartisan way
" documents set to be released this week by the @entity3 watchdog show that the agency targeted tea party organizations and other groups focused on government spending and the federal debt that were seeking tax - exempt status
the @entity3 also applied extra scrutiny to applicants with statements that " criticize how the country is run " or that sought to educate the public on how to " make @entity35 a better place to live , " designations that would have included conservative political groups looking to apply for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status
those disclosures are included in the appendix of an inspector general 's report , obtained by @entity44 , that has caused widespread anger among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as conservative groups
@entity50 : what 's behind the @entity3 flap an @entity3 official admitted friday that the agency made " mistakes " in the past few years with tax - exempt status applications submitted by groups with the words " tea party " or " patriot " in their names
multiple conservative groups have said their applications were delayed and returned with lengthy requests for supporting materials , sometimes including website printouts and lists of guest speakers
@entity0 said he learned of the allegations through news reports on friday and did n't want to comment on any findings by the @entity73 inspector - general that oversees the @entity3 -- but if true , he said , " it is contrary to our traditions , and people have to be held accountable , and it 's got to be fixed
" so we 'll wait and see what exactly all the details and the facts are , " he said
" but i 've got no patience with it , i will not tolerate it , and i will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this
" @entity3 chief to face @entity87 on friday the @entity89 - led @entity88 , which oversees the @entity3 , announced it would hold a hearing on the allegations friday morning
slated to testify are @entity92 , the acting @entity3 commissioner ; and the @entity73 inspector - general investigating the complaints , @entity96
@entity98 rep. @entity97 , the committee 's @entity89 chairman , said the disclosure by the @entity3 " is both astounding and appalling
" " @entity103 will get to the bottom of this practice and ensure it never takes place again , " @entity97 said in a statement announcing the hearings
rep. @entity107 , the panel 's ranking @entity108 , added that " a thorough and bipartisan investigation and effective remedial action " was essential
and in the @entity114 , @entity113 chairman @entity112 called for a full investigation as well
" we need to know who knew what , and exactly what mistakes were made , " said @entity112 , @entity116
" the @entity35 people have questions for the @entity3 and i intend to get answers
" @entity3 officials knew of agents ' tea party targeting in 2011 in 2010 , @entity112 called on the @entity3 to look into whether some groups were abusing their tax - exempt status by making politics their primary activity
sen. @entity131 , the committee 's top @entity89 , wrote a letter to @entity112 calling for an immediate hearing
" bipartisanship on this issue is critical since both @entity137 and @entity89 have expressed considerable interest in these matters over the past couple of years , " @entity131 wrote
" as the sole committee of jurisdiction over the @entity3 , it is critical that @entity113 play a leadership role in examining this issue
" flood of tax - exempt claims followed court ruling the applications in question were processed by an office in @entity156 that handles most applications for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status and had seen the number of applications rise sharply beginning in 2010 , the year of the @entity148 's @entity150 ruling , which blessed unlimited campaign spending by corporations
tax - exempt groups became a popular channel for the new wave of political spending
@entity166 , the former director of the @entity3 division under fire , said the @entity3 receives about 60,000 applications for tax - exempt status every year
most of them are from civic groups like parent - teacher associations , scout troops or sports leagues , and they 're quickly approved
but @entity176 said organizations seeking tax exemptions that appear to be involved in politics should get a closer look from the @entity3 based on their actions -- " but not by name , like they were here , which was a mistake
" the inspector - general 's report indicated the agency 's practice of singling out conservative groups began as early as march 2010 , and in july of that year , unidentified managers within the agency " requested its specialists to be on the lookout for tea party applications
" in august , specialists were warned to be on the lookout for " various local organizations in the tea party movement " applying for tax - exempt status
timeline : @entity3 wrestled with which groups to scrutinize in june 2011 , a briefing paper noted that groups focused on government spending and debt , as well as organizations criticizing how the government was being run , were also singled out for extra inspection
officials at the @entity3 knew in june 2011 that their agents were targeting conservative groups for additional scrutiny on tax documents , the report indicates
@entity176 said the @entity3 used to have a set of " tripwire " actions that drew the agency 's attention , but he said those standards were largely abandoned during a reorganization in the early 2000s
the reorganization was aimed at finding more money , and tax - exempt groups " do n't produce any tax revenue for the government regardless
" " what was wrong was using criteria that look like they were focused only on one end of the political spectrum , " @entity176 said
@entity232 , who monitors campaign spending for the liberal watchdog group @entity234 , said the " vast majority " of 501 ( c ) 4 ) groups are legitimate
but the others are " primarily involved in elections " and helped funnel more than $ 1.2 billion in secretive campaign money into the 2012 elections , and the @entity3 needs to crack down on them , he said
" they should not be partisan , or single out the tea party , " @entity232 said
" but they should look for political groups , and they 're not
they never prevented any of them from registering as nonprofit social welfare organizations
" and now that the issue has become a political hot potato , they 're not likely to , he said
" this controversy means they will never enforce the tax code , " he said
" we are going to see the @entity3 hide
" who knew what , and when ? @entity251 , the head of the @entity156 - based @entity3 office that oversees tax - exempt groups , did not respond to requests for comment from @entity44 on monday
@entity251 is the @entity3 official who publicly admitted friday that agents used the keywords " tea party " and " patriot " to flag applications for further review -- but she stressed that was done as a " shortcut " for picking the applications to review , not out of " political bias
" @entity251 said in a friday conference call that she " did not feel comfortable answering " as to when senior @entity3 officials became aware of the situation
she said the @entity3 has implemented changes to prevent similar mistakes in the future but could not say that any @entity3 employees had been disciplined
but a congressional source familiar with the inquiry understood that @entity251 knew of the targeting in 2011 and sent letters to @entity87 this year without disclosing the extent of her knowledge
and @entity89 are questioning why @entity92 -- who the @entity3 said was informed of the problem in may 2012 -- did n't raise it when lawmakers asked questions about the issue the following june and july
" an apology is not sufficient , " @entity97 said
" there have been enough excuses and delays , and now it is time for the @entity3 to answer to the @entity35 people
" opinion : @entity3 abuses power in targeting tea party the @entity3 did not respond to questions about why @entity92 did n't inform @entity87 nor to questions about when its previous commissioner , @entity296 , found out
@entity296 told a march 2012 @entity88 hearing that his agency did not target conservative groups for political reasons
" i can give you assurances
we pride ourselves in being a nonpolitical , nonpartisan organization , " said @entity296 , who was appointed by president @entity304
" there is absolutely no targeting
this is the kind of back and forth that happens when people apply for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status
" the @entity3 has told @entity87 that @entity296 did not know about the targeting of conservative groups when he made that appearance , said @entity318 , a spokeswoman for @entity131 .
