editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity4 contributor on national security issues , served as president @entity7 's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser
@entity2 has spent more than two decades in the fields of intelligence and criminal justice and has served during the past three administrations
@entity2 is currently a consultant to the @entity14 @entity13 and a member of the @entity16 and the @entity17
@entity2 says the priority for the @entity19 must be protecting the @entity14 people
@entity21 ( @entity4 ) -- the @entity22 recently reported that gen. @entity23 , president @entity24 's national security adviser , is reviewing plans to reorganize the @entity27 and @entity28 councils
some , if not all , of the functions of the @entity31 may be folded into an expanded @entity32
there is no more solemn responsibility that the president bears than to protect @entity14 lives
during my 4Â½ years at the @entity19 , i came to believe that , for this reason , organization must be dictated by effectiveness
how best to maximize effectiveness will inevitably change over time as we as a country continue to weaken @entity44 and other enemies , as the @entity46 gains strength , and as our government better integrates the capabilities that have been built since the tragedy of september 11
as the @entity24 administration considers the most effective means of organizing the @entity19 structure , i respectfully submit that any structure should be judged against three fundamental criteria
first , there must be a single person both responsible and accountable to the president who monitors threat information and who has the authority to marshal all instruments of national power ( military , intelligence , law enforcement , economic , diplomatic and public diplomacy ) to defeat the threat
this individual can not wait until threats arrive on our shores , but must have the responsibility and the means to identify those threats where they originate and to ensure a coordinated response to them
the president 's homeland security adviser must not be constrained by geographic boundaries that our enemies do not respect
second , the homeland security adviser must have direct and immediate access to the president
ultimately , if terrorists successfully strike the @entity14 , it is the president , and not his staff , who will be accountable to the @entity14 people for the failure
the homeland security adviser must be able to get to the president quickly without clearance from his or her colleagues on the @entity19 staff
unfortunately , there will be times when @entity14 lives are at stake and the president will need to be advised and operational decisions taken and communicated to the relevant cabinet secretary in real time
these sorts of crises do not lend themselves to the normal bureaucratic process
third , the homeland security issues faced by our government are diverse and many
they range from preparedness and response to natural disasters ( ice , flooding , fires and wind ) to pandemic planning and biological and nuclear threats
these issues are often distinct from the more traditional foreign policy issues faced by the @entity32 and require experienced staff with significant expertise
the staff must understand state and local emergency management policy issues and concerns
they must be organized , not simply to facilitate the homeland security policy process , but also to anticipate and respond to state and local political leaders in a time of crisis
the homeland security adviser requires adequate staffing to deal with the counterterrorism and homeland security issues
we remain a nation at war with a very determined enemy
we have troops deployed in @entity139 and @entity140 , but the national security adviser has many important responsibilities in addition to those two theaters
for example , he must contend with the @entity147 peace process and counter proliferation around the world , but most especially in @entity150 and @entity151
i worry that increasing the span of control of the national security adviser could dilute the homeland security mission and make it just one more item on a list already overburdened
that said , i wish to be clear
we should judge any reorganization by the substance and criteria that i have suggested above
we must be careful not to assume that a merger means the president cares less about homeland security
we must resist this easy organizational chart test and look to the substance of how responsibilities are allocated and how we are being protected
let me suggest three questions the administration should ask before deciding on a new @entity19 structure : ( 1 ) is there one person responsible and accountable to the president who looks around the world at threats and advises the president ? ( 2 ) does this one person have direct and immediate access to the president ? and ( 3 ) does this person have adequate staff to fulfill his or her responsibilities ? these are the questions that we should be asking and the criteria against which we should judge the effort
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
