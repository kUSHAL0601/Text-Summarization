@entity0 -- as president @entity2 considers military action in response to @entity6 's alleged use of chemical weapons in @entity8 , a debate over whether he must seek @entity11 ' consent has surfaced
it 's a debate with which the president is extremely familiar
as a senator , @entity2 was a staunch critic of president @entity15 for not obtaining renewed authorization for the war in @entity18
he blasted his predecessor in 2007 , saying , " the president does not have power under the @entity22 to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation
" additionally , as a candidate for president , @entity2 reaffirmed that sentiment
he told the @entity30 in a questionnaire , " the president does not have power under the @entity22 to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation
" " it is always preferable to have the informed consent of @entity11 prior to any military action , " @entity2 added at the time
@entity8 : western intervention looms after reported chemical attack as a senator , vice president @entity43 had a similar take
during a campaign speech in @entity47 in 2007 , he said " the consequences of war -- intended or otherwise -- can be so profound and complicated that our founding fathers vested in @entity11 , not the president , the power to initiate war , except to repel an imminent attack on the @entity56 or its citizens
" although they have held such strong views in the past , their positions have dramatically changed
they did not seek @entity11 consent when the @entity56 engaged its military in @entity64 , nor when @entity2 expanded the war in @entity66
in both instances , members of @entity11 complained loudly , but the president defended his decision
@entity71 : @entity56 military action in @entity8 would spark ' disaster ' in the case of @entity64 , the president said at the time that @entity56 troops would not be on the ground and so the law did n't apply
why the change of heart ? " where you stand on this issue depends on where you sit , and right now ( @entity2 ) is sitting in the @entity85 , " said @entity80 , professor of law at @entity81
it 's a long - running battle of checks and balances
and it 's one that the president usually wins
opinion : on @entity8 , learn from @entity56 mistakes in @entity18 the debate revolves around the @entity95
@entity11 passed the measure in 1973 , overriding a veto by president @entity98
it was meant to rein in the president 's ability to involve the @entity56 in overseas conflict
the law requires that the president seek consent from @entity11 before force is used or within 60 days of the start of hostilities and that the president provides @entity11 with reports throughout the conflict
it has n't really worked that way
many in @entity11 want consultation before action in @entity8 it 's a debate that has played out time and time again in @entity56 history : a president is considering intervening in an international conflict , @entity11 wants a say
specifically , congressional opponents want the ability to block the intended military action
since 1973 , the @entity56 has used military force in @entity126 in 1983 , @entity127 in 1989 , @entity18 in 1991 , @entity128 in 1994 and @entity129 in 1999
in all those instances , presidents -- both democrats and @entity132 -- sidestepped @entity11 and committed @entity56 military forces without obtaining @entity11 approval
@entity11 did , however , provide @entity15 with its approval for the war in @entity18 in 2002 and the war in @entity66 after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks
like a replay of the past , some members of @entity11 are demanding the president seek the legislative branch 's approval before any action is taken in @entity8
but it 's highly unlikely the president will take that formal step
warnings of quagmire in @entity8 as @entity56 contemplates military action @entity11 complains , sometimes loudly , but has rarely done anything about it
it could pass laws further restricting the president 's authority , but has n't done so
the legislative branch could also withhold funding of any military conflict , but that 's another avenue it has failed to take
additionally , the judiciary has been reluctant to settle the dispute
in the @entity163 's daily briefing , press secretary @entity161 said the administration is consulting with @entity11
@entity2 " had discussions with relevant members of @entity11 , and leaders of committees and leaders of the @entity11 at large , " he said
who wants what after chemical weapons horror in response to @entity161 's statement , rep. @entity175 , @entity176 , who called military action without congressional approval " unconstitutional " and is among a group of lawmakers who are demanding the president seek their approval , tweeted , " yeah right
" but while members are likely to write letters , pontificate and even challenge the president to seek consent , the president is likely to continue to sit on the winning side of the issue
@entity191 : what @entity2 can and ca n't do
