-- @entity2 striker @entity1 has left @entity4 club @entity3 to join @entity6 champions @entity5 , both teams confirmed on wednesday
the 27 - year - old scored 20 goals in 67 appearances for the @entity12 outfit , but his impact was hampered after suffering a serious leg break in february 2008
@entity1 signed a new long - term contract in november , but the @entity17 - born player was allowed to leave for an undisclosed fee as he joined 2009 @entity19 winners @entity5 on a four - year deal
the signing of @entity22 from @entity24 club @entity23 in may left @entity1 down the pecking order at @entity3 , who also have @entity29 stars @entity27 and @entity30 to call upon up front
" @entity1 's recovery from his injury sustained at @entity37 in february 2008 is a testament to his strength as a human being , and this character and determination will be missed by everyone associated at @entity3 , " the club said in a statement on its website
" everyone at @entity3 would like to thank @entity1 for his contribution towards the club and wishes him the best of luck for the future
" meanwhile , @entity3 's @entity49 rivals @entity50 continued rebuilding under new manager @entity52 with the signing of defender @entity54 from @entity56 champions @entity55
the center - back , 18 , agreed a three - year contract in a deal which could be worth up to $ 7.5 million to the cash - strapped @entity61 side , who have now lost seven players ahead of the new season
@entity50 also unveiled @entity67 midfielder @entity66 , who joined on a free transfer earlier this week after his contract at double winners @entity71 expired
@entity73 champions @entity72 signed @entity74 from @entity75 for an undisclosed fee on a five - year contract , but the 22 - year - old central defender will be loaned back to the @entity80 club for the new season
the @entity82 league winners also sent young striker @entity83 on loan to @entity75 as part of the deal
it was a busy day for @entity75 , who sold @entity90 's @entity29 defender @entity89 to @entity91 for a reported $ 5.7 million on a five - year contract
the 22 - year - old was new @entity91 coach @entity95 's first signing since replacing @entity96
@entity95 also tied up veteran former @entity98 fullback @entity97 , 34 , to a new one - year contract , while @entity91 owner @entity100 told reporters that former @entity17 star @entity102 was not for sale .
