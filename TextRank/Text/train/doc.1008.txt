-- she could , maybe , be the first beauty pageant contestant to sport a tattoo , but determining that would necessitate reportage on the obscured derrieres and other regions of hundreds of past contestants
so we 'll just say miss @entity9 , @entity11 , is the first beauty queen to prominently sport a large tattoo during a pageant
but that 's not the only thing that sets her apart from most bombshells
the @entity20 contestant also hunts deer with a bow and is an @entity23 ( markswoman ? ) serving in the @entity25 while double - majoring in @entity27 and chemistry at @entity29
oh , and she 's working on her private pilot 's license
" i 'm all about breaking stereotypes , " she said
" everybody thinks of @entity20 as this girl on a pedestal
i want her to come down from that
she is just a normal girl
" @entity36 elaborated on her tattoo in a blog post last month
" i am writing this ( blog ) post just weeks away from competing for @entity20 because i do not want to shock the nation when i 'm seen in a swimsuit , bearing my marks
i want to explain the meanings and reasons behind them , and why i am opting to show them proudly , " she wrote in august
both tattoos are on her right ribcage
one is of the @entity49 , running from her armpit to her hip
it was partially obscured by her bikini strap during the swimsuit segment of the pageant
the other is a military medical insignia
her plans include a career in dentistry
tattoos and piercings : how young is too young ? @entity11 wrote that she chose to get the prayer tattoo because she was bullied as a youngster and the prayer gave her the strength to get through high school and boot camp
she wrote that the insignia was inspired by her father , who was influential in her decision to pursue a dental profession in the military
" if i were crowned @entity20 , bearing my tattoos , do you realize the stereotypes and stigmas it would break ? " she wrote
" do you realize it would pave a path for a whole new audience to compete in the @entity20 ? " tattoos among the millennial generation are on the rise , according to a 2010 @entity86 : nearly 40 % are inked
" if i do n't win the title of @entity20 , i can only hope i have changed people 's perceptions of the type of women that choose to compete for it
@entity95 , @entity94 me the courage to change the @entity97 ... , " she wrote
the @entity20 will crown its pageant winner sunday
