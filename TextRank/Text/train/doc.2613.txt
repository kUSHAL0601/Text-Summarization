-- an election - year democratic measure designed to ensure that women do n't face pay discrimination was blocked tuesday by @entity4 who complained that the bill was politically inspired and would reward trial lawyers at the expense of employers
the motion , which needed 60 votes to succeed , got only 52 , not one from a @entity4
president @entity11 issued a statement criticizing republicans for putting " partisan politics ahead of @entity16 women and families
" senate majority leader @entity18 , @entity19 , standing at a news conference with pay equity advocate @entity21 , accused @entity4 of " wanting to stick their heads in the sand " about the longstanding issue of women being paid less than men
" but it 's clear where @entity29 stand , " @entity18 said
the bill , which @entity29 said would close loopholes in the 1963 @entity32 , would require employers to prove that differences in pay were related to job performance , not gender ; would prevent employers from forbidding employees from sharing salary information with each other ; and would allow women who believe they were discriminated against to sue for damages
democrats acknowledged privately that they expected to make political gains with women by pressing to close the pay gap , which they said has women earning just 77 cents on the dollar compared with men
republicans , fearful that @entity29 were trying to portray them as insensitive to women , argued that they oppose pay discrimination but disagree with the @entity29 ' bill , which was written without their input
republicans remained largely silent about the issue in the days leading up to the vote , even as @entity29 , led by the president , made an all - out push for the legislation
only one @entity4 senator , @entity58 of @entity59 , who is in a tight re-election race against @entity29 rep. @entity61 , spoke on the floor against the bill
in his brief speech , @entity58 proposed an alternative bill to combat the problem , but @entity29 criticized it as insufficient
off the floor , a few @entity4 spoke about the bill , but only when asked by reporters
" we think it is the wrong way of going about dealing with this issue , " said sen. @entity70 of @entity71 , the minority leader , who described the measure as a reward for @entity75 trial lawyers
" this is just politics
this should be called the trial lawyers bonanza bill , " complained sen. @entity80 of @entity81 , the top @entity4 on the @entity83 labor committee
" it has nothing to do with the women
they will get very little out of it
what it allows is huge class - action suits with very little defense by any employer
" even the retiring moderate @entity4 senator from @entity97 , @entity98 , whose support @entity29 hoped to win , called the @entity29 ' bill " regrettable " and an " overreach
" " i think there are other ways ( of ) addressing these issues , and this legislation goes too far , " @entity101 said
the bill " would put a tremendous burden on employers through lawsuits , class - action lawsuits
" sen. @entity111 , @entity112 , the chief sponsor of the pay equity bill , vowed to return to the bill until it passes
" we will be back , " she said
" though we lost the vote today , we are not giving up for equal pay , for equal rights
