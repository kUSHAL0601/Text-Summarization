-- season four of " @entity2 , " featuring @entity3 and @entity4 filling in for @entity5 and @entity6 , taped blind auditions recently , and @entity0 had a chance to watch the new judges in action
what we saw in our brief glimpse into the new season was that there will be no messing around
all four judges , including returnees @entity17 and @entity19 , mean business
when we spoke to @entity3 at @entity21 in @entity22 in september he promised to promote a competitive edge , but he is n't the only one bringing that attitude
at the audition we saw some friendly competition between @entity3 and @entity4 over one contestant , and when @entity3 bested @entity17 for another vocalist at the audition , he playfully taunted his fellow judge
' @entity31 during a junket featuring all four judges and show creator @entity34 , @entity19 confirmed this season will give new meaning to the term " battle rounds
" " i would say the competitiveness is up , " he said
" we 've replaced @entity5 with somebody that 's just that much more aggressive
and @entity6 was always competitive , [ but ] now you 've got four that are just killers up here
" @entity17 agreed that @entity4 might be the one they have to watch out for
" you have a pregnant , hormonal @entity45 , " he says
" she 's ready to bust some heads
she ai n't messing around
" @entity4 said she is happy to be welcomed with humor , as it shows her she is part of the family
" spending some time with these guys , i can only tell you that it is the best -- they joke all the time and make me laugh onstage , offstage , " she said
" they have been such great hosts making us , @entity3 and me , feel at home at all times
" cover story excerpt : ' @entity2 ' but the battle we witnessed over contestants was real , she insisted : " there 's a lot of competitiveness , of course
once we are in the process of trying to get a contestant recruited for our team , there 's a lot of adrenalin , and there 's a lot of tension , but the healthy kind
" both of the new coaches believe they bring more than just a new intensity
" you ca n't really compare my style to anybody , " @entity3 said
" my style is more military than anything , because i 'm all about the preparation and have always been
i rehearse a million times to be prepared
my style is to make them understand the seriousness of the craft and that they have the very best opportunity to be the greatest or the worst , depending on how you take it
" as for @entity4 's approach , she views it as very involved
" besides being a singer , i 'm also a producer and writer
once i 'm in the recording studio , i am so hands - on , " she said
" while i 'm coaching my team i tend to focus on the detail
i do n't know if it 's maybe because of the female condition , but men are more focused on the general aspects , and women tend to sort of focus on details a lot
and so when i 'm giving directions to my contestants i 'm particularly focused on details
" " she plays the female card quite a bit , " @entity17 said
" that 's one thing we ca n't compete with , really
" ' @entity2 ' renewed for two more seasons as the proven commodities , @entity17 and @entity19 , who between them coached the winning contestants in all three previous seasons , feel they still have an edge
" there are many advantages to being the seasoned veteran , starting with we 've seen about 4,000 more auditions , " @entity17 says
" we fell into the traps that the newbloods will fall into and dig themselves out of because they are strong , and they will survive , but we know from experience where we 've been , where we 're going , how to get through this
but these guys are smart and quick studies , so they are probably going to get better quickly , and it 's going to suck for us because then they will probably win this damn thing
" @entity3 brings in his own experience , having mentored @entity141 to the top of the charts , and @entity17 says that does count for a lot
" as much as i hate to say this about another coach in the beginning , @entity3 has done what this show has yet to do , " he says
" you have launched a superstar , and that 's our goal
that 's the show 's goal
that 's something we want to do as an institution
" the one thing that i hope is to come into this show and be able to score an incredible entertainer that people will talk about for years and years and track it back , " he says
" i am kind of a living example of that
i started on @entity166 , and my career kind of launched from there
" how long he and @entity4 will remain on the show is up in the air
" everybody ca n't coach for life , " said @entity34 , " because when you have people with current recording in the game , this is not their job
their job is their fans and making music and being live , and so we knew from the beginning that this would happen
they all have another life and their schedules
" @entity4 concurred that while this is where she is now , her music comes first
" we are not judges
it 's not what we do for a living , " she said
" we have musical careers that we have to attend to , but we are embarking on this great adventure and enjoying it until we feel that we have to get back to our first and most important duties with music
