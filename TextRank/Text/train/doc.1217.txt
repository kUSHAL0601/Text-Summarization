-- he is the new leader of the most populous @entity3 nation
but @entity5 's interim president @entity4 is , in many respects , a mystery man
profiles of him in local and international media have stuck to the basics -- where he was born , where he went to school , how he fared in his last job
facts that hardly offer an insight into how @entity4 will run the country until new elections are called -- whenever that may be
but his low - key demeanor might be the very reason the military picked him , analysts say
" he represents what the military needs , a fairly low - profile but respected technorat , " said @entity24 , a @entity25 and @entity26 analyst at @entity27
one of his main roles will be to help draft a constitution , a job he is well - versed in as the head of the nation 's @entity36
the @entity5 people have given me the authority " to amend and correct the revolution of the 25th of january 2011 , " @entity4 said
@entity5 's revolution , which led to the toppling of @entity44 after three decades in power , started that day
more than two weeks later , @entity44 was ousted
work spans two regimes @entity4 was born in @entity48 , and attended law school at a local university before heading to @entity51 for studies
appointed vice president of the court in 1992 by @entity44 , he is also one of its longest serving judges
deposed president @entity57 appointed him to the judicial role last month after the former chief '' s term expired
he assumed the top judiciary post as a result of a law that mandates that the chief should be hired from within the system
his work spans two regimes -- @entity44 's and @entity57 's
the latter was deposed wednesday after a year in power
@entity4 also helped draft the elections laws that set the time frame for campaigning in the 2012 vote that brought @entity57 to power , the state - run @entity70 newspaper reported
" the @entity76 will try to say he is part of the judicial conspiracy against them , " @entity24 said
" however that 's unlikely to carry weight
he is fairly balanced and has made legally sound decisions in the judiciary
" viewed as an independent the 67 - year - old is married and a father of three
though virtually unknown -- no one was chanting his name on the streets as a potential replacement -- he is viewed as an independent
" in a sense , you could argue that 's what the military wanted , " @entity24 said
the army seized power after @entity44 was toppled , but lost popularity after cracking down on continuing protests
@entity57 's election win last year was welcomed as win over military rule
" this time , they ( military ) are looking to perform an indirect role , " @entity24 said
" they do n't have any desire for some kind of public body
" during the @entity113 protests that led to his ouster , some opposition groups had called for the head of the constitutional court to take over the running of the country
@entity4 's appointment is likely to appease them
he will " establish a government that is strong and diverse , " said @entity123 - @entity122 , the nation 's top military officer
until parliamentary elections are held , the interim president will have the power to issue constitutional declarations
@entity0 's @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 contributed to this report .
