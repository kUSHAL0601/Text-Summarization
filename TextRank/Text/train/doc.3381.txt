today , the @entity0 is conducting offensive cyberwar actions around the world
more than passively eavesdropping , we 're penetrating and damaging foreign networks for both espionage and to ready them for attack
we 're creating custom - designed @entity10 weapons , pre-targeted and ready to be " fired " against some piece of another country 's electronic infrastructure on a moment 's notice
this is much worse than what we 're accusing @entity18 of doing to us
we 're pursuing policies that are both expensive and destabilizing and are n't making the @entity10 any safer
we 're reacting from fear , and causing other countries to counter-react from fear
we 're ignoring resilience in favor of offense
welcome to the cyberwar arms race , an arms race that will define the internet in the 21st century
@entity28 20 , issued last october and released by @entity29 , outlines @entity0 cyberwar policy
most of it is n't very interesting , but there are two paragraphs about " @entity35 , " or @entity35 , that are intriguing : " @entity36 can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance @entity0 national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging
the development and sustainment of @entity35 capabilities , however , may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist
" the @entity52 shall identify potential targets of national importance where @entity35 can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power , establish and maintain @entity35 capabilities integrated as appropriate with other @entity0 offensive capabilities , and execute those capabilities in a manner consistent with the provisions of this directive
" opinion : cyber arms control ? forget about it these two paragraphs , and another paragraph about @entity35 , are the only parts of the document classified " top secret
" and that 's because what they 're saying is very dangerous
cyberattacks have the potential to be both immediate and devastating
they can disrupt communications systems , disable national infrastructure , or , as in the case of @entity83 , destroy nuclear reactors ; but only if they 've been created and targeted beforehand
before launching cyberattacks against another country , we have to go through several steps
we have to study the details of the computer systems they 're running and determine the vulnerabilities of those systems
if we ca n't find exploitable vulnerabilities , we need to create them : leaving " back doors " in hacker speak
then we have to build new cyberweapons designed specifically to attack those systems
sometimes we have to embed the hostile code in those networks , these are called " logic bombs , " to be unleashed in the future
and we have to keep penetrating those foreign networks , because computer systems always change and we need to ensure that the cyberweapons are still effective
like our nuclear arsenal during the @entity110 , our cyberweapons arsenal must be pretargeted and ready to launch
that 's what @entity112 directed the @entity114 to do
we can see glimpses in how effective we are in @entity29 's allegations that the @entity117 is currently penetrating foreign networks around the world : " we hack network backbones -- like huge internet routers , basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one
" the @entity117 and the @entity114 are basically the same thing
they 're both at @entity127 in @entity128 , and they 're both led by gen. @entity129
the same people who hack network backbones are also building weapons to destroy those backbones
at a march @entity135 briefing , @entity129 boasted of creating more than a dozen offensive cyber units
longtime @entity117 watcher @entity137 reached the same conclusion in his recent profile of @entity129 and the @entity114 ( written before the @entity29 revelations )
he discussed some of the many cyberweapons the @entity0 purchases : " according to @entity146 ' @entity145 and @entity147 , @entity144 also offers its intelligence clients -- agencies like @entity114 , the @entity117 , the @entity150 , and @entity152 intelligence -- a unique map showing them exactly where their targets are located
dubbed @entity155 , the map displays the geolocation and digital address of basically every device connected to the internet around the world , providing what 's called network situational awareness
the client locates a region on the password - protected web - based map , then picks a country and city -- say , @entity168 , @entity18
next the client types in the name of the target organization , such as the @entity173 's no. 3 @entity172 , which is responsible for computer security -- or simply enters its address , 6 @entity177
the map will then display what software is running on the computers inside the facility , what types of malware some may contain , and a menu of custom - designed exploits that can be used to secretly gain entry
it can also pinpoint those devices infected with malware , such as the @entity191 worm , as well as networks turned into botnets and zombies -- the equivalent of a back door left open ... " the buying and using of such a subscription by nation - states could be seen as an act of war
' if you are engaged in reconnaissance on an adversary 's systems , you are laying the electronic battlefield and preparing to use it ' wrote @entity208 , a former @entity117 director for information assurance , in a @entity211 report on cyberwarfare
' in my opinion , these activities constitute acts of war , or at least a prelude to future acts of war
' the question is , who else is on the secretive company 's client list ? because there is as of yet no oversight or regulation of the cyberweapons trade , companies in the cyber-industrial complex are free to sell to whomever they wish
" it should be illegal , ' said the former senior intelligence official involved in cyberwarfare
' i knew about @entity234 when i was in intelligence
the intelligence community did n't like it , but they 're the largest consumer of that business
' " that 's the key question : how much of what the @entity0 is currently doing is an act of war by international definitions ? already we 're accusing @entity18 of penetrating our systems in order to map " military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis
" what @entity250 and @entity29 describe is much worse , and certainly @entity18 , and other countries , are doing the same
all of this mapping of vulnerabilities and keeping them secret for offensive use makes the @entity10 less secure , and these pre-targeted , ready - to - unleash cyberweapons are destabalizing forces on international relationships
rooting around other countries ' networks , analyzing vulnerabilities , creating back doors , and leaving logic bombs could easily be construed as an act of war
and all it takes is one over-achieving national leader for this all to tumble into actual war
it 's time to stop the madness
yes , our military needs to invest in cyberwar capabilities , but we also need international rules of cyberwar , more transparency from our own government on what we are and are not doing , international cooperation between governments and viable cyberweapons treaties
yes , these are difficult
yes , it 's a long slow process
yes , there wo n't be international consensus , certainly not in the beginning
but even with all of those problems , it 's a better path to go down than the one we 're on now
we can start by taking most of the money we 're investing in offensive cyberwar capabilities and spend them on national cyberspace resilience
@entity297 , mutually assured destruction , made sense because there were two superpowers opposing each other
on the @entity10 there are all sorts of different powers , from nation - states to much less organized groups
an arsenal of cyberweapons begs to be used , and , as we learned from @entity83 , there 's always collateral damage to innocents when they are
we 're much safer with a strong defense than with a counterbalancing offense .
