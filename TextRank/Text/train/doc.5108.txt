house speaker @entity0 said rep. @entity1 was justified in ending an acrimonious hearing on @entity4 targeting of conservative groups -- a meeting concluded when @entity1 cut the hearing room microphones with his harshest critic on the panel , rep. @entity10 , in mid sentence
" from what i understand , i think mr. @entity1 was in his rights to adjourn the hearing , " @entity0 told reporters on thursday
the @entity16 wants @entity1 removed as @entity18 chairman following wednesday 's uproar , which it sees as the latest in a series of disrespectful responses to pushback from @entity23 during hearings on the @entity4 matter
the group offered a resolution on thursday
" chairman @entity1 's abusive behavior on march 5th is part of a continuing pattern in which he has routinely excluded members of the committee from investigative meetings and has routinely provided information to the press before sharing it with committee members , " @entity16 chairman rep. @entity28 said
the organization also sent @entity0 a letter
" the abuse of authority and misuse of the congressional privileges afforded them are an affront to the expectations of the @entity49 public
congressman @entity1 of @entity53 abused his authority and therefore must be reprimanded to ensure the dignity of the @entity56 is preserved , " @entity50 , an @entity52 @entity51 , wrote
" we urge you to take prompt action to maintain the integrity of this body and remove mr. @entity1 as chair of the @entity64 immediately , " the letter continued
tensions are strained between @entity23 and @entity66 as the two sides continue to probe whether the @entity4 intentionally targeted conservative groups seeking tax exempt status
the issue flared anew this week following a series of hearings last year around the oversight panel 's investigation
@entity1 : @entity66 - led @entity4 targeting probe may be at ' dead end ' @entity66 see former @entity4 official @entity78 's decision to invoke her constitutional rights not to testify at hearings as obstructionist
@entity23 believe their @entity66 colleagues are trying to squeeze any kind of political capital they can out of an embarrassing episode for the @entity86 administration in a midterm election year
those frustrations boiled over on wednesday when @entity1 refused to take @entity10 ' statement and muted his microphone when he protested an early end to the hearing during which @entity78 again refused to testify
@entity10 , a @entity93 @entity51 , says he knows a thing or two about respect
" let me tell you something
i 've been practicing law for 30 , 40 years
and , so you see these kind of things , " @entity10 said after the hearing wednesday
" but the thing that we are determined is not to be detracted , to get to the truth
and so i see it as a distraction
i do n't worry about disrespect , okay ? " on thursday , @entity10 elaborated on why he felt @entity1 's actions were troubling
" this is not the first time chairman @entity1 has shut mics down
you ca n't shut out the minority voice , " @entity10 said
" he shut me down because he did n't want to hear what i was saying or what he thought what i was saying
" @entity10 told @entity120 's " @entity119 " that he talked briefly with @entity1 on thursday and said he does n't " expect him to apologize
" other @entity23 lawmakers were similarly upset
" what happened was so outrageous , so demeaning , so unjudicial , so awful in every respect , that we just absolutely have actually reached the boiling point , " said rep. @entity123 or @entity124 and the top @entity51 on the @entity125
" he was talking into a mic in an adjourned meeting
the fact is mr. @entity10 came to make a point of his objections to the process we 'd been going through
he was , he was actually slandering me at the moment that the mics did go off by claiming that this had not been a real investigation , " @entity1 said wednesday
" this had been a bipartisan investigation by multiple committees in which we had testimony in multiple hearings ... in which it was very clear there was targeting of conservative groups in which there were people who were acting outside the norm
we 're going to continue our investigation
but just because mr. @entity10 would like to have a more convenient truth does n't give him the right to make a speech
" @entity1 has also indicated that the probe may be approaching a " dead end " after nearly a year
" it may well be that we have gotten to the bottom of it , " @entity1 said
such uncertainty raises questions about whether @entity66 who have alleged the targeting order came from political higher - ups , even the @entity167 , can win a legal battle to compel @entity78 to provide testimony .
