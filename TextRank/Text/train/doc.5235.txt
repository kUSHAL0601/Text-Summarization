-- just when you thought this divorce could n't get any messier
weeks after @entity4 annexed @entity7 's @entity6 region , it plans to take custody of dolphins in the nation as well
these highly trained military mammals detect risks such as sea mines or enemy scuba divers trying to slip through
sea mines are sophisticated weapons that can sink ships and other watercraft
" the combat dolphin program in the @entity6 city of @entity21 will be preserved and redirected toward the interests of the @entity4 navy , " state - run @entity4 news agency @entity18 reported thursday
dolphins are a crucial part of open - water security
they detect sounds and objects in murky waters that human beings ca n't , making them uniquely effective at highlighting dangers on the sea floor
harnessing the military power of animal intelligence @entity7 was using outdated military equipment for the dolphin program and planned to disband it next month , @entity18 said
the @entity39 told @entity0 that the nation has an ocean dolphin facility , but declined to provide details , saying they 're classified
the dolphin program dates to the 1960s , when @entity4 and @entity7 were part of the @entity45 , but was handed over to @entity46 after independence
the @entity48 in @entity49 also trains dolphins and sea lions to help protect its assets and find dangerous objects underwater
tensions between @entity55 and @entity46 have escalated since @entity4 reclaimed the @entity6 after a referendum this month that overwhelmingly supported the annexation
the @entity58 and its allies have pledged to isolate @entity4 for its actions
@entity7 also has combat sea lions that operate under the same base
it 's unclear whether they 'll be barking allegiances to @entity55 or @entity46
@entity0 's @entity66 and @entity67 contributed to this report .
