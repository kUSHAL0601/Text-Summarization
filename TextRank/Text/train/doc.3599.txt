-- i know you are really , really upset -- but can you stop crying for a second so we can talk about the fact that @entity6 is finally leaving " @entity7 ? " long overdue , as far as i 'm concerned
she has been annoying me since day one
how bad can the job really be ? hmmm , let 's see
you get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to show up on set for 12 episodes -- then you get half the year off
yeah , i think i 'd quit too
her publicist claims she 's out of there because she wants to spend more time with her newly adopted daughter , and that becoming a mother has " changed [ her ] desire to work full - time
" that 's sounds like sunshine and moonbeams and all , but the truth is that she 's been petitioning to get dr. @entity27 written off for the last three years
since her @entity28 left , i suspect
at least we can have some fun imagining how they might get rid of her
drug overdose ? amnesia ? @entity36 ? sex tape ? fun ! anyway , considering her last few movies were ludicrous rom - coms and she has a rep for biting the hand that feeds her , i 'm thinking she may not be too popular in @entity45 after this
plenty of other celebs have left cushy tv jobs for bigger and better things
let 's see how nine of them fared
the @entity0 - @entity54 and other celebs who ditched the dead weight 1
@entity57 thinks she 's too big for the filming schedule of " @entity59
" that 's why she 's leaving the show -- to move back to @entity62 , pursue her film career , and live life to the fullest by eating spinach and seeds and popping pills
@entity68 , @entity57 ! but we 're not sure how this is going to go for you
fans went crazy when @entity73 announced that it was canceling " @entity75 " after just one season
but then it came out that @entity77 was the one who wanted the show to end -- she was ready to move on to a film career
she 's had some hits , " @entity83 " and " @entity82 , " but she will always and forever be @entity81
she 's never confirmed it , but when " @entity88 " killed off @entity86 in the season finale of season three , most people assumed it was because @entity89 wanted to move on
the show trucked on without her -- for a season
@entity89 's career , on the other hand : as dead as @entity86 after the car wreck
@entity96 - 8 female stars who dated their managers 4
@entity98 replaced @entity99 when good witch @entity100 was " killed off " of " @entity102
" now she 's working her magic on the judges of " @entity105
" abracadabra ! save my career ! 5
never thought i 'd say this , but i 'm actually glad that @entity110 left " snl " to go on to write , produce , and star in " @entity112
" yeah , she 's pretty much taking over the industry and making money with much more than her looks
the @entity0 -- @entity118 and @entity119 did it : how a " @entity121 " cameo can turn a career around 6
hunky @entity123 left " er " in its fifth season to become the a-list movie star in the front row at the @entity128
a winning move ? i 'd say yes
@entity132 was so desperate to be polished like the jewel that she believed she was that she left " @entity134
" she called the show " complacent , " but creator @entity136 said her time was up because she had already slept with everyone on the show
rumor has it that she has a new tv show coming out
let 's see if that jewel shines
the @entity0 - 10 stars whose relationships went sour after they found fame 8
viewers cried and stuff when @entity151 's character on " @entity152 " committed suicide only to stop crying when they found out he 'd accepted a position at the @entity152
because it 's nobler to actually help people than to play someone who does it on tv
while @entity151 joined the real @entity152 , @entity160 left the fictional one on " @entity161 " because he did n't think there was a place for his character , democrat @entity164 , anymore
and then he went on to play @entity166 politico @entity165 on " @entity167
" politics will eat you alive , man
