-- @entity2 warned friday it would launch a military strike against the @entity4 if @entity5 goes ahead with live - fire drills near @entity7 over the next five days , @entity2 's state - run @entity1 reported
@entity11 " should take a prompt measure to stop the planned provocative maritime shelling from @entity7 , " the report said
the @entity17 " will deal the second and third unpredictable self - defensive blow at them to protect the inviolable territorial waters of " @entity2 " as it had declared before the world
" the @entity18 also warned against the drills in a meeting friday among deputy foreign minister @entity21 , @entity23 ambassador @entity22 and @entity24 , the @entity11 ambassador to @entity25 , according to a statement posted to the ministry 's website
the @entity29 announced thursday that the exercises will take place in the seas southwest of @entity7 between december 18 and 21
the @entity4 previously announced military exercises for this week
tensions mounted between the @entity35 on november 23 , when @entity2 shelled the island , which lies in @entity11 territory
the attacked killed two marines and two civilians and injured 18 people
the @entity41 has accused the @entity4 of provoking the attack because shells from a @entity11 military drill landed in the @entity41 's waters
according to the @entity18 , @entity46 reminded the @entity23 and @entity11 ambassadors at friday 's meeting that the november drill resulted in casulties and that canceling the drills was critical to avoid further possible escalation of tensions
last month 's attack was the first direct artillery assault on @entity11 since 1953 , when an armistice ended fighting
the @entity23 military has said it is concerned that @entity11 's exercises could spark an uncontrollable clash with the @entity41 , but the @entity60 said the exercises are not meant to be threatening or provocative
" what we worry about , obviously , is if that is misunderstood or if it 's taken advantage of as an opportunity , " gen. @entity62 , vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said thursday at the @entity63
" if @entity2 were to react to that in a negative way and fire back at those firing positions on the islands , that would start potentially a chain reaction of firing and counter-firing
