-- on tuesday , voters across the country appeared to offer a rebuke to the administration of president @entity5 by voting into office many republicans , who now will control the @entity8 and the @entity9
such a take - down in the second year of the second term of any president is not uncommon
but this is the first @entity14 - @entity14 president , a man swept into office twice with huge support from blacks
does voters ' midterm reaction to @entity5 indicate some flagging in support for him among people of color ? could the @entity25 be making inroads with black voters ? well , first consider : last week @entity28 hosted " @entity29
" the show reprised a segment about blacks and president @entity5 called : how 's he doing ? the bit had an all - black panel , and after a few moments the discussion turned to the following question : what would it take for @entity5 to lose the black vote ? spoiler alert : there is no way for him to do that
it was just a comedy skit , but seems to be true in real life ; some may wonder why
after all , the unemployment rate for blacks remains high
in september the unemployment rate for whites was 4.9 % , while for blacks it was more than double that , at 10.8 %
the racial wealth gap also remains high
what is less well - known is that when you control for family income , black median wealth is less than one - third of white median wealth
put another way , at every income level , blacks only have a fraction of the wealth that similarly situated whites have
from a financial perspective , things are not good for many blacks when compared with their white peers -- in spite of there being a black president
nevertheless , there is widespread support of the president among blacks
so far , the @entity25 has given black voters little reason to shift its way , and @entity25 should not assume that black support will simply move to their side if they merely put forth a black candidate
a few of the reasons why : @entity25 - controlled state legislatures that enacted voter - @entity90 laws , coupled with @entity25 positions on affirmative action and immigration , are outside of the views held by most of the black community
but to be sure , black support for president @entity5 has eroded
@entity5 's favorability rating is down 9 percentage points from the beginning of the year and stands at 85 %
his favorability among whites has remained unchanged at 34 %
but black support is double that of whites
why ? is it because blacks always support blacks ? @entity107 justice @entity106 would say that ca n't be true , and tell that to the blacks who supported @entity111 in the 2008 primaries
no , i suspect it 's because we have empathy for the situation @entity5 finds himself in
he is n't even safe in his own home , for heaven 's sake
to quote @entity28 from the " @entity29 " segment : " run into @entity123 's lawn and see what happens
" what most blacks have in common with president @entity5 , is well -- we 're black
we 've all been disrespected at work ( remember " you lie ! " from rep. @entity130 )
we 've all been presumed incompetent : " why is the president 's response to @entity134 so weak ? " here 's why : because the @entity25 will not confirm his nominee for surgeon general
that is not president @entity5 's fault -- even though he receives the blame
last year , a @entity142 poll showed that when you polled the term " @entity145 " you received a different response than when you polled the term " @entity145 " : 46 % of the group asked about @entity145 opposed it , while 37 % asked about the @entity145 opposed it
it is not the president 's fault that when some voters hear his name associated with something they are more likely to reflexively oppose it
who does n't remember the " keep the government out of my @entity163 " signs when the @entity145 was being debated in town hall meetings across the country ? uh
... you almost did n't have the heart to tell them that @entity163 is a government program
early reports show that indeed @entity5 has not lost black support in the voting booth
about 90 % of blacks voted @entity172 in the 2014 midterm elections , roughly where they voted in 2012 and 2010
a high percentage of black voters will likely always support this president
his experiences are like our experiences
he may be the president , but ... he 's ... still ... black like us
but the midterms do not bode well for the @entity172 in 2016
republicans could not put enough images of president @entity5 in their election ads , and many @entity172 could not run away from the president fast enough
my favorite was @entity8 hopeful @entity189 refusing to say whether she even voted for president @entity5
contrast her response with that of a senator from @entity193 -- @entity194 -- a presidential aspirant who stated , at a @entity196 @entity25 field office in an @entity14 neighborhood , that the " @entity25 brand sucks , and so people do n't want to be a @entity25 and for 80 years , african - americans have had nothing to do with @entity25
" in 2016 when president @entity5 is no longer at the top of the ticket helping to get out the black vote out , @entity172 will have a different problem
if they lose , maybe they will blame that on president @entity5 as well .
