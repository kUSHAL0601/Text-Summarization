-- the sponsor of a top golf tournament in @entity3 insists it is safe to go ahead despite two @entity6 players pulling out due to security fears
@entity6 @entity10 stars @entity8 and @entity11 withdrew from the @entity12 monday , citing concerns over recent tensions between @entity15
" they have reached this decision following perceived unrest on the @entity25 and can no longer assure their commitment to this year 's event , " @entity16 's said in a statement on the website of the @entity19 , which co-sanctions the tournament with the @entity21
now held at the @entity29 course at @entity30 , 60 kilometers south of the capital @entity32 , the â ‚ ¬ 2,205,000 ( $ 2.85 million ) event was the first staged in @entity3 in 2008 on the island of @entity36
" @entity16 's and the @entity19 would like to reiterate that the tournament is going ahead as planned with a full field of @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity42 members , " the statement added
" @entity16 's has been kept fully up to date on relevant issues and the @entity19 has also been liaising with key decision makers , including the @entity45 , who have not warned of any increased risk to those traveling to or within the country
world no. 30 @entity11 , who won the 2007 masters , said he did not want to take the risk following @entity53 's recent threats against its neighbor and its move to test missiles and restart its nuclear program
" it was one of those things where the women in my life really did n't feel like it was necessary for me to go , " the 37 - year - old from @entity59 told the @entity60 , referring to his wife , mother and young daughter
" the posture and rhetoric that is taking place right now makes it not worth it
and it probably is just posture and rhetoric
however , i do n't want to take the chance
" world no. 19 @entity8 , who played at the @entity25 event in 2011 , had similar concerns
" i feel bad for the tournament , " said the 28 - year - old , whose partner is @entity84 , the model daughter of ice hockey legend @entity85
" they were gracious and understanding
hopefully it will work out in the future
" the tournament , which starts on thursday , will feature three former major champions in @entity95 's world no. 6 @entity93 , @entity25 veteran @entity98 and @entity97 's @entity96 .
