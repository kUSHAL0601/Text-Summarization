-- health officials announced friday a campaign to vaccinate more than 20 million children against polio and other diseases across much of the @entity6
" the headline is the @entity6 is reinfected , " said dr. @entity7 , the @entity8 's assistant director - general for polio , emergencies and country collaboration
the announcement , by @entity8 and @entity14 , comes a week after an outbreak of polio was confirmed in @entity17 for the first time since 1999
ten children have been left paralyzed , and hundreds of thousands are at risk
given that the virus paralyzes anywhere from 1 in 200 to 1 in 1,000 of the people it infects , " that means you 've got probably thousands infected , " @entity7 told @entity0 in a telephone interview
" so , if you do a campaign to respond , it would have to cover basically all of @entity17
" most of the victims are younger than 2 years of age , born since violence erupted in march 2011 , wracking the country and shredding its once - robust public health infrastructure
" we will expect to see more cases , certainly in @entity17 if not in surrounding countries , " @entity37 , a spokeswoman for polio eradication for @entity8 , said in a telephone interview
@entity17 's immunization rates have dropped from more than 90 % before the conflict began in march 2011 to 68 % now , the @entity42 , or @entity42 , said friday in a prepared statement
already , more than 650,000 children in @entity17 have been vaccinated , including 116,000 in the northeast province of @entity49 , where the outbreak was confirmed , the @entity42 statement said
the campaign also will target @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , and the @entity57 and @entity58
over the past year , the virus has been discovered in sewage samples from @entity52 , @entity62 , the @entity57 and @entity58 , a region that has not seen polio cases for nearly a decade , it said
transmission of the virus occurs through close person - to - person contact and consumption of food or drink contaminated with feces
" preliminary evidence indicates that the poliovirus is of @entity74 origin and is similar to the strain detected in @entity52 , @entity62 , the @entity57 and @entity58 , " the @entity42 statement said
@entity74 is one of three countries -- the others are @entity79 and @entity80 -- where polio remains endemic
but @entity7 said health officials have a good chance of halting its spread in @entity17 , where 1.6 million children are to be vaccinated against not only polio , but against measles , mumps and rubella
" they have a great history of vaccination in @entity17 ; the immunity gap is in a relatively small part of the population , " he said
in addition , the region is entering its cool season , when transmission would typically slow , he said
@entity7 said he met last week with @entity17 's minister of health and was impressed by the response
" everybody 's playing ball , " he said
but it 's a dangerous game
" the virus is unforgiving -- both what it does to kids and what it does to epidemiologists trying to stop it , " he said
over the past few days , more than 18,000 children at @entity112 in @entity54 have been vaccinated , with a national goal of reaching 3.5 million people
vaccinations have also begun in western @entity53 , with more planned for the @entity116 in the north in coming days
and the campaign is slated to begin this week across @entity55 , and in @entity56 and @entity52 by the middle of this month
though there is no cure for polio , it can be prevented through vaccination , which is credited with slashing cases around the world by more than 99 % since 1988 .
