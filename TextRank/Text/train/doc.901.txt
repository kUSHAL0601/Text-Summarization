@entity0 -- most people toss out their busted umbrellas after a strong storm rips them apart
but for @entity6 , these broken remnants are true treasures
after rainy weather hits @entity0 , @entity6 takes to the streets collecting umbrellas from roads , subway stations and trash cans
then she totes them back to her @entity16 studio and transforms them from trash into fashion
her unique pieces are anything but shabby
@entity22 creates chic cocktail dresses , tote bags and dog clothes from umbrella material and other recycled fabrics for her clothing line @entity28
she has even made a wedding dress using 15 white umbrellas
after watching the film " breakfast at @entity36 , " @entity6 was inspired to make her own version of the little black dress , thinking , " i really love that black dress , but i do n't want to do the same kind of little black dress
what about i try something out of umbrellas ? " and i took 3 umbrellas and i designed a beautiful gown
" wet - weather months provide an abundance of fabric for @entity22
" in march , during the rainy month , i collected 237 umbrellas , " she said
the job can lead to interesting situations
one woman who came across @entity54 digging deep in a trash can mistook her for a homeless person and offered her lunch
but @entity6 does n't mind
she believes she is helping to reduce the amount of garbage on the streets
" i think i 'm doing a lot
i 'm helping a lot because all those umbrellas and all those fabrics are going to end up in a landfill
" her creations are mostly sold online
the umbrella dresses start at $ 200 , dog clothes are $ 40 , and purses are about $ 150
it 's fashion for a good cause
@entity6 says 10 percent of every sale she makes will go to a school she is building in her home country of @entity75
the school , @entity6 said , will be " something young kids can just go and learn something positive , learn how to recycle , how to do something with their hands , and be useful for tomorrow
" @entity6 believes she is making a difference at home , too
" by purchasing and buying one dress , a bag made out of a recycled umbrella , right there you 're showing your support , you 're doing something that is right , that is good for the environment , for you , for your kids , or for everybody , " she said
meanwhile , @entity6 is committed to braving the rainy @entity0 streets on the hunt for trashed umbrellas
" i 'll keep on going and recycling and do whatever i can just to make our lives easier , a little bit better maybe
