-- you sure got ta climb a lot of steps to reach the @entity5 building in @entity6 , so just imagine what the tumble down is like
or , just ask " @entity9 , hero of the classic animated educational segment " @entity12 " on how a bill becomes a law
in a sketch on this weekend 's episode of " @entity18 " that captures the gridlocked climate of @entity6 politics , president @entity15 pushes the bill ( played by @entity22 ) down the steps of the @entity5 to make room for a cigarette - smoking executive order ( played by @entity26 )
" there 's an easier way to get things done around here , " @entity15 ( played by @entity27 ) tells a bewildered schoolboy visiting the @entity5
the sketch starts off the same way as the original " @entity35 " segment , with a schoolboy meeting the bill on the @entity5 steps
@entity39 launches into the classic " i 'm just a @entity39 " ditty , explaining how he goes from " sitting here on @entity44 " to the @entity45 , the @entity46 and then to the president 's desk
then , enter @entity15 , followed by @entity49 , who tells the student , " i pretty much just happen
" @entity39 makes his way up the steps a few times after the tumble , only to meet the same fate
but is this constitutional ? the boy asks
yes , says executive order -- " i create national parks , or new holidays
" " or grant legal status to 5 million undocumented immigrants , " interjects @entity15 , referring to his plan to overhaul immigration
" whoa ! " exclaims executive order
" ok , go big or go home
" moral of the story ? " i think i want to go into the private sector , " says the boy
