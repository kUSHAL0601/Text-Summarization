-- a deadly 2009 " sweat lodge " retreat in @entity2 left participants so sickened that the scene resembled " a battleground " with people vomiting , foaming at the mouth and with their eyes nearly popping out , according to one survivor who testified thursday
" i saw people agonizing , " said @entity11 , a participant from @entity13 , @entity14
" it looked like a battle ground
people are just laying there
" @entity11 , who earlier testified he fell at one point and badly burned his arm on the heated rocks , continued his testimony thursday in the trial of self - help guru @entity25
@entity25 is accused of manslaughter in the deaths of three persons at his october 2009 " @entity32 " retreat in the desert
killed were @entity33 , 38 , of @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , 40 , of @entity37 , @entity38 ; and volunteer @entity39 , 49 , of @entity40 , @entity41
at least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill , but more than 40 others were uninjured , and defense lawyers have argued that the deaths were accidental
@entity25 's attorneys have also argued that exposure to an unknown toxin , perhaps a pesticide , could have caused the fatalities
the event participants paid up to $ 10,000 to seek " new areas of consciousness , " according to this week 's testimony
the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches , and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to perilously high temperatures , causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke
the sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds , with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes
while they were not prevented from leaving , participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds
under questioning by the prosecution , @entity11 recounted how he re-entered the sweat lodge and came across one participant , @entity39
she was among those who died
" seeing the way @entity79 was i knew there was something terribly wrong
i was a bit apprehensive about being back in there just because of the pain i had in my arm
we finished the last ceremony and i was more focused on staying awake , " @entity11 told the court
" she was a heavy - set woman and i could n't quite get her out
so a fellow named @entity92 helped me , " @entity11 said
" i was lifting her little by little
we would go , ' one , two , three ' -- and we would lift
i think her face dragged on the ground a little bit , but we helped her out
