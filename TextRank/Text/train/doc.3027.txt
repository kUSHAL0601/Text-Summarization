-- the only thing cuter than a baby panda might be two baby pandas
@entity0 sent reporter @entity4 and producer @entity5 on thursday to @entity6 for a behind - the - scenes peek at the twin panda brothers ( the only surviving panda twins in the @entity9 )
@entity10 and @entity5 got to watch as veterinarians weighed and measured @entity14 , " took his temperature and listened to his heart
they 'll be known as @entity15 " a " and " b " until a naming ceremony 100 days after their birth , in keeping with @entity20 tradition
rules for the panda nursery : before entering the " secure bio zone , " @entity10 and @entity5 were required to change into yellow gowns and put on booties over their shoes
even the tripod got booties
@entity10 asked if she could hold one of the little guys but the zoo said no. seeing the babies together was a special treat
usually one panda is cared for by zoo staff while the other is with mom
@entity39 is a very hands - on mom , @entity10 reports
zoo visitors wo n't be able to see the pandas until this fall but a story about them is scheduled to air friday on @entity47
until then , treat yourself to their @entity49 .
