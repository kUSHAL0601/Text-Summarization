@entity0 -- a lapse in @entity6 's health insurance -- because she 's not been working in the past year -- has prevented her from paying for the psychological counseling ordered as part of her probation , her lawyer revealed in court thursday
" maybe she knows somebody who can help out , " @entity13 judge @entity12 said , warning @entity6 she had 21 days to sign up for counseling
judge @entity12 ordered the actress to appear in court thursday so she could review the actress ' progress on meeting the requirements of her probation for a shoplifting conviction and two older drunk driving convictions
@entity6 , 25 , entered a guilty plea in may to stealing a necklace from a @entity28 , @entity27 jewelry story
while @entity6 is in compliance with her community service , fines and shoplifting counseling requirements , but she has not signed up for the court - ordered psychological counseling , the judge said
she could be ordered to jail unless she proves within three weeks that she has found a psychologist , @entity12 said
group counseling , which probationers attend , is often free or low - cost , but judge @entity12 agreed with @entity6 's lawyer , @entity41 , that @entity6 's celebrity status makes that unworkable
" i do n't want group counseling for her , " @entity12 said
" she needs one on one counseling
" @entity6 scribbled a note to her lawyer during the hearing saying she believed she could raise the cash soon to enter counseling
the judge chided @entity6 for only completing 33 of the required 480 hours of community service so far
if it 's not finished within a year , she could go to jail , she said
@entity6 wore these shoes to court ? ! she must work 120 hours at the @entity0 morgue after she completes 360 hours at the a women 's center on @entity0 ' @entity59 section
" get done with that community service and your life can be back in order , " judge @entity12 said
@entity6 's legal woes , which began four years ago with two drunk driving arrests , have been compounded over the past two years by her failure to attend counseling classes and alcohol and drug test failures
the 120 - day jail sentence also ordered translated into just 35 days of home confinement that ended on june 29
jail overcrowding rules and and state rules that give credit for good behavior for prisoners allowed for the shortened term
her probation is scheduled to end within a year , unless @entity6 is charged with breaking any laws before then
it has been extended several times because of probation violations , including failed alcohol and drug tests
@entity6 failed an alcohol test administered by a probation officer in june and was ordered to go before the judge for a probation violation hearing the next week
but @entity6 's attorney convinced the judge the testing requirement had lapsed in february
@entity94 ruled that @entity6 is now allowed to drink alcohol and she is no longer required to take random drug tests
the actress has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunken - driving convictions , a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction
" because of budget constraints and because we 're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation , nonviolent offenders , lesser crimes , get 20 % of their sentence , " @entity104 's spokesman @entity103 said
@entity6 entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge
but @entity12 made it clear in court last month that she did n't think drugs and alcohol were the root of @entity6 's legal troubles
" she 's got other problems for which she self - medicates , " @entity12 said at her sentencing in may
@entity6 's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken - driving arrests in 2007
since then , she 's spent more than eight months in substance - abuse rehabilitation programs
a probation report released in may said the actress " appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues
" " it would appear that the defendant 's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity , " the probation report said , yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail
@entity6 tested positive for alcohol use , a violation of probation rules , in february , the report said
it also revealed that the drug test failure last august , which resulted in a jail sentence and court - ordered rehab , involved cocaine and amphetamines .
