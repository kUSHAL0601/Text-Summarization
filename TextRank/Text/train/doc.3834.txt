@entity12 will sit down with the four - time @entity13 to thrash out a new contract which will see him remain as most highly - paid at the @entity15
" we want to sit down , without any rush , with @entity22 's father -- it 's not something that 's happening tomorrow , we have plenty of time , but we will do what we have to to ensure he 's the best paid player , " said @entity12 , who assumed control at @entity5 after @entity18 's resignation last week

former president @entity18 stepped down after a @entity37 judge 's decision to investigate the deal which saw @entity51 move to @entity52 from @entity54 team @entity53 last june
the club initially announced the deal was worth $ 78 million , but the breakdown of the agreement was never revealed

@entity12 , who will continue as president until the end of the current term , which finishes in 2016 , explained that he spoke with senior players at the club before discussing details of @entity51 's contract at a previous press conference
" i explained to the captains that we would be showing details of @entity51 's contract , " said the former vice president
" we have to be grateful to @entity51 that he came here , when he could have earned more money at other clubs
