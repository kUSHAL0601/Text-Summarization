-- @entity1 continued his record goalscoring streak by taking his tally to 88 for the year
the @entity5 striker scored both goals in his side 's 2 - 0 win at @entity9 in the @entity10 as @entity12 's team continued its stunning start to the season
the @entity16 side , which lifted the trophy in @entity19 's final game in charge last season , has won the competition on 26 occasions and looks in good shape to defend its title
@entity1 makes case as world 's greatest ever player @entity5 has won 14 and drawn one of its league games so far this season and has only suffered one defeat , which came in the @entity33 at @entity34
but with @entity1 firing on all cylinders , it is difficult to imagine which team can prevent @entity5 from regaining the league title from @entity39
@entity1 beats @entity41 's 40 - year goal record only last week , @entity1 surpassed @entity41 's record of 85 goals in a calendar year , which was set back in 1972 by the former @entity46 and @entity47 striker
@entity1 , 25 , has two games remaining this year to set the bar even higher with @entity51 fixtures against @entity52 and @entity53 to come before the end of 2012
already his club 's leading goalscorer after moving past the 232 mark set by @entity59 in the 1950s , the @entity55 continues to defy belief
his two goals against @entity9 means he has now scored 32 times in all competitions for club and country this season
@entity1 has also scored 15 goals in his past eight starts for @entity5 to ensure his team remains unbeaten in domestic competition
playing against a @entity9 team , which is ranked below @entity5 's b team in the second division , @entity1 could have had three or four goals
@entity1 map : how @entity55 maestro conquered the world after tapping home from close - range on 11 minutes , the striker was denied on three occasions by @entity9 goalkeeper @entity82
@entity1 eventually added his second of the evening with 16 minutes remaining
he will now go up against @entity52 hot - shot @entity84 on sunday with both men in fine form
@entity84 scored five in his side 's 6 - 0 win over @entity89 last weekend and has netted 16 times in @entity51 so far this season
but the @entity93 hot - shot was reduced to a watching role as his side eased to a 3 - 0 win over @entity97 in the first leg of their fifth round tie
@entity101 struck twice and @entity102 was also on target as @entity52 claimed a hefty advantage
@entity105 and @entity106 right to privacy ? while @entity1 had an enjoyable evening , his chief rival for the @entity109 , @entity105 , endured a frustrating night as @entity39 was beaten 2 - 1 at @entity110
the defending champion rested a number of players for the first leg tie and was made to pay the price as @entity110 claimed a deserved victory
@entity117 opened the scoring on 56 minutes before substitute @entity119 unleashed a spectacular winner to net his first goal in 110 appearances
real had several chances to make the breakthrough against a @entity110 team ranked 15th in @entity51 and finally grabbed a consolation when @entity105 fired home with three minutes remaining
that away goal leaves @entity130 's side needing just a 1 - 0 win to progress to the next round , where it could meet either @entity135 or @entity136
@entity1 and @entity105 battle for @entity109 elsewhere , there was embarrassment for last season 's finalist @entity140 after it was knocked out of the competition by minnow @entity144
@entity144 , which plays in the third division , had held the might of @entity140 to a goalless draw in the first leg of the fourth round clash

in @entity171 , @entity170 claimed a 1 - 0 win over @entity173 in the @entity174 thanks to @entity176 's 56th minute strike

@entity189 stunned by @entity190 in @entity191 in the @entity191 , @entity192 booked its place in the semifinals for the very first time in its history following a 1 - 0 win over @entity198
the @entity200 club , which is managed by former @entity5 and @entity39 player @entity201 , joins @entity202 and fourth - tier @entity190 in the next round with either @entity204 or @entity205 set to make up the numbers
in @entity209 , league leaders @entity207 moved three points clear at the top , despite being held to a surprise tie by relegation - threatened @entity213
it was @entity213 which took the lead through @entity217 and the visitor looked set to win for the first time since the opening day
but @entity221 struck an 83rd minute equalizer to ensure @entity207 took a point
meanwhile , @entity224 moved to within three points of the summit following a 2 - 1 win at @entity228 in a game played behind closed doors
following trouble in @entity228 's home game with @entity234 rivals @entity233 in october , the game was played without any supporters in the stadium
@entity238 's 15th - minute volley and an @entity240 penalty sealed the win with @entity242 grabbing a consolation for @entity228
elsewhere , @entity244 made it four wins from its past five games with a 2 - 0 triumph over @entity251 courtesy of strikes from @entity253 and @entity254
