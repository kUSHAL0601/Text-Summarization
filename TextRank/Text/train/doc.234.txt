@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government hopes to hold talks with @entity6 representatives in @entity7 in the coming weeks , according to a senior @entity1 official , in a move that threatens to cloud already delicate and fragile steps to negotiate an end to the @entity13 ' longest war
the senior official , speaking anonymously as he was discussing sensitive diplomatic issues , said there were plans for a meeting between insurgents and @entity1 officials in @entity7
yet , he added , the plans were at such an early stage that it was not clear who -- including @entity13 officials -- would attend or when any talks would be held
the @entity13 has acknowledged that it has held discussions about opening a @entity6 office in @entity29 , @entity30 , as well as the possibility of transferring some @entity6 prisoners held at @entity33 as part of @entity13 support for @entity1 reconciliation efforts
" the principle is that although there is now an agreement -- almost -- to set up an office in @entity29 , that does n't necessarily mean that all conversations will take place in @entity29 , " the official said
" we will talk to the same or different individuals ( from the insurgency ) in a different location
obviously , @entity7 has been supportive of the recent agenda and has hosted talks in the past
it is likely that we are heading there in the future for meetings
" he said the dates and participants were still being worked out and insisted that any @entity7 discussions would feed into the @entity30 process
this is " absolutely not in opposition to the @entity30 process , " he added , calling the talks in that @entity63 state " a very substantive step forward
" importantly , while the @entity1 official was unable to say whether the @entity13 would attend any talks held in @entity7 , he insisted , " the @entity13 is supportive of the idea
it is far too early to discuss any specifics about this
" the creation of a parallel process to the @entity30 talks risks frustrating @entity13 efforts to bring the @entity6 and @entity1 officials together
the current " talks about talks " in @entity29 are the product of months of @entity13 efforts to reach out to the insurgency , which came to sudden fruition last month when the @entity6 announced that they would support opening an office in their name in @entity30
officials in president @entity87 's government privately voiced frustration at being excluded from the early stages of this process
they agreed to support it last week , but the announcement of a separate drive in @entity7 will be interpreted by many as an @entity1 reminder that they wish to exert overriding influence over any peace process
the official 's remarks that they might talk to different insurgents in @entity7 could further create distance between this process and that in @entity30 , although the official insisted that was not the intention
the official said the @entity30 process could move forward once the @entity30 sent a delegation to @entity0 to discuss the next steps , adding that he hoped that would be soon
he said that as of now , there were no @entity1 government officials in @entity30 to support any discussions
" to fully assume ownership of the @entity30 process is important for us , " the official added
" we will work in the weeks ahead " to do that
he said the @entity13 needed a clear statement from the insurgents , distancing themselves from terrorism , for their role in the @entity30 process to move forward and for an office to be established
he said : " we know and are aware the are @entity6 representatives in @entity29
there are channels in fact , and we are aware of the presence
what 's not yet established is the office
" an @entity13 observer with an intimate knowledge of the discussions said , " @entity134 ( @entity87 ) is basically saying is that he is not on board with the @entity30 process
" the observer said he did not think @entity13 officials had been made aware of the @entity7 process before its announcement and expressed doubts as to how thought - out and organized any @entity7 meeting was
" this does n't seem really serious
it 's more a symptom of @entity87 protesting the progress that 's been made in @entity30
we do n't know if this is real or if the @entity7 are on board
it 's yet another statement that comes out of @entity0 that throws a monkey wrench into the process
" he added that @entity87 had blown " hot and cold " over reconciling with the @entity6
" it is frustrating because often the assumption was that it would be difficult to get the @entity6 to focus on talks , but actually it 's difficult to get @entity87 to
