-- as the first president - elect with a @entity4 page and a @entity6 channel , @entity1 is poised to use the @entity7 to communicate directly with @entity8 in a way unknown to previous presidents
since the election , president - elect @entity1 has posted weekly video addresses on @entity6
judging by @entity1 's savvy use of social - networking sites during his campaign and the interactive nature of his transition team 's web site , @entity8 can expect a president who bypasses the traditional media 's filters while reaching out to citizens for input , observers say
" the rebooting of our democracy has begun , " said @entity25 , founder of @entity26 and the @entity28 blog
" [ @entity1 ] has the potential to transform the relationship between the @entity8 public and their democracy
" during the presidential race , @entity1 's campaign won praise for its innovative use of social - networking sites , including @entity4 , @entity42 and @entity43 , to announce events , rally volunteers and raise money
@entity4 has more than 150 million active users , and the average user has 100 friends on the site , according to the company
ireport.com : your chance to ask president - elect @entity1 a question @entity1 has more than 1 million @entity42 " friends " and more than 3.7 million " supporters " on his official @entity4 page -- some 700,000 more than when he was elected in november
his campaign also has a database of almost 13 million supporters and their e-mail addresses
transition officials hope to transform @entity1 's vast web operation and electronic list of supporters into a 21st - century tool to help accomplish his goals as president
they even have a name for this ambitious effort : @entity1 2.0
" @entity1 has invented an alternative media model , " said @entity0 senior political analyst @entity73
" in the old model , the president talks to the people on television [ and ] the people talk back in polls
in the new model , communication is online , and two - way
" @entity4 , @entity42 , @entity6 and @entity83 did n't exist when @entity84 took office eight years ago
but since last november 's election , @entity1 has wasted no time embracing these online communication portals
in recent weeks he has taped weekly video addresses and posted them to @entity6 , where most have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times
@entity1 's staffers also have stopped posting information to social - networking sites since the election , preferring to reach out to constituents through @entity6 and @entity95 , the official site of the president - elect 's transition team
visitors to @entity95 can read a frequently updated blog , post their ideas on issues facing the country , and rate others ' ideas
top - rated ideas will be gathered into a briefing book and given to @entity1 after he takes office
" they want information going not just from them to the voters , but from the voters back to them , " @entity110 strategist @entity109 said wednesday on @entity0 's " @entity111
" " thirteen million people pushing a button , sending an e-mail to their elected representatives , making a phone call , taking action , is a powerful , powerful lobbying tool
" " it 's a very smart use of the @entity7 , to get people to offer ideas , " said @entity124 , a @entity126 internet strategist
all hopes that @entity1 and his staff take a similar approach to @entity131 , the president 's official web site
the current @entity131 site , operated by the @entity84 administration , contains few interactive features
a statement on the president - elect 's transition site says that @entity1 hopes to " use cutting - edge technologies to create a new level of transparency , accountability , and participation for @entity8 's citizens
" it 's fitting , then , that @entity1 's inauguration next week could be one of the most watched video events in internet history
@entity25 expects that hordes of users will be watching online when @entity1 takes the oath of office , visiting @entity131 and refreshing their browsers to capture the moment the site switches to proclaim @entity1 , not @entity84 , as president
as president , @entity1 will likely not just rely on @entity131 but use multiple internet sites and technological tools to build grass - roots support for his agenda , observers say
" [ @entity1 ] is using the tools that are available to him today , " @entity124 told @entity0
" the next president will be using some of the same tools , and also some tools that have n't been invented yet
