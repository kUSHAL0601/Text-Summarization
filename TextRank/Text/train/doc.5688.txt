a former @entity2 player apparently lived up to his old @entity5 team 's name and says he swam nine miles in the ocean to shore after falling off his boat
fighting back tears , @entity8 , 38 , recounted an incredible story monday at a press conference in @entity12 , @entity13
he said he swam through cold water in the @entity15 for about 16 hours , alternating between the breast stroke and backstroke
jellyfish stung him , and he was once circled by a shark , he said
appearing healthy , his wife sitting next to him , @entity8 told reporters that , treading water in the moments after falling off his boat wednesday off the @entity13 coast , he knew how improbable his survival was
he had read about what happens to the body under such circumstances
he figured that he had maybe three hours before hypothermia set in
it might take him more than 10 hours , at best , to get to shore
but he told himself he would make it
" i 've got two beautiful daughters , " he said , his eyes watering
" i was hitting shore
" @entity8 said he departed alone in his 36 - foot @entity35 boat from @entity36 , @entity13 , at about 10:30 a.m. wednesday and went about nine miles offshore
he set the boat on autopilot for 5 mph and started to fish
he said he hooked a fish around 1 p.m. and while trying to reel it in , a huge wave smashed into the boat and he lost his footing and fell overboard
the boat was moving east , he said , toward the @entity45
he was n't wearing a flotation device and did n't see any other boats around
" i quickly realized i was in a real bad situation , " he recounted
" i made a decision that i was going to start swimming toward shore , west
" over the next 16 hours , he said he had two opportunities to be rescued
he saw a recreational fishing vessel
he was floating about 50 yards from it and tried to swim closer , but no one spotted or heard him
a little later , a @entity57 @entity56 helicopter circled and shined its light on him , he recounted
" they had come right over the top of me , " he said
but the helicopter flew away
" that was a difficult time
i realized at that point in time ... i was on my own
@entity64 told @entity0 on monday that @entity66 authorities contacted the @entity56 to report that @entity8 was missing and that it had a helicopter out looking for the former fullback
down to his underwear , @entity8 alternated between breast stroke and backstroke , mustering the strength to keep swimming
he made it through the night , and managed to coach himself to remain calm despite seeing " glowing " creatures in the water
when he heard waves crashing against the shore , he told himself : " at that point , you ca n't not make it ? " at around 4:30 a.m. thursday , @entity8 said he hit the shore in @entity66
he was shivering uncontrollably so he curled into a ball and tried to warm himself up
he had trouble walking but eventually made his way to a home where a security guard was working
the guard notified that @entity88 , according to a department report
@entity8 was taken to the hospital , where he said he was treated for hypothermia , severe dehydration and rhabdomyolysis , the breakdown of muscle tissue
@entity8 's remarkable experience has wowed distance swimmers
@entity98 , a nationally renowned distance swimmer , has swum the 22 - mile course around @entity100 , @entity101 , five times
he 's trained in the same waters in @entity13 where @entity8 fought against the odds
" if you 're a good swimmer and you 're faced with an emergency , you could be capable of doing what he did , " @entity98 said
the @entity108 said it is investigating the boat incident
depending on @entity8 's location in the @entity111 , he would have had to swim west , across the water 's south - to - north current , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity113
the current could have been up to 4 mph
normally swimming a mile in the ocean could take 20 to 30 minutes -- if a person is very fit , @entity98 said
most professional swimmers do n't attempt that many miles without help from a team providing hydration and nutrition
@entity8 is the ceo of @entity123 , a @entity13 financial services company
a fullback , he played at @entity125 and was drafted by the @entity2 in the second round of the @entity127
he played his entire pro career for the @entity2 -- 82 games , according to @entity130
he was released from his contract in 2005
" i ca n't imagine that swimming is n't part of his typical workout , " @entity98 said
@entity8 said he judged which direction to swim by looking at the sun during the day and the stars at night
but even if @entity8 knew which direction to start swimming , he 'd have to contend with constant saltwater in his eyes , intense muscle fatigue , wind and , of course , current , noted @entity146 , president and ceo of the @entity147 in @entity148
" from the salt alone , you 'd have a tongue the size of a baseball , " said @entity146
it makes sense that @entity8 stripped down in the water to lessen the drag , @entity146 added
a former pro athlete like @entity8 knows what it takes to push past pain , @entity98 surmised
he would know how to focus and to stay calm , too
sitting next to her husband monday , @entity162 said he has always been the kind of guy who never gives up
" @entity8 is a very powerful human being , " she said
" he set his mind on something and he does go after it
" @entity171 : @entity8 's amazing swim for survival @entity0 's @entity174 contributed to this report .
