-- there will be no more @entity2 , at least for now
the @entity4 cover girl and her @entity6 team are out of the @entity7 after losing an elimination game thursday night in @entity9 , @entity10 , to a squad from @entity12
@entity14 's @entity13 jumped out to a quick 2 - 0 lead , but it did n't last
the @entity17 club went ahead 4 - 2 in the bottom of the first inning , and added two more runs the next frame
@entity21 narrowed the score to 6 - 4 in the fourth inning , then to 6 - 5 the next
but despite advancing the tying runner to third base in the bottom of the sixth and final inning , the @entity13 could n't finish off the comeback
the result means @entity12 will face off against @entity30 at 3:30 p.m. et saturday for the @entity32 championship
the winner of that game plays for the @entity7 title on sunday
it also ends @entity14 's high - profile run on youth baseball 's biggest stage
while other girls have played in the @entity7 , none have gotten the same attention as the @entity6 resident and @entity13 standout
the 13 - year - old became a national sensation after tossing a shutout -- giving up three hits and notching six strikeouts in the process -- to help @entity21 become one of the final 16 @entity7 contenders
@entity53 persistently deflected attention to her teammates -- all of them boys -- even as the media consistently made her the headline
she recalled how she happened into baseball after a coach spotted her tossing a football , how her stellar play caught some off - guard and how she interacts with her teammates
one would expect , then , that this will all die down
@entity14 is too old to be in another @entity7
but that does n't mean we wo n't hear from her again
the @entity4 cover says it straight out : " @entity14 -- remember her name ( as if we could ever forget )
" the accompanying story says @entity53 's first love is basketball and her dream is to play for legendary coach @entity77 's @entity79 team
@entity80 does n't doubt @entity53 can do it , saying she " completely dominated the @entity82 ( despite ) every play matching up with 6 - foot - 2 , 6 - 3 boys
" " everyone 's seen her pitch , " @entity80 , @entity14 's coach in soccer , told @entity4
" well , i promise you , she 's five times better at basketball
