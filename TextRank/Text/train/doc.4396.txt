-- @entity1 does n't like the word " dominance "
that would appear strange given that 's exactly what he has created within the world of @entity9
at the age of 26 , @entity1 has won four successive drivers ' titles and after claiming seven straight successive race victories last weekend , he can even afford to take his foot off the gas with two @entity16 of the season remaining
not that he will though
this is a man who lives to win -- even if he does n't like the term which goes with his era of success
" i do n't like the word domination because it makes things sound easy , " @entity1 told reporters
" if we look back through every single individual race it was very , very hard work
" we got great results to finish on the podium on days where possibly we should n't have
" it 's a long season and you need to make sure that you get to your 100 %
" you ca n't do that all the time but i think you can get very , very close
" @entity1 's win at last weekend 's @entity38 brought him level with fellow @entity42 @entity41 's record of seven successive race victories which was recorded back in 2004
with two races left on the calendar , he can match @entity47 's record of nine in a row set in 1952 - 53 and @entity41 's 2004 feat of 13 in one season
such success would cap another phenomenal season for @entity1 , who is hoping to improve on his 37 career wins by triumphing in the @entity54 and @entity55
" when i jump into the car , i 'm not thinking about what has happened before -- i 'm thinking about what is going to happen in the future , " he added
" i 'm not completely aware of what i 've achieved over the past couple of years
i 'm happy not to be aware
" i love racing and it has been my dream since i was a child -- was a dream to race in @entity9
" to be this successful , of course i 'll take it and i 'm very proud
but every race is a new challenge , every year is a new challenge
i 'm not lacking in motivation because i know how hard it is deliver
" what is scary for @entity1 's rivals is that he has no desire to slow down any time soon
@entity41 , @entity74 and @entity75 have all won four drivers ' titles but @entity1 is the youngest to have reached such a milestone
@entity74 was 45 when he took his fourth title , @entity75 was 38 and @entity41 was 32 -- and @entity1 is already planning his next
he added : " the next goal is the next race
i 'm not trying to look too far ahead or looking back
" you should always look forward
we had many great moments , a special moment but i believe the biggest moment in my life is yet to come
" it would be quite sad at the age of 26 to look back and that the greatest moment had happened and have nothing to look forward to
" @entity93 team principal @entity92 says @entity1 's " burning desire and great natural talent " separates him from his competitors
" the hardest thing about being his @entity92 is slowing him down , " @entity92 told @entity0 after being asked about working with @entity1
" he pushes himself very hard and is hard on himself , sometimes he needs to be less so
he has a burning desire in him and a great natural talent too
" the qualities he has -- huge inner belief , determination , a fantastic natural feel for the car and beyond all that he 's a really , really nice guy
" that 's why he 's so popular within the team
he wears his heart on his sleeve
