@entity0 calls it her " a-ha " moment
there she was looking for her first sippy cup for her then 6 - month - old daughter
her choices : @entity8 , @entity9 and " @entity15 " characters for boys , and princesses -- and more princesses -- for girls
already fired up , she walked through the toy aisles and saw what she describes as a further gender divide
girls were offered baby dolls , princesses and sexy fashion figures ; the boys section had superheroes , building blocks , science kits and dinosaurs
there was no middle ground
i did n't see any dolls or cooking sets for boys , nor building blocks or fire trucks for girls , " writes @entity0 in her new book " @entity35 : how parents can fight the @entity40 and @entity41 , from @entity42
" after that experience , she said in an interview , " everything clicked and made sense to me
" " i hear parents saying that all the time
they 're like , ' oh , i just had my sippy cup moment ' ... they were at a restaurant and the clown came to the table and offered the boys a whole bunch of selections for what balloon animal to make and then he offered the girl a flower or a tiara , " said @entity0 , a mom of two
" the mom 's like , ' what if she wants a light saber , too ? ' " the birth of a cause after @entity0 's eye - opening shopping experience , she decided to start a business creating empowering t - shirts for girls and boys
her company , @entity73 and @entity74 , offers selections such as a girl doctor with the headline " call me in the morning " and another that says " i 'm growing up , " and lists words like inquisitive , fearless and daring
her business led to a blog and ultimately , a cause : trying to raise awareness about gender stereotypes and how damaging they can be
" one pink pacifier or sippy cup or @entity91 set is n't a big deal ... it 's when the lowest common denominators of femininity become the marketing catalyst for every product that 's made for females , " said @entity0 , who has an 8 - year - old daughter and a 5 - year - old son
the fact that there are " girl " products and " boy " products at all is also part of the problem , she said
" it teaches children there is only one way to be a girl and one way to be a boy , " she said
" when you have a little girl like mine who is obsessed with the ocean and giant squids and insect infestations in homes , she 's considered weird or odd or a tomboy when in fact , science and things like that should be considered girly
" as a mom of two girls -- including one who hopes @entity129 of the @entity130 calls her to play on his team in this week 's @entity132 -- i can totally relate
i , along with so many other parents , am frustrated about the definitions of what 's girly and what 's not , and the separate products and clothing offered to girls and boys
' @entity141 and pretty to hot and sexy ' a larger question is just whether this gender differentiation in products and fashion actually leads to another big concern , especially for parents of daughters , the sexualization of our young girls
@entity0 of @entity152 , @entity153 , says there 's a correlation
" you have to connect the dots , " she said
" with princess culture and all these pink toys that are almost always focused on fashion and beauty and how a girl can please somebody else , either by keeping a nice house or looking like a perfect princess , that all segues into the sexualization side of the market
" once you 're done with princesses , if you are growing up in that girly - girly culture , the next thing offered to you are these sexualized dolls and you are growing up too fast , " she said
" you are being introduced into adult concepts of sexuality that otherwise would n't be present in toys and it does n't allow a girl to develop on her own , and at her own pace
" the pretty princess culture focuses on appearance and that segues ( from ) ' sweet and pink and pretty ' to ' hot and sexy
' there 's no room for girlhood in that space
" encouraging girls ' ' personal brand ' so what 's a parent to do ? @entity0 's book , which she hopes is almost like a " recipe book for parents , " offers step - by - step advice
she encourages us to teach our children to think critically , which can be as simple as watching a television show and raising questions about why girls are portrayed a certain way
for instance , if the girl character is getting rescued by a boy , we can tell our girls the story could easily have been changed so the girl is doing the rescuing
" i talk about parents teaching girls a personal brand , " she said
" she kind of has this benchmark that ... when these toxic messages come in and out from culture , she can then bounce against ( them ) or not and say , ' well this does n't fit what my mom and dad taught me
' " there are not enough parents having these kinds of conversations with their girls and boys , @entity0 said
moms on @entity230 might see something inspiring such as a new ad by @entity233 encouraging women to love themselves , no matter what
" they all click like and they love it , " she said , " but are you taking that second step and sharing that with your kid and really talking about it ... and just being conscious of the media you are taking in ? " parents can also make their voices heard , @entity0 said , whenever they see a product , ad , or clothing that they believe stereotypes and sexualizes girls
when @entity250 gave @entity251 , the heroine from " brave " a makeover , more than 250,000 people signed a " @entity256 " online petition
@entity250 ultimately backed down from changing the character 's look and dress
" once you aggregate these parents ' voices and the tens of thousands of voices , you really can start to make change , " she said
' once you see it , you ca n't unsee it ' @entity0 often tells parents in her community that once they become aware of the stereotyping and the sexualization , they wo n't be able to look away
" once you see it , you ca n't unsee it , " she writes
it 's also never too late to start doing something about it , she says
that includes letting our girls know they can be whatever they want to be
" there are many ways to be a girl and ' @entity35 ' is about giving girls the space to show us who they are , " she said
so if the @entity130 needs an extra player sunday , i 'll be sure my 6 - year - old gal is ready ! what do you think we can do to fight stereotyping and sexualizing girls ? @entity297 in below in comments or tell @entity299 on @entity300 and @entity301 on @entity230 .
