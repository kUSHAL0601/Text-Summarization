-- back in the 1950s , @entity1 fell in love with the idea of truth serum
all manner of spies , murderers and other bad guys were given a needle containing sodium pentothal on the big screen and soon were babbling away uncontrollably as to their guilt or complicity with @entity15 or the @entity16
as recently as 2004 in " meet the @entity20 , " a former @entity18 agent played by @entity19 injects his would - be son - in - law , played by @entity22 , with the stuff to get the lowdown on his love life
@entity22 's character confesses , in a foreshadowing of @entity29 's amorous ways , to having had a child with his housekeeper , although whether he did or not is far from clear
@entity32 knew all about truth serum
@entity34 was used on a variety of miscreants and by evildoers
it was so powerful and feared that its use was strictly controlled by the @entity41
in reality , magical thinking is all it really is
there is no such thing as truth serum
but that news has apparently not reached @entity48
the judge in charge of the mass murder trial of @entity52 seems to think @entity1 was onto something with its fascination with truth serums
he has approved the use of a " narcoanalytic interview " -- such as a " truth serum " like sodium pentothal -- as part of a competency evaluation to determine whether @entity52 was legally insane at the time he allegedly went on a rampage in a theater in @entity64 , @entity48
@entity52 is charged with killing 12 people and injuring many more
sodium pentothal -- the original " truth serum " -- was discovered in 1936 by @entity69 and @entity70 working in @entity71 at @entity72
they were trying to create an injectable drug for use in general anesthesia
their discovery was a success and had a huge impact on surgery
sodium pentothal is still used today to knock out patients before they are given another , longer - lasting anesthetic to keep them unconscious during surgery
sodium pentothal made surgery far less painful
it also has an interesting side effect
people under its influence lose their inhibitions and babble on about all sorts of things , leading to some amusing moments for surgical teams
this loss of inhibition gave a few researchers hope that the drug or something like it could be used to get the truth out of people in police stations , security interrogations or trials
but outside of @entity1 , no drug passes muster as a potion capable of getting accurately at the truth
people do get uninhibited and talk more freely , but they do n't necessarily stop lying or fantasizing
they also grow more compliant , tending to agree with those asking them leading questions
there is no solid evidence that what is said under the influence of a " truth " drug correlates reliably with the truth
for the most part , people yammer away
if anything , they behave as if they were drunk rather than diligently affirming the sober truth
there is no drug that is going to shed trustworthy light on @entity52 ' state of mind last year when , police say , he donned a gas mask as well as full body armor and grabbed a rifle , a pump - action 12 - gauge shotgun and at least one .40 - caliber semiautomatic pistol to launch a heinous attack
no drug can tell us what he was really thinking
in giving permission to use drugs , the judge has opened the door to a line of defense in which @entity52 ' lawyers can argue that if drugged , he is being forced to testify against himself against his will
as much as some might hope for a thing such as a truth serum , none exists
whether @entity52 was bad or mad when he allegedly caused so much misery to so many people will not get resolved by a technique beloved by @entity1 movie directors but not by scientists
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .
