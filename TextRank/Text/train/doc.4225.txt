the law , which president @entity23 signed july 26 , 1990 , is credited with smashing barriers and creating opportunities for the disabled in a nation where more than 3 million people 15 and older use wheelchairs
it prohibits discrimination against disabled people , guaranteeing them equal opportunity in employment , transportation , government services and other areas
although some critics say the act can be burdensome , costly and an overextension of the government 's authority over the private sector , others say it could be stronger

in addition , @entity2 said , the @entity53 was publishing rules to prohibit disability - based discrimination by state and local governments as well as private businesses
he called the 1990 law " one of the most comprehensive civil rights bills in the history of this country " and cited examples of people who faced discrimination for their disabilities or overcame them
" when told you ca n't , you responded with that age - old @entity4 creed , ' yes , we can , ' " @entity2 said ; applause and cheers greeted his 2008 campaign theme
