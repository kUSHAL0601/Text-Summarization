-- an @entity2 court has called a short - notice hearing friday for three men convicted of killing three west @entity6 boys in 1993 , with authorities tight - lipped about the nature of the proceeding in a closely watched case
all three of the men -- @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity12 , dubbed the " @entity12 " -- are expected to attend the session in @entity15
the state attorney general 's office said it could not comment on the matter , citing a gag order on participants in the case
@entity21 , a spokeswoman for the state court system , said the convicts would appear before a judge in chambers before the public hearing is held
@entity27 was sentenced to death and @entity13 and @entity12 were given life sentences in the may 1993 slayings of second - graders @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity12
the boys ' bodies were mutilated and left in a ditch , hogtied with their own shoelaces
prosecutors argued that @entity27 , @entity13 and @entity12 , then teenagers , were driven by satanic ritual and that @entity27 had been the ringleader
but dna testing that was not available at the time failed to link any of the men to the crime , and the state @entity45 ruled in november that all three could present new evidence to the trial court in an effort to clear them
the case has drawn national attention , with actor @entity53 and singer @entity54 trying to rally support for the men 's release
@entity0 's @entity58 and @entity59 contributed to this report .
