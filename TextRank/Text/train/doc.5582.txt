-- in 1974 , a series of powerful tornadoes whipped through @entity3 and devastated a small town called @entity5
it happened again in 1994 , and then again last april
@entity7 was there for all three
" we 're sort of a tornado magnet , " she said , her voice quaking as she surveyed the damage to her neighborhood caused by the latest major storm system to hit her community
" i 'm basically starting to rebuild , just like i did last year
" @entity7 , 56 , and her husband , @entity17 , were still reconstructing their home smashed by april 's tornadoes when an apparent twister barreled through town on friday
" my son called me and said there 's one coming up @entity25 , " she said
" i could hear the ground rumbling
so i stepped outside with my coffee and i saw it
" turning to her neighbor , she asked , " @entity30 , is that a tornado ? " " hell yeah , " he responded
" run ! " what happened next for @entity7 seemed a blur
" i ran through my front door and out the back toward my neighbor 's storm shelter
it was almost like i had blinders on , " she told @entity0 saturday
" i was n't looking where that funnel was , i was just running
" moments later , the pair flung open the shelter 's metal door and descended underground as powerful gusts swirled overheard
about 15 minutes later , it was over
surveying the damage , @entity7 said her front porch and a section of her roof were gone
much of the house 's siding had also been cleaved off , rooms were damaged and carpets were soaked
" i was lucky , " said @entity7
" we did n't lose any of our neighbors this time
they did n't die this time
" the state 's emergency management agency said saturday that at least one person had died and 11 others were injured in @entity3 after friday 's storm
the apparent tornado outbreak also killed dozens of others across the nation , leveling communities from @entity66 to @entity67 and up through @entity68
seventeen counties in @entity3 reported moderate to heavy damage , including @entity71 , where the town of @entity5 is located
" last year two people died right there on that corner , " said restaurant owner @entity73 , referring to a nearby intersection in town
@entity73 , 47 , who runs the @entity78 on a storm - damaged block , said the region has grown somewhat accustomed to treacherous weather
during last year 's storms , she said , her store was damaged and lost power , but continued to serve food on open grills in its parking lot until @entity91 arrived three days later with much - needed aid
" this is a close - knit community , " she said
@entity78 has also become a neighborhood meeting spot of sorts , and is located roughly a quarter of a mile from @entity7 ' home in an area where several other houses were damaged friday
" it destroyed my trailer , " said resident @entity99 , who had fled to seek shelter with her daughter in the neighboring town of @entity71 when she heard news of the approaching weather
less than a year ago , her home -- a house that she and her family had built -- was destroyed in a similar storm
" it was a nice house
i did n't have much money and no insurance , and so @entity114 gave me the trailer
" in 2011 , the @entity114 dispatched disaster assistance , including trailers , after april storms tore through houses , downed trees and scattered debris across @entity3
but after friday 's storms , @entity122 said her year - old trailer had been rendered unlivable
" i 'm 75 years old and i 'm tired , " she said
" it just makes me feel real tired
" mostly weary of the weather , @entity122 says she now has plans to look for a place in @entity131
" i just trust in @entity132
" back at the @entity78 , conversations were abuzz saturday with talk of the storm
" it basically followed the same path it followed on april 27th , " said @entity136 , a 67 - year - old retiree and long - time restaurant patron
" it just got them again , " he said of his neighbors
" people are walking around dumbfounded
" @entity136 , whose house survived friday 's storms , said last year 's tornado cost him more than $ 40,000 in home damages
" how much more of this are we going to take ? " he said
" some are saying , ' that 's enough , ' and do n't planning on coming back
" harvest is in the so - called " @entity154 , " a collection of @entity156 , which includes @entity3 , where warm - air moisture from the @entity158 mixes with cold air sweeping down from @entity160
the mixture is thought to foster conditions suited for tornadic activity
" when the seasons change , warm and cold air are fighting more , " said @entity164
" that increases the chances
" but the specific path tornadoes take is " largely happenstance
" state authorities say @entity3 historically has been prone to the storms , and encourage residents to develop emergency plans for the start of what 's commonly referred to as " tornado season
" " we always know that starting in march we 'll likely have tornadoes , " said state emergency management spokeswoman @entity177
" fifty - five percent of @entity3 was hit by the storms last april , so it 's pretty likely that we 'll have had some repeat hits this year
