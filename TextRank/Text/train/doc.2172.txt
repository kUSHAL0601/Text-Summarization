-- power returned slowly to @entity2 on tuesday night , a few hours after widespread outages blacked out nearly half the country , trapping people in elevators , stalling subways , filling streets with pedestrians and forcing hospitals to switch to emergency generators
the streets of @entity13 , @entity2 , are thronged with people during tuesday 's power outage
" we understand that at 1600 hours -- that is to say at 4 p.m. ( 4:30 p.m. et ) -- there was a blackout on a national level that was produced by an explosion , which is being investigated " in the @entity23 hydroelectric power station , @entity13 mayor @entity15 said
" that produced a blackout in 16 states of the country , particularly those of the central north coastal area
" the city 's emergency plan kicked in , and about 400 firefighters in training had reported for duty to help , he said
city firefighters had gone to 37 buildings in the capital to free people from elevators
the head of the country 's electric authority , @entity41 , told state - run @entity44 that 60 percent of the power had been restored by 7 p.m. local time ( 7:30 p.m. et ) and predicted that power would be fully restored before 9:30 p.m. ( 10 p.m. et )
" we are now recovering , " he said
minister of interior and justice @entity49 blamed a fault in a generator at the plant in @entity23 , which caused a high - voltage power transmission line to overheat
in taking the line out of service , power was disrupted to other areas , he said
in all , about 40 percent of the country was blacked out , officials said
affected zones included parts of the capital city of @entity13 -- where streetlights were dark -- and the states of @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , the station said

" normally , these blackouts do n't occur very often , " said @entity88 , president of @entity89
