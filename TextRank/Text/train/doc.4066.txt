-- when @entity4 appears on the news , sweat - soaked and breathless , railing against @entity7 and the government for failing to keep the oil in the @entity10 from reaching @entity12 's shores , the anguish on the politician 's face is real
" he takes this personally because he feels a great responsibility for the lives and livelihoods of the people of @entity20 , " said @entity13 , a parish employee who works for @entity4
" when he says things that some people take as controversial , he does n't mean to be controversial ; he 's just speaking from his heart
" among his more provocative statements : that the leadership of the @entity26 and @entity27 should be fired , that their plan of attack has been an " embarrassment
" " they had no plan to keep the oil out , even though they said it would n't come ashore
they had no plan to clean it up
they had no plan to make the fishermen whole
it 's like it 's being run with a bunch of seventh - graders , " the outspoken freshman parish president said last week
" this is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable
" @entity4 , president of @entity12 's southernmost parish , where the @entity48 meets the @entity10 , spoke with president @entity49 on friday about how to minimize the spill 's impact on a community whose livelihood depends on fishing and offshore oil industries
@entity4 has said he is confident in the president 's assurance that something would be done to protect the barrier islands , which come more than a month after the politician began sounding the alarm bell over the spill 's potential impact on @entity20 ' extensive network of marshes and waterways
@entity4 hopes berms can be built to protect the area from the oil , and the @entity26 was part of a discussion on the idea tuesday
" [ president @entity49 ] has the opportunity ... to do the right thing on these berms , " @entity4 said in a phone interview tuesday night
" if the truth gets back to him on these berms , i 'm confident he 'll do the right thing
" since the early days of the massive oil spill , the @entity12 native has been going non-stop , according to friends and family , waking up around 3 a.m. and returning home at 11 p.m. , after a full day of meetings , tours of the area and rounds on local and national news networks
" i worry about him
i 'm concerned about him dropping dead on me because he never stops , " said friend @entity91 , who has known @entity4 since his days as a local businessman
" i talk to his fianc√©e to find out about him , because i ca n't talk to him because he 's so busy
" @entity4 says his energy comes from wanting " to do the right thing
" " @entity96 always told me i had one speed : always wide open , " he said
" i ca n't rest as long as the job still needs to be done
" his outspokenness comes as no surprise to those who know him
before @entity4 became the weary face representing @entity12 's coastal communities , he was already known among friends and constituents as someone who 'd do anything to help others , who 'd open his home to strangers and stray animals alike
like most @entity115 natives , his backstory is tied to the industries that have sustained the region
he grew up in @entity118 , outside of @entity119 , working in his father 's cannery before starting his own business ventures
he was the second of four children and was known as the class clown who could never stay still and often brought home stray animals much to his parents ' chagrin , his sister , @entity123 , said
" @entity4 never sat down for a meal
he probably had [ attention deficit disorder ] , but they did n't diagnose it in those days
our father would tell him to sit in the corner , and he could not stand still , " she said
after high school , he attended @entity140 and @entity141 but did n't graduate , she said
inspired by his father , @entity142 , a local businessman and chairman of the state @entity144 , she said the younger @entity4 made an unsuccessful run for state representative and served on the state levee board in the 1980s
soon after he began working for his father 's business , which had evolved into a catering company for the offshore industry , providing cooks and food on oil rigs
during trips out to check on operations or fill in for someone who called in sick , @entity4 became aware of living conditions on the rig and came up with an idea for his own business : converting old shipping containers into living quarters
general @entity165 proved to be a great success , mostly due to @entity4 's finesse with clients , said @entity170 , a contractor who became a friend of @entity4 's after working with him
" he made it a priority to keep in touch with his clients and to listen to them
if they wanted modifications or a @entity182 , he 'd find a way to do it , " he said
he 's an idea man
he has a million ideas , and he is determined to make them all work
" by the time a @entity188 company offered to buy @entity189 from him for a reported $ 18 million , @entity4 had moved to @entity20 , bought property on a low level of land and turned his sights to raising elk
he acquired more than 100 head in @entity196 and corralled them in an area of his property , but could never bring himself to kill them , @entity170 said
" he treated them all like they were his kids , like puppy dogs , " he said
" i think he sent a few to the butcher , but you can also use their horns for vitamin supplements , so he ended up making a profit by grinding up their horns
" @entity4 lost most of his herd when @entity213 roared through @entity20 in 2005 , carrying some of the elk up to 30 miles from his property , @entity170 said
yet @entity4 eagerly participated in relief efforts , taking his airboat on rescue missions , opening his home to stranded people and abandoned animals , and helping to clear roads
on adjacent property , a riding facility that he built for handicapped children became a staging ground for relief efforts , where volunteers slept and supplies were stored , according to @entity13 , who worked on @entity4 's property coordinating relief efforts
" @entity4 is probably the most compassionate person that i 've dealt with on a regular basis and that compassion has never waned
it stays there all the time , " @entity13 said
" he was eager , at a moment 's notice , to help out
he stepped up , and he never refused anybody that he could assist
he 'd give you the shirt off his back and last dollar in pocket
" @entity4 says he ran for parish president in part because he did n't see the incumbent in the community during the @entity213 clean - up
" i saw absolutely no one standing up for the people of this parish , " he said
" people told me , ' you ought to run and quit complaining
' " since taking office in 2007 , those who know him say he has cemented his reputation as a dedicated champion of the beleaguered community through a long list of accomplishments in a short period of time related to recovery efforts
" i do n't think @entity4 ever really relaxes
i can get him out on the boat or hunting , and he 'll take it easy for a bit , but within 10 minutes , it 's back to the business of @entity20 , " said @entity170
" but he loves it
he takes great joy and pride in contributing to the improvement of the community
" @entity4 says he 'll keeping working hard as long as the oil threatens his parish
" things still need to be done to keep the oil out
... at the end of this thing , i have to know i did everything possible to save the parish and the coast land , " @entity4 said
