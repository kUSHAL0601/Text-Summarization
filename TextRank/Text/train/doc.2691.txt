" embrace the @entity1 ! " said the subject line
uh , no. the @entity2 reported that almost 300 students who had been rejected by @entity4 received a joyous shock over the weekend when the prestigious @entity7 school sent them emails telling them to " embrace the @entity1 ! " they 'd been admitted after all
had n't they ? it did n't take long for joy to turn to sadness when the school followed up with another email on sunday afternoon : " please note that this email was sent in error
the decision posted on the decision site reflects the accurate result of your @entity21 application
the email was the result of " human error , " @entity24 , vice provost for admissions and financial aid at @entity27 , told the @entity2
" we apologize to the students affected and to their families , " @entity24 said
" @entity35 decision days are stressful enough
we very much regret having added to the disappointment felt by a group of very capable and hardworking students , especially ones who were so committed to the idea of attending @entity4 that they applied early decision
" @entity4 is n't the first to make such a mistake
last december , @entity44 sent 2,500 students acceptances , when their status was still unresolved
@entity47 , a parent of a @entity4 hopeful , told the @entity2 she was upset
" you do n't crush somebody 's feelings twice , " she said .
