@entity1 officials are still trying to determine what caused gunmen to attack a satirical magazine in @entity6 , killing 12 people
but , according to @entity1 media , the gunmen yelled , " we have avenged the @entity11 ! " as they stormed the office
@entity12 , the @entity1 satirical magazine attacked on wednesday , has a controversial history of depicting @entity14 , often in an unfavorable light , which has angered many @entity16 around the world
the prohibition again illustrating the @entity14 began as a attempt to ward off idol worship , which was widespread in @entity23 's @entity22 birthplace
but in recent years , that prohibition has taken on a deadly edge
a central tenet of @entity23 is that @entity14 was a man , not @entity26 , and that portraying him could lead to revering him in lieu of @entity28
" it 's all rooted in the notion of idol worship , " @entity29 , who chairs the @entity30 at @entity31 told @entity2
" in @entity23 , the notion of @entity26 versus any depiction of @entity26 or any sacred figure is very strong
" in some ways , @entity23 was a reaction against @entity39 , which early @entity16 believed had been led astray by conceiving of @entity41 , not as a man but as a @entity26
they did n't want the same thing to happen to @entity14
" the prophet himself was aware that if people saw his face portrayed by people , they would soon start worshiping him , " @entity29 told @entity2
" so he himself spoke against such images , saying ' i 'm just a man
' " in a bitter irony , the sometimes violent attacks against portrayals of the prophet are kind of reverse idol - worship , revering -- and killing for -- the absence of an image , said @entity58 , a professor of @entity30 studies at @entity60 in @entity61
in november 2011 , @entity12 's office was burned down on the same day the magazine was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at @entity30 law
the cover cartoon depicted a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of the @entity14 , with a bubble saying , " 100 lashes if you 're not dying of laughter
" in september 2012 , as @entity1 was closing embassies in about 20 countries amid the global furor over the anti-islam film " @entity77 , " the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked @entity14 , along with a cover that seemed to show @entity14 being pushed in a wheelchair by an @entity82
@entity12 journalist @entity83 defended the magazine at the time , saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence
" the aim is to laugh , " @entity83 told @entity87 in 2012
" we want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist
they can be @entity16 , @entity93 , @entity94
everyone can be religious , but extremist thoughts and acts we can not accept
" but for many @entity16 , depictions of @entity14 , revered not only as a prophet but also as a moral exemplar , are no laughing matter
satirical representations of @entity14 are not new , although they are very modern , said @entity58
" in the context of @entity105 , where in many countries @entity16 feel like they are besieged , these images are not seen as criticism , but as bullying
violence , as a response , is clearly wrong and disproportionate
however , it is not so much about religious anger , as it is about vengeance
" but even in the @entity114 , where @entity16 are relatively acclimated , extremists have opposed the portrayal of @entity14 on " @entity116 , " the satirical cartoon show , and the subsequent " @entity119 , " that erupted in response
@entity120 , an imam and former head of @entity122 , told @entity2 that the @entity16 prohibition on depicting prophets extends to @entity125 and @entity126 , whom @entity23 treats as prophets
some @entity16 countries banned the films " @entity130 " and " @entity131 " this year because their leading characters were @entity134 prophets
in @entity139 mosques , the largest branch of the faith , there are no human images of any kind
the spaces are instead decorated with verses from the @entity144
but there have been historical instances of @entity16 depicting the prophet , especially in @entity149 branches of @entity23 , @entity150 , a religious studies professor at @entity152 , told @entity2
" we have had visual depictions of the prophet in the form of miniatures and pictures in the @entity159 context , the @entity160 context , the central @entity161 context , " said @entity150
" the one significant context where depictions of the prophet have not been image - related has been in the @entity166 context
" @entity167 , the imam for @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170 , told @entity2 that depictions of the prophet 's teachings were sometimes used to bridge gaps in illiteracy
even historical renditions of @entity14 by @entity16 artists were careful not to paint the prophet in too much detail
for example , @entity29 told @entity2 that @entity16 artists in the 15th and 16th centuries would depict the prophet but took pains to avoid drawing his face
" it would be as if he was wearing a veil on his face , so the really orthodox could not object -- that was the solution they found
" in a @entity16 film called " @entity189 , " which circulated throughout the @entity16 world in the 1970s and 1980s , @entity14 was shown only in shadow
in the quran , there is " no statement from the prophet requesting his image not be recorded , " @entity167 told @entity2
instead , the teaching about images comes from the hadith , a record of the sayings and actions of the @entity14 and his closest companions
the hadith is considered secondary only to the @entity144 in terms of textual authority , but the sometimes contradictory accounts have led to centuries of debates within the umma , or global @entity16 community
scholars of religion say opposition to portraying @entity14 was n't generally violated in earlier centuries because of a gulf between @entity216 and majority - @entity16 nations
in the age of globalization , non-muslims and critics of @entity23 have felt free to depict @entity14 , including in offensive ways
in 2006 , for example , a @entity224 cartoonist 's depiction of the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse sparked demonstrations across the world
@entity2 's @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .
