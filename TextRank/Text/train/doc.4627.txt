two @entity2 doctors face murder charges related to abortions performed on late - term fetuses that were viable , authorities said friday
@entity8 and @entity9 are in jails in @entity11 and @entity12 , respectively , awaiting extradition hearings to bring them back to @entity2 , police in @entity7 , @entity2 , said in a news release
the two face identical charges -- five counts each of first - degree murder , five of second - degree murder and one of conspiracy to commit first - degree murder
the cases did not fall into the exceptions for aborted fetuses under @entity2 law , @entity27 , the deputy state 's attorney for @entity28 , told @entity29
defense attorney @entity30 told @entity29 by e-mail that @entity33 " has fully cooperated with this investigation " and has not " violated any @entity2 laws
" another lawyer for @entity33 , @entity36 , declined to comment
@entity37 , an attorney at a @entity39 - based law firm that is representing @entity40 , said , " we believe that the criminal charges are without merit , ( and ) we believe it is inappropriate for ( @entity40 ) to be held without bond
" the investigation began august 13 , 2010 , when @entity40 brought a woman into an @entity7 hospital due to a " complication resulting from a medical procedure , " police said
the woman had driven from @entity11 to @entity2 for an abortion , investigators later determined
days later , @entity7 police searched the abortion clinic where @entity33 and @entity40 work and found several fetuses " in a freezer chest
" the fetuses were taken to a medical examiner 's office in @entity39 , according to the news release
the indictment warrant was issued wednesday , following an investigation
@entity65 , @entity11 , police took @entity33 into custody " without incident " later that night
the 55 - year - old doctor has since been held at the @entity70 jail
@entity40 , 46 , was also detained without incident wednesday evening by the @entity72 in @entity12
she is being held at the @entity75 jail , ahead of an anticipated extradition hearing , @entity7 police said
@entity27 , who is the chief homicide prosecutor for @entity28 , said more details on the case will not be released until tuesday .
