-- editor 's note : @entity3 writes about mobile tech for @entity0
she is a @entity5 writer and media consultant whose blog , @entity8 , explores how people communicate in the online age
as @entity12 and other wireless providers move away from offering unlimited data plans , many smartphone owners want to better understand their own wireless data usage to avoid racking up surprise charges
while you can log on to your wireless carrier account to check how much data you 've used so far during the current billing period , you often ca n't tell how much data each type of mobile activity consumes
recently in @entity24 , @entity25 of @entity26 ( a wireless market research and analysis firm ) offered a table of smartphone data usage by mobile activity
she estimates that if you generally send or receive 20 e-mails on your smartphone daily ( no attachments ) , that 's probably about 0.01 gb of data usage over the course of one month
bumping that up to about 70 no - attachment e-mails sent or received daily uses about 0.04 gb per month
viewing an average of 20 web pages on your smartphone per a day would consume about 0.11 gb in a month , according to @entity25
watching 20 minutes of mobile video per day uses about 1.14 gb per month
an hour of streaming mobile music per day uses about 0.86 gb per month
@entity25 's benchmarks can help you plan a mobile " diet " that wo n't bust your budget
she based these estimates on data from @entity12 smartphone users , and not all smartphones and carrier networks are created equally
but it helps to know which mobile activities generally are more data - heavy , so you know what to cut back on to keep your wireless bill under control
what 's a " normal " level of mobile data usage ? according to @entity25 , an average residential ( non-business ) smartphone user consumes about this much data per day : fewer than 10 e-mails sent / received ( no attachments ) = 2.5 mb 1 e-mail with photo attachment = 10 mb 3 e-mails sent / received ( with other attachment ) = 12 mb 5 minutes of streaming music per day ( about 2.5 hours per month ) = 72 mb 5 web pages visited = 25 mb 0 - 1 applications downloaded ( games / songs ) = 60 mb 10 social media posts per day = 14 mb 1 minute of streaming video per day ( about 30 minutes per month ) = 60 mb over the course of a month , that adds up to @entity84 ( about a quarter of a gigabyte ) on average -- but that 's just for mobile content
mobile access to data also entails considerable overhead , and consumers pay for that , too
the smallest of @entity12 's new data plans gives mobile users @entity95 of data per month for $ 15
the " @entity98 " plan gives people 2 gigabytes of data -- about 10 times more -- for $ 25 per month
" signaling traffic " is how smartphones keep in touch with wireless data networks and move between cells
@entity25 explains that the growing problem of wireless network congestion comes mostly from smartphones constantly querying the network as they move among cell sites
this means that you 're racking up some data usage anytime your smartphone is on
according to @entity25 , " while data traffic is also growing , signaling traffic is outpacing actual mobile data traffic by 30 percent to 50 percent , if not more
" there 's not much that consumers can do to control the amount of signaling traffic from their smartphones -- aside from simply turning your phone off or operating it in " airplane mode " when you do n't need online access or incoming calls
however , mobile content usage is something that you can control .
