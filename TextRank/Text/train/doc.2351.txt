when @entity2 sens. @entity1 and @entity3 fly back from @entity4 to the @entity2 on wednesday , they will carry the regret of not being able to take with them @entity7 , a @entity2 government subcontractor serving a 15 - year prison sentence on the island
" @entity7 wants to come home , " @entity1 , an @entity12 @entity11 , said at a news conference after a two - hour meeting with the imprisoned @entity2 on tuesday
the two senators , who are critics of the @entity2 trade embargo on @entity4 , said they had come to @entity4 to again push for @entity7 ' release
they said his imprisonment is an impediment to improved @entity2 - @entity4 relations
" other people have tried to come and meet with him and not been able to , " said @entity3 , a @entity24 @entity23
" that 's an optimistic thing
" last week , @entity28 was the first to report that @entity7 was refusing to meet with @entity2 diplomats in @entity30 , in protest over the slow progress to free him
detained @entity2 @entity7 ' withdrawn ' @entity7 ' attorney @entity34 said his client told him he would be happy to see @entity2 officials " at the airport , when he leaves @entity4 , assuming he 's alive
" @entity1 and @entity3 said they also met tuesday with @entity4 foreign minister @entity41
the @entity4 government has called for a prisoner swap : gross for three imprisoned @entity4 intelligence agents serving lengthy federal prison sentences in the @entity2
but the @entity46 has nixed the idea of a swap , saying @entity7 was an aid worker merely trying to help @entity4 's small @entity50 community get online despite @entity4 government restrictions on internet access
frustrated by the diplomatic impasse , @entity7 has threatened to kill himself if he is n't freed soon
" i do feel we are closer , " @entity1 said
" one , because of what @entity7 has said himself
this is going to end one way or another
we have gone on five years and any benefit the @entity4 government may have seen has to have evaporated
" @entity7 was arrested in 2009 for smuggling in banned communications equipment to @entity4
he was convicted of violating the island 's sovereignty and sentenced to 15 years in prison
@entity4 authorities say he was part of a larger program by the @entity66 to undermine the island 's single - party communist form of government
in 2014 , @entity66 had to defend programs to create a text messaging " @entity78 " program to stir dissent and another program to recruit future leaders on the island
on monday , the @entity79 reported that the agency would soon cease all covert programs in @entity4
" there 's been a statement that there wont be covert programs run out of @entity86 anymore and that 's a good thing , " @entity1 said
" its not just a source of tension between the countries , it puts @entity2 in danger and really cheapens @entity86 's mission around the world
