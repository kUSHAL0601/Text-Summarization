-- it was tuesday afternoon when i found a trending article through @entity4 that seemed to explain why i 'm not reaching my full potential for joy
and mind you , it had nothing to do with @entity10 not returning my calls
because that would be a very strange article for somebody to write
sad man waits by phone ; needs shower
the article that was actually trending came from @entity21 , and the premise was that morning people are generally happier than night people
@entity29 , as a small victory for us night owls , i would argue that morning people still have to , you know , wake up earlier
the article cites a study published in the june issue of the journal @entity35 , which is not to be confused with the journal @entity37 that recently sent shock waves through the tech world when it revealed that chronic overuse of smiley faces may cause dysentery
we 're all going to die
( apparently on the @entity44
) the research presented in @entity35 reveals that only 7 % of young adults describe themselves as being morning larks
conversely , by age 60 most people have lost their affinity for staying up late
basically , it 's @entity52 and then to bed
but the common thread among both the older and younger subjects was that , regardless of age , morning people responded as being happier
and night people responded as having seen every single episode ever of " @entity59
" advantage : night people
the most interesting finding , however , is that just being awake early and seeing the morning sun is n't what actually makes people happy
even my dog knows that if you get out of bed before , say , noon you 're going to have a bad time
and this is a dog who spends the bulk of his waking hours blissfully licking his crotch
study researcher @entity75 , a graduate student at the @entity76 , said one of the reasons morning people may be happier is because they tend not to suffer from social jet lag
@entity75 said , " @entity81 's expectations are far more organized around a morning - type person 's schedule
" apparently society 's expectations do n't include midnight ping pong
the article suggests hacking your sleep schedule , and @entity75 said , " one way to do it is to increase your natural light exposure early in the morning
" sadly , the light from my @entity92 does n't count
at least not when i play @entity94 in bed
i did , however , find an app called @entity97 and tested it out on my co-worker
" do you feel happier ? " " no. " " what about now ? " " no. " " what about now ? " " do n't you ever do work ? " " no. what about now ? " so that was 99 cents i 'll never see again
still , i was determined to find something that could provide natural light without actually having to get up and face the outside world and / or put on pants
as always , when times are tough , i turned to @entity111
and that 's where i found the @entity114
for $ 189.95 this device delivers " the optimal 10,000 lux of therapeutic light to counteract the effects of fatigue , jet lag , and @entity121
" i have no idea what a lux is , but i 've always said 10,000 is the optimal number
so , this was promising
perhaps i had finally found my savior
( current savior : @entity132 bars
) unfortunately , to reap the benefits of the @entity114 , you have to spend 30 minutes with your face in front of a blinding , bright light
that , they say , will " block the release of melatonin
" but besides just being kind of weird , it requires , even at a minimum , sitting upright in bed
and that requires not sleeping
so , for now i guess i 'm just going to stay a miserable night owl
at least until @entity10 texts me back
hey , @entity146 ! how bout some ping pong ? :-) uh oh
here comes the dysentery .
