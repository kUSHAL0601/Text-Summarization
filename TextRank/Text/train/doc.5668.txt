-- it 's arguably one of the largest pieces of @entity4 memorabilia ever : a 154.5 - acre ranch in @entity6 , @entity7 , once owned by @entity8
@entity4 bought the property in february 1967 , three months before marrying @entity10
and it 's on the market , with an asking price of $ 6.5 million
" it had a large cross there that @entity4 really liked , and a concrete bridge over a 14 - acre lake , " real estate agent @entity14 told @entity0
the property , called the " @entity21 " by locals , is just east of @entity22 in @entity6 , about 17 miles south of @entity23
@entity4 purchased it in february 1967 , three months before he married @entity10 , according to a @entity26 spokeswoman
the deed on record was signed by @entity4 's longtime manager , col. @entity29 , said @entity30 , @entity32 tax assessor
there is a small house known as the " @entity35 " on the property
@entity26 confirmed the newly married @entity37 did spend time there following their honeymoon in @entity41 , @entity42
the property has been on the market since last month
its current owners are @entity46 and his brothers
@entity46 said his parents bought the property in 1979 and turned it into a cattle ranch after previous owner - developers had failed to turn it into a resort
@entity46 said he met @entity10 on a winter day in 1985
" i got a call one day that @entity10 was coming up for a visit , " he said
" i 'd been working on a cow 's ear and was covered in blood when she came up
she told me @entity4 would have been proud this was a working cattle ranch
" tours occasionally have driven down from @entity23 with passengers who took pictures of the pastures , he said
at one time , there was a 12 - foot wooden fence around the compound with a half - dozen trailers on the grounds , where members of @entity4 's entourage , the " @entity73 " were housed
" there 's still a trailer pad behind the @entity35 , " @entity46 said
" i remember as a child when @entity4 owned it , " said @entity76 , planning director for the city of @entity6
" i had a friend he gave a horse to
she lived across the street to the ranch and woke up one day and they had a pony
" she said she remembers seeing @entity4 riding a horse along the highway
he was a quiet owner , she said , and the ranch is prime real estate
" i 've been getting a lot of calls from media , " @entity14 said , " and the @entity94 are really interested
" however , he said , he does n't have a serious buyer on the hook and has yet to receive an offer .
