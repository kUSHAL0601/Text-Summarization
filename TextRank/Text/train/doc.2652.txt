-- @entity1 preferred the orange light
no wait , the green light
oh , and the red too
" i loved all of them ! " the 6 - year - old says enthusiastically
choosing a custom color for her hospital room was one of @entity14 's favorite perks at @entity15 , the new 60 - acre health campus outside @entity17
her mom , @entity18 , adds that her daughter preferred the purple light at night
@entity14 also made full use of the 10,000 - square - foot garden terrace on the fourth floor
she was admitted with a mystery illness , having suffered through six weeks of debilitating headaches that left her sleeping 18 hours a day
by day three of her six - day stay at @entity15 , the physicians had it figured out : encephalitis , or swelling of the brain
by day four , she was racing her older brother around the terrace 's 40 - year - old , 6,000 - pound live oak

it 's a hospital that believes nature -- and its healing properties -- is as valuable as any iv or pill
" @entity15 in a garden " is how chief medical officer dr. @entity55 describes @entity15 , which opened october 22 , 2012
it 's a concept underscored by the many nature - centric touches
the floor - to - above - ceiling windows flood the rooms and public spaces with natural light , not dull fluorescence
the two rooftop terraces feature obstacle courses and walking paths
the one - acre discovery garden is built around the senses : fragrant flowers bloom in the section dedicated to smell ; a few steps away , the ears are engaged by xylophone benches and percussive art. it 's all part of a budding trend in medical care , one that believes nature can speed up the healing process , particularly with children , where the stress of hospital stays can be much greater
( @entity15 eliminates stress wherever it can
@entity55 points out that the hospital room ceilings are matte , not metallic or glossy like most medical facilities
" when the children are in bed , they do n't like to look at themselves attached to tubes and machines , " he notes
) parenting.com : 15 kid and toddler superfoods this " it 's what 's outside that counts " philosophy first gained attention in 1984 with @entity104 's pioneering " window view " study
surgery patients at a @entity108 hospital were assigned to two types of rooms : one had a window facing a brick wall ; the other faced a tree - filled landscape
the study found that the patients with the verdant view healed a day faster , needed less pain medication , and had fewer postsurgical complications
more recently , a 2005 study conducted at a @entity123 hospital focused on the effect sunlight has on patients recovering from surgery
those who had bright , naturally lit rooms experienced less stress , less pain , and required less medication than those in dimly lit rooms
@entity15 is n't the only new children 's hospital prescribing sunshine and serenity
the @entity138 and @entity137 of @entity139 recently launched a study to understand the effect healing spaces have on kids
the study 's laboratory is the hospital 's own @entity145 , a 5,000 - square - foot respite 11 floors above @entity149
it 's a soaring greenhouse flanked by skyscrapers , and outfitted with bamboo trees , carved wooden benches and an interactive light wall
parenting.com : must know winter safety tips " the day after @entity160 's opened , i visited the @entity145 at about 7 o'clock in the evening , " says @entity157 , chief of new hospital design and construction
" i saw a family seated on the wooden benches near the windows -- a patient , a mother , and a father huddled around a jigsaw puzzle and their dinner
it looked just like a beautiful family setting in a park
" but healing spaces are not standard issue at modern hospitals
in fact , some are in danger of being eliminated
earlier this year , a movement began to save the beloved @entity180 at @entity181 , which may become a casualty of the facility 's expansion
a petition was created on @entity186 ; there are currently more than 4,200 signatures
" the relief it gives to our long - term patients is a godsend , " writes one supporter , a 22 - year volunteer at the hospital
" i have witnessed the comfort and solace it has given so many families
" " all the amenities at @entity15 are as much for the parents as they are the children , " says @entity55 as a yellow tang fish swims past his head
the saltwater tank on the ground floor is provided and maintained by @entity206
( being near @entity17 has its perks
) last week , the young patients staying at @entity15 woke up to a curious sight : elves dangling outside their windows
the window washing crew donned pointed hats , green tunics , and red and green argyle socks as they worked their squeegees
sure , they brought a dose of holiday cheer , but more importantly , they 're making sure the sun gets in
