-- as @entity3 's relations with the western world seem to be thawing following a historic @entity6 agreement over its nuclear production , sport is also doing its part to bring @entity9 in from the cold
@entity11 , the world 's most successful soccer club in terms of trophies won , sent a team stacked full of its former stars to take part in a charity match against counterparts from @entity20
thursday 's game , watched by 65,000 fans in @entity20 ' @entity23 , was won 3 - 1 by the seven - time @entity25 champion
but as @entity3 's nuclear deal will help lift some of the economic sanctions that have hurt its growth , this exhibition has bigger meaning for @entity20 and the development of @entity3 football
it is part of a collaboration that began at the end of last year when @entity20 president @entity37 visited @entity38 to meet with @entity11 chief executive and @entity41 @entity40
@entity11 's website reports that the " @entity11 " ( " black and reds " ) will be sharing knowledge of the club 's successful youth academy with @entity20 -- which is @entity3 's most successful team and one of the most popular in @entity47
" @entity37 expressed his admiration for the way that the club and its proprietor made @entity11 the most decorated in the world , " the website said
" the desire to create and develop a form of collaboration between the two clubs came naturally
" collaboration is already underway that will see the @entity61 help to export and replicate the @entity62 with @entity20 , which celebrates its 50 - year anniversary this year
" legendary defender @entity64 headed a star - studded @entity11 lineup at the 100,000 - capacity @entity23 for a match that marked the last @entity20 appearance for former @entity3 captain @entity70
@entity70 , 36 , retired this year following a distinguished career in which he appeared at two @entity72 -- representing his country 111 times in all -- and spent eight seasons with @entity78 club @entity76
the @entity11 team also included another of @entity38 's defensive greats , @entity82 , and his fellow @entity84 winner @entity83
its goals came from @entity86 -- part of @entity38 's @entity89 - winning squad -- @entity90 and @entity91 , while @entity92 scored for @entity20
" thank you to @ acmilan glorie for coming to @entity3 and putting a smile on the @entity3 @entity11 fans : ) " one supporter wrote on @entity97 .
