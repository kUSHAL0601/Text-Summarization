-- @entity2 @entity1 announced greater political participation for women in the conservative kingdom this week , but tuesday , a human rights group decried the promised reforms in light of a flogging sentence for a woman who dared to drive a car
@entity12 said a @entity2 woman was sentenced to 10 lashes for getting behind the wheel
the group said the harsh sentence demonstrated the scale of discrimination against women in the @entity22 nation , and it urged the dismantling of the " whole system of women 's subordination
" " @entity30 is a cruel punishment in all circumstances , but it beggars belief that the authorities in @entity2 have imposed lashes on a woman apparently for merely driving a car , " said @entity26 , @entity12 's @entity27 and @entity29 deputy director
" belatedly allowing women to vote in council elections is all well and good , but if they are still going to face being flogged for trying to exercise their right to freedom of movement , then the @entity1 's much - trumpeted ' reforms ' actually amount to very little
" @entity12 said a court in @entity45 handed down the sentence tuesday
two other women are believed to be facing charges for driving , one in @entity45 and one in @entity51
the @entity53 campaign said the woman who was sentenced to 10 lashes has appealed the sentence
she said she did not want to be identified or speak publicly about her case for her own safety
@entity53 also said police pulled over women 's rights activist @entity59 for driving in @entity61 on tuesday
she was taken to police headquarters for questioning and released after she signed a pledge not to drive and called for a taxi home , a statement from @entity53 said
" after the euphoria of the announcement on voting , we are saddened and shocked to hear the news today , " said @entity67 , a member of @entity53
no specific traffic laws make it illegal for women to drive in @entity2 , but religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers
such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts , obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian
authorities stopped @entity87 , 32 , for driving a car may 21 and detained her the next day
she said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again and spent a week in jail
her case became a rallying cry for female activists
the @entity53 campaign on @entity95 and @entity96 encouraged women to drive as part of their normal daily activities rather than converge in one place
on sunday , @entity1 announced two changes for women , which would be historic for @entity2
he said women will be allowed to serve as members of the @entity105 , the appointed consultative council that advises the king
he also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections
it is unknown when those may ultimately take place
the changes do not apply to elections scheduled for thursday , which will be only the second set of elections in the kingdom since 1963
the @entity121 's human rights report on @entity2 , published in 2011 , noted many challenges facing women in @entity2 in 2010 : -- " by law a female rape victim is at fault for illegal ' mixing of genders ' and is punished along with the perpetrator
" -- " the guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her ' guardian ' with the authority to approve her travel
" -- " women risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative
" -- " women also faced discrimination in courts , where the testimony of one man equals that of two women
" -- " the law requires a woman to obtain the permission of a male guardian to work if the type of business is not ' deemed appropriate for a woman
' " @entity0 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .
