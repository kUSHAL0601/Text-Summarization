@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 secretary of defense @entity3 arrived in @entity1 on monday morning on an unannounced visit , as @entity7 - led coalition forces are pressing an offensive in the nation 's south
@entity3 was scheduled to meet with @entity1 president @entity11 and gen. @entity12 , the @entity4 commander in @entity1
coalition forces are battling @entity14 fighters around the town of @entity16 in southern @entity18 province
@entity19 , the offensive was launched in february by an international coalition of 15,000 troops , including @entity1 , @entity4 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26
@entity3 told reporters that he was going to @entity1 to " get an update on the campaign , not only in @entity16 but the next steps as we look to spring , summer and fall
" long a bastion of @entity35 sentiment and awash with the opium used to fund the insurgency , the @entity16 region has been known as the heroin breadbasket of @entity1 and as a place where the @entity14 had set up a shadow government
the hope now is for the @entity4 to persuade the locals to change their crops from poppies -- grown to produce opium for the @entity14 's drug trade -- and instead grow crops such as wheat , which can help them survive and provide income as well
@entity11 visited @entity16 on sunday with @entity12 to see what gains have been made in the military offensive
@entity3 arrived in @entity1 on the same day that @entity54 president @entity53 was supposed to have visited
@entity54 state - run media reported monday that @entity53 's trip had been postponed until mid-march
" @entity54 is playing a double game in @entity1 , " @entity3 told reporters on the flight to @entity1
" they want to maintain a good relationship with the @entity1 government
they also want to do everything they possibly can to hurt us , or for us not to be successful
" @entity3 said the @entity70 government " will help the @entity14 , whether they are providing money " or " some low level of support
" the @entity4 and its @entity72 allies are making a strong pitch to members of the @entity75 for new sanctions that they say will be " smart and effective " as @entity54 moves forward with its nuclear program
those proposed new sanctions reportedly would target @entity54 's banking , shipping and insurance sectors
but it 's unclear whether @entity83 , a veto - wielding member of the @entity75 , will support the proposals
the @entity4 and other nations think @entity54 has undertaken a program to build nuclear weapons , an assertion @entity54 denies , saying the goal of the program is to produce domestic power .
