-- roughly 700 students at the @entity3 , @entity3 , will be given a powerful antibiotic to guard against meningitis after coming in contact with four people diagnosed with meningococcal disease , county health officials said tuesday
the news came as the @entity10 confirmed a fourth student at the university has been diagnosed with meningococcal disease
the four students all became sick with meningococcal disease , which can cause meningitis or blood infections , during a three - week period in november
one of them has become permanently disabled , the @entity18 said
the second and third students who fell ill recovered and are back in classes , @entity3 spokesman @entity20 said
the fourth is expected to recover , he said , but the first is still hospitalized
the first three cases were confirmed to be caused by type b bacteria , which is the same bacteria strain causing an outbreak of meningitis at @entity29
testing is not complete on the most recent case , county health spokeswoman @entity30 said in an e-mail
meningitis is a form of meningococcal disease , but not all four cases at @entity3 are meningitis , @entity34 said
although the @entity40 recommends that college freshmen living in dorms receive a meningitis vaccine , the vaccine approved for use in the @entity45 does not protect against the kind caused by type b bacteria
@entity3 is sending a letter to its fraternities and sororities , most of which are based off campus , asking them to refrain from large social gatherings where cups might be exchanged , @entity20 said
" we 're almost certain that they 'll go along with that as we head into the holiday period here , " he said
more than 500 students at @entity3 who were identified as close contacts of these students have received preventive antibiotics , county health officials said
this week , additional individuals who may have been exposed to the bacteria causing the meningococcal disease are being directed to take antibiotics
the school has been consulting with the county health department and the @entity40 about the outbreak , @entity20 said
on the opposite @entity45 coast , @entity29 announced last week that it would make an unlicensed vaccine for meningitis b available to undergraduate students , as well as graduate students living in dorms or the @entity77 and annexes , and other university community members with particular medical conditions
the vaccine , @entity82 , made by @entity83 , is approved in @entity84 and @entity85 but not the @entity45
the @entity40 's @entity86 approved the importation of @entity82 specifically for the @entity29 situation
" the @entity40 is the lead on the vaccine issue , " @entity34 said tuesday
what is meningitis b ? meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord , known as the meninges
infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation , according to the @entity40
meningitis usually develops in response to bacteria or viruses , but there can be other forms and causes , such as physical injury , cancer or certain drugs , according to the @entity40
the bacterial form is rare in the @entity45 , and the @entity115 bacterial strains are even more rare
meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing , coughing , sharing drinks and living in close quarters , such as in dormitories , according to health officials
symptoms can include a stiff neck , headache , fever , vomiting , rashes , sensitivity to light and confusion
untreated , the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment , brain damage , limb amputations and death
antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis " should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15 % , although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly , " according to the @entity40
in 2012 , there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the @entity45 , according to the @entity40
of those , 160 were group @entity149 @entity0 's @entity150 contributed to this report .
