-- two hours before his scheduled execution thursday , the @entity3 commuted the death sentence of @entity6 , his lawyer said
@entity6 's death sentence was changed to life in prison by @entity11 authorities , his attorney says
@entity6 was convicted in 1988 of murdering @entity12 , the retail manager at @entity13 in @entity14
@entity6 admitted to the crime
the board 's ruling means @entity6 's sentence will be changed to life without the possibility of parole
the board did not give a reason for its decision
when attorney @entity26 called @entity6 with the news , he was quiet
" he was really shocked and relieved but very somber about it
he takes very seriously the deep harm that he caused when he committed this crime , " she said
@entity6 had a cocaine habit that his attorney says he kicked in prison
he spent his time behind bars counseling other inmates , teaching some of them to read and writing to people outside of prison who had drug habits
" he did n't want them to go down the path he did , " @entity42 said
as for the @entity12 family , they are devastated
the @entity47 reported that @entity12 's widow , @entity49 , and his daughter , @entity50 , were too upset to address the parole board
a representative spoke to the board on their behalf , the newspaper said
@entity6 had been scheduled to be executed by injection at 7 p.m. et thursday at @entity57 in @entity58 , 45 minutes south of @entity59
he would have been the 19th inmate in @entity11 executed by injection
@entity60 was executed by injection the first week in may
he was the first inmate to die in the state since september , when the @entity64 @entity63 agreed to consider whether the three - drug combination represented cruel and unusual punishment
@entity60 was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend in 1988
the @entity64 @entity63 had effectively halted all executions in the country last september , when it agreed to consider whether the three - drug combination used by most states violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment
death penalty opponents have argued that if inmates are not given enough anesthetic , they could be conscious enough to suffer excruciating pain without being able to express it because of the paralyzer
their claims are supported by medical studies
of the 24 death sentences the @entity11 board has considered , @entity6 's is the third it has commuted
also this week , @entity84 executed murderer @entity85 by lethal injection
@entity85 confessed to abducting @entity87 in 1987 , beating her to death and then dumping her body in a rural road
the courts rejected @entity85 's attorneys ' arguments that he should be spared because he was mentally retarded
@entity0 's @entity94 contributed to this report .
