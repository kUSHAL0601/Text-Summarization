-- after nearly seven weeks on the run , suspected cop killer @entity3 is in custody , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity1 said thursday
according to a local government official briefed on the matter , @entity3 was caught at an abandoned airport between @entity9 and @entity10
he was reportedly taken into custody without incident
a @entity14 's service special operations team tracked @entity3 to the abandoned airport while it was in process of clearing the area , according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the capture
its work , that source said , was also aided by intelligence and eyewitness accounts gathered throughout the course of the manhunt
@entity3 was armed with two guns when he was arrested , according to another law enforcement source
one was a pistol and the other a rifle , the source said
a separate law enforcement official told @entity0 that knives were recovered from @entity3 's hiding place , and that authorities are currently searching the area for more weapons
@entity3 , 31 , is suspected in the september 12 ambush shooting that left cpl. @entity41 dead and trooper @entity42 wounded outside the @entity2 barracks in @entity44
" let me assure everybody here ... justice will be served , " @entity46 gov. @entity45 said thursday night at a news conference about @entity3 's capture
prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty for @entity3 , @entity53 district attorney @entity52 told reporters
the suspect is now sitting in a cell at the same barracks outside which the two officers were ambushed , authorities said
he was cuffed with cpl. @entity41 's handcuffs , officials said
the search the weeks - long search yielded a mishmash of purported personal effects
police have said they found an empty pack of @entity73 cigarettes
@entity3 claims to have fought with @entity73 in @entity74 and has studied @entity76 and @entity73 languages , according to the @entity77 , which named him one of its @entity79 fugitives
two fully functional pipe bombs and soiled adult diapers were also found , perhaps used by @entity3 to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time
police have not spoken about a possible motive for the crime , other than that @entity3 has talked and written about hating law enforcement
authorities have said a review of a computer hard drive used by @entity3 shows that he had planned the attack for years
the manhunt involved as many as 1,000 officers at times , some from other states
the search for the self - styled survivalist cost at least several million dollars
@entity3 's capture took so long because he hid in a wooded area that took a long time to search , said state police commissioner @entity102
community on edge the hunt for @entity3 turned life upside down for people inside the search area
helicopters buzzed overhead and police seemed to be everywhere , all the time
" every night , every day , but mostly at night , the helicopters would be flying over our house , waking us up at 1 o'clock in the morning , " said @entity111 , in @entity112 , @entity46 , before @entity3 was caught
the fugitive was reportedly spotted in a wooded area in the town of @entity112 , about 8 miles southeast of the @entity120 area , where his family has a home
" it 's kind of scary -- a little bit nerve - wracking -- because we live so close to it , " said @entity123 , who rode the bus to school with @entity3 when they were children
she remembered him as quiet , but not " weird , " and definitely not the type of person you 'd expect to kill a cop
" you hear of stuff like this , but you never know the person , or it 's like hours from you
you know , it 's on the news but it 's not ever close to home
so it 's a little bit scary , " said @entity123
@entity0 's @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .
