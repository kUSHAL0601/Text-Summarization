-- the human rights group @entity1 is calling on the @entity2 to impose an arms embargo on @entity4 and the @entity5 , saying both sides used weapons supplied from abroad to carry out attacks on civilians during their three - week conflict in @entity11
@entity5 children make coffee behind a bullet and rocket riddled wall in @entity17 , @entity11 , on january 24 , 2009
the @entity19 - based group issued a 38 - page report sunday night that detailed " evidence of war crimes and other serious violations of international law by all parties
" @entity4 forces used white phosphorus and other weapons supplied by the @entity29 , killing hundreds of civilians and destroying homes , the group said
the use of white phosphorus is restricted under international law
in the early days of the @entity11 conflict , the @entity35 denied using the ordnance
but later , @entity4 officials said only that any shells fired in @entity11 were " in accordance with international law
" @entity1 said its researchers found munitions fragments littering school playgrounds , hospitals and homes after the 22 - day fighting in @entity11 ended in january
many of the munitions used by the @entity4 army were @entity29 - made , and included bombs , white phosphorus remains and missiles seemingly launched from unmanned drones , @entity1 said
" to a large extent , @entity4 's military offensive in @entity11 was carried out with weapons , munitions and military equipment supplied by the @entity29 and paid for with @entity29 taxpayers ' money , " @entity55 , @entity1 's @entity56 director , said in the report
he called on the @entity29 to immediately suspend military aid to @entity4
the @entity29 is to provide $ 30 billion in military aid to @entity4 under a 10 - year agreement that runs till 2017 -- a 25 - percent increase compared with the period preceding the @entity70 administration , @entity1 said
the group also took to task @entity72 , the @entity74 militant group that has ruled @entity11 since 2007
it said it found remains of @entity77 and grad rockets fired by @entity5 armed groups in civilian areas
grad rockets have a longer range than the crude , home - made qassams
@entity4 said @entity5 militants have fired about 10,000 rockets and mortars into @entity4 in the past eight years
" these unsophisticated weapons are either smuggled into @entity11 clandestinely or constructed there from components secretly brought in from abroad , " @entity1 said
@entity4 's foreign ministry responded harshly to the report , calling it biased and " dedicated almost exclusively to the censure of @entity4
" the ministry said the report does not mention @entity72 ' " deliberate use " of civilians as human shields
it also said @entity4 's use of weapons complied with international law and denied that its forces targeted civilians
" the comparison of the supply of weapons to @entity4 and the @entity72 in inappropriate , " the ministry said in a statement
" @entity4 is a sovereign nation that is obligated to use force to protect its citizens , while @entity72 is a terror organization
" @entity4 launched the attack on @entity72 in @entity11 on december 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern @entity4
more than 1,300 @entity5 died and about 5,400 others were wounded
thirteen israelis , including 10 soldiers , were killed in the fighting
since the two sides declared a cease - fire on january 21 , militants have sporadically fired rockets into @entity4
@entity4 has responded with airstrikes .
