@entity2 , @entity3 on a recent morning , @entity0 and other family members walked into the @entity5 in search of answers
they had come to see official video footage of a police shooting that took place more than a year ago
@entity13 , 74 , was killed last december after he rushed an officer while wielding a hatchet , police have said
video of the incident , captured by an officer 's lapel camera , proved the shooting was justified , officials have argued
a grand jury heard the case , saw the footage and decided not to issue an indictment
but for more than a year , @entity0 's younger brother , @entity26 , 69 , said he and others have been asking to see the tape for themselves
and what they saw on december 19 only seemed to raise more questions , leaving them to feel the shooting was more senseless than ever
with police shootings making headlines across the nation , the @entity2 case adds a different layer to the conversation -- not least of all because of the city 's historic civil rights significance
@entity4 saw the video , which runs four minutes and 48 seconds , after the family did
it shows a patrol officer pulling up to an abandoned building , where two other officers have already gathered
one officer ducks inside the building and soon @entity13 emerges , holding an ax and cussing
an officer follows , there are at least 20 shouts to " drop the ax , " and then @entity0 turns toward the officer , appears to lunge toward him , and -- bang -- he 's dead
officers had been called to respond to a disturbance at a @entity58 restaurant , but found @entity0 across the street in the long - gone @entity60
@entity0 said his brother , once a mechanic , had " lost himself " after his wife left him decades ago and his house burned in a fire
he said @entity2 police knew his brother " acted crazy , " and walked the streets but that he never harmed anyone
and he just ca n't understand why they had to follow him
" he 'd left @entity58 , and was n't shot for disturbing the peace , but because they were messing with him in his domain
" @entity0 said requests to see the video only gained traction after a small band of protesters took to the streets
it was the @entity80 , @entity81 , protests that inspired longtime activist @entity83 to lead the charge for the @entity0 family in @entity2 , though the circumstances are vastly different from @entity80
@entity2 , which is more than 80 % @entity87 , has a black mayor , a black police chief , a black district attorney and a majority black city council
so was the officer who shot him
but for @entity83 , the problem in @entity2 goes far beyond this one case
@entity2 once shocked the national consciousness when police beat and tear - gassed 600 civil rights marchers as they crossed the @entity97 on their way to @entity99
the day became known as @entity100 and led the way to the @entity102
a movie depiction of the @entity2 story will release nationwide on january 9
@entity2 , said @entity83 , has come a long way since then , but black people are not yet free of injustices
she has led the charge in recent weeks , marching from @entity2 's famed @entity97 while yelling , " hands up ! do n't shoot ! " and " i ca n't breathe ! " -- in reference to the deaths of @entity113 in @entity80 and @entity114 in @entity115
added to the mix in @entity2 has been this chorus : " show the tape ! " police chief @entity119 said he takes no issue with protests tied to the tensions roiling through the country
what happened in @entity80 and @entity115 bothers him , too
" we have things going on in policing that are n't right , " he said
if people want to scream outside his department , " i ca n't breathe , " he 's all for it
but what riles him is how what happened in @entity2 is being lumped with these cases
" it 's wrong and disingenuous , " he said
" we 're no @entity80 , " and pretending @entity2 is , he said , " hurts the message
" @entity138 said it was her husband , @entity142 sen. @entity140 , who was responsible for $ 30,000 in funding for the city of @entity2 to buy lapel cameras for the police force
she has called for a public release of the video showing the shooting of @entity13 , calling it a " matter of transparency
" " they let @entity4 see [ the tape ] before me
i need to see the tape , as an attorney and a citizen , " @entity83 said
" if there 's any doubt that the killing was justified , we would demand that the @entity164 reconvene the grand jury
" @entity119 , the police chief , said the family should see it first
he said it would n't be easy to watch and that they deserved space to process it on their own
" i do n't care who 's jumping up and down , " @entity119 said
" we want the family to see it first
" @entity13 's children , who live in the @entity179 area , were able to see the video several hours after family members in @entity2 did
they , too , walked away troubled and wanting more answers
@entity183 called it " inconclusive , " and his brother , @entity185 , complained about editing
he said the video was choppy and skipped from one place to another
" we need more information to move forward , to have closure , " @entity185 said
civil rights attorney @entity193 , who said he has been working with the family to obtain the videotape since june , said he will be contacting the @entity2 police chief to demand the release of the lapel camera videos from the other two officers who were present
he also said the family wants to know the name of the officer who shot @entity0
" what we did learn from the video is that officer appeared to be poorly trained , " @entity193 said
" he put himself so close to mr. @entity0 that he escalated the situation
" the police chief said the officer is no longer on the force , but he did n't say why he left or where he 'd gone
lt. @entity212 , who has been with the department for nearly 28 years , said he knew of only two police shooting fatalities in all that time
with the police chief on vacation and out of town on the day of the viewing , it was @entity212 who showed the video to the family in @entity2
he also showed it to @entity4
when asked questions , he could only say , " no comment
" @entity138 raised other questions , too
she said that while there may have been witnesses who said they saw @entity13 rushing the officer , there was also a witness who said she saw no such thing
resident @entity234 said she and her daughter were on their front porch when she saw police following @entity0 through her yard
she pointed to the place in front of her home where she said the officer shot the man dead
@entity246 said she did n't see him raise the hatchet
she said he was n't threatening anyone
but @entity246 was never called to testify before the grand jury , @entity83 said
why is that ? district attorney @entity251 had an answer
he said @entity246 was not called because her words would not have changed the video
" what 's the point ? " he said
" you can bring in 50 witnesses and it would not change what the tape clearly shows
" though the police force has since acquired @entity265 , officers did n't have them at the time
" the officer only had one choice , " @entity251 said
but @entity0 said there was no reason for the police to give his brother chase
" they flushed him out like a rabbit " and treated his brother like " a nobody , " he said
" life beat him down , but he was a good man
