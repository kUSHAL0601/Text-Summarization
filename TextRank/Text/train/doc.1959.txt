@entity0 , @entity1 -- suspended @entity6 quarterback @entity5 will go to work for a construction company in @entity0 , @entity1 , after he leaves federal prison for bankrolling a dogfighting operation , his lawyer said thursday
football player @entity5 listens as his lawyers make the case for chapter 11 bankruptcy
the details emerged in a chapter 11 confirmation hearing in @entity15 to determine how @entity5 , 28 , will work his way out of bankruptcy
@entity5 's lawyer , @entity18 , told the court that the embattled footballer will take the stand first thing friday and explain how he intends to turn over a new leaf after spending nearly two years in prison on a federal conspiracy charge
@entity5 's 23 - month sentence ends in july , but he is expected to be released from the federal penitentiary in @entity27 , @entity28 , in may and serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement , most likely in @entity1
he is a native of @entity0
the sports agent who landed @entity5 's landmark 10 - year , $ 140 million contract with the @entity34 also testified that he expects @entity5 will be back in the game as soon as september -- if the @entity6 reinstates him
@entity5 is in great shape and could once again command millions of dollars if he returns to football , @entity36 told the court
the decision to reinstate @entity5 rests with @entity6 commissioner @entity41 , with whom @entity36 said he had consulted
@entity5 was suspended from the @entity6 after his conviction but remains under contract with the @entity34 , @entity36 said , though he does not expect the @entity34 to retain @entity5 's rights if he is reinstated
@entity5 and many of his creditors are depending on a return to football as his main source of income
but @entity36 admitted that he has no way of knowing whether @entity5 will be reinstated , because the decision lies with @entity41
in the meantime , @entity5 is ready to " get back in the community in a positive light " and demonstrate remorse for his actions , @entity36 said
he has agreed to participate in a documentary about him that will net him $ 600,000 , @entity36 said
he will also work 40 hours a week for @entity59 , a construction company based in @entity0
the employment is not part of the official 61 - page agreement tentatively worked out between 's @entity5 's lawyers and numerous creditors
the parties involved in the hearing will continue to present evidence and testimony in an effort to convince the judge that @entity5 qualifies for chapter 11 bankruptcy
attorneys and representatives from the creditors , including @entity76 , the @entity34 and the @entity0 , to name a few , packed the courtroom thursday as the hearing got under way
@entity5 's mother sat in the gallery with his fianc√©e , who blew him a kiss during one break in the proceedings
among the terms included in @entity5 's plan of reorganization : @entity5 will retain the first $ 750,000 of his income
a percentage of his income above $ 750,000 will go to a trust fund
