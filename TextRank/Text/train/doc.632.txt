for 13 years , president @entity0 has governed @entity1
for 2Â½ of those years he 's faced repeated calls from many inside and outside the country for his resignation
now , @entity0 's regime is thought by many @entity7 governments to have used chemical weapons against its own people , prompting talk of international military intervention
but @entity1 's president shows no sign of stepping back from the brink of confrontation
so who is @entity0 and what might he do next ? when @entity0 succeeded his father @entity19 in 2000 , there was the promise of a modern and more democratic @entity1
in his inauguration speech , @entity0 indicated he would be a very different kind of leader to his father
" i shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfills the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people , " he said
and for a while that promise was kept
his official website says he has built free - trade zones , licensed more private newspapers and private universities , and fought government waste and corruption
he has also worked on social and economic reform
low profile for @entity1 's first lady but many say @entity0 's promises have largely not been delivered
@entity43 called his first 10 years as president " the wasted decade , " with a media that remained controlled by the state , a monitored and censored @entity47 and prisons still filled with dissidents
back in 2011 , @entity0 drew criticism from around the globe as he met popular protests and unrest with force
since then , the conflict has escalated into a brutal civil war and the rebels have at times threatened government strongholds in @entity60
through it all , @entity0 and his government have consistently said that its forces are targeting armed terrorists funded by outside agitators
and the president has shown no sign that he will accede to demands that he stand down and quit the country
in november last year , he told @entity71 : " i am @entity1
i was made in @entity1 and to live and die in @entity1
" over time , his public appearances have become rare events
but an @entity75 account set up on july 24 offers an alternative vision of the president 's life -- one that is all about feeding the hungry , science olympiads and widespread support for @entity0 and his wife , @entity82
the closest it comes to reflecting the ongoing war are pictures of the president meeting " with the armed forces who are fighting the terrorist groups
" @entity90 , a senior fellow at the @entity91 , describes @entity0 as " a master of deception " -- and his manipulation of the media is one part of that
" i think that the regime -- the package of @entity0 and his wife @entity82 , it 's very seductive
and it draws you -- how could someone who seems so reasonable command such a horrific regime ? " said @entity90
and if the threat of @entity7 military intervention in @entity1 is borne out , @entity0 's response may not be an obvious one , he said
" he 's going to think about , ' how am i going to react to these strikes ? ' now what we can see from past strikes by the @entity117 is that actually @entity0 does very , very little in terms of a direct response
but over time , he might carry out other kinds of attacks on @entity123 assets
" a brutal war ? not to hear @entity0 's @entity75 tell it ' victim of cruelty ' two former regime insiders -- now its opponents -- told @entity130 of their time with the younger @entity0
former vice president @entity132 said @entity0 was often the victim of his elder brother 's cruelty
" his brother @entity135 bullied him as a child
his father never gave him as much attention as @entity135 , " @entity132 said
@entity140 's uncle @entity139 , who left @entity1 in 1984 after being involved in a failed coup , also recalled the future president
" he is very different than his father
@entity19 was a leader , the head of the entire regime , while @entity0 was never that close to being one and never fell within that framework
he is being perceived as the leader but he follows what the regime decides on his behalf
" @entity140 himself said reform faltered because of unrest in neighboring states -- @entity153 and @entity154
but @entity132 , who was vice president under both @entity0 and his father , says the younger @entity0 is both brutal and indecisive
" @entity0 's problem is that he listens to everything but denies and forgets quickly
you discuss an issue with him in the morning and another person comes along and changes his mind
" politically , @entity0 does not have a consistent ideology ; he changes his opinion according to his interests and that of the regime
" and the regime is a family affair
@entity140 's younger brother @entity169 commands an elite division of the army , and is accused of widespread human rights abuses
his cousin @entity173 is the richest man in @entity1
the @entity174 belong to @entity1 's @entity176 minority , who according to the president 's uncle @entity139 , are driven by fears they could be overwhelmed
" there is no doubt that the @entity176 are a minority who are in fear of the outcome and they are driven by that fear factor , " he said
' not my forces ' despite the brutal crackdown in @entity1 , @entity0 has maintained that he is not in charge of @entity1 's military
he told @entity194 's @entity193 in 2011 : " they are not my forces
they are forces for the government
i do n't own them
i do n't own the country
so they are not my forces
" would n't @entity0 , the commander in chief , have had to give the order for any military actions ? " no , no no , " he said
not by your command ? " no , " he said , " on no one 's command
there was no command to kill or to be brutal
" @entity140 said those members of the armed forces who " went too far " had been disciplined
but @entity132 , the former vice president , expressed no doubts about who does give the orders to kill : " @entity0 and no one else
he gives out orders to use all means of force to crush the revolution
he is surrounded by close aides and a security apparatus that advise him , but he decides
" it was n't expected that @entity0 would carry on the family 's political dynasty
he did n't seem to have the personality for the job ; he was n't deeply involved in military or government matters , according to " inheriting @entity1 : @entity0 's @entity228 , " a biography by @entity230 , who worked as an expert on @entity1 for the @entity232 in the 1990s and was the senior director for @entity235 affairs at the @entity236 in the early 2000s
because his older brother @entity135 was expected to succeed his father , @entity0 went to @entity239 in the 1990s and studied ophthalmology , and headed the @entity241
" dr. @entity0 , " as he was widely known , liked to windsurf and play volleyball
he is believed to have started dating @entity244 - born @entity243 during this time
but @entity0 was called back to @entity1 in 1994 when @entity135 died in a car wreck
this turn of events made him first in line to rule @entity1 , and he was appointed president by @entity1 's rubber - stamp @entity250 in 2000 after his father died
before 2000 ended , he and @entity82 were married
steps toward change ? shortly after the @entity256 started in early 2011 , @entity0 made apparent moves toward change in @entity1
initially , protesters wanted basic reforms , more freedoms , a multiparty political system and an end to emergency law
some of these measures were , on paper , implemented by @entity0 , but they were far too little and , by the time they came about , too late
in a speech in january 2013 , @entity0 laid out his latest solution to the ongoing crisis in @entity1
he said he wanted to foster national dialogue and proposed a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum
he also said he would not negotiate with terrorists and asked regional governments to stop supporting them
months later , though , any chance of finding a political solution seems as remote as ever
a date has yet to be agreed for a second international meeting on @entity1 in @entity281 , @entity282 , initially proposed for june
after more than two years of violence and more than 100,000 deaths , many opposition supporters have lost any faith they ever had in @entity0 's ability to deliver reform , and simply want an end to his rule and true democratic elections
but the president 's days at the helm may be far from over .
