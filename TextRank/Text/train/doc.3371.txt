it 's the white whale of the skies and one of aviation 's rarest and most loved planes currently in service
the @entity7 , popularly known as the " @entity7 " because of its resemblance to the white @entity11 whale , is the @entity13 plane manufacturer 's super-sized transporter jet
five of these enormous planes make more than 60 flights each week , carrying parts for all of @entity19 ' planes from manufacturing sites -- wings in the @entity22 , tails in @entity24 , for example -- to the final assembly facilities in either @entity27 , @entity28 or @entity29
the planes have been in service since 1994 , but are in need of reinforcements
since the plane 's inaugural flight , @entity19 's production rates have increased five fold , so a new fleet is planned to keep up with demand , especially with the new @entity41 plane now entering service
" the need for the new @entity7 comes with the increase in production rates and to get extra capacity on top of this fleet of five aircrafts , " says @entity43 , head of @entity44
" so initially there will be a mixed fleet use of both new @entity7 and old @entity7
and then the second need was as well to anticipate replacement of an aging fleet
" a crew of three operates the @entity7 : two pilots and a loadmaster
because of its size the plane reacts differently to other large jets in turbulence ; moving sideways more than up and down

the top section of the aircraft was cut and an additional , wider fuselage section -- resembling a bubble -- was added to the airframe , giving it its characteristic hump
the cockpit was lowered , making it possible for the cargo hold to be loaded and unloaded through the front of the aircraft
the result is an incredibly spacious cargo hold of 1,400 cubic meters
that 's the equivalent to 671 people , 36 cars or seven elephants
" the perception you have ( when the cargo door opens ) is of a huge volume like a cathedral , " says @entity43
although the @entity7 's maximum payload of 47 tons is surpassed by a handful of other cargo aircraft , its voluminous hold makes it suitable for transporting oversized , but not particularly heavy , cargo , like aircraft parts

but it 's not large enough to transport many @entity111 super jumbo parts
those need to travel by boat , barge and road
with the @entity68 now out of service , the new @entity65 will be based on the @entity117 and be bigger than the existing fleet
while the current planes can only carry one wing for the new @entity41 at a time , the new jet will be able to take on board both on the same flight
and for plane - spotters who love the unique shape of the existing @entity7 , that will remain much the same
" it will be the same look , " says @entity43 , " because we will operate both fleets in parallel for a number of years and it will also be compatible with existing loading means
" the first of the new fleet will enter service in 2020
