-- the family of @entity2 has applied for a review of his conviction in a @entity6 court for the 1988 bombing of @entity8
@entity2 was found guilty in 2001 of the murders of the 259 passengers and crew on board the flight from @entity14 to @entity15 , as well as those of 11 residents of the @entity6 town of @entity8
he died in 2012 in @entity19 , having been released from prison in @entity6 in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had terminal cancer
the @entity23 confirmed in a statement thursday that it had received an application to review his conviction in the case
dr. @entity29 , whose 23 - year - old daughter @entity30 was killed in the bombing , attended court to file the application on behalf of the @entity2 family , the @entity23 said
he is also one of the applicants
@entity36 does not believe @entity2 was responsible for the bombing and is among a number of relatives of the victims who have been fighting for the evidence in the case to be re-examined in court
@entity2 previously applied to the commission for a review of his conviction in 2003 , and his case was referred to the @entity48 for a new appeal in 2007 , the statement said
however , he subsequently dropped his appeal in 2009
the commission , a body set up to investigate potential miscarriages of justice , will now look at the new application in order to make a decision about whether to accept it or not , a process that could take months
if accepted , the application would then go through a review process in order to be sent either to the @entity48 or back to the applicant , who can then submit further representation
chief executive @entity65 said , " as it does in every case the @entity23 will now give careful consideration to this new application
" i previously indicated last month that there are several important matters which will affect the timescale within which the @entity23 will be able to deal with this fresh application and subsequently , if there is to be a further review of this conviction , any such review will take some time to complete
