-- a @entity0 team has been denied credentials to cover upcoming local elections in @entity4
a @entity0 en @entity6 correspondent and producer appeared friday at the @entity8 in @entity9 , and an official told them their credentials were denied
when the crew asked for an explanation , the official said that " they did n't understand why @entity0 needed to send an anchor to cover local elections when there are two correspondents accredited in @entity4
" the @entity0 team , including reporter @entity21 , intended to travel to the state of @entity23 , where the most violent protests erupted in february in the southwestern city of @entity26
opposition mayor @entity27 was accused of civil rebellion and conspiracy after the government said he failed to stop violent protests in his city
he was jailed in march and given a 12 - month sentence
the city of @entity26 has never had a pro-government mayor
@entity37 mayor @entity36 was also jailed for 10 months after the government accused him of ignoring an order given by the @entity40 to stop the protests
the wives of both the mayors are running in the municipal elections sunday
@entity27 ' wife has no political experience , while @entity36 's spouse is a city councilwoman
@entity0 has been reporting on the protests since february when the attempted rape of a young student on a @entity26 university campus galvanized students , who took to the streets to speak out against crime , shortages , blackouts and a dire economic situation
students were jailed and , in solidarity , protests began in other cities
in the course of @entity0 's coverage of the protests , @entity21 has been criticized by both president @entity64 and the president of the @entity66 , @entity65
an investigative piece by @entity0 showed that @entity65 lied about alleged weapons found at a retired general 's home
the picture that he used as evidence of the weaponry was of a gun shop in @entity76
@entity77 voiced concern in february that @entity4 was censoring the news media and highlighted @entity64 's efforts to take @entity0 off the airwaves
clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces have left more than 40 people dead and around 800 injured since february , according to officials
@entity64 has said protesters are " fascists and extreme right thugs " who are trying to destabilize the government to promote a coup
protesters call @entity64 a dictator who has ruined the @entity4 economy with failed socialist policies .
