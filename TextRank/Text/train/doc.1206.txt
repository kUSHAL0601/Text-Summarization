-- the view from the roof of @entity4 's hotel in @entity5 , @entity6 , is of a thousand lights twinkling on the dark surface of the @entity9
it 's a pretty scene , but few visitors are here to enjoy it
as a waiter brings over beer and tea , @entity4 puts out a @entity18 cigarette and lights another
a tour guide and hotel partner whose livelihood depends on tourism , @entity4 is agitated , and understandably so
the @entity24 has just declared @entity25 one of the most dangerous places on earth for tourists
the report puts @entity25 above @entity31 and @entity32 in terms of risks for visitors
" just like any other country , @entity25 has dangerous places , " allows a weary @entity4
" yes , the crime rate has increased since the revolution , due to the economic situation , but this affects @entity25 , not tourists
" why some travelers seek out the world 's most dangerous locales @entity4 is one of many
the country 's tourism workers have been hit hard by political and civil unrest
according to the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , tourism employs directly nearly 18 million people
tourist arrivals are far lower than in previous years
in addition to politically motivated violence that continues in the wake of the 2011 @entity25 revolution , there are concerns about the country 's beachside resorts at @entity60 and @entity61
many worry that the new government , the @entity63 , will impose strict morality provisions on these party towns , which are famed for their beaches and nightlife
earlier this month , tourism minister @entity68 sought to quell these fears at the @entity70 in @entity71 , when he alluded to @entity73 groups calling for bans on alcohol and women wearing bikinis
" bikinis are welcome in @entity25 and booze is still being served , " @entity68 told reporters in @entity71
@entity25 hotel goes alcohol - free , creates women - only floor tourists trickling back despite media coverage of calls by conservatives for an alcohol ban , tour guide @entity4 says he never expected the comments of hardliners to be taken seriously
@entity25 is n't an exclusively @entity63 country , and tourism has long been a lifeline for the @entity25 government , which is currently facing its worst economic crisis in decades
the country desperately needs the money that tourism brings
in 2012 , @entity49 figures show international tourism generated $ 10.1 billion
tourist numbers have fallen , from 14 million in 2010 to 10.2 million in 2011 , and 10.5 million for 2012
the good news is that , after a sluggish start , total numbers for 2012 picked up with a strong surge toward the end of the year
" despite the ongoing political instability in 2012 , main tourist attractions such as the @entity112 beach resorts , @entity113 and @entity114 remained very much secluded from the political turmoil , which allowed the tourism sector to slowly recover , " says @entity108 , a research analyst at @entity109
the first quarter of 2013 has continued the trend , with arrivals and hotel bookings showing a " healthy increase , " according to @entity108
@entity6 slower to recover despite the positive outlook , the @entity25 capital of @entity6 is n't a placid city two years after the revolution ( arguably it never was )
gone are the days when tourists might visit @entity25 's museums and pyramids and ignore the country 's political turmoil
tourism gains for 2013 come almost exclusively from outside of @entity6
@entity109 's @entity108 says that in the early days of the revolution , the capital 's @entity134 -- the epicenter of protests that ultimately toppled president @entity138 in february 2011 -- became a tourist attraction in itself
the attraction proved short lived , as political instability in the country persists
" with the ongoing unrest and growing security concerns , the number of tourists visiting @entity134 and @entity6 in general remains very small , hence the low ( hotel ) occupancy rates , " she says
the revolution is on the lips of every barman , taxi driver , shop owner and tout
its graffiti adorns walls across the city
despite the challenges , @entity6 remains a fascinating , vibrant city , and local optimists argue that dangerous areas are few and far between
@entity113 balloon flights resume fruit sellers , kebab shops and cafes bring peaceful crowds into the streets
men sit in plastic chairs puffing on shisha pipes
outside the @entity174 close to the @entity175 , an unlicensed vendor openly sells @entity25 's @entity177 beers for a fraction of the price found in the city 's trendy bars
in @entity183 , a 20 - minute walk north , outdoor cafes are packed with young @entity25 sitting in the shade of the trees
tentative hope @entity4 has landed another job , this one guiding a group around @entity25 's ancient tombs and monuments at @entity113
he 's grateful for the work , and , with his schedule filling up in the warm summer months -- generally a slow season in @entity25 ahead of the busy autumn -- he can relax , at least temporarily
" the unrest is still putting people off , of course , but i think people are starting to come back , " he says
@entity4 remains hopeful , if not for a revolution , at least for a little more activity .
