-- with his health in question and speculation rampant about his future , @entity2 president @entity1 has named 10 @entity2 to an influential commission
the @entity8 , as it is known , is stipulated in the @entity9 as the highest circle of advisers to the president , but has never actually been formed
now in a battle with cancer , @entity1 announced in january that it was time to constitute the council , and wednesday named his appointments
@entity2 and international observers alike are likely to scrutinize his choices for any signs of transition or succession should @entity1 become incapacitated
@entity1 's choices include a veteran of his administration , a military man and a writer , among others
the president of the council will be vice president @entity31 , as the constitution stipulates
@entity1 named five principal members
among them are @entity35 , a journalist who came to hold a number of posts under @entity1 , including foreign minister , defense minister and vice president
@entity2 's former ambassador to the @entity41 and former foreign minister @entity42 was also named to the council
@entity44 was elected by the country 's national assembly as ombudsman from 2000 to 2007
@entity48 is an active duty admiral who currently serves as secretary of the country 's defense council
@entity1 also named @entity52 , a playwright and author , to the council
in addition , the president listed five others as alternate members
the timing of the appointments is significant , as speculation increases over who will succeed @entity1 if he becomes too ill to govern , or if he dies
he has been reluctant to name a successor , but the @entity8 , as envisioned in the constitution , stands to wield significant influence
the council is the " highest body of advisers " to the government , the constitution states
" there are no surprising names here , " said @entity71 , a professor of political science at @entity73
with so much uncertainty surrounding @entity1 's health and the upcoming elections , the appointments answer part of the puzzle of who is close to @entity1 , he said
but it does not end the uncertainty , he added
whether the group simply advises @entity1 , or a successor , or takes up more powers of its own , " anything is possible , " @entity71 said
he envisioned a hypothetical scenario in which @entity1 remained president , but , too ill to make decisions , delegated power to the council
@entity1 in january said the council was " an institution that we lack and that is in the constitution but that we never activated
the time to activate it has come
" the fact that @entity31 , as vice president , will preside over the council elevates his status and could signal a victory for those supporting him as a potential successor to @entity1
@entity106 and @entity107 , who are trying to influence the succession , favor @entity31 , said @entity109 , an analyst with the conservative @entity110 and former @entity112 ambassador to the @entity41
analysts also say @entity1 's brother , @entity114 , is also liked by the @entity115
but @entity1 is not the only one with say on the council members
according to the constitution , the national assembly and the supreme court get to name one person each to the body
both institutions are favorable to the president
the governors of all the states will also have to pick one governor to be part of the council , too
