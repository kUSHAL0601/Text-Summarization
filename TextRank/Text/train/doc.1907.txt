-- it now seems like a lifetime ago that a young man in @entity3 , @entity4 , first pinned the @entity6 sheriff 's badge to his shirt
it was 1965 , and he had just beaten the man who took the office from his daddy four years earlier
the young man is 80 now , with a lawman son of his own
but @entity14 is still wearing that badge
he is believed to be the longest - serving sheriff in the @entity17
@entity14 says he did n't set out to make history , and that it recently " struck me that enough is enough
" he has decided to hang up his holster for good
from running the jailhouse to rounding up criminals , @entity14 witnessed the best and worst his fellow man had to offer during 12 terms as sheriff
he has worked for the department since 1953 , when he started at the bottom as a deputy
" i 'm just thankful to the citizens of @entity6 for seeing fit to elect me
" @entity14 recently told @entity0 in a telephone interview
" it 's been an enjoyable career and i 'd love to do it again
" while @entity14 says he 's ready for retirement , his wife of 58 years , @entity34 , is n't so sure
" he does n't golf , he does n't bowl , he does n't dance , " she said
" i do n't know what he 's going to do
" for starters , he will try to keep the sheriff 's business in the family
his father , @entity44 , was the @entity6 sheriff from 1931 to 1961
now , his son , @entity45 , 50 , is hoping voters will choose him on november 6 to succeed his dad and become the county 's third @entity48
" i never take anything for granted , " @entity50 said of his chances at the polls
" but it 's been going good , it 's been very positive
" @entity6 , population 55,000 or so , derives its name from the @entity59 band of @entity60
it is a slice of agricultural @entity17 near the center of @entity4 and is also know for its golf courses
the county 's most popular event is the annual @entity66 , which is held each year on the third wednesday in october
a @entity68 like his father , the younger @entity14 is a veteran law enforcement officer
he spent 32 years climbing the ranks from deputy to lieutenant before retiring in february
" my father never wanted to show any favoritism , " he said , " i was there for 12 years before i was promoted
working for your dad was n't easy
we butted heads a lot
" @entity80 was raised to be a lawman
he was born in the official sheriff 's residence , located inside the old jail
what was confinement to the inmates was home to three generations of @entity89
" i was the matron , " his wife , @entity34 , recalled
" i took care of all the adult women and the juvenile boys and girls , and that was quite an experience
" a new lockup replaced the old jailhouse 20 years ago
the sheriff 's staff , which began with just a small handful , now numbers more than 100
@entity80 still goes to work on sundays and holidays
he has 10 walkie - talkies in the house -- including one in the bathroom , and another in the laundry , said his wife
but if his dedication remains the same , many other aspects to the jobs have changed over the years
" when i first ran for the office , there were a lot of things you can do with a handshake without worrying about the controversy , " @entity80 said
" and where i find it very difficult is the way criminal statutes have changed
the maneuvers you have to go through in the courts , it seems you have roadblocks wherever you go
" those obstacles make the pursuit of justice more difficult , the sheriff says
" i 'm the kind of person that feels if you do something , you commit a crime , you pay , " he explains
" i do n't want somebody charged that is not guilty
it used to be if someone was arrested they would have to get their own attorney , now all they got to do is say they do n't have the funds and the state appoints a public defender and that 's added money
you ca n't take a chance today
" @entity14 is passionate about his profession
" he 's given 24/7 , " wife @entity34 said
" as sheriff , he never gets away
we 've sat down for @entity157 dinner and he 'd get a call and we would n't see him for 24 hours
he never stopped to eat , he would keep going until he got his man
" it 's in @entity14 's blood , their son agrees
" he demands so much
he wants to know everything that 's going on
he lives it , eats it , breathes it
" asked what the hardest part of the job is , sheriff @entity14 does n't hesitate : " when you have to go to a motor vehicle accident and notify the next of kin
the knock on the door and the mom in her bathrobe answers and you have to tell them that her son was just killed
" retiring will give @entity80 more time to spend with his children and grandchildren
he and his wife will get the chance to do things they never could while he was on the job
" our health is still good and we better take what time we have and enjoy ourselves instead of looking back and saying ' i wish we did this , ' " he said , adding that he leaves without regrets and knows he did the best he could
and he said he 's ready for some down time
" if anyone does n't like me because of what i 've done , so let it be , " he said
i 've done my job
