-- @entity2 's longtime leader @entity1 , the embodiment of the reclusive state where his cult of personality is deeply entrenched , has died
he was believed to be 69
regarded as one of the world 's most - repressive leaders , @entity1 always cut a slightly bizarre figure
his diminutive stature and characteristically bouffant hair have been parodied by some in the @entity13
" he 's a mysterious person -- i think by design , " said @entity14 , director of the @entity15 at the @entity16 and a frequent visitor to @entity2
" mystery is a source of leverage and power
" but for the citizens of his @entity2 , @entity1 was well regarded
this just in : up - to - the - minute news on the death of @entity1 his father , @entity28 , founded @entity2 with @entity30 backing after @entity31 @entity1 was just a little boy when the @entity32 invaded the @entity34 - backed @entity33 , sparking the @entity35 in 1950
after the fighting ended , @entity1 became steeped in his father 's philosophy of " juche " or self - reliance -- the basis of @entity2 's reclusive nature
@entity43 never formally signed a peace treaty and remain technically at war -- separated by a tense demilitarized zone
@entity2 gives @entity1 's official birthplace as sacred @entity48
the peak , on the northern border with @entity50 , is the highest on the peninsula and the site where @entity2 legend says the nation came into existence 5,000 years ago
cause of death reported to be " overwork " researchers who are more objective place @entity1 's birth in the @entity62 of the @entity30 on february 16 , 1942
his father had fled to the @entity30 when the @entity64 put a price on his head for guerrilla activities in occupied @entity2
the family returned to the northern part of the peninsula after the @entity64 surrender in @entity31 , and @entity30 dictator @entity72 anointed @entity28 as the leader of the @entity2
timeline : @entity1 @entity1 's younger brother drowned as a child and his mother died when he was 7 years old
shortly after , when the @entity35 broke out , he was sent to @entity50 , returning three years later when it ended
despite these hardships , @entity1 was presumably surrounded by luxury and privilege for most of his upbringing
as the first - born son of an iron - fisted dictator , " the doors were likely opening for him from a very young age , " according to @entity88 , a professor of political science at the @entity90 who specializes in the @entity92 government
time : the iconography of @entity1 gradually @entity1 was groomed for the top position , making public appearances in front of cheering crowds
in 1980 , @entity28 formally designated his son as his successor
@entity1 was given senior posts in the @entity101 , the @entity102 and the @entity103
he took on the title " @entity1 " and the government began spinning a personality cult around him patterned after that of his father , the " great leader
" in 1991 , @entity1 became commander - in - chief of @entity2 's powerful armed forces , the final step in the long grooming process
three years later , when @entity28 died suddenly from a heart attack at 82 , most outsiders predicted the imminent collapse of @entity2
the nation had lost its venerated founding father
just a few years earlier , its powerful alliances had evaporated with the fall of the @entity30 bloc and @entity123 's move toward a market - based system
the economy was on the rocks and energy and food were in short supply
a series of weather disasters , combined with an inefficient state - run agricultural system , further eroded the food supply , leading to mass starvation
the timing could not have been worse for replacing the only leader @entity2 had known
" @entity137 did n't smile on @entity1 , " said the @entity90 's @entity88
after his father 's elaborate public funeral , @entity1 dropped out of sight , fueling rumors , but he soon managed to consolidate power
@entity143 : will the @entity2 rise up ? under his newly organized government , his father 's presidential post was left vacant and @entity1 took the titles of general secretary of the @entity150 and chairman of the @entity152 -- a group of 10 men that includes the heads of the air force , army and navy , who are now considered the most powerful in the country
" it 's a peculiar government to say the least , " @entity88 said
" he honors the legacy of his father , but the new government is a @entity1 government
it 's quite different from his father 's
" @entity28 's unique style of @entity167 was subordinated to the more militant theme of @entity1 's " @entity170 " policy , introduced in 1996
the changes afoot were dramatically illustrated in 1997 by the defection of @entity173 -- the architect of the juche philosophy and the first high - level official to seek asylum in @entity178
in a news conference after his defection , @entity173 warned of a growing possibility that his homeland might launch an attack
" the preparation for war exceeds your imagination , " he said
many outsiders viewed the flight of @entity173 as another sign that the @entity2 regime was on its last legs , but once again it weathered the storm , perhaps even benefiting from the fears of war heightened by @entity173 's warning
despite sending a test missile over @entity64 in june 1999 and other such incidents , @entity2 under @entity1 also sent signals that it is open to new alliances after decades of isolation
billions of dollars in international aid poured into @entity2 during the 1990s , which did little in return
many analysts conclude that @entity1 has played a poor hand of cards skillfully
" i tend to disregard rumors that he 's irrational , a man that nobody can do business with , " said @entity208 , a longtime @entity2 scholar and a former @entity210 diplomat who was posted in @entity92 in the late 1980s
" i believe that he is smart
and i think he can be ruthless
he 's a man who will not loosen his grip in any way on the people around him
" his obsession for movies led to one of the strangest incidents associated with him : the 1978 kidnappings of @entity178 actress @entity224 and her director husband @entity226
the couple 's account of their ordeal , given after they escaped @entity2 in 1986 , sounds like a b - movie script
they said @entity1 held @entity224 under house arrest and imprisoned @entity226 for four years for a failed escape attempt
@entity1 then forced them to work in the @entity2 film industry , paying them handsomely while keeping them in the gilded cage of his artistic and social circles
although the country was having problems paying its debts , @entity1 lived extravagantly and spent tens of millions of dollars on their film productions , according to @entity224 and @entity226
the couple told @entity249 reporter @entity248 that @entity1 was a " micro-manager " who made all the major decisions in @entity2 because of his father 's ailing condition
@entity226 described @entity1 as " very bright , " but said that he had no sense of guilt about his misdeeds " due to his background and upbringing
" while the @entity1 is said to have indulged his appetite for the finer things , his people were literally starving to death
the collapse of the @entity30 in the early 1990s hit @entity2 hard when guaranteed trade deals with @entity266 came to an end
and then devastating floods compounded the famine
the @entity2 regime admitted almost 250,000 people perished between 1995 and 1998 , but some outside groups believe it was more like ten times that figure
nevertheless , an artifice of a successful state was maintained in the capital , @entity92 , including an opulent subway -- proof that @entity1 would say reflected @entity2 's progress under his and his father 's leadership
in 2000 , there appeared to be a thaw in @entity33 relations leading to the first - ever summit meeting between @entity1 and his then counterpart from the @entity33 president @entity287
@entity178 's so - called " sunshine policy " of engagement seemed to be bearing fruit
but @entity1 pressed ahead with his nuclear weapons program and then - @entity34 president @entity292 labeled @entity2 as part of the " axis of evil " in his @entity295
a year later , @entity2 withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
in 2006 , the @entity32 conducted a nuclear test and test fired missiles adding extra urgency to the six - party talks designed to deal with @entity2 's nuclear program
a breakthrough came in 2007 , when @entity1 finally agreed to disable the nuclear reactor at @entity305 in return for fuel and better relations with the @entity34 but despite dramatically blowing up @entity305 's cooling tower , @entity2 seemed to backtrack afterwards and the deal appeared to be jeopardy
in august 2008 , @entity92 halted the disabling of the plutonium - producing plants in after a stalemate over verification measures
months later -- as @entity292 wrapped up his final term in office -- the @entity34 government agreed to take @entity2 off its list of countries that sponsor terrorism
the move was a turnaround from the @entity292 administration 's previous refusal to drop @entity2 from the list until @entity92 agreed to set up an internationally recognizable mechanism to verify it was revealing all its nuclear secrets
analysts say it is easy for outsiders to demonize @entity1 , a dictator who spent an estimated 25 % or more of his country 's gross national product on the military while many in his country went hungry
but in @entity2 , closed off from outside influences , fearful of threats from its neighbors , and subjected to decades of political socialization on top of a long tradition of a strict hierarchical system , @entity1 is viewed positively by most people , said @entity346 of the @entity347
" the level of reverence for @entity1 in @entity2 is quite underestimated by the outside , " @entity14 said
" he is regarded by many as not only a superior leader but a decent person , a man of high morality
whether that 's accurate is not important if you want to deal with @entity2
you have to understand their belief system
" but to the outside world , @entity1 will be remembered as one of the worst despots in history , according to @entity366 , an author on @entity2 's history
" he will be remembered as a person who was responsible for awful things : for the existence of one of the worst dictatorships in not only @entity2 history but the world history at least in the 20th and 21st centuries , " @entity366 said
" yet he did not create this dictatorship -- it was his father 's but he took responsibility , and he made sure it continued for many more years
" @entity0 's @entity380 contributed to this report .
