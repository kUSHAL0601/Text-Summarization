-- the @entity2 peacekeeping chief says @entity3 is now in a civil war
some experts agree with @entity2 official @entity6 that the war - torn country has reached that chilling milestone
others say the country is hurtling in that direction
the conflict began in march 2011 when a fierce @entity3 government crackdown on peaceful protesters morphed into a bloody government uprising
@entity16 , @entity17 at the @entity18 , said popular conversation about civil war tends to be dominated by images of the @entity22 , and it conjures a vague picture of a " really bad conflict
" but the rigorously defined scholarly meaning of civil war fits @entity3 now , just as it applied to @entity27 last decade , he said
@entity2 report : @entity3 children tortured , used as human shields " a civil war is a conflict in which at least one side is a non-state actor , with at least 1,000 total battle deaths and at least 100 on each side , " he said
@entity38 , assistant professor of political science at the @entity40 , cites a similar threshold and notes that the estimates of 10,000 to 14,000 battle - related deaths so far in @entity3 fulfills the definition
she said the definition has " little to do with the growing use recently of attack helicopters " to wage war
" @entity3 did not start out as a case of civil war because the opposition to the government mainly took the form of a popular uprising in march 2011 , " she said
" however , later that year , the @entity55 and its organization of an armed rebellion against the government ( in defense of the civilian uprising ) fulfilled at least the most basic criterion of a civil war -- the armed confrontation between a rebel group and the government
thus , @entity3 turned into a civil war situation much earlier than recent observations by the @entity2 would suggest
" like other civil wars , she said the situation has " notable international dimensions , " with reports of @entity71 military support for the regime and reports of the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 backing the rebels
@entity3 's government on thursday rejected the claim , saying " @entity3 is not witnessing a ' civil war ' but rather a struggle to uproot the plague of terrorism
" but @entity38 said an " important difference that the ' civil war ' label makes is that the @entity90 regime can not credibly claim that it is only a sectarian conflict or that this is a terrorist struggle against the people of @entity3
it is squarely an armed attempt by non-state groups ( who define themselves mostly in a non-sectarian manner , and claim to speak in the name of the people ) to overthrow the government , and fight for territorial control
" @entity103 , a professor of political science at @entity105 , defines a civil war as " an armed conflict within a country between organized groups who are fighting to control the central government or over control of a region
" the @entity3 conflict " has qualified as a civil war for a while now , " he said
he cited the same academic thresholds that political scientists and sociologists use for a civil war : 1,000 killed in a conflict 's duration or 1,000 killed per year , but added : " how many is enough to qualify is matter of opinion , and this arbitrariness might be the source of some of the disagreement about whether @entity3 , etc , is having a civil war or not
" it does n't matter how much of the country is in conflict for unrest to be defined as a civil war , he said
" for instance , we call the conflict in the @entity74 in the first part of the 1860s a civil war , even though things were entirely peaceful in almost all of the @entity142 , " he said
@entity3 : battle for the cities two organized forces facing off against each other is also a necessary part of the definition , said @entity148 , a researcher at the @entity149
in @entity3 , there have been sectarian tensions between the @entity152 and the @entity153 , with the opposition overwhelmingly @entity152 and the pro-government @entity153 , who dominate the regime of @entity90 , also an @entity153
" when you let the sectarian genie out of the bottle , it 's hard to put back in , " @entity156 said
he said the opposition fighters are becoming an organized militia force
the pro-regime @entity164 militias , dominated also by @entity153 , are becoming more significant , signaling an erosion in the government 's chain of command
" i think @entity3 is a civil war or has all of the components to become one in the future
" @entity171 , a @entity3 expert at the @entity172 , said parts of @entity3 are in civil war
" civil war suggests the previous state that exists all but failed and collapsed , " he said
in some regions , the government lacks control and there is a " growing equalization " of forces , he said
@entity183 , senior adviser for @entity185 initiatives at the @entity186 , said the regime 's tactics , the escalation in violence and a growing supply of weapons to the opposition indicate the conflict is moving closer to a civil war
while there are " some isolated areas in @entity3 where conditions have crossed the threshold for civil war , " @entity3 has not yet " crossed that threshold with respect to the conflict as a whole
" he used @entity206 and @entity207 as the model for civil war
in @entity206 during the 1980s , the state collapsed and " we saw a proliferation of armed groups across society in multiple directions " in a society with no controlling authority , @entity183 said
during last year 's civil war in @entity207 , there were two competing armed forces , with the quality of weapons and the scale of the units largely comparable on each side
" neither of those conditions exist in @entity3 , " he said
the regime commands armed forces totaling about 200,000 troops and has ample resources such as tanks and helicopters , he said
the armed opposition is basically a " localized insurgency , " much smaller , poorly equipped and trained and " not integrated into any coherent command and control structure
" so while the conflict between these forces does not constitute a civil war at the moment , said @entity183 , the pace and intensity of opposition activity could change that
@entity246 , a defense fellow at the @entity247 , said @entity3 is edging toward civil war , but is not there yet
" my definition of civil war is a situation which is characterized by conflict between two , or more , segments of society
i still see the situation in @entity3 as one of fundamentally an armed and unarmed insurrection against the government
that is , the people are fighting the state , not each other
" that said , the elements of civil war are taking hold
" the regime is heavily , perhaps increasingly reliant on @entity153 fighters both within the regular military and in its irregular forces
the regime has also begun using @entity153 villagers in attacks on neighboring @entity152 towns and villages
there are also reports of @entity152 retaliation for attacks
this is the kind of activity that creates its own dynamic and can spread easily , " he said
the tipping point could be a " tipping period
" that would be when " communal violence increases in scope and intensity until it dominates the situation , " @entity246 said
" we will know it when we see it ; but things to look for would include : organized and directed violence by one sect against another ( as opposed to spontaneous actions ) , declarations by community political and religious leaders that the enemy is the other sect ( as opposed to ' @entity90 's dogs / pigs ' and ' terrorists ' ) , cleansing of areas , organization of irregular forces along sectarian lines , regime arming of @entity153 villages for ' defense ' against @entity152 , breakdown of @entity3 military forces along sectarian lines
we have bits and pieces of this now , and the bits and pieces seem to be accumulating
" the rhetoric used to describe the conflict has important meaning
the term " civil war " can change the dynamics of a conflict
" in the @entity27 war , the @entity329 administration did n't want the conflict described as a civil war because it feared that this would increase public opposition -- if it 's a civil war , then it 's their business and we should n't bother with it , or expect to be able to fix it , " @entity103 said
" in the @entity3 case , it is the advocates of greater intervention ( and / or greater pressure on @entity71 ) who are saying ' it may be soon be a civil war , ' by which they mean ' this is really bad and we have to do something about it , ' " he said
@entity246 said defining a conflict as a civil war has political implications
" there is always reluctance to get involved in a civil war
so defining it so supports non-intervention
it also tends to spread the blame for violence more or less evenly across the parties
it is much easier to get behind an insurrection than take sides in a civil war
" @entity38 said once a conflict is deemed a civil war , it can compel " more assertive forms of actions from various international actors concerned about their interests in the country
" this could be in the form of international intervention and heightened diplomatic efforts at negotiation , she said
@entity183 said the specter of a civil war could increase pressure on policy makers to act so decisively that incremental measures to deal with the conflict might be " left by the wayside
" also , he said , the international community has been reluctant to support the opposition because it would contribute to instability , international spillover , the presence of jihadists , and the militarization of the opposition
now that all of those factors have emerged , they might determine that " some form of engaging " would be the response to a civil war
@entity148 said labeling a conflict as a civil war matters politically , but he does n't know how much it alone would make a difference
he cited the slaughter of civilians in the @entity401 town of @entity402 , which helped prompt international involvement in that civil conflict in the 1990s
" the instances of sectarian violence against civilians will make a difference , " he said
" that type of thing is the biggest factor to push toward @entity74 involvement
" @entity74 says @entity71 attack helicopters on way to @entity3 @entity3 opposition cites indiscriminate firing from helicopters
