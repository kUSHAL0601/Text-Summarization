@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , " @entity5 " mom , may be one of @entity7 's best - loved mothers
@entity3 is often asked for hugs by complete strangers
as @entity11 travels the @entity7 with her one - woman road show , " all the lives of me , " fans respond as if they grew up in her 1970s tv family
" every day , i 'm asked ' can i have a hug ? ' " @entity11 said
i hug a lot of people
" and on @entity21 every year , her mailbox fills with cards from people she does n't know but who think of her as @entity25
" i get mail from all over the world , 122 countries , " she said
@entity11 is using her fame as the iconic tv mother to help other moms who suffer from " lackus appreciatus , " which she says is " a condition caused by years of under - appreciation and neglect " of mothers by their kids
her role as spokeswoman for the " @entity40 " is part of a tongue - in - cheek campaign sponsored by @entity43 to promote an online service where @entity21 cards can be sent for free
a video posted on @entity47 points to the @entity25 - a - thon.com web site , which aims to close the " appreciation deficit " between what your mom does for you and what you do for your mom
although just five seasons of " @entity5 " were produced , starting in the fall of 1969 , children still grow up with the @entity58 in syndication
" it 's never been off the air in the @entity7 , " she said
@entity11 said she sometimes encounters mothers who tell her " you know , i really did n't like you when my kids were small , because they preferred you to me
" she knows the power of her motherly voice , using it to make a reporter feel special with a scolding : " do n't play ball in the house ! " for a moment , the interviewer feels like a @entity5 .
