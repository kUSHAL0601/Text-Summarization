@entity0 , @entity1 -- deadly bombings in two @entity5 parks on july 20 , 1982 represented a dark day in the bloody conflict between @entity8 republicans and the @entity10 government -- now their legacy threatens to derail @entity1 's hard - fought peace process
eleven @entity10 soldiers -- some members of @entity16 's @entity15 regiment , others part of a military band -- died during blasts in @entity21 and @entity22
one of the men accused of being behind the @entity21 attack -- believed to have been carried out by the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) -- walked free this week after it emerged in court that he had a letter from the @entity10 government from 2007 -- the 25th anniversary of the bombings -- assuring him he did not face prosecution for @entity25 crimes
prosecutors argued the letter was sent " in error " to @entity35 , 62 , and that authorities at the time had failed to register an outstanding warrant for his arrest in connection with the 1982 attack
@entity35 , who denies planting the bomb that killed four of the soldiers , was not the only one to be given immunity
almost 200 other @entity8 republican terror suspects were too
@entity48 deal according to @entity10 media , 187 so - called " comfort letters " were sent to suspected @entity25 terrorists such as @entity35 -- known as " on the runs " -- who sought clarification about their status after a peace settlement in 1998 , known as the @entity55 , which brought the decades - long " troubles " in @entity1 to an end
the letters were part of a covert deal struck between the @entity10 government and republicans -- who bitterly opposed @entity10 rule -- to ease the reconciliation process
now the historic power - sharing government in @entity1 -- which brought unionists and republicans together -- appears in grave danger of collapsing
the top lawmaker in the administration , first minister @entity70 , said it had been plunged into crisis over the deal allowing suspected terrorists to walk free
@entity70 has threatened to resign , saying he had been kept in the dark over the years about the secret " letters of assurance
" he said he only found out after the @entity5 court judgment
and he 's supposed to be in charge here
his partner in government , @entity81 -- himself a former @entity25 commander -- urged him to pull back from the brink of bringing down the government
the nationalist @entity87 leader took to social media to say : " my unionist colleagues need to calm down
we 've all come a long way
no sensible person will thank anyone for threatening the institutions
" @entity10 secretary of state for northern ireland , @entity97 , stressed the @entity10 government " does not support amnesties for people wanted by the police in connection with terrorist offenses , " and that @entity35 " was part of an administrative scheme for dealing with ' on - the - runs ' set up by the previous government
" she added that the government would be working with the police to identify whether there are other cases similar to that of @entity35
imperfect peace the tension is a sign of the times in @entity1
there 's peace but an imperfect one
the bombings and sectarian murders have largely stopped , although small groupings of @entity25 dissidents continue to pose a threat
pro-british paramilitary groups also remain active
emotions continue to run high between the pro-british and @entity128 communities over issues such as parades and the flying of the @entity133 flag
the parades are particularly controversial -- groups from both sides of the unionist / nationalist divide would claim they hold marches as a celebration of their culture , while critics would argue they are asserting their rights over communities across @entity1
@entity145 diplomat @entity144 was flown into @entity0 to chair all - party talks last year in a bid to find a resolution to outstanding issues -- the talks ended without agreement
marching season through it all , the power - sharing administration at @entity155 -- @entity1 's @entity155 -- in @entity0 has held
the present - day political and economic challenges were being worked through
but the past has proved more difficult to deal with
and with elections on the horizon , compromise might not be viewed as a policy to win votes
another controversial summer marching season looms with the prospect of violent clashes at disputed locations
the trouble tends to be confined to certain neighborhoods , mainly working class districts of @entity0
but the shockwaves can be felt across @entity1
@entity25 dissidents lurk in the background desperate to launch attacks
many victims of decades of paramilitary violence believe their voices are being ignored
of course , there are many economic challenges too , with a sluggish economy and an unemployment rate above the @entity10 average
it promises to be an interesting year in @entity1
and while the politicians fight , the vast majority of people on both sides of the religious divide are united -- praying for peace .
