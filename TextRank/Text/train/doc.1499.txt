-- @entity2 rep. @entity1 is making his third bid for the @entity4 armed with the same libertarian - leaning stances that cultivated a dedicated following during his 11 terms in the @entity8
those positions -- calls for limited government , reduced federal spending and less @entity14 involvement overseas -- are now in the fore of national politics with the rise of the @entity18 and the country 's financial situation
@entity1 is perhaps most famous for his calls to abolish the @entity23 and @entity24 and return to a gold standard , views he often advocates as a member of the @entity27
and as a member of the @entity29 , he has consistently voted against authorizing military action overseas and opposed @entity14 support for the @entity32 and the @entity33
he has also called for constitutional amendments to abolish personal income , estate and gift taxes
but those are some of the same issues that made him and his son , @entity42 sen. @entity41 , darlings of the @entity18 movement and especially popular among young conservatives whom he visits on college campuses across the country
he often says he was fighting for those issues before they were popular
more @entity1 coverage on the @entity50 " @entity51 is now thinking about these things
before , mainstream was deficits do n't matter , print money when you need it , endless wars , personal privacy that did n't mean anything , " @entity1 said on @entity0 's " @entity53 " recently
" but believe me , mainstream is moving in the direction that i have been talking about for a long time , and therefore nobody knows what the outcome will be in this election
" although he raises significant campaign funds , fundraising success does n't necessarily translate to electoral wins
while running for the 2008 @entity71 nomination , @entity1 raised $ 20 million in the last quarter of 2007 , mostly through individual contributions , which was twice as much raised by eventual @entity71 nominee sen. @entity73 of @entity74
but he barely breached 10 % in the early presidential voting states
after he dropped out of the race in june 2008 , he used his remaining funds to form @entity78 , designed to support candidates who agreed with his policy stances
an early champion of virtual campaigning , @entity1 coined the term " money bomb " for setting a fundraising goal over a set period of time on his website
he raised more than $ 1 million during his most recent " money bomb " in june but fell short of the $ 2 million goal
the @entity91 native first ran for the @entity4 in 1988 as the @entity93 candidate against @entity71 @entity94 and democrat @entity95 , ultimately receiving 0.5 percent of the vote , or 432,000 votes , in the general election
but do n't expect him to seek a third - party bid in 2012
" we do n't have a democracy in this country
it 's so biased , " @entity1 told @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity103
" if you 're a third party , you ca n't -- i ca n't get into debates as a third - party candidate
when i did it as a third party , i spent over half my money just to get on the ballot
" as a @entity71 candidate he will also promote more socially conservative stances , popular with @entity71 voters in many of the early nominating states
he has said he believes marriage is the union between a man and a woman , but voted in 2004 and 2006 against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage , something he said is an increase in federal power
@entity1 also told @entity126 in may that he supports the " protection of all human life
" " i 'm for repealing @entity129
and it 's not an attack on women 's rights , " @entity1 said on @entity0 's " @entity130
" " women have rights , but they also have a responsibility if they 're responsible for life
" @entity1 has a unique perspective as a specialist in obstetrics / gynecology who has delivered more than 4,000 babies
after graduating from @entity142 and the @entity143 , he served as a flight surgeon in the @entity145 before moving to @entity2 with his wife @entity146 and eventually representing the 14th district that includes the cities of @entity149 and @entity150
he will be 77 in 2012 , but @entity1 , a father of five and grandfather of 18 , said he does n't feel old
" where do i get my energy and where do i get my support and the enthusiasm ? it comes from the young people , " @entity1 told @entity126
" that really excites me because this issue is so important
it 's important to my kids
it 's an important point to all the kids of @entity14
