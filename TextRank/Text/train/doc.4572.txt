-- folks are really mad at @entity2
the @entity4 ceo has revoked the company 's long - time work - from - home policy , a ban that will take effect beginning in june
when i asked how my tech - industry - heavy social network felt about the policy reversal , the responses from both men and women were overwhelmingly negative
one man said the decision felt arbitrary and like a throwback to less - connected days before real - time video hangouts and collaborative docs
" short - sighted and against the tide of where things are heading , " he observed
" going backwards " and " epic fail , " wrote others
@entity27 's name and you will find that the media and blogosphere are equally riled up
the move , some say , is particularly disappointing coming from a new mother , who presumably should know better about the difficult position that many parents are in
opinion : allow @entity4 workers to work at home and who are we kidding ? by " parents " we mean mostly moms , because whether we have solid childcare , family support or neither , many of us are performing real - life acrobatics worthy of @entity47
@entity4 's new policy pushes my buttons , as well
had it not been for workplace flexibility and the ability to work from home , i -- and scores of my friends and colleagues -- probably would not be in the game at this point
i telecommuted long before i had children , back in the days when almost no one i knew worked from home
the joke then was that when i showed up at the office , it was because i was getting lonely and wanted to hang out
having kids completely flipped the script , and telecommuting suddenly went from luxury to necessity
my husband continued working full - time , and i started juggling
you wo n't ever truly understand the meaning of " hustle " until you 've tried to do anything while taking care of children at the same time
ceo right : @entity4 workers must show up but here 's the thing : being stuck between the rock of workplace imperatives and the hard place of home mandates is not new to any of us working mothers , and we all know that the trade - offs you have to make in that position are almost never easy or simple
the difference is that @entity93 's experience is far more public and high - stakes , and half the world is second - guessing her
@entity93 is running a public company , with more than 11,000 employees
is it possible that as @entity4 's chief , she is privy to a fact or two that you and i might not know and understand about the larger predicament @entity4 finds itself in ? absolutely
@entity93 did not take over a healthy company and disrupt an effective culture that has been working well
@entity4 is in trouble and has been for a long time
( full disclosure : i very briefly wrote a column for @entity4 last year
) and as much as we all swear up and down that we are happier and more productive working from home , this is not necessarily ( and objectively ) so
tech execs question @entity4 's work - from - the - office edict last summer while on assignment at the @entity120 , i interviewed @entity121 , an @entity122 research scientist and ceo of @entity124
@entity121 and his colleagues at @entity122 and @entity126 have been engaged in a process called " reality mining " -- analyzing the constant trail of data that we leave behind about ourselves via e-mail , instant messaging patterns , phone logs and meeting information -- to come up with insights about work productivity and satisfaction
he helps companies translate these insights into concrete ways to enhance people 's experience at work , as well as to increase productivity
testing those insights across dozens of companies in different industries , @entity121 has found that face - to - face communication , friendships and social interaction at work make people more productive and happier
" obviously there 's a big difference between working from home every day of the year and telecommuting occasionally , " @entity121 told me yesterday
" there are pros and cons to both arguments , but when you look at the data alone , there is compelling evidence that individuals coming in to work physically at @entity4 may benefit the company
" as he writes in his forthcoming book , " @entity175 , " " a large , robust body of research indicates that companies need to figure out some way to get employees together face to face , because remote work tools just are n't cutting it
... when making the decision to work from home , employees must weigh personal needs against the negative impact it will have on their colleagues and on them as an individual
" " it 's easy for us to armchair quarterback , " observes @entity185 , " but @entity2 is in it , and at this point i 'm assuming she 's making the best decisions with the information she has
" the mother of two young children , @entity185 is the former co-president and current emeritus board member of the @entity193 of @entity194 and @entity195 , a nonprofit to which many @entity197 parents belong
like me , @entity185 would have been completely out of the paid workforce without the ability to work from home when her children were born
for almost a decade now , she has worked as a consultant , as well as for a nonprofit tech startup that was completely virtual
@entity4 work - from - home policy riles workers everywhere @entity185 is willing to give @entity93 the benefit of doubt for now , but she observes that " like most things , workplace flexibility is not something that is an either / or issue
" @entity185 believes that while @entity4 's strategy may make sense in the short - term as a reboot or in a crisis situation , it is unlikely to be sustainable in the long run
given the culture of @entity197 , where so many highly successful companies offer a good amount of flexibility when it comes to working from home , an employer that sets rigid and immutable standards on this issue risks shutting out a large segment of potential talent and making itself undesirable to others
what about the charge that the impact of @entity93 's decision is sure to be felt disproportionately by the working mothers at @entity4 ? should n't @entity93 " get it " because she is a new mom ? " that 's essentialist nonsense in my feminist book , " @entity185 says
" we all experience motherhood and fatherhood in different ways
if we would n't be asking this same question about a male ceo who just had a baby , then i 'm just not interested in going there with a female one
" as much as @entity93 's decision strikes a nerve for working moms , some of us are feeling a troubling sense of @entity255 vu about the damned if she does , damned if she does n't scenario she finds herself in
and at least for now , we are willing to reserve judgment
