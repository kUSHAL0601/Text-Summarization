-- she 's the latest teen prodigy to emerge from golf 's conveyor belt and if she keeps producing stellar performances like this 15 - year - old @entity5 may well shelve her plans to stay an amateur
the @entity8 stormed to the top of the leaderboard at the @entity11 in @entity12 with a ten - under - par round of 63 that included 11 birdies , one eagle and , astonishingly , three bogeys
@entity18 's round meant she eclipsed her playing partners , world no. 1 @entity23 and @entity25 @entity24 , another player who grabbed worldwide attention when she qualified for the women 's @entity28 aged just 10
the teenager , who was born in @entity31 , won her third professional tournament last week in her native @entity33 and leads by a shot in @entity12 from @entity37 @entity36
and despite giving notice of her intentions , even if she were to win the Â £ 1.2 million tournament , she wo n't be able to claim any prize money as she still is still an amateur
" after my bogey on my first hole , which was the 10th , i thought ' what 's today going to be like ? ' but after a couple of birdies , i started to feel pretty comfortable , " she told the tournament 's official website
@entity18 needed just 30 shots to complete her front nine holes and her illustrious playing partners thought she could be on course for a record - breaking round of 59
but @entity18 played down that it was on her mind during her round : " i 've played good before and gone triple , par bogey or whatever
i did n't really think about what i was going to shoot
it was one shot at a time
'' her performance certainly made a lasting impression on her partners
" playing with @entity5 , five - under ( par ) is like nothing , " said @entity23 , from @entity66
" she still looks like 15
i do n't know how she hits the ball that well
i 'm not even close to her at 15
" she is only 15 but she looks like a pro , so i mean i treat her like a pro , but i treat her like a child , too
i feel i 'm getting old , " the 24 - year - old added
@entity18 might now shelve plans to go to college and hone her game there in favor of turning professional
her coach and mentor @entity81 hinted at the prospect after her victory at the @entity85
he told @entity86 : " realistically she 's probably going to look to turn pro next year , only because the opportunities now are pretty obvious
wasting two years at college could be a disadvantage , " the @entity11 has a purse of $ 1.2 million but as an amateur , @entity18 wo n't be able to share in the spoils even if she ends up winning
but she does look set to improve on her official world ranking of 30
@entity18 's tally of ten - under is the lowest score ever recorded at the @entity97 , trumping @entity98 's nine - under 64 in @entity99 13 years ago
but due to preferred lies being in operation , where a player can clean and place their ball as long as it is on the fairway , due to several parts of the course being wet from over watering , @entity100 will not go into the record books .
