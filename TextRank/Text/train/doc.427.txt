-- long established as the premier portal for sound , your ears are facing increased competition from emerging techniques for transmission through your skeleton
bone conduction has rapidly become a critical asset for treatment of hearing loss
while a new generation of cochlear implants has had spectacular success in recent years , they rely on air conduction and the patient possessing a functional pathway from outer to inner ear
for patients with severely damaged pathways , such implants offer no solution
@entity28 ( bone anchored hearing aids ) units work by passing sound from a microphone to a magnet or implant beneath a patient 's skin , which is converted into vibrations in the skull and eventually arrives at the inner ear
this process extends the miracle of restored hearing to victims of such conditions as microtia or atresia , where the ear or canal is closed or deformed
" it 's the natural spectrum of sound compared with traditional hearing " , says @entity48 , spokesperson of hearing treatment company @entity49
" even with amplification it 's the same , there 's no distortion
" the company recently launched a wireless @entity28 set , an indication of the technology 's progress and growing popularity
implants have become smaller and less invasive , while cosmetics have improved so that the system can be worn without advertising it
bone conduction is not a new discovery
@entity70 overcame deafness by biting a metal rod attached to his piano to hear his work
neither do they need to be compensation for disability - such systems have been used by military in environments that require awareness as well as audio instructions
a member of the seal team which killed @entity85 wrote in his autobiography that bone conduction communication was critical to co-ordinating the raid
the innovation is beginning to seep into consumer electronics
in the early 2000s , headphone sets appeared that played music via the user 's bones , but the systems were hamstrung by high cost and low quality , with common complaints about muffled and distorted sound
the makers of @entity102 believe they have solved those problems with a unit that retails for $ 79
" the difficulty for bone conduction has been transmitting vibrations through bone with enough power for music , you need to be on the 20 - 20,000 hz frequency range , " says ceo @entity105
" we have been able to power dual transducers with enough vibration to make the sound musical , which has been our big breakthrough
" the bone conduction system offers key safety advantages over traditional earphones , by leaving the user 's ears free so that they are not distracted from their environment
it is even possible to drive wearing them , as they comply with the legal requirement to be able to hear on the road
the @entity130 of @entity131 have also supported the concept , stating that it causes less damage to the ears than ear buds
a flood of competitors are entering the market and innovation is not limited to headphones
@entity141 are using bone conduction rather than ear buds for their speaker system , although there have been teething problems
multiple patents are emerging for underwater and deep sea communication systems , and the technology has become cheap and accessible enough to be viable for novelty items such as talking pillows
the field has even expanded to offer audio communications through diverse body parts including the teeth and eyes
" in theory you can hear from anywhere " , says dr. @entity157 , ear biomechanics expert at @entity159
" although practically there would be disruption by having to pass through soft tissue depending on the point of contact
" the technology has offered a new dimension to advertisers , with @entity171 trialling a system on @entity174 trains that plays targeted messages to commuters as they lean against the window
the company claim a positive public reaction , and promise the concept will deliver social benefits through delivering announcements and emergency warnings
but the scheme has been controversial , with civil liberty activists arguing it is invasive and delivers content without consent
dr. @entity157 foresees another ethical concern
" as it vibrates your skull to generate sound , others around you can also potentially hear a message sent to you , so there will be privacy issues
that 's a problem that needs to be solved
" but he believes the major technological hurdles have been overcome
" there has been tremendous progress , from miniaturization , to wearable and wireless , so that we have reached the holy grail of not requiring earphones
" from medicine to entertainment , from reef diving to sleeping in our beds , we may have to get used to a whole new set of voices in our head
