-- @entity6 will not deliver new weapons to @entity8 so long as the situation in that country is unstable , an official at the body in charge of monitoring @entity6 's arms trade said monday , state media reported
" @entity6 , as well as other countries , is concerned by the situation in @entity8 , " said @entity11 , deputy head of the @entity12 for @entity13 , @entity14 reported
" we are not talking about new arms supplies to that country
" " until the situation stabilizes we will not deliver any new weapons ( to @entity8 ) , " said @entity11
he specifically said @entity6 would not supply @entity8 with @entity22
@entity6 has signed a $ 550 million contract for the delivery of three dozen such planes , @entity14 said
still , it was not clear whether the official was saying @entity6 would discontinue the delivery of all arms , or whether it was stopping just the supply of " new weapons
" the report seemed to leave open the possibility that @entity6 could continue to deliver some arms to @entity8 under existing contracts
the move could be a major blow to @entity8 president @entity38 , who is fighting to stay in control after more than a year of popular protests and a brutal government crackdown
@entity6 has been the long - time principal supplier of arms to @entity8 since the days when it was the @entity44
the weapons sales have more than doubled in recent years
according to @entity46 , @entity6 sold @entity8 $ 4.7 billion in arms from 2007 to 2010 , compared with $ 2.1 billion from 2003 to 2006
@entity48 secretary of state @entity47 said last month the continued supply of arms from @entity6 has strengthened @entity38 's regime , despite denials by @entity6 president @entity53 that any munitions it was providing to @entity8 were being used against its own people
also last month , a shipment of refurbished @entity6 helicopters headed for @entity8 had to turn around and return to @entity6 after its @entity60 insurance company dropped coverage on the ship carrying the helicopters
news of the suspended shipments comes the same day the joint @entity68 - @entity67 envoy to @entity8 said @entity38 has agreed on " an approach " to ending the bloodshed in @entity8
@entity71 made the statement after meeting with @entity38 in @entity73
he then flew to @entity74 for meetings with @entity77 leaders about the @entity8 conflict
@entity71 gave no details of the " approach " @entity38 agreed to but said he vowed to share it with the " armed opposition
" @entity71 also said @entity38 " reassured me of the government 's commitment " to @entity71 's six - point peace plan , brokered in march , which has done nothing to stop the deadly violence
@entity8 said the two men discussed a recent gathering of world leaders in @entity91 , @entity92 , aimed at taking steps to bring peace to @entity8 , " with emphasis on the need for dialogue to be among @entity8 and led by @entity8 " -- a phrase emphasizing @entity8 's resistance to foreign intervention of any sort in the conflict
later , @entity71 announced he was in @entity74 " to discuss the situation in @entity8 " and " to see how we can work together to help settle the situation
" @entity77 's state - run @entity106 said he planned to " hold talks with senior officials
" even as @entity71 was in @entity8 , @entity38 's regime reported it had conducted live - fire training exercises that simulated a defense against foreign attacks
throughout the 16 - month uprising , the regime has blamed violence on armed terrorist groups involving people from outside @entity8
at least 41 people were killed monday as the @entity8 regime continued its crackdown , according to the @entity122 opposition group
it said at least 60 people were killed in fighting sunday
monday 's violence included house - to - house raids and arrests in @entity128 and " very intense shelling " in @entity130 , with helicopters flying overhead , the @entity122 said
eighteen of the deaths were in @entity133 , the @entity122 said
gruesome video from the town of @entity136 in @entity133 showed blood - soaked bodies being dumped onto pickup trucks amid apparent destruction
a man is heard yelling , " @entity143 " ( " @entity144 is great " ) and calling the dead " victims of the indiscriminate shelling
" as with so many other videos that have emerged from the conflict , it was impossible to know the full story behind the images
heavy gunfire also erupted monday in the northern @entity151 state of @entity154 near the border with @entity8 , the official @entity151 news agency reported
a number of shells fell inside @entity151 territory , it said
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of violence as @entity8 has severely limited the access of international journalists
@entity8 state - run tv , meanwhile , broadcast what it called " confessions of four terrorists who admitted to committing murder , rape , abduction and robbery , in addition to smuggling weapons and gunmen , in @entity130 ' countryside
" the so - called confessions aired sunday , state - run news agency @entity176 reported monday
it said one of the terrorists " started off by being part of a group that attempted to incite people to protest , and his job was to transport protesters from mosques to squares in the town of @entity187
" @entity176 reported that on monday , authorities " clashed with an armed terrorist group " on the outskirts of @entity192
the @entity68 says more than 10,000 people , mostly civilians , have been killed in the violence in @entity8
opposition groups give an even higher figure
the violence erupted in march 2011 when @entity8 forces launched a brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrations , part of the @entity203 that swept through several countries
while members of the @entity206 , which includes the @entity48 , have called for an end to the violence and for @entity38 to step aside , efforts to adopt a resolution that would allow for aid to the rebels have been blocked by @entity6 and @entity213 , key @entity8 trade partners
@entity6 and @entity213 are strongly opposed to armed intervention , saying the outcome in @entity8 should be decided by its people
@entity0 's @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .
