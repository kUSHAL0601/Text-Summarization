@entity3 , @entity2 @entity2 searchers battling bad weather in their efforts to find more remains from @entity8 have so far recovered seven bodies from the sea , officials said wednesday
a day after the first bits of debris from the commercial jet were spotted afloat off the coast of @entity16 , the search operation was hampered wednesday by big waves , strong winds and heavy rain
helicopters scanning for signs of wreckage and victims were halted in their search , while ships continued combing the waters
it was unclear how long aerial operations would be held up
answers about why the aircraft , with 162 people on board , fell from the sky sunday remained elusive
among the seven bodies recovered so far -- not 10 , as earlier reports had indicated -- was that of a woman wearing a flight attendant 's uniform , said @entity39 , @entity2 's national search and rescue chief
" reality of seeing the evacuees and some of my aircraft parts are soul destroying , " @entity42 ceo @entity41 tweeted
the air executive also put to rest rumors of a survivor found in a life jacket , saying that only the life jacket was found in the water
@entity54 may have detected wreckage there was conflicting information about whether any parts of the plane had been found underwater
one search official told @entity4 that he believes sonar equipment has detected wreckage from the plane at the bottom of the sea but could n't confirm it
" i think that that 's the case , " said @entity65 , the head of search and rescue for @entity3 , the @entity2 city where @entity69 began its journey sunday
but in a news conference wednesday , @entity41 denied this , saying sonar imaging has yet to detect anything
" @entity77 teams are doing a fantastic job
they are narrowing the search and they are feeling more comfortable they are beginning to know where it is
but there is no confirmation of them
no sonar ... nothing " @entity39 was also cautious , denying reports that searchers had found the plane 's main fuselage
" until now , we have n't found the plane , " he said , according to @entity2 's national news agency @entity94
search teams are looking for other bodies and parts of the plane , including its so - called black boxes
those could help investigators determine what went wrong on the flight , which lost contact with air traffic controllers after the pilot asked to change course and move to a higher altitude because of bad weather
