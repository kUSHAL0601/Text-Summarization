-- a 36 - year - old man goes out with some friends
they hit a handful of bars
the 36 - year - old has some drinks
at the end of the night last may , as the last bar closes , he decides to slide down the railing of the stairs heading out
he loses his balance and falls backward
he dies from a skull fracture
his blood alcohol level was .25 , more than four times the @entity17 threshold
who 's responsible ? before you answer that , let me tell you another story
last april , a man goes out drinking with friends to celebrate his 21st birthday
he ends the night at the same bar the 36 - year - old ended his last night at
as life would have it , he , too , decided to slide down the railing
he , too , lost his balance
he , too , fell back four stories
the death certificate stated " acute ethanol intoxication " played a role in his death
in 2009 another partying 21 - year - old fell to his death in that same stairwell
now who do you think is to blame , the bar or the patron ? because the stairwell was up to code , i believe the fault lies with the patron
the @entity47 is going after the bar
last week at a state hearing , officials recommended suspending the liquor license for 10 days for the @entity53 , @entity47 , four - story , 70,000 - square - foot multi-venue entertainment hub affectionately known as @entity54 ( short for @entity55 )
the punishment is for what officials believe is a culture of over-serving customers , which the bar says it has taken steps to avoid
after the 36 - year - old 's death , many in the area went online to point an angry cyberfinger at the bar 's owner for not making it safer for drunk people to slide down railings 40 feet in the air
anyone who questioned the decision of the deceased was deemed insensitive
much in the same way , some @entity76 were upset there were n't more lifesavers along the city 's river , after a drunk man hopped a fence , ignored the " park closed " signs , fell into the icy waters and died
why did he venture out to the slick and slushy banks during what has become the coldest @entity90 winter in 30 years ? to retrieve a dropped cellphone that landed on a broken shard of ice
a friend he was with also died that night trying to save him
these are all sad , tragic stories
but they come with the territory
@entity99 was repealed in 1933 because we the people wanted the freedom to drink
and as with all freedom there exists the burden of personal responsibility
we have age restrictions , we severely punish law breakers , we educate consumers and make public service announcements like " @entity111
" yet nearly 90,000 people still die from excessive drinking every year , according to the @entity114
what are we gon na do ? go back to @entity99 -- because you know , the war on drugs is so successful ? -- or recognize government can detour behavior but it ca n't legislate away stupid
case in point : the @entity124 pastor who starred in a reality tv show about snake - handling in church who died last week from a snakebite
so if you 're the kind of person who thinks it 's cool to drink large quantities of alcohol out of a toilet -- which one participant in the social media drinking game " @entity139 " was photographed doing -- i 'm more prone to give you the side - eye than blame @entity142
nonetheless , because at least five people have died playing the game , @entity142 was compelled to issue a statement which read in part : " we do not tolerate content which is directly harmful , for example bullying , but behavior which some people may find offensive or controversial is not always necessarily against our rules
" which sounds reasonable to me but was n't enough for dr. @entity154 , a medical adviser for the @entity156 - based charity drinkaware
she said @entity142 should remove the videos , noting " if the thrill was n't there , your mates were n't seeing you , i expect it would very rapidly fizzle out
" she 's right in that @entity139 -- a game in which players post video of themselves drinking a large amount of alcohol while doing something crazy and then challenge friends to outdo them -- may lose popularity in its current incarnation
but as the recent tragedies in small cities like @entity53 and large ones like @entity90 point out , @entity139 is n't the issue
the issue is n't alcohol
while i understand the desire to want to save everyone from themselves , i also understand that we ca n't
alcohol is legal , and every year tens of millions of people consume without incident
and every year tens of thousands of people die of an alcohol - related death
some as innocent victims , some because of addiction and some because of a bad decision
that 's the deal we made back in 1933 , and i doubt we 'll go back
one of the @entity139 participants drank alcohol mixed with motor oil
@entity201 oil ! i refuse to make that @entity203 's fault
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .
