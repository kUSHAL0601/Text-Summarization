a @entity1 cruise ship terminal was evacuated for more than two hours wednesday morning when customs officials detected radiation from a passenger bag
the radiation , they discovered , was being emitted from a @entity7 - era compass
@entity9 spokesman @entity8 said officers from the agency detected radiation coming from a couple 's bag as they disembarked from a cruise ship trip
passengers in the terminal were evacuated , and other passengers were told to remain on the ship
the source of the radiation , @entity8 said , was discovered to be an old compass
after the compass was found to be safe , it was returned to the owner , he said
@entity9 officers wear radiation devices , similar in size to pagers , to detect possible threats
but the sensitive devices can also detect naturally occurring radiation in such substances as ceramics and kitty litter , and even in people recently treated with nuclear medicines
@entity8 said @entity37 explosives detection canine support and @entity39 hazardous materials units responded to the scene .
