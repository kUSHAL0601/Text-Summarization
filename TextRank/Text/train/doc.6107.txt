@entity0 , @entity1 -- for many @entity5 veterans it 's a trip they thought they 'd never take ; returning to @entity1 , the land where so many of their brothers - in - arms lost their lives
a mist hangs in the surrounding hills of the @entity11 as dozens of returning veterans gather to honor the dead
it 's a difficult but necessary journey for most of them as they commemorate the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the fighting in the @entity19
" i was in the @entity21 in july 1953 and i remember the sounds of artillery and fighting
that is not something that you will forget
i never intended to come back to @entity1
it 's not like i did n't like the country but just did n't need to see it , " says @entity5 veteran @entity28
almost two million @entity33 civilians lost their lives during the war as well as more than 200,000 @entity1 and about 36,000 @entity5 soldiers by the time the ceasefire was declared in 1953

some veterans now need canes and wheelchairs to help them complete the 40 - meter stretch
sixty years on , they are n't the strapping teenagers they once were , the years show in the wrinkles crisscrossing their faces but the memories are still fresh
" the @entity19 was very dangerous and i lost a lot of friends , " says veteran @entity59
" i remember all the battles i was in
i lost a lot of friends and saw a lot of people wounded
" for infantryman @entity68 it 's a journey he wanted to share with his two daughters , son and granddaughter
for him , it was about closing a chapter in his life , but for his children it was a chance to understand what the war was like
it 's @entity79 's first time back since he left the peninsula in 1954
long gone are the dirt roads and huts
asphalt and high - rises have taken their place
but the memories of a young , scared 18 - year - old rush back among the tombstones

when i 'm saying do the real thing that was just a figure of talk at that time , because in all fairness i was a very , very scared kid and i had a lot of fear in me , " says @entity68
the lively 81 - year - old widower 's memory does n't fail as he recalls in descriptive detail to his family the two years he spent in @entity1
" to be with him here now ... i can see a huge difference in his emotions and how trying to gather everything that happened it 's unbelievable , absolutely unbelievable , " says @entity68 's granddaughter , @entity102
his daughter , @entity108 , added : " the great connection and almost a closure for my father to see a country in such despair and to see a country again with such prosperity
" the thought of the war has brought up mixed emotions from the veterans
some of them express anger , sorrow and fear but most come to the same general conclusion

it disrupted a lot of lives of the @entity5 and lives of the @entity91
at the time , you always wondered if it was worth it
to think about it now , it accomplished a lot to the region and the world 's order
" " do n't tell the veterans that the war was nonsense , " says @entity68 with a sense of defiance and pride
" it stopped the spread of communism in @entity151
" the ceremony honoring the dead does n't last long , less than a half hour
the veterans salute the memorial , pour incense into a smoldering pot flanked by two giant statues and say their silent prayers
but for @entity79 it ca n't last long enough
" we were never told to cry and it makes you cry because we are the survivors
we are just a little patch of what we did
sure we survived for our country
the people who died should have these honors
