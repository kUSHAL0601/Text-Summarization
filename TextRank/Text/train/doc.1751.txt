-- it 's called the " @entity2
" this newest big - box store is devoted to selling marijuana - growing equipment
its biggest outlet yet is to open wednesday in @entity7 , where @entity9 voters approved medical cannabis last fall
the @entity11 will be the first outside @entity12 , where medical weed has long been legalized
none of the chain 's three stores sell the drug
instead , they unabashedly promote medical marijuana by offering " everything -- from supplies to services -- that cultivators need to grow it , " the company says
what sets @entity11 apart from the mom - and - pop stores selling the growing supplies is that @entity11 openly states its hydroponic equipment is intended for pot , a spokeswoman said
the smaller stores often claim the hydroponic equipment is used for growing indoor tomatoes and often kick out a customer if they broach the subject of medical cannabis , said @entity11 spokeswoman @entity37
while 16 states and the @entity40 now allow for some sort of medical marijuana , there remains ambiguity about whether @entity45 authorities would ever enforce federal laws against marijuana distribution , though 90 % of hydroponics revenue is from cannabis growers , @entity37 said
in fact , the state of @entity9 filed a federal lawsuit last week asking the courts to determine whether the voter - approved initiative legalizing medical marijuana is , indeed , legal
calling itself " the nation 's only hydroponics franchise that openly talks about medical marijuana , " the @entity56 , @entity12 - based @entity11 sees a boom in @entity9 and projects 100,000 @entity62 acquiring state medical cannabis cards , @entity37 said
so far , about 4,000 @entity62 became state - authorized marijuana users after the state began issuing the cards on april 15 , @entity37 said
@entity11 chose wednesday to open its superstore because that was supposed to be the day the state was scheduled to begin accepting applications to run a marijuana dispensary
but @entity9 gov. @entity71 and attorney general @entity72 filed a federal lawsuit friday seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the legality of @entity76
voters approved the @entity78 last november and @entity71 signed it into law in december
nonetheless , the federal government considers marijuana a controlled substance
in a may 2 , 2011 , letter , @entity45 attorney @entity83 of @entity9 warned state officials that " growing , distributing and possessing marijuana , in any capacity , other than as a federally authorized research program , is a violation of federal law regardless of state laws that purport to permit such activities , " according to @entity71
@entity83 declared that his office would " vigorously prosecute individuals and organizations that participate in unlawful manufacturing , distribution and marketing activity involving marijuana , even if such activities are permitted under state law , " according to @entity71 's office
" @entity104 of @entity9 has worked to follow the wishes of voters , " @entity71 said in a statement
" but i wo n't stand aside while state employees and average @entity62 acting in good faith are unwittingly put at risk
in light of the explicit warnings on this issue offered by @entity9 's @entity83 , as well as many other federal prosecutors , clarity and judicial direction are in order
" @entity71 has directed that the @entity118 put on hold its process for licensing marijuana dispensaries , pending court action on this issue , @entity71 's spokesman , @entity117 , told @entity0 on tuesday
" the agency will continue providing registration cards for individuals who receive a doctor 's recommendation to use medical marijuana , " @entity117 said in an e-mail
@entity11 founder @entity129 , a 27 - year - old entrepreneur who opened his first store in @entity56 after a small hydroponics store ejected him for asking about medical marijuana cultivation , said his firm still sees an opportunity in @entity9 , where he estimates medical pot to be a billion - dollar industry
he has plans for similar superstores in other states with legal marijuana
the @entity7 store , located in an industrial area so as not to upset any homeowners , will be 21,000 square feet
wednesday 's grand opening in @entity7 will feature indoor growing demonstrations with nonmarijuana plants , experts on how to build professional grow rooms , a physician for patient evaluations and classes on how to safely and responsibly cultivate medical marijuana , @entity11 officials said
the first @entity11 store was a 15,000 - square - foot facility that opened in @entity56 last year , and in february , a 10,000 - square - foot store opened in @entity158 , @entity12 , a spokeswoman said
@entity129 said the @entity9 law allows for up to 124 dispensaries , and he took exception with the governor 's lawsuit
" delaying the process that a majority of the @entity9 voters have asked for prevents qualified cannabis patients from receiving medicine they need and causes unfair financial hardship to businesspeople who have invested tens of thousands of dollars in reliance on the process set up by the state , " @entity129 said in a statement
" medical marijuana cultivating , dispensing , and consuming will exist with or without governmental approval , " @entity129 said
" it 's time to tax and regulate this industry so legitimate business people and patients are not criminalized
