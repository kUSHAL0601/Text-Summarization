@entity0 , @entity1 -- this could amount to some pretty pricey sushi
a giant bluefin tuna caught off the coast of northern @entity1 went for a record 32.49 million yen ( about $ 396,000 ) at an auction wednesday , the @entity5 said
the price was the highest for a tuna since the market began keeping track in 1999
it all breaks down to about 95,000 yen per kilogram , or about $ 527 a pound , for the 342 - kilogram ( 754 - pound ) fish
the bluefin , caught off @entity19 in northern @entity1 , was " an excellent quality " said @entity21 , the owner of the high - end @entity23 sushi restaurant in @entity0
the catch will be split by @entity21 and @entity26 's @entity25
" it became a bit too expensive , " @entity21 said answering questions after the record bidding
" but the people would talk about it a while
" @entity35 auction , the first of 2011 , typically brings some of the highest prices of the year and is considered to be very symbolic
the record price reflects the increasing demand for high - quality fresh tuna , especially throughout @entity41 , with competition between @entity1 and @entity44 buyers intensifying in recent years
@entity2 's @entity45 contributed to this report .
