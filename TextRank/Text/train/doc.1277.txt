-- the militants pulled into the northeastern @entity3 village of @entity4 under cover of darkness , their target a girls ' boarding school filled with students ahead of final year exams
armed and wearing military uniforms , they told the girls they were there to protect them
the girls started to assemble in the yard as ordered to , not realizing the men were from @entity18 -- the group whose name roughly translates as " @entity21 education is sin " -- until it was too late
more than 200 were loaded onto trucks and spirited away : the group 's leader later announced that he would sell them
since the mass abduction on april 14 , the world 's attention has been focused on @entity4 , but @entity0 was the first global news organization to send a team to the scene of the atrocity
the journey from the relative safety of @entity3 's capital , @entity36 , to the remote countryside stalked by @entity18 can take eight to 10 hours , but logistics and security concerns meant that it took @entity0 international correspondent @entity41 's team four days to complete the trek
for most of the route , the road was tarmacked and the team constantly stopped at checkpoints manned by the military , police or vigilantes looking out for militants
but for the final 45 minutes the tarmac and checkpoints disappeared and the team swerved through the bleak , potholed landscape at full speed with flak jackets beside them
