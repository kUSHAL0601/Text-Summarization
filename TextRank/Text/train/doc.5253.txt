-- a @entity2 court has approved the divorce of the father of @entity5 , a @entity2 girl who disappeared in february , and the girl 's stepmother , a key witness in the case
@entity10 divorced his wife , @entity11 , who was the last person to see his daughter , @entity12
@entity10 , 25 , cites irreconcilable differences in ending his short marriage to his 17 - year - old wife , whom he married more than a month after @entity12 went missing from her father 's home in @entity18 , @entity2 , on february 9
@entity5 has made several public pleas for information in her disappearance
@entity22 , then known as @entity23 , was the last person known to have seen @entity12 the night she disappeared from the family 's rented mobile home
the teenager said she tucked @entity12 and her 4 - year - old brother into bed about 8 p.m. and went to sleep herself two hours later , but awoke at 3 a.m. to find the girl missing and a cinder block propping open a back door
@entity10 called police and reported his daughter missing when he returned from work at dawn
investigators have said they do not feel @entity22 has told them everything she knows
" the police have been telling me that i 've been keeping @entity11 under my wing and that 's why she has n't talked to the cops , " @entity10 told a @entity39 's " @entity40 " producer earlier in october
" so now , here you go , i divorced her
so now go find my baby
" the @entity48 sheriff 's office said in august that " the evidence and investigatory effort has minimized the likelihood that @entity12 's disappearance is the work of a stranger
" @entity10 and @entity56 , @entity12 's mother , are not considered suspects , police said
" investigators believe that @entity63 continues to hold important answers in the case , " the sheriff 's office said in a written statement
" she has failed to provide any sort of detailed accounting of the hours during the late evening and early morning of @entity12 's disappearance
furthermore , physical evidence at the scene contradicts @entity11 's sketchy account of her evening activities
" @entity23 has not been named a person of interest or suspect in the case
in televised interviews , @entity23 has said she does not know what happened to the little girl , while also saying she believed " the other side of the family " knows where she is
the couple lived together for about six months before marrying in march
under the divorce settlement approved thursday by a @entity86 court , both sides permanently and irrevocably waive any rights to alimony and other types of financial payments .
