-- @entity1 stayed on course to add the @entity3 to their @entity5 triumph of last season with a dramatic 2 - 1 win over @entity8 in their semifinal first leg match in @entity10 thursday
@entity1 put on a display in @entity8 's @entity12 which had echoes of their commanding performances in @entity17 's premier club competition 12 months ago and grabbed a last gasp victory thanks to an injury time goal from @entity21
the @entity23 side had led after an early goal from @entity26 international @entity25 , but the home side drew level with a late @entity30 penalty
the equalizer sparked a late @entity1 charge and @entity34 star @entity21 found the net from a free kick , his low shot eluding @entity38 in the home goal
" it 's difficult to win here and to score the second goal with the last kick of the match was amazing for us , " a delighted @entity21 told @entity40 after his dramatic late intervention
in the other semifinal , @entity49 's @entity48 will take a 1 - 0 lead to @entity52 for the second leg after beating @entity54
@entity48 dominated the match and @entity56 saw his penalty in the first half strike the base of the post
they also hit the woodwork with two other efforts until @entity62 made the breakthrough in the 72nd minute with a strong header from a corner
@entity54 's best effort saw @entity67 strike the post with a curling shot and they will be looking to retrieve the narrow deficit in their home tie in @entity73
famous fan @entity8 had reached the last four by beating another @entity23 side @entity75 on penalties , but watched by tennis maestro and football fan @entity78 they found @entity1 a tougher proposition
@entity25 headed the visitors in front in the 12th minute from a @entity83 corner and they might have added to their advantage before the halftime interval
@entity8 improved after the break and @entity87 hit the post with a shot with @entity90 beaten
at the other end @entity91 also struck the woodwork after a cut back by @entity95
but late on @entity97 's seeemingly innocuous challenge on @entity87 saw the home side awarded a surprise penalty
@entity30 kept his nerve to beat @entity90 but @entity1 responded with a series of telling attacks and @entity103 was left shaking his head as @entity105 saved his point blank headed effort
but @entity109 's men reserved the best to last as @entity87 fouled @entity110 25 meters out and @entity21 performed his late heroics
it left @entity1 in an excellent position to finally capture a trophy under the interim reign of @entity109 , having exited after the group stages of their defense of the @entity5 .
