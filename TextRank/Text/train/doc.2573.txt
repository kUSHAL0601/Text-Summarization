-- there are certain elements of leadership that survive the centuries -- that are classical , says @entity5 , co-author of " @entity6 : the @entity7 between @entity8
" and while these features are n't necessarily a guarantee of success in the modern world , they can provide professionals with a framework around which success can be built , he says
so which leaders from the ancient past should you be looking to model your career on ? @entity22 ( 356 - 323 bc ) @entity22 of @entity23 is the standard for leadership by which all others are measured , @entity5 says
but does he merit his place as a leadership icon ? " it 's questionable , " says @entity5
on the one hand , @entity22 had a capacity for intense focus and was willing to sacrifice friends , family and personal fortunes to reach the top
but ambition fueled by a massive ego eventually proved to be @entity22 's undoing , @entity5 argues
having defeated @entity42 in the @entity43 , the @entity41 king offered the marauding youngster the western half of his @entity46 in return for his family who had been captured by the @entity50 army
@entity22 's most senior commander , @entity51 , urged his young master to accept @entity42 's proposal and consolidate his power in the region
but @entity22 ignored the advice , choosing instead to resume his conquest , capturing the @entity41 capital of @entity59 before hunting down and killing @entity42
from there , @entity22 continued eastwards conquering large parts of south central @entity62 before heading to @entity63
but it was here that @entity22 's exhausted army refused to carry on , thus ending his eastern escapade
ancient quote : " i see no limits to what a man of ability can accomplish
" modern lesson : youth is no barrier to success
be bold and learn to focus on your task , but do n't let your ambition or ego cloud your judgment
listen to the advice of those more experienced than yourself
@entity85 ( circa 435 - circa 354 bc ) an aristocrat by birth , @entity85 was a @entity88 military leader
but unlike @entity22 , @entity85 did n't command by the force of his personality , says @entity5 , but sought to forge a consensus
" what makes @entity85 so unique as a leader is that he 's not a soldier , he 's a philosopher
he is elected by the soldiers to be one of the leaders based on his ability to articulate a course of action for them , " @entity5 said
@entity85 was a student of @entity103 and did n't believe in democratic rule but he actually functioned as a democratic leader , @entity5 says , leading a potentially unruly army of @entity88 mercenaries successfully out of @entity108 by occupying the middle ground
ancient quote : " in life a leader must resign himself to expect anything and never count on anyone but himself
" modern lesson : tailor your message to your audience and be sensitive to the moods and opinions of the people you manage
@entity123 ( 63 bc - ad 14 ) @entity124 famously built the @entity125 by conquest , but it was @entity123 , his nephew and first @entity129 , who administered it and took it to its greatest heights , says @entity5
@entity123 believed that the conquering achievements of @entity22 were actually easy when compared to the task of administering and building an empire , @entity5 says
" he was a great administrator who made the political and economic foundation of @entity139 that lasted for the next 300 years , " @entity5 said
ancient quote : " that which has been done well enough has been done quickly enough
" modern lesson : @entity123 said : " make haste slowly
" in other words , @entity5 says , move cautiously and thoughtfully in everything you do
@entity147 ( 69 bc - 30 bc ) @entity149 's last pharaoh is often feted for her seductive beauty
but @entity147 was also a woman of high intelligence , as evidenced by her grasp of several languages , says @entity154 , assistant professor of classics at @entity156 in @entity157
" one of our principal sources for @entity147 's life , @entity162 ( the 2nd century biographer ) , says that in fact she rarely needed an interpreter to deliver her decisions to the representatives of foreign peoples , " @entity154 said
she was a tenacious and resourceful leader who adopted a " hands - on " approach to power , consolidating her position through civil war with her brother and sister ( @entity175 and @entity176 ) , he says
furthermore , @entity177 says , " she was a realist and was n't afraid to gamble on bringing in a more powerful ally when that was what the situation called for , " as shown by her personal and political courtship of @entity124 and @entity139
ancient quote : @entity177 says @entity147 's attitude to power and life could be best summed up with the phrase , " let it be done
" modern lesson : leaders who back up their god - given attributes with hard work and imagination can create a formidable business package .
