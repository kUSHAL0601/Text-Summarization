@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's president and the newly elected president of @entity5 signed a landmark agreement on wednesday that signals an end to years of enmity between the two former @entity10 republics
@entity1 agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to @entity5 , in exchange for permission to extend @entity1 's lease of a major naval base in the @entity19 port of @entity20 , @entity5 , for 25 years
seated @entity23 , @entity1 president @entity21 and @entity5 president @entity22 announced the agreement at the end of a one - day summit in the eastern @entity5 border city of @entity28
" we have indeed reached an unprecedented agreement , " @entity21 said
" the rent [ for the naval base ] will be increased by an amount equivalent to that of the [ gas price ] discount
" the agreement may bring an end to years of disputes over natural gas prices , which culminated in @entity1 turning off the pipeline to @entity5
the gas dispute left @entity5 and many @entity42 who depend on @entity1 gas pumped through @entity5 shivering
@entity5 and @entity1 had been at odds ever since the " @entity46 " swept @entity22 's @entity48 predecessor @entity47 to power in 2005
throughout his time in office , @entity47 repeatedly threatened to expel @entity1 's @entity52 from @entity20
the @entity1 military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017
" the prolongation of the @entity52 's presence in @entity20 is essential to @entity1 , " @entity22 said on wednesday
" we understand that the @entity52 will be one of the guarantors of security on the @entity19
" the @entity61 - friendly @entity22 , who hails from predominantly @entity1 - speaking eastern @entity5 , trounced @entity47 in national elections in january
the @entity1 president said the new deal added a " concrete and pragmatic dimension , " to centuries of relations between @entity5 and @entity1
opposition groups in @entity5 , however , were quick to denounce the agreement
former president @entity47 's " @entity71 " party said the treaty would lead to the " russification " of @entity5
former @entity5 prime minister @entity74 said the agreement violated part of the @entity76 , which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017
according to a spokesman for the @entity1 president , the new accords will be submitted to the @entity1 and @entity5 parliaments for ratification simultaneously on april 27 .
