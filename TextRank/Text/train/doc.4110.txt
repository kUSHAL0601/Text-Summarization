-- @entity1 battled to a three - set victory over @entity5 qualifier @entity3 to reach the final of the @entity8 tournament in @entity9 on saturday
the two - time winner at the @entity12 club will now play top seed @entity13 , who was also taken to three sets before beating @entity16 's @entity15 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 3
the 19 - year - old @entity3 had never won a match in a main @entity8 tour event before the @entity20 warm - up tournament , but did well to hit back after losing the first set to level with a 6 - 4 second set win
but former world number one @entity1 was not to be denied and swept through the decider 6 - 1 to earn a rematch with @entity26 star @entity13 , who beat her in the semifinals last year
" it 'll be good to play her again , " @entity1 told the official @entity8 web site
" a year makes a big difference
i certainly do n't like losing to the same person twice in a row -- i 'm a big competitor
" @entity13 , who lost in last year 's final to @entity37 , said she suffered from a lapse of concentration against the fourth - seeded @entity15 , but recovered to earn another meeting with @entity1
she will be bidding for her career third title on the @entity8 and first since the @entity43 in 2008 , but aside from her 2009 win over @entity1 in @entity9 last year has lost their other five meetings .
