@entity0 -- the @entity3 's chief prosecutor reported friday to the @entity4 that violence continues in @entity6 and that the @entity8 president and his government are not cooperating with investigators
@entity11 noted positive developments in judicial proceedings and " fruitful " cooperation with international bodies , but said there still remain many setbacks
he explained that crimes continue in the region , including " indiscriminate bombings of civilians ... rapes and sexual violence " and the " use of child soldiers
" @entity11 also highlighted @entity8 president @entity27 's role in the situation
" any leader committing crimes will face justice
@entity32 does not provide immunity
" @entity27 has refused to appoint a lawyer to represent his position in court and , because of the @entity3 - issued warrant for his arrest , has not risked traveling to attend high - level events such as the @entity40 or a meeting held by the @entity42 , or to other countries where it had been thought he might go , such as @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48
@entity11 said respect for the @entity3 's decision to issue the warrant would send a clear message that @entity27 " will face justice
" " there was no immunity for president [ @entity59 ] @entity58 [ of the former @entity60 ] , there was no immunity for prime minister [ @entity64 ] @entity63 [ of @entity65 ] , there was no immunity for president [ @entity69 ] @entity68 [ of @entity70 ] , " he said
instead of complying with the @entity4 , @entity27 has used the @entity8 state apparatus " to commit massive crimes " and has attempted to " exacerbate " the conflict in the @entity73 as means of shifting the international community 's attention away from @entity6 , @entity11 said
he also accused @entity27 of " stopping information about the crimes " rather than stopping the crimes themselves
deputy u.s. ambassador to the @entity0 @entity83 called on the @entity8 government to fully cooperate with the @entity3 and its investigations as called for in @entity86 1593
" the @entity87 believes that those responsible for the atrocities in @entity6 must be held accountable " as they " affect the stability of @entity8 as a whole , " she said
@entity83 said the ongoing violence in @entity6 undermines " an already fragile humanitarian situation " and urged all states " to refrain from providing political or financial support " to those charged by the @entity3
@entity11 said his office was considering holding responsible @entity8 officials " who actively deny and dissimulate crimes
" " since @entity103 , due obedience is no longer a legal excuse " for the facilitation of such criminal acts , he said
@entity8 ambassador @entity107 responded by calling @entity11 a " mercenary of death and destruction , " back once more to spread his " illusions " and " catastrophic vision
" " this is a big lie
the war in @entity6 is over , " he said
@entity107 turned to those in the @entity4 who asked for justice , and said they " should feel ashamed " and that their " credibility is at stake , if they have any
" the @entity8 ambassador said @entity11 " would like to prolong the suffering of our people , " and said , " we will charge him with political prostitution
" reiterating his role as prosecutor is " to investigate and prosecute to contribute to the prevention of future crimes , " @entity11 said he is " ready to answer any challenge in court
" however , he acknowledged he would need the @entity4 's full support " to end the current crimes against the people from @entity6
