-- lawmakers in @entity2 on thursday approved a ban on the wearing of burqas and other @entity6 garb that covers a woman 's face but the bill must still be approved by the upper house of parliament before it becomes law
if the @entity13 approves it , @entity2 would become the first country in @entity15 to ban the burqa
the vote in the @entity19 was 136 in favor , none opposed and two abstentions , according to @entity22 , a press officer for the @entity2 parliament
@entity13 passage seems likely since the @entity19 approved it
human rights group @entity26 immediately condemned the vote
members of parliament have said they 're motivated both by security and morality in pushing for the ban
" we think all people in public places must show their face , " @entity32 , of the liberal @entity33 , said earlier this month
" we must defend our values in the question of the freedom and the dignity of the woman
" @entity32 said it 's not true that @entity6 requires women to wear burqas , which cover the whole body and face , or niqabs , veils that cover most of the face except for a small slit for the eyes
" the majority of @entity52 in @entity2 and @entity15 do n't accept the burqa , do n't accept the niqab
it 's only 10 percent who are radical , " he said , blaming trends from @entity57 and @entity58 for encouraging facial covering
he estimated that 300 to 400 women in the country wear the niqab or the burqa
@entity2 may have more than half a million @entity52 among its population of 10.5 million , researchers estimate
@entity68 , a @entity52 political leader in @entity2 , warned earlier this month that the legislation could actually encourage more women to adopt the veil
the bill would impose a fine of 15 - 25 euros ( $ 20 - 33 ) or imprisonment of one to seven days for those who break the law
@entity2 is home to about 281,000 muslims , the @entity79 estimates
that would make the country about 3 percent @entity52
@entity68 , a @entity52 political leader in @entity2 , warned earlier this month that the legislation could actually encourage more women to adopt the veil
one town in @entity2 banned the burqa six years ago
@entity87 , the mayor of the tiny picture - postcard city of @entity89 , said it was no problem to enforce the ban , and that he had the support of the local @entity94 community
some fines were handed out , and although none was paid , no one wears a veil in @entity89 today , he said
@entity0 senior international correspondent @entity99 and @entity0 's @entity100 contributed to this report .
