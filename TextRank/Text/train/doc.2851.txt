@entity0 -- @entity2 claims he and his @entity4 basketball team introduced the high five to @entity6
it 's a big claim , but anything 's possible after the group of fourteen players and coaches held a week of training camps for @entity6 students in the capital , @entity15
" we really wanted to promote basketball , diplomacy , friendship , break those barriers , " said @entity2 who founded the club -- @entity22 -- while living in @entity23
the club 's stated mission is to " use basketball to break down political and social boundaries that exist all around the globe
" growing up with his missionary parents in @entity23 close to the @entity31 -- or demilitarized zone , separating north and south -- @entity2 always wanted to see what was happening in @entity15
" @entity6 was a place that was so close yet so far away
" @entity2 believes his was the first @entity4 basketball team ever to visit @entity6
his intention was to foster friendships and build trust through sport
" we wanted to ... bring in a whole team of @entity4 and say hey we 're not those guys you see on posters , " he said
" we 're not those guys you hate so much , we want to be separated from the government and let the government do whatever they want
" relations between @entity50 and @entity15 have long been strained
tensions rose earlier this year after the @entity6 regime defied international warnings and launched a long - range rocket
the @entity4 and other countries saw the launch as cover for a ballistic missile test
but @entity22 was adamant their visit would ignore politics
the players had far more interaction with @entity6 than most tourists do , although @entity2 admits the students they trained were suspicious of them in the beginning
" at first there was distance , " he said
" but before the end of the games and practicing sessions , the kids were definitely laughing with us
it took a while to get laughs out of the kids , we did n't know why they did n't smile
" basketball is one @entity4 import that the @entity6 leadership may not object to
the young leader @entity80 is believed to love the sport as did his father , the @entity82 , who is rumored to have been a big fan of basketball star @entity84
@entity2 hopes that may help when they try to return next year
but even though the trip was a sporting one , the team did not escape the usual @entity6 propaganda
they were taken by their tour group to the @entity94 , a @entity96 spy ship captured by @entity15 in 1968 and told stories of the " @entity4 imperialists , " but that did n't seem to phase @entity2
" we tried not to look to the anti-americanism or the propaganda , we knew it was coming , we were briefed ahead of time and we did n't want to get caught up in that
" the group also attended a protestant church service
human rights groups claim that @entity6 @entity108 have faced persecution in the past for practicing their religion
" to actually go there and be a part of a church service of that kind was actually very shocking , it was very enlightening and actually a very interesting experience , " said @entity2 , himself a @entity108
and there was the obligatory visit to the huge bronze statues of @entity6 founder @entity122 and his son @entity82
other sightseeing tours included @entity15 's funfair and the famous @entity126 , named after @entity122 's principle of " @entity128 " or " self - reliance
" the players and coaches raised $ 50,000 themselves to fund the trip
they 're hoping to find sponsorship for future visits -- and @entity2 is determined there will be more training tours
" we 've seen as athletes and as someone who 's played and traveled all around the world and with groups that have done likewise , " he said " we 've seen what basketball can do to break down barriers or race , religion and anything else you could ever imagine
" @entity1 's @entity148 contributed to this report .
