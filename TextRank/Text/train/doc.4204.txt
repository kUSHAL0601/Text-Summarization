@entity0 , @entity1 -- we 're up in the north central part of @entity1 -- @entity5 -- to see what 's happening with @entity1 cheese
cheese lovers will be happy to know , just about nothing , at least as far as the traditional cheeses are concerned
cheese from the @entity13 region now carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine
but for the milk industry in general , it 's another story
it has now a larger annual turnover than the steel industry in @entity1 ( which admittedly is in decline
) somehow the @entity1 have figured a way to export dairy products to people who already have cows and their own dairy industries -- to the tune of nearly â‚¬ 4 billion ( $ 6 billion ) per year
@entity2 spoke to a few of the people who do just that everyday and who are part of the changing face of @entity1
@entity34 , the mayor of @entity35 and the administrator of the @entity35 cheese works says : " a camembert not made out of raw milk is like making love without sex
" a @entity1 is someone who cultivates with modern evolution his past
it 's someone who protects moral values , cultural values and artistic values , and when i say cultural values i would include camembert
" @entity52 and small cheese makers like @entity54 , who has 40 cows , have struggled and won the right to an @entity57 -- the mark aoc for their " @entity13 " which carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine
for @entity54 making cheese is about not cutting corners
" you have to have the passion , " he says
" yes it 's difficult because it means a lot of work
we make it all by hand
i do believe it is important because the cheese is an emblem of @entity1
it is a gastronomic emblem
" still some small cheesemakers have been driven out of business and the taste and smell of their particular cheeses are lost to the world forever
for @entity87 it was a combination of new , more stringent rules and his age that led him to quit producing his handmade @entity90
@entity87 : " it 's more and more complicated for those who stay in the business
they must hold out ! yes i miss the cheese a little
but i 've kept my souvenirs , you see i 've kept my old milk cans so i can stay in the spirit of @entity13 ! " despite those who 've quit , the actual number of the variety of cheeses in @entity1 is growing
at the last cheese census more than 1,000 different kinds of cheeses were made here
the milk industry is no small cheese in @entity1 , thanks to the efforts of people like @entity114 who travels the world endlessly promoting milk products , which these days include protein supplements and milk derivatives that can go into all sorts of processed food
@entity114 , who works for the milk marketing consortium , says : " i really would say i am selling the @entity1 approach to milk
we eat a lot of milk
we drink a lot of water , wine , beer and coffee
but drinking milk is not a big business here
" @entity1 has developed technological and marketing knowledge about adding value to a raw material -- milk
i have been traveling for 40 years all around the world and i feel so welcome
when you are @entity1 and you demonstrate that being @entity1 you can listen to others , people are interested in knowing about this country , about its people , about the way of life here
" @entity114 must be doing a good job as it 's not just abroad that the @entity1 are selling more milk products -- cheese consumption in @entity1 has doubled from 12 to 24 kilos per person per year
it seems there 's no curding their enthusiasm ... e-mail to a friend
