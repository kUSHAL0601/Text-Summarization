-- two years after massive demonstrations forced out longtime leader @entity3 , @entity1 finds itself right back where it started
this time , protests have led to the removal of @entity7 , the country 's first democratically elected president
some are calling it @entity1 's " second revolution
" " think of the millions of people who cheered @entity7 after his election , " said @entity12 , director of the @entity13 at the @entity14
" think of the millions of @entity1 who pinned their hopes on @entity7
" a year later , now , the millions of @entity1 who cheered for @entity7 are saying he must go
" they got their wish wednesday , when the country 's military leaders confirmed that it had ousted @entity7
how did it get to this point , and what 's next for @entity1 ? a look at five key questions : 1
why have so many @entity1 protested against @entity7 ? @entity7 , a strict islamist aligned with the @entity32 movement , was elected in june 2012 by appealing to all @entity1
but his opponents say his government has been anything but inclusive since he took office , and they say it has failed to deliver on the people 's aspirations for freedom and social justice
what is the @entity32 ? @entity7 has also been accused of authoritarianism , forcing his conservative agenda through edicts and a narrow majority
he has squared off against @entity1 's judiciary , the media , the police and even artists
" the @entity32 has not recognized that it has to take into account the 48 % that did n't vote for it , " @entity0 's @entity50 told @entity51 on tuesday
" there are many people who feel that the constitution was rammed down the throats of a lot of @entity1 , that it contains within it many illiberal characteristics , things that are kind of the @entity32 's @entity65 agenda written into the basic framework of laws
" @entity1 are also frustrated with rampant crime and a struggling economy that has n't shown improvement since @entity3 resigned
unemployment remains high , food prices are rising and there are frequently electricity cuts and long fuel lines
large - scale protests began the weekend of june 30 , on the first anniversary of @entity7 's election
what has been the response from the other side ? there have also been huge rallies in favor of @entity7
his supporters -- and many outside observers -- say that by getting rid of @entity7 before his term is up , @entity1 is circumventing the democratic process
" popular protests are the sign of a robust democracy
but the change in an elected government should be at the ballot box , not through mob violence , " said @entity92 , a senior fellow for @entity94 studies at the @entity95
@entity7 stressed his legitimacy in a speech tuesday and said he would not step down
" the people of @entity1 gave me the mandate as president , " he said
" they chose me in a free election
the people created a constitution
i have no choice but to bear responsibility for the @entity1 constitution
" @entity7 even said he was ready to sacrifice his blood if that 's what it took to uphold his constitutional legitimacy
but by the next day , he was out and the country 's constitution had been suspended , according to @entity118 - @entity117 , the nation 's top general
@entity7 supporters in at least one @entity123 plaza vowed to oppose the coup , chanting " down with military rule
" in statements posted on the presidential @entity128 and @entity129 pages , @entity7 said his ouster would be " categorically rejected by all the free men of our nation
what 's the military 's role ? when @entity3 resigned in 2011 , the country 's military took over leadership of the country and remained in power until @entity7 's election
it had mostly stood on the sidelines until monday , when it said it would intervene if @entity7 did not come up with a solution to " meet the demands of the people
" it gave @entity7 48 hours to accommodate his opponents or be pushed aside
" we swear by @entity150 that we are ready to sacrifice our blood for @entity1 and its people against any terrorist , extremist or ignorant , " generals said in a statement called " @entity157
" a military spokesman said the ultimatum was to push everyone toward national consensus , not seize power through a coup
but after the deadline expired wednesday , there were reports from some of @entity7 's supporters that a coup was under way
the state - run newspaper @entity172 , citing an unnamed presidential source , reported that @entity7 was told by 7 p.m. ( 1 p.m. et ) " that he is no longer a president for the republic
what 's the @entity178 stance ? president @entity180 spoke with @entity7 this week and reiterated that the @entity178 does n't support a particular party or movement in @entity1 , a @entity178 statement said
@entity180 " stressed that democracy is about more than elections
" @entity186 spokeswoman @entity185 denied , however , that @entity180 urged @entity7 to hold early elections
senior administration officials told @entity0 that a military coup would trigger @entity178 legislation that calls for cutting off all @entity178 aid to @entity1
@entity185 confirmed there were conditions on aid , but said " that 's way ahead of where we are in the process
" @entity50 said many @entity1 are suspicious of @entity178 intentions and influence
" at some level , no matter what the @entity178 does , it gets blamed , " he wrote on the @entity202 blog
" for decades , it was blamed for supporting the military -- it was blamed for that even a year or two ago
now the claim is that they 're too @entity211
what 's next for the @entity32 and for @entity1 ? @entity7 's removal offers no guarantee that the protests and violence will stop
it might even get worse
the @entity32 still has significant support in the country , and those supporters could lash out
@entity50 called @entity7 's removal " a fairly dangerous move
" the @entity32 was " able to survive and flourish through five or six decades of complete persecution and an outright ban on their activities , " he said , " so they 're not going to go anywhere
" they will be very passionate about trying to push back on this , and that suggests the tensions in @entity1 are likely to get a lot worse before they get better
" long - term , many fear this could set a dangerous precedent
it could also create more instability , @entity92 said , for a country that depends on tourists and international investment for economic prosperity
" hopes were raised , " he said , " but now the democratic dream is coming apart before our eyes
... is it too late to save @entity1 's democracy ? " @entity0 's @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .
