-- could another zoo in @entity2 kill a giraffe named @entity4 ? to some animal lovers , it sounds too terrible to be true , but zoo leaders say it 's anything but a tall tale
just days after the @entity11 killed a male giraffe named @entity4 to avoid inbreeding , another zoo said it might follow suit
@entity15 said thursday it may also have to " euthanize " one of its male giraffes -- coincidentally , also named @entity4 -- if a female is brought in to breed
zoologist @entity20 told @entity0 that @entity15 joined the same breeding program as the @entity11 last year , which means it ca n't have too many giraffes with the same genetic makeup
the zoo currently has two male giraffes , he said
one , @entity4 , is not deemed useful to the program but is a useful companion to the genetically valuable second giraffe , which is in fact an older brother of the @entity4 killed in @entity31
the zoo wants the second giraffe to mate , so it must bring in a female giraffe
" at the moment , they are doing very well and are keeping each other company , but if there are some genetically more valuable giraffes in the program that need the space , we have to decide what to do with him , " said @entity20
" we will of course try to place him in a suitable zoo , but if that is not possible , we might have to euthanize him
the program will give us notice well in advance , so i think we will have a good chance of placing him
" it 's thought that no decision is imminent , " so the problem is not acute , " he said
death threats the killing of the @entity11 's @entity4 opened wide divisions between animal lovers and zoo officials concerned about maintaining the genetic diversity of giraffes in the program
staff at the zoo received death threats as debate raged online over the killing , which took place despite a petition signed by thousands of animal lovers
but @entity72 , executive director of the @entity73 , a @entity75 body governing 345 institutions , said those protesting were missing the point
" i 'm afraid that when we have limited space in zoos -- and it 's limited because of problems in the wild , of course , and more and more animals need our help -- then we sometimes have to make these really tough decisions , " he said
' surplus problems ' @entity90 , scientific director at the @entity11 , told @entity0 the decision was made for the greater good of the giraffe population
" our giraffes are part of an international breeding program , which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes , " he said
" it can only be done by matching the genetic composition of the various animals with the available space
... when giraffes breed as well as they do now , then you will inevitably run into so - called surplus problems now and then
" the @entity11 's @entity4 was shot by a veterinarian with a rifle as he leaned down to munch on rye bread , a favorite snack
after a necropsy , the giraffe was dismembered in front of an audience that included children and fed to the zoo 's lions , tigers and leopards
