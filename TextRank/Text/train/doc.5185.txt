-- a sign over the @entity3 latte stand reads " @entity9 " and features a seductive image of a silhouetted woman in high heels , a devilish tail and horns , and seemingly little else
inside , authorities allege , customers got more than a sizzling beverage to kickstart their day
eight people were arrested tuesday in connection to latte stands in @entity16 that , the @entity18 police department says , served as fronts for prostitution and lewd conduct
those detained include the owner of seven stands in question , 51 - year - old @entity26 , who state public records link to the @entity30 establishments
other records , including health inspection reports , indicate some stands targeted by police operated as @entity35
@entity26 was arrested for conspiracy to promote prostitution and permitting prostitution , according to police
but she is hardly the only one in hot water
so , too , is @entity42 sgt. @entity41
the 30 - year office veteran was arrested and booked tuesday into @entity45 for conspiracy to promote prostitution and official misconduct , police said
it was no secret that the stands were offering more than just coffee
a post on @entity3 ' facebook page included -- in addition to pictures of women in lingerie -- an invitation for patrons to " come and watch our girls dance on our new @entity62
" but having baristas work wearing scantily clad outfits is not illegal
in october 2012 , authorities opened an investigation after getting complaints about alleged lewd conduct at a latte stand in @entity72 , which is about 20 miles south of @entity73
the probe -- @entity18 police deputy chief @entity75 told @entity0 affiliate king that it included video and in - person surveillance -- eventually widened to include seven such stands tied to @entity26 and one residence
this law enforcement effort was n't helped by the @entity42 sergeant who , a barista told detectives , tipped off workers about the undercover probe and " engaged in inappropriate behavior while on the job , " police said
@entity41 , 58 , has been placed on paid administrative leave and is the subject of an internal investigation , according to the @entity94
@entity0 's @entity95 and @entity96 contributed to this report .
