-- @entity1 is under fire following its delayed decision to recall 2.6 million cars over a faulty ignition switch
the automotive giant 's ceo says she is " deeply sorry " for 13 deaths caused by the defect
in isolation that 's bad enough
but it 's been exacerbated by another recall , this time of 1.3 million vehicles beset by a potentially dangerous power steering problem
critics might say it 's hardly unexpected from a company that took a $ 49.5 billion @entity20 bailout in 2008 and ended up costing the @entity22 tax payer $ 10.5 billion
apologists claim that if @entity1 had been allowed to wither and die , it would have cost the @entity22 in the region of $ 66 billion
probably more important is the potential human toll -- an industrial apocalypse like this would have wreaked on @entity1 's 212,000 - strong global work force
then there are the millions of employees working for the various suppliers who would also have suffered
but was saving @entity1 , and thereby condemning it to more of the same , really the triumph that some ( mainly blinkered @entity1 management ) claimed ? in 2013 , @entity1 ' global sales were up 4 % compared with the previous year
that 's in a market of worldwide vehicle sales that was up 7 %
@entity1 's big rival @entity40 's global sales increased by 12 % over the same period
@entity1 has multiple problems and none of them is new
lack of positive image and identity is one
hear the words @entity50 and @entity1 together in the @entity51 and it 's usually because of mass redundancies or a factory being shut
of its brands , @entity55 are insipid and to sell in the required volumes they are heavily discounted and sold to rental firms , a killer for models ' retained values that increasingly savvy consumers now consider
the decision to import the latest iterations of @entity68 and @entity69 -- cars more worthy of the bowtie badge than the @entity72 and @entity73 we 've currently got , coincided with a @entity1 directive to withdraw @entity65 from the @entity51 by the end of 2015
to calm a nervy dealer network , prices in january were slashed by up to 42 %
you could buy a @entity81 seven - seat suv for Â £ 12,295 ( $ 20,460 ) , the sort of money that barely buys a decently equipped three - door @entity84
unsurprisingly at that sort of money dealers have n't struggled
@entity65 's february sales were up 114 % proving what @entity89 firms have known all along : workmanlike products will sell if priced correctly
twenty years ago , @entity1 became the first major car manufacturer in the modern era to mass produce an electric car
it wanted to prove the viability of the project by inviting drivers to become one of 50 to lease the impact electric vehicle
the project leader anticipated 80 applicants
in @entity105 there were 10,000
there was evidently an appetite for electric cars
management admits that now its zero and low emissions vehicle technologies have fallen behind rivals
defeat from the jaws of victory and symptomatic of a company lacking the vision now required to compete at the cutting edge of car manufacturing
@entity1 used to own @entity121 car firm @entity120
in 2008 it finished development on the @entity123 , a competent suv designed primarily for the @entity22 market
it was the sort of car that should turn a decent profit margin , perfect to help re-fill a cash - strapped company 's depleted coffers
@entity1 did n't launch the car until 2011
three years can be more than half a car 's life : the 9 - @entity123 was past - it before anyone outside @entity1 and @entity120 even drove it
you can almost hear the mirth from boardrooms in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and even @entity141
but could that be @entity1 's salvation ? as a @entity143 who has watched an entire car industry slip into foreign hands i can tell you overseas ownership has n't been too bad at making viable businesses out of @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154
a fresh culture could be equally positive for @entity157 management teams have had their chance and at least 13 people have lost their lives
@entity1 might be too big to die
it 's not too big to be run properly by a foreign company
