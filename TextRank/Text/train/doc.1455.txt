@entity0 -- @entity2 is not terribly worried about the @entity3 reading his emails
" i do n't necessarily want people reading my emails but i 'm not a spy , i do n't run a crime syndicate , " he said at the @entity6 computer - security conference here on friday
" i 've got things i do n't want people to know but i did n't really go running for cover for a new way to encrypt
" the comedian gave the closing keynote at the @entity6 conference , ignoring requests from privacy activists and some members of the cybersecurity community to back out of the event
a number of security speakers dropped out of the @entity6 conference when @entity25 reported in december that @entity6 had an undisclosed $ 10 million contract with the @entity3 to build a back door for the government agency into encryption software
some protesters put on a counter-conference nearby thursday called @entity32 , and protesters passed out @entity35 information outside of a conference location in downtown @entity0
though he is not a security expert , @entity2 's reaction was closely watched by those outside of the community
@entity6 typically closes out its week - long conferences with big - name speakers , often from the political sphere
@entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 have all held the honor at previous conferences
this year it hired @entity2
some called for the tv host to boycott the event , and privacy group @entity53 had started an online petition asking @entity2 not to attend
" now a lot of people , maybe some in this room , were upset to learn i 'd be speaking here today
many of you see me as a champion of privacy , " said @entity2
" which i know because i read your emails
" @entity2 was quick to defend @entity6 and his decision to keep the paid gig
he said he believed the security company was exonerated by its claim to have promoted the supposedly compromised standard a full two years before the @entity3 payoff
@entity2 asked if it was fair to boycott this conference when other major companies such as @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 had all been linked to the @entity3
he also joked that as a freedom lover , he does n't engage in boycotts
and that he had signed a contract so his conscience was clear , as long as his check cleared
while the @entity6 got a pass , @entity2 did n't go as easy on the @entity3 or @entity83 , whom he referred to as " practically a war criminal " for taking top secret @entity86 intelligence to @entity87 and then to @entity88
" was @entity89 not accepting asylum requests ? " he quipped
the lines between the blustering right - leaning character @entity2 plays on tv and the more liberal comedian himself were fluid during the talk , but he seemed genuine in his criticisms of the agency and its famous whistleblower
" we can trust the @entity3 because without a doubt it is history 's most powerful , pervasive , sophisticated surveillance agency ever to be totally pwned by a 29 - year - old with a thumb drive , " said @entity2
the rest of the talk was a mix of jokes and light political commentary , with some security humor thrown in to appease the cryptographer audience
he joked about his own fictional security startup , @entity113 , and took questions from the audience about " @entity116 , " @entity117 , acting and politics
in the end , the comedian placed the blame for the @entity3 's programs on @entity86
" we all deserve credit for this new surveillance state that we live in because we the people voted for the @entity126
democrats and @entity128 alike , " said @entity2
" we voted for the people who voted for it , and then voted for the people who reauthorized it , then voted for the people who re- re-authorized it
" @entity86 wants to extend time it can hold surveillance data big data , big business , @entity137 ?
