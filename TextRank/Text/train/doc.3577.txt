-- former @entity2 champion @entity1 is to miss out on an emotional return to @entity4 after withdrawing from this year 's tournament
the @entity6 , who won the 2005 edition of the grand slam on the @entity11 course , has pulled out citing personal and injury problems
@entity1 explained that he had only just recovered from an ankle injury and had recently separated from his wife @entity14
" sorry i have been off the radar since playing at the 2014 @entity18 , " a statement on his personal website read
" i have had some problems with a tendon in my left ankle that stopped me from playing for 2 to 3 months
the good news is that i am back swinging and now managing to play 18 holes
" on a personal note , i have some sad news
unfortunately @entity14 and i have separated
our children remain our number one focus as we move forwards -- as parents first and foremost while remaining both friends and business partners
" as i do not feel that i am either fully physically or mentally ready to play tournament golf at the highest level , after much deliberation , i have decided not to play in the @entity37 , the @entity2 or the events in between
" i want to get back to my best and i believe this is the best strategy to achieve this
" the 45 - year - old has endured a lean period since his 2005 @entity2 triumph , all eight of his career wins coming in 2005 or before , but his is still one of the enduring major championship wins
@entity1 only secured his place at the 2005 tournament after making a birdie on the final hole of a qualifying competition at @entity52 in @entity53
then he held off the challenge of current world no. 1 @entity55 -- who was then at the peak of his major - winning powers -- to claim the title by two shots
he became the first @entity61 in 42 years to claim a major championship , and though he finished tied for sixth at that year 's @entity64 his game rapidly deserted him
his third place at the @entity66 in october 2012 was his best finish since 2006 though he did record a handful of top - 25 finishes in 2013
@entity1 's win at @entity4 gave him a 10 - year exemption at the tournament , meaning 2015 will be the last year he does n't need to quality , but he now wo n't be able to relive any of those fond @entity2 memories at @entity4
golf : caddie dies , play continues
