@entity1 anti-government demonstrators massed wednesday outside the prime minister 's makeshift office , a day after clashes with police in the streets of @entity7 killed five people
the protesters have been rallying in the city for months , demanding that prime minister @entity11 step down
their long - running campaign has deepened political divisions in @entity1 , undermined the functioning of the national government and stirred outbreaks of deadly violence
the demonstrators want to rid the country of the influence of @entity11 and her older brother , former prime minister @entity21 , who they say controls the government from self - imposed exile
they are calling for the creation of an unelected " people 's council " to oversee electoral and political changes
10 questions : what 's behind the protests in @entity1 ? deadly clashes with @entity1 still scarred by a severe bout of civil unrest in 2010 -- in which a crackdown on @entity38 protesters by security forces left scores of people dead -- police had until recently largely refrained from using force on the current demonstrations
but last week , police began attempts to clear sites occupied by protesters for months
government officials said the protesters ' actions were blocking public access to government services
the police measures encountered strong resistance from protesters in central @entity7 on tuesday , and clashes between the two sides erupted into gun fire
five people , including a police officer , died in the violence , and more than 70 were wounded
police have suspended efforts to seize the protest sites for the time being , said lt. gen. @entity67 , the national security chief
protesters gather the anti-government protesters , meanwhile , are trying to keep up the pressure on @entity11 by gathering wednesday outside @entity72 offices in the suburbs of @entity7 where the prime minister has set up a temporary office
she has had to relocate there after the demonstrators blocked access to @entity80 , the @entity75 and appointed cabinet ministers in central @entity7
thousands of demonstrators assembled near the @entity72 compound , arriving by foot , on bikes and in pick - up trucks
some of them waved flags and others blew whistles , a trademark of their movement
about 1,000 police officers in riot gear were positioned outside the compound
it was n't immediately unclear whether @entity11 was inside the offices wednesday
she gave a televised speech from there on tuesday
political uncertainty the prime minister is also facing difficulties over her government 's controversial rice subsidy program
@entity1 's anti-corruption commission said tuesday it was bringing charges against @entity11 over allegations she failed to act on warnings of corruption in the program , which paid farmers well above the market rate for their rice but has run into financial problems
@entity11 said tuesday that the program had been successful and that there was " no conspiracy to corrupt
" the current protests in @entity7 were sparked in november by @entity11 's government 's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother 's return to the political fray in earnest
@entity11 called elections in december in the hope that they wcould help ease tensions
but the main opposition party boycotted the vote earlier this month , and protesters caused widespread disruption , making the outcome of the election inconclusive
that has left @entity11 's caretaker administration unable to operate fully .
