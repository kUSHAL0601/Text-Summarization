-- a sailor is accusing the @entity2 of baselessly trying to discharge him for " unprofessional conduct " in an effort to get around the recent " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal , after being found asleep in the same bed with another male sailor
navy petty officer @entity8 , a student at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , told @entity0 that on the night of february 5 , a male sailor stopped by to watch the @entity14 tv show " @entity15
" " he has come over to watch shows in the past , " @entity8 said
the two watched the show on his bed but accidentally fell asleep
@entity8 says his roommate walked in around midnight
" my roommate walked in and it woke me up , " @entity8 said
he then woke up his friend , navy petty officer @entity23 , who according to @entity8 , immediately left the room
but the @entity2 is proceeding with discharging @entity8 , charging him with " willful failure to exhibit professional conduct , " @entity8 ' lawyer , @entity26 said
" it is a violation of the @entity30 for sailors to act unprofessionally in the barracks
it is considered unprofessional conduct to share the same bed in @entity2 barracks , " said @entity33 , a spokesman for the @entity9
@entity8 , who claims nothing sexual happened , said they were both clothed , him in pajama pants and a white t - shirt and @entity42 in boxers , and that two were not under the covers together
@entity8 was lying above the covers while @entity42 lay below
the play - by - play given by @entity8 is substantiated by the @entity9 investigating documents , although a different account on the amount of clothing worn was given by @entity8 ' roommate who claimed in his naval statement that both sailors were only dressed in their boxers
@entity8 ' roommate , who was uncomfortable by what he saw , according to @entity26 , @entity8 ' attorney , moved out of the room a day later and reported the incident to command officials
an investigation was launched , ending with the command attempting to punish @entity8 and @entity42 by a " @entity61 , " a non-judicial procedure meant to avoid a court martial
@entity42 , who declined to comment on the case , accepted the mast and punishment but @entity8 refused , moving the @entity2 to begin proceedings to discharge him
punishment by @entity61 could have resulted in loss of rank , forfeiture of pay , or jeopardized @entity8 ' top secret security clearance , @entity26 said
" i 'm not pleading guilty to something that i did n't do
i did not commit a crime , " said @entity8
" i am the type of person that takes responsibility for my actions
if i break a rule , i take my punishment
and i know i did not break any rules
" @entity26 also said he is adamant that no crime was committed
" in the end , @entity8 was charged with falling asleep while watching a show on his computer while on his bed over the covers where another man under the covers was also sleeping
this is not a crime and never will be as there was and is no duty to avoid such a circumstance as a matter of laws , " said @entity26 in a statement sent to the @entity2
@entity8 and his lawyer charge that the @entity101 suspects @entity8 of being gay and wants to discharge him for that reason alone
" @entity104 suspects that @entity8 is a homosexual but has no proof
it can not invoke ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' because there is no homosexual conduct and there is no admission of homosexuality
yet this homophobic command is using its suspicions to reach the same result as though there were , " said @entity26
" this is bigotry disguised as the rule of law
" @entity8 would not comment on his sexual orientation saying , " that is my business and my business alone "
president @entity121 signed the so - called " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal into law in december but it 's not officially off the books until secretary of defense @entity126 , the chairman of the @entity128 and the president give the ok that the military is ready to implement the repeal
for now , the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy remains in place , although no military personnel have been discharged under that policy since october , when @entity126 changed procedures to have such separations reviewed at the highest levels , a point , @entity26 says , was not forgotten by the @entity101
" the secretary of defense has said that ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' cases will be reviewed at the highest levels
this case is disguised as misconduct to avoid that result , " said @entity26
" this is a subterfuge being used by this commander because he does not have the elements of proof to separate him for homosexuality , but he suspects homosexuality , so he has created this illusion that @entity8 has engaged in misconduct of some form
" the @entity2 denies the separation proceedings are based on the suspicion of homosexual behavior
" @entity9 is not administratively processing either of these sailors for separation based on sexual orientation , " said @entity33
but one gay rights group worries this case may be an example of some in the military trying to get around the " do n't ask do n't tell " repeal by charging suspected homosexuals with other offenses
" we 've seen this before , " said @entity169 , executive director of @entity170 , the nation 's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans
" here is the classic text book case of trumping up charges and exaggerating an event to try to punish someone
and this is exactly what the senior defense leadership has said would not and should not happen when @entity185 goes away
" for now , the 21 - year - old @entity8 says that even though he is disappointed in the @entity101 , he just wants to keep his job and finish his training to become a nuclear operator on an aircraft carrier or a submarine
" i enjoyed my job
i enjoyed the environment and i was interested in what i was learning
it has been challenging but it was definitely something that i wanted to complete , " said @entity8 .
