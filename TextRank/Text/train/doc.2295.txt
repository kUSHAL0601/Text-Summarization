@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity0 police officer is suing the city after he was suspended for referring to a black @entity6 professor as a " banana - eating jungle monkey " in an e-mail
@entity0 police officer @entity9 apologized for his e-mail about @entity6 professor @entity11 " if i 'm charged with a crime i want a chance to answer
i want the chance for a fair hearing , " officer @entity9 told @entity2 on tuesday
@entity9 has apologized and denied he is a racist
his lawsuit claims his civil rights have been violated ; @entity9 's lawyer said the words referring to @entity11 were misinterpreted
" the choice of words were poor ; but they were n't meant to characterize professor gates as a banana - eating jungle monkey , " attorney @entity21 said
" they were meant in a response to behavior and characterizing the behavior
not the person as a whole
" @entity21 said the city had effectively fired @entity9 , though he is officially suspended with pay
he said it was fair to hold @entity9 to a higher standard than the general public because he is a police officer , but that he was still entitled to express his opinions
" being held to a higher standard should n't eradicate his right under the @entity41 for free speech
that is part and parcel of the lawsuit , " the lawyer said
gates was arrested at his house last month when a neighbor called police after she thought she saw a man trying to break into @entity11 ' home
the man turned out to be @entity11 himself , who was attempting to free a jammed door
the incident sparked a national debate about race and policing , drawing in president @entity60 himself
@entity60 , who is a friend of @entity11 , said the officer who arrested the professor " acted stupidly , " but then withdrew the comment , saying he did not know all the facts when he spoke
he hosted @entity11 and sgt. @entity66 for a beer at the @entity68 to calm the tensions
@entity9 later sent a mass e-mail about the encounter to other officers and to the @entity74 newspaper
@entity9 was suspended from his military duties as captain in the @entity77 and placed on administrative leave from the @entity79 pending the outcome of a termination hearing
@entity9 said he was moved to write the note because he believed a @entity74 column about @entity11 ' arrest " seemed like it was biased
" " it did not show the roles and duties of a police officer and how dangerous it already is without having a debate about people getting in a police officer 's face , which should never happen at all
" asked what led him to choose to use such language , he said , " i do n't know
i could n't tell you
" he added , in response to a question , that he had never used such language before
@entity0 police commissioner @entity99 denounced the e-mail
@entity9 used the " jungle monkey " phrase four times , three times referring to @entity11 and once to the @entity74 column
he also declared that he was " not a racist but i am prejudice [ sic ] toward people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they say is freedom but it is merely attention because you do not get enough of it in your little fear - dwelling circle of on - the - bandwagon followers
" according to a statement from @entity0 police , @entity99 took action immediately on learning of @entity9 's remarks , stripping the officer of his gun and his badge
@entity9 's arrests and investigations will be reviewed for indications of racial bias , @entity99 said
the department will also look closely at the officers who received or viewed the e-mail .
