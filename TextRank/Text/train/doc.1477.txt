-- @entity1 did n't quite come out of nowhere
the actress did seven years of " @entity2 , " headlined " @entity10 " for @entity4 and played three roles in screenwriter @entity7 's ingenious first feature as director , " @entity9
" but her supporting turn in " bridesmaids " was a revelation , a powerhouse comic performance that pushed that movie to another level of hilarity
in recent years , perhaps only @entity18 in " @entity19 " has had a comparable impact
@entity1 was lewd and fearless , a woman unashamed of her size and her sexual appetite
how to follow that ? there 's no question she represents a challenge for @entity28 , not only because the industry still struggles to believe women can carry movies , but also because screen glamour is synonymous with thin
her first star vehicle , " @entity33 , " is not likely to be remembered as anyone 's triumph ( it 's scoring in the 20 - something percentile on the critics ' aggregator site @entity39 ) , but at least it does enough to show that @entity1 has what it takes
if she forges a movie career , she could really shake things up
she 's not quite flying solo , of course
@entity45 has top billing as @entity46 , a financial officer in a big @entity48 firm
when reports start coming in that he 's maxed out his credit card in @entity51 , @entity46 is naturally upset
turns out @entity1 has stolen his identity and is running up big bills on all his accounts
oh , and she 's missed her court date , which means there 's an arrest warrant out in his name
mustering enough cash to fly down there , @entity46 decides to apprehend the imposter himself and escort her back to @entity63 so that they can straighten out the mess before he loses his job and his home
she may be a scam artist , but @entity46 reckons she looks harmless enough
and that would be his fatal error : if there is one thing @entity1 means to prove , it 's surely that one look is not enough , because there is so much more to her than meets the eye
in one of the movie 's better running gags , she proves it again and again when she delivers a vicious sucker punch to the throat of anyone foolish enough to threaten her well - being
@entity1 , as @entity83 ( which may or may not be her real name ) , is not about to give up without a fight
but she 's also slippery in more subtle ways , an operator who knows how to manipulate people with the way she looks and how she talks
in some cases that involves playing on their pity -- and on ours , too , as the filmmakers imply that her weight is a symptom of her unhappy life
but @entity1 has the personality to subvert this , because her @entity83 may be lonely , but she is still more vital , more spontaneous and more fun than @entity46 is ever likely to be
in the best , most daring sequence , she picks up a guy in a bar ( @entity105 as @entity106 ) and persuades him back to their motel room to have sex with her in front of her husband , @entity46 , who " likes to watch
" it 's all a ploy to make an escape , but the scene pivots -- @entity106 makes it about emotion , not sex , and she responds to his openness
@entity1 pulls off these shifts with gusto but also delicacy and , yes , tact
in a sharper movie ( and let 's shoot for the moon here -- @entity128 as the con woman in " @entity130 " ) , @entity83 would play @entity45 's smug executive for a sucker and take him for everything he 's got
but in these recessionary times , even financial officers can be sympathetic underdogs , and instead the film contents itself with puerile cracks about his manhood and undeveloped hints that her bad influence might rub off in a good way
written by @entity143 ( " @entity144 " ) and directed by @entity145 ( " @entity146 " ) , " @entity33 " borrows too much from the likes of " @entity148 " and " @entity149 " without giving enough back -- especially since " @entity151 " already went that route quite recently
but even with all its shortcomings and sentimental fudges , there is something about @entity1 's refusal to lie down and play the victim that gives it a comic edge
a blunt edge , to be sure , but an edge all the same .
