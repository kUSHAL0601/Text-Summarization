@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 military planes headed for @entity5 took off from @entity1 saturday , evacuating @entity6 fleeing the @entity8 conflict , a deadly war spurring a massive refugee flight
two @entity13 planes left the airport in the @entity1 island of @entity0 with a total of 132 @entity6 on board , the @entity11 said
two additional @entity19 c - 130s are en route to @entity0 and will take another group of @entity6 home
all four @entity4 planes are expected to arrive in @entity5 by saturday night , @entity4 officials said
two @entity26 military cargo planes landed at the @entity0 airport delivering humanitarian aid
there are at least 10 other evacuation flights scheduled for saturday -- six @entity32 , three @entity29 and one @entity26 -- said @entity33 , a spokesman for the @entity35 refugee agency
nine of the flights are to evacuate @entity6 and the other is for @entity39
there are a few thousand @entity6 left in @entity1 awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home
@entity33 said there are also three ships preparing to evacuate people
the violence in @entity8 has generated an exodus out of the @entity49 nation
almost 200,000 people , a majority of them foreign workers , have fled @entity8 -- nearly 100,000 to @entity1 and a similar number to @entity6 -- according to the office of the @entity35 high commissioner for refugees
the numbers of people entering @entity1 daily from @entity8 dropped to 1,800 thursday and friday and stood at 3,000 saturday
previously , they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people
@entity59 , a field officer for the @entity35 refugee agency , attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by @entity8 authorities
" a lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting so they were staying in their houses , " he said saturday
" we fear the regime might be blocking refugees from the border
" a @entity78 man who crossed into @entity1 said @entity8 had been confiscating phones and sim cards of people fleeing
he said people are afraid to make the journey because of the fighting and the cost for bus or taxi transport to the border has spiked
however , he said , @entity8 are not stopping traffic toward border
@entity90 , a @entity91 engineer who had been working on a @entity8 water project , said @entity8 soldiers at the @entity1 border stole his laptop , money and mobile phone
because of complications with his group 's flight home , he and his @entity91 colleagues have had to spend three days at the airport
many countries , such as @entity104 and @entity105 , put in place well - organized evacuation operations for their citizens
but others , including @entity6 and @entity110 , have been left to fend for themselves
the @entity11 said saturday it would donate $ 3 million to the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) as part of a joint @entity4 - @entity111 partnership to help get home thousands of @entity6 and other nationals from @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118
@entity33 said more than 10,000 @entity110 are awaiting transport in @entity1
many @entity110 have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs
one man suffered a heart attack and died , aid officials confirmed .
