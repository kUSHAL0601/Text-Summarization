-- no drawn butter will ever touch @entity3 's tail
she 's an extremely rare , seven - year - old " yellow " lobster
@entity3 's colorful hue makes her a one - in - 30 million rarity
@entity3 belongs to @entity7 , the owner of @entity9 's @entity8 in @entity10 , @entity11 , who has been in the restaurant business for 32 years
the special lobster was caught off the coast of eastern @entity16 last week by a friend of @entity7
" in 57 years in @entity19 , i have never seen a yellow lobster and i doubt that i will ever see one again , " he said thursday
experts say @entity3 's colorful appearance makes her one in 30 million
@entity3 's not really yellow , but more of a bright orange , she 's not quite the red color your typical lobster looks after it 's been cooked
@entity7 has plans for his new ocean - dwelling friend , but it has nothing to do with the boiling pot. he said he 'll keep the 1.75 - pound crustacean in a viewing tank at his restaurant , hoping to draw in a few extra customers
