-- @entity2 @entity1 hopes home advantage will give @entity4 the edge in the @entity7 final against @entity8 , starting on friday
@entity1 , @entity4 's no. 1 player , has been drawn to face @entity9 in the second singles match in @entity11 , following @entity13 's opener against @entity14
he comes into the event after losing to eventual winner @entity16 in the semifinals of the season - ending @entity18
" we 're all very excited and ca n't wait for the first point to start
@entity21 [ the home support ] will be an advantage for us over our opponents
we are all in good shape , physically and mentally fresh to perform our best tennis , " the 23 - year - old said at thursday 's draw
@entity9 , once ranked sixth in the world but now down at 42 after suffering with injuries , beat @entity1 in their first encounter in 2008 but has lost all five since
" i think the pressure i have on my back will for sure help me to forget the crowd is against me
i will see how i will react , but i will be natural so if i have to let my emotions out , i will , " the 25 - year - old @entity8 said
" since i was a young child it was a dream to play in the @entity7 final
also with my friend , @entity14 , it 's just unbelievable
i really hope we 're going to win the trophy -- that would be perfect
" @entity14 , ranked 12th in the world , has a 2 - 2 record against no. 49 @entity13 -- who was @entity4 's semifinal hero with two singles victories against the @entity46 on home soil
he will be very nervous because he plans to come out first on the court in front of the @entity4 crowd
it will be tough for him
i will try to be very relaxed and just play my game , " @entity14 said
in saturday 's doubles , @entity53 and @entity54 will take on the @entity8 pairing of @entity57 and @entity58
the @entity8 are seeking a fourth title , the last coming back in 2001
the first came in 1991 after beating @entity60 in the semifinals , but the two countries have not met in the competition since @entity4 again became independent from the former federal republic
neither @entity60 nor @entity4 have won the @entity7 .
