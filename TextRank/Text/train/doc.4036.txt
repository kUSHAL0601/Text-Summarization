-- at least 37 people were killed during a shootout at a meeting to resolve cattle disputes in @entity6 , officials said saturday , the latest in a spate of violence in the world 's newest nation
one @entity12 officer was wounded during the meeting at @entity14 , which was attended by several staff members of the world body , according to @entity17 , a spokesman for the @entity12 mission in @entity19
seven @entity12 staff members and three local officials traveled to @entity22 to investigate a wave of violence from cattle raiding on the borders of @entity14 and @entity28 states
during the meeting wednesday , the county commissioner from neighboring @entity31 state appeared and interrupted the meeting , yelling angry remarks at his @entity22 counterpart , the spokesman said
the shooting followed soon after
" four pick - up trucks carrying armed men believed to be the @entity39 ( @entity6 army ) and @entity41 ( @entity6 police service ) then appeared and started shooting indiscriminately at the @entity45 county commissioner 's compound , " @entity17 said
a local official said it was unclear why the @entity31 state official had an armed convoy
" we are asking ourselves why the county commissioner would come with such a heavily armed convoy , " said @entity50 , the minister of information for @entity14
" he was uninvited , so we are still asking him to answer these questions
we want to know what his intentions were
" the clashes killed at least 16 people from @entity14 and 21 from @entity31 , including six civilians from both states , the minister of information said
the @entity12 officer injured in the attack is in stable condition at a hospital in @entity19 , @entity6 's capital
" it appears that the @entity12 team was not the target of the attack but were at the wrong place at the wrong time and were caught up in the incident , " the minister of information said
the meeting was initiated after a violent cattle raid four days earlier in @entity28
the attackers , believed to be from @entity14 , stole thousands of cattle and killed 74 people
most were women and children
the latest clashes come after a particularly violent month of cattle raids in @entity82
in late december , officials in the town of @entity85 said more than 3,000 were killed in cattle raids after 6,000 armed youths from the @entity88 tribe attacked the @entity90 people
the @entity12 said the number is more likely in the hundreds , but it said 120,000 were affected and in need of immediate assistance
weeks later , the @entity90 attacked the @entity88 people in retaliation and killed more than 100 people in two separate attacks
the main purpose behind the raids is to steal cattle , a livelihood for the people who live in the barren regions , but the violent clashes end with killings and child abductions
the victims are largely defenseless women and children
in a country struggling with violence six months into its independence , and recovering from decades of civil war , weapons have flown freely into the hands of cattle raiders
what used to be rural - style attacks , with sticks and arrows , have been replaced by automatic weapons , killing thousands and displacing even more .
