-- the immigration debate took center stage thursday as @entity4 president @entity3 fielded questions in a forum broadcast live online by the @entity9 - language @entity8 network
" i want you to acknowledge that you did not keep your promise , " co-host @entity10 said in @entity9 , noting that the president did n't deliver on his 2008 campaign pledge to push immigration reform during the first year of his term
@entity3 said the first year of his term was consumed by efforts to help the economy and stop the country from going into another @entity20
and @entity22 political opponents , he said , kept many significant immigration measures from getting off the ground
for immigrants , ' deferred status ' still means no federal health insurance " i am happy to take responsibility for the fact that we did n't get it done , " @entity3 said
" but i did not make a promise that i would get everything done 100 % when i was elected as president
what i promised was that i would work every single day as hard as i can to make sure that everybody in this country regardless of who they are , what they look like , where they come from , that they would have a fair shot at the @entity4 dream
and that promise i 've kept
" asked whether his move this summer to halt deportations of some children of illegal immigrants was politically motivated by a desire to win the @entity52 vote , @entity3 said , " i think if you look at the polls , i was winning the @entity52 vote before that
" i did this because i met young people all across the country , wonderful kids who sometimes were valedictorians , were participating in the community , had aspirations to go to college , some were serving in our military
... there 's no way you would think it was fair or just for us to have them suffering under a cloud of deportation , " he said
after answering a series of @entity9 questions about topics ranging from teacher strikes to @entity80 's drug war , @entity3 brought up the topic again at the end of the forum
asked by @entity10 to identify his biggest failure , @entity3 offered a quick response
" @entity10 , as you remind me , my biggest failure is that we have n't gotten comprehensive immigration reform done , " he said
" but it 's not for lack of trying or desire
" the hourlong forum , co-sponsored by @entity94 , was broadcast live online in @entity9 and @entity96 on thursday afternoon and was scheduled to air on @entity8 later thursday night
on the campaign trail , both @entity3 and @entity22 challenger gov. @entity98 have discussed immigration in their efforts to woo @entity52 voters , considered a key demographic in the november election
@entity3 handily won the @entity52 vote in 2008 over @entity107 sen. @entity107 , and recent polls have showed @entity3 leading @entity98 among @entity52 registered voters
@entity98 steps up effort to woo @entity52 voters in @entity8 forum the @entity112 weekly tracking poll reported monday that @entity3 held a 68 % to 26 % advantage over @entity98 among @entity52
a @entity116 poll conducted partially before and partially after the @entity117 at the end of august said @entity3 leads @entity98 among latino registered voters 64 % to 27 %
but @entity52 leaders have criticized the president for an overall increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years
last year , @entity125 removed 396,906 illegal immigrants , the largest number in the agency 's history
some @entity52 leaders have also criticized the president for not moving quickly enough on immigration reform at the beginning of his presidency
@entity3 : ' i need a dance partner on immigration reform ' politicians across party lines have vowed to fix what they argue is the nation 's broken immigration system
but it 's unclear what shape so - called comprehensive immigration reform could take -- particularly in a politically divided @entity147
many immigrant rights groups have proposed creating a " path to citizenship " that would give millions of illegal immigrants an opportunity to become legal residents
critics have called such proposals unfair offers of amnesty to lawbreakers
measures aimed at dealing with the thorny issue -- including the dream act , proposed by @entity162 and backed by @entity3 -- have not gained enough support to pass @entity147 despite several attempts
the @entity3 administration has said its deferred action policy -- which allows people younger than 30 who arrived in the @entity4 before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military , to apply for a two - year deferral from deportation -- is a temporary measure aimed at addressing a problem that requires a permanent solution
during the primary campaign , @entity98 said he opposed the @entity180 , but also called for an unspecified @entity22 version that has yet to emerge from the party or his campaign
on thursday , @entity3 said he had never wavered in his support for immigration reform and criticized @entity98 's stance on the topic
" the issue here for voters is whose vision best represents the aspirations , not just of the @entity52 community , but of all @entity4 who believe that we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants
and that candidate i believe is talking to you right now , " he said as the audience at the @entity200 cheered
@entity98 spoke for about 35 minutes in another " meet the candidates " forum hosted by @entity8 on wednesday
the events come weeks after @entity10 criticized the @entity206 for not picking a @entity52 debate moderator
" i think that they should have noticed that this country is changing very rapidly , " @entity10 told @entity0 in august
" @entity211 , for instance , surpass whites in @entity4 births , and those changes simply are not reflected
i really ca n't believe why they did n't choose a member of a minority group to be part of at least one debate , and i really ca n't understand why ( the commission did n't pick ) a journalist from the fastest ( growing ) voting block in the country , the @entity224
" the bipartisan commission that organizes presidential debates announced the moderators last month
