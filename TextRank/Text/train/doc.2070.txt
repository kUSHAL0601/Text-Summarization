-- the most compelling action during @entity2 's primary tuesday will be on the @entity4 side
the @entity5 has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early , and top - tier @entity5 candidates have taken their names off the ballot , except for sen. @entity12
the struggling auto industry has been a drag on @entity2 's economy
in many ways , the @entity4 battle for @entity2 will be similar to last week 's @entity19 contest
the primary is open , and any registered voter -- including independents and @entity5 -- can participate
sen. @entity23 won @entity19 with the help of independent voters , and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in @entity2
in 2000 , @entity23 defeated then - @entity28 gov. @entity27 in the @entity2 primary
in that vote , more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or @entity5
among @entity4 voters , @entity23 lost to @entity27 29 percent to 66 percent
in that contest , almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right
overall , @entity2 is a swing state , producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders
however , voting trends favor the @entity5
@entity2 's governor , @entity43 , is a @entity44 , as are the state 's two @entity46 senators -- @entity48 and @entity49
the @entity5 presidential nominee has carried @entity2 in the last four elections
sen. @entity52 , the @entity5 ' 2004 standard bearer , won @entity2 51 percent to 48 percent over president @entity27
the state 's economy is powered by the automotive industry , which has experienced its fair share of struggles
@entity2 's unemployment rate , 7.4 percent , is higher than the national average of 5 percent
region by region @entity64 , in the southeastern corner of the state , contains the economically depressed @entity65 , @entity2 's largest city
@entity65 is predominantly black and solidly @entity5
@entity67 of @entity64 are the more - affluent suburban counties of @entity69 and @entity70 , which have grown in population in the last two decades
these two counties have been the state 's central political battleground in recent elections
west of @entity64 is the " university belt , " home to the @entity79 in @entity80 and @entity81 in @entity82
the area also includes the industrial cities of @entity85 and @entity86 , where unions remain strong , as well as @entity88 and @entity89
the state 's capital , @entity82 , and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region
the southwest part of the state is dominated by @entity97 , @entity2 's second - largest city
@entity97 is traditionally @entity98 - @entity46 and has many @entity100 conservatives and generally votes @entity4
the area also contains smaller industrial cities and farming communities
the economy of the sparsely populated north and northwest is based on agriculture , tourism and timber
endorsements the @entity112 has endorsed @entity23
" while the @entity112 differs with @entity23 on a number of issues , the @entity116 senator is a smarter , more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances around issues , " the newspaper said in an editorial
the @entity121 also endorsed @entity23 , citing his fiscal conservatism and command of military and foreign affairs , over @entity2 native @entity125
" other @entity4 contenders , most notably former @entity127 gov. @entity125 , are capable figures with impressive resumes and a solid grasp of the issues
but @entity23 's longtime presidential ambitions are at last aligned with the needs of the nation , " the newspaper said
