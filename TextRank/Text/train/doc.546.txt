-- since 2008 , @entity1 and his nonprofit , @entity2 , have provided hundreds of wheelchairs and mobility aids to people living with disabilities in rural @entity7
@entity8 and his group also teach recipients how to use their chairs and maximize their quality of life
@entity0 asked @entity8 for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the @entity16 of 2011
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a @entity16 @entity20 ? @entity1 : i was at home in @entity23 , @entity7
i am honored to be one of the @entity16
the door has been opened to show the world the huge need for wheelchairs in @entity7 , the plight of those who are stuck in their house because they ca n't move , and all the lives we are changing
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to the @entity2 ? @entity8 : i hope that many people and organizations will come alongside of @entity2 to help provide mobility and a better quality of life to the many disabled of @entity7
... i hope that people will realize that poverty is poverty and ( that ) those who have so much ( should ) help those in desperate need , in whatever country
i hope new volunteers , individuals or organizations -- from schools , churches -- will come to @entity7 to give away a wheelchair , to encourage , to inspire and to change a life
i started this organization because i saw the happiness , joy and ability of @entity60 , a 17 - year - old girl who i gave her first wheelchair
when @entity64 volunteers participate in a wheelchair donation , they realize the huge difference they can make in another person 's life and the unexplainable feeling of watching someone get up off the floor into their first wheelchair
the one who receives the wheelchair laughs , and the mother cries tears of joy
i hope that not a single used wheelchair in the @entity64 will ever be thrown into a dump and that every wheelchair that is sitting in a garage or basement will now be given to someone who desperately needs it
i hope this award means we will be able to provide a new life and opportunities to all those in @entity7 who deserve to be as independent and successful as people with disabilities in the @entity64 @entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a @entity95 ? @entity8 : every penny will go to @entity2 to continue the work we 're doing
in the past couple months , our financial levels have been dropping , and i was wondering if we would last another year
we have new cities we want to go to , and there are thousands of people in @entity7 who need wheelchairs
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity8 : in many rural , impoverished , uneducated areas of @entity7 , people do n't even know what a wheelchair is
they do n't know what their disability is or why they ca n't walk
they have no hope , no expectation for the future , and no resources to change their situation
... we host clinics and camps to teach them how to use their wheelchairs so they can get out of their house
we use able and disabled volunteers to encourage them and give them hope
the @entity7 government is trying to help , but does n't have the financial resources or connections in remote areas to contact or help everyone
many people in tiny pueblos have no electricity , dirt floors and cook using a wood stove
for a person with a disability to have a wheelchair is an unthought - of luxury
i have seen the lives of many people changed after receiving a wheelchair
@entity148 , who fell out of a tree when he was 12 , is now an artist and helps support his family
@entity151 s was in a car accident , is now married , works in @entity153 and has been promoted from greeter to the electronics department
@entity60 is married and has two children
( with ) a wheelchair , some motivation , a new perspective , love -- a new life is created
no degree , no training , no qualification is necessary
just a willingness to provide mobility , motivate and encourage are all that is needed to help someone get to where they never imagined they could be
