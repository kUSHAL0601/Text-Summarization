-- former world no. 1 @entity1 retained his @entity3 title in @entity4 by defeating @entity7 14th seed @entity5 6 - 3 6 - 2
the @entity8 , who lost his position at the top of the world rankings following @entity14 's @entity13 triumph , did not drop a set during the defense of the championship he won during his dominant 2011 season
the five - time major winner took advantage of all three break points he earned during the match to wrap up victory in just over an hour
@entity1 was pleased to have bounced back after a disappointing loss to @entity27 's @entity26 in the recent bronze medal match at the @entity29
" it 's a big tournament , one of the biggest we have in tennis , " @entity1 told the @entity31 's official website after securing his 31st career title
" i 'm very happy to be in this position
" i truly did not expect myself to win this tournament after the emotional losses in the @entity38
i really took it hard
i tried to bounce back and recover ; i 've done great , i have to say
" @entity14 considering @entity41 bid having also won the @entity3 title in 2007 , @entity1 became only the third open era player to win the event at least three times , following in the footsteps of @entity47 and @entity48
" i 'm not one of the biggest servers in the game , that 's for sure , but i always try to focus on the second shot after the serve , " said the 25 - year - old @entity8 , who has won seven of the eight matches he has played against @entity5
" i 've been working on the efficiency of my first and second serve , but also trying to be aggressive in the first ball
it 's been working exceptionally well throughout the whole week
" @entity63 and @entity64 both in doubt for start of @entity67 in the women 's draw , @entity68 ensured she will return to the top 10 of the world rankings by coming back from 5 - 1 down in the final set to beat @entity74 3 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 5
@entity77 's @entity76 champion will play @entity74 's compatriot @entity78 in monday 's final , after last year 's @entity13 winner defeated former world no. 1 @entity79
" in the beginning i was trying to shoot as hard as i could , and i was making a lot of mistakes -- so i knew i had to start putting the ball back in the court more , " @entity68 told the @entity82 's official website
you have to put the ball over the net and back in the court
it looks easy , but sometimes it can be hard to do
" when i was 5 - 1 down , i thought if i shot hard four in a row , i 'd lose the match
so i had to change a little bit
i was just trying to take it point by point
" when i got back to 5 - 4 , my serve game , i think it was more exciting for the fans
they were supporting me a lot
i 'm happy i could win the match
