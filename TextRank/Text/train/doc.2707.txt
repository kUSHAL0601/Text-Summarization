-- in the wake of an online video in which soldiers returning from @entity5 complained that @entity6 charged their unit more than $ 2,800 in bag - check fees , two rival carriers on thursday said they will loosen their checked - bag restrictions for active - duty military members
@entity11 announced it will allow military personnel to check an extra two bags with no out - of - pocket expense , and @entity15 said later thursday it will waive baggage charges for " members of the military who are traveling on active duty orders
" the airline 's policy is identical to that of @entity24 , which acquired @entity15 in a merger last september , @entity15 spokesman @entity20 told @entity0
@entity11 airline will have policy fully implemented " in the next few days , " spokeswoman @entity26 said in a statement released thursday
the airlines were the latest of the major @entity32 carriers to change their policies
@entity6 and @entity35 / @entity34 announced wednesday they were loosening their checked - bag policies for military personnel
previously , @entity11 allowed three bags to be checked free , " with full government reimbursement to military personnel on any bags above that number , " but the carrier decided to increase the free - bag limit to five , " given the potential confusion with different military units carrying different amounts of bags depending on their mission , " according to the statement
the statement continued : " both our revised 5 - bag policy as well as the previous policy allowed active military personnel traveling either on orders or on personal travel to utilize our military bag policy
in addition , @entity32 also allows military personnel traveling on orders to have one of their free bags weigh up to 100 pounds and ( to be ) 126 linear inches in size without penalty
... this greatly helps with the typical , large military duffel bags
" its limits on other bags are 50 pounds and 62 linear inches , it said
@entity15 's fee waiver also comes with some size and weight restrictions : " as long as each piece of baggage does not exceed 100 pounds in weight and 80 inches in size ( length plus width plus height ) , you will be exempt from baggage charges , and will not be subject to excess , oversized , or overweight baggage charges , " @entity20 said in an e-mail to @entity0 the @entity6 incident got instant notoriety after servicemen spoke out about their experience in a video posted on @entity92
in the clip , which the men say was recorded on board a @entity6 flight from @entity98 to @entity99 on tuesday , a day after they returned from @entity5 , the soldiers explain they had " a little issue with the bags
" @entity0 affiliate @entity102 in @entity99 identified the soldiers as @entity104
the men , who were bound for @entity108 , @entity109 , said their military travel orders allowed them to carry up to four bags , but when they arrived at the airport in @entity98 , @entity6 told them it allowed military personnel to check only three bags for free
members of the unit who were traveling with four bags ended up paying out of pocket for their extra luggage , the soldiers said in the video
they were charged $ 200 per extra bag , so the 34 - member unit ended up paying more than $ 2,800 in bag fees , the soldiers said
any extra bag fees charged by an airline will be reimbursed by the government , a military spokeswoman told @entity0 affiliate @entity131 in @entity99
one of the soldiers in the video said the bag he had to pay for was a weapons case that contained " the tools that i used to protect myself and @entity5 citizens while i was deployed in the country
" the other man then looked into the camera , exasperated
" good business model , @entity6 , " he said sarcastically
not happy at all , " he added , shaking his head
on wednesday , @entity6 changed its policy : effective immediately , @entity32 military personnel traveling on orders are now allowed to check up to four bags for free in coach and five bags in first class and business class
@entity6 spokeswoman @entity152 on thursday said the airline will reimburse the complaining soldiers for any fourth - bag fees that the military will not cover , and is giving them travel vouchers good for future trips
@entity34 / @entity35 also announced wednesday it will allow more bags
" @entity34 and @entity35 are waiving the fourth checked bag fee for military personnel traveling on orders in recognition of their sacrifice and service to our country , " @entity160 , a spokeswoman for @entity34 / @entity35 , said in an e-mail
the two airlines closed a merger deal in october
@entity6 said it deeply respects and admires men and women in uniform and added that it has worked hard to ensure that @entity32 military personnel get " additional flexibility " when they travel on the carrier
the carrier said it 's " continuing to work with the soldiers individually to make this situation right for each of them
" the soldiers may have been misinformed about how many bags traveling active duty military personnel can check for free , according to @entity187 , the independent news organization focusing on the military
@entity0 's @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .
