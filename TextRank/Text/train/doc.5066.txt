-- rebels in an unstable part of the @entity3 have until thursday afternoon to hand in their weapons to @entity6 peacekeepers or risk being disarmed by force
the ultimatum comes amid the latest flare up of unrest in central @entity13 's volatile @entity12
the 19,000 - strong @entity6 peacekeeping mission in the country , @entity14 , issued the deadline on tuesday
it 's the first time it has said it will use its troops there to implement a security area around the city of @entity23 , by the border with @entity25
sitting on the shore of @entity28 , the city has been at the center of clashes in the region over the past year between the @entity33 rebel group and @entity3 government troops that have displaced more than 100,000 people , according to the @entity6 the rebels occupied @entity23 for more than a week in november before withdrawing amid pressure from regional leaders and the @entity39
renewed attacks but since mid-may , @entity33 forces have carried out repeated attacks on government troop positions " in an apparent attempt to advance on @entity23 and @entity47 , " another nearby city , the @entity6 mission says
the rebels have used " indiscriminate and indirect fire , including by heavy weapons , resulting in civilian casualties " and attacks on @entity6 installations , the peacekeepers say
the latest fighting has also reportedly drawn in a group of @entity58 - based rebels
if rebel troops in an area of @entity68 that includes @entity23 and @entity47 ignore thursday 's deadline to give up their weapons at a @entity6 base , " they will be considered an imminent threat of physical violence to civilians and @entity14 will take all necessary measures to disarm them , " the peacekeepers ' statement says
those rebels who agree to hand in their arms will enter a process of demobilization and reintegration , the @entity6 says
a breakaway group the @entity33 group was named for a peace deal of march 23 , 2009 , which it accuses the government of violating
the soldiers , mostly from the @entity85 ethnic group , became part of the national army through that accord
however , they broke away from the @entity3 army last year , complaining they were n't being promoted as promised , and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions
the latest unrest continues a cycle of misery in the eastern @entity3 , a mineral - rich region at the epicenter of a political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east , @entity58 and @entity25
region in crisis the humanitarian crisis in the region involves 2.6 million internally displaced people , the @entity6 says , and 6.4 million people in need of food and emergency aid
the area has been embroiled in violence since 1994 , when ethnic @entity113 forces crossed the border from @entity25 fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country
at least 800,000 people in @entity25 were killed in the 1994 genocide , one of the worst mass slaughters in the @entity123 era
the victims were mostly from the @entity85 ethnic minority , who were targeted by @entity113 over a rivalry that dates to colonial days
some moderates from the @entity113 majority who supported @entity85 also were killed .
