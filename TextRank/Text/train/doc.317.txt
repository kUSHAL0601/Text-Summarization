-- thank you , @entity2 , for stepping up and being a real man
a real man is honest and confident and can look the world in the eye and take responsibility for his own life
real men can stand up to religious zealots who believe that they have the right to stand in judgment of others
you are exactly the right man at the right time to help break down the stereotypes about gays in professional sports
and kudos to the @entity23 commissioner @entity22 for working tirelessly over decades to create a workplace environment that is inclusive and diverse across many cultural issues , including sexual orientation
" @entity2 has been a widely respected player and teammate throughout his career , and we are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue , " the commissioner said monday
having worked in sports for two decades and having been a straight ally for most of my adult life , i know this day did n't come just because president @entity37 and other politicians say it 's ok to be gay
sure , having the topic of @entity43 equality in the public conversation is an important part of changing a culture , but it has been the everyday people with the courage to advocate for equality and break down hostile environments that make a day like monday possible
the @entity23 , more than any other professional men 's sports league , has worked to create a culture that supports gay athletes
no doubt , there will be critics and ugly accusations thrown at @entity2
and that , along with his anemic stats -- 1.1 points per game -- might make it a challenge for him to find a job in the @entity23 next season
but the reaction from his peers to his coming out has been overwhelmingly positive : @entity23 star @entity73 , an ex-teammate of @entity2 , tweeted : @entity74 â‚¬
