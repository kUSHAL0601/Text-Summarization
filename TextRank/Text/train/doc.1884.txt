a gunman who shot dead two @entity2 officers inside the @entity4 interior ministry remained at large late saturday as @entity2 officials decried the attack in @entity7
" this act is unacceptable , and the @entity2 condemns it in the strongest possible terms , " @entity9 press secretary @entity8 said in a statement
the @entity14 claimed responsibility , though @entity17 and @entity4 officials are investigating and have not confirmed involvement by the @entity20 militant group
a @entity14 spokesman said the attack was in response to the recent burning of @entity25 at a @entity2 base
the killing of the officers prompted gen. @entity29 to order all military advisers with the @entity31 to withdraw from government ministries in the @entity4 capital as a precaution
according to @entity31 , initial reports indicated that " an individual " turned his weapon against @entity17 service members , later confirmed by an @entity4 police official to be an @entity2 colonel and major
the two officers were found dead in their office from gunshot wounds to the head , the @entity4 police official said
" they were part of the advisory mission there , " the official said
" at this stage we ca n't say why they were killed
" hours later , @entity2 president @entity54 called @entity29 to discuss the situation and express condolences to the families
" we welcome president ( @entity62 ) @entity61 's statement this morning encouraging peaceful expressions , and his call for dialogue and calm , " @entity54 said in a statement released by the @entity59
" the @entity2 remains committed to a partnership with the government and people of @entity4 , as we work to realize our shared goal of disrupting , dismantling and defeating @entity71 and strengthening the @entity4 state
" photos : faces of the @entity14 the investigation into the attack is ongoing , and it was unclear who the shooter was , the @entity4 official said
however , it 's unlikely that the gunman was an outsider who had infiltrated the ministry , he said
the attack happened in a separate compound inside the interior ministry where as many as 10 @entity2 are based , the @entity4 official said
such an attack would have to be planned , he said
" the perpetrator of this attack is a coward whose actions will not go unanswered , " @entity29 said
@entity29 's order for @entity31 advisers to withdraw includes the interior and defense ministries , among others , the @entity2 official said
the @entity97 announced that @entity99 officials working in @entity4 ministries in @entity7 have also been withdrawn , as a " temporary measure
" @entity31 provides advisers in key ministries to help train @entity4 officials
it is not clear to what extent @entity31 's military training mission was affected by the attack
@entity4 defense minister @entity108 called his @entity2 counterpart , @entity109 , to offer his condolences and apologized for the attack , @entity8 said
@entity109 " urged the @entity4 government to take decisive action to protect coalition forces and curtail the violence in @entity4 after a challenging week in the country , " he added
@entity117 , a @entity14 spokesman , said " the attacker is still alive and resisting and a second @entity117 managed to escape the ministry
" " this comes amid our call to all @entity4 security forces to turn their guns towards the invading forces who are the real enemies of our country and religion and kill them so they leave our country , " @entity117 said in an e-mail
saturday 's brazen attack at the interior ministry came amid continued protests over the recent burning of @entity135 at @entity136
a military official said the materials burned were removed from a detainee center 's library because they had " extremist inscriptions " on them and there was " an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications
" a fifth day of demonstrations over the burning left four civilians dead and 50 injured near the @entity151 office in @entity152 , said @entity153 , head of the city 's health department
twelve police officers were among the wounded saturday
@entity29 addressed the burning issue during a visit to a military base where two @entity2 soldiers were killed thursday by a man wearing an @entity163 uniform
a protest over the burning of @entity25 was taking place outside the base at the time of the killings
@entity29 called on troops to " show the @entity4 people that as bad as that act was at @entity136 , it was unintentional , and @entity2 and @entity31 soldiers do not stand for this
we stand for something greater than that
" @entity54 also apologized for the incident
@entity180 believe the @entity181 is the word of @entity182 , so holy that people should wash their hands before touching the sacred book .
