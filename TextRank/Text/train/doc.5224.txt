-- @entity2 president @entity1 appeared on state television with a shaved head monday , telling viewers it is a sign that his cancer treatment is working
he referred to it as his " new look , " using an @entity11 fashion phrase to describe his appearance
" chemotherapy attacks the whole body , and the act of hair falling out is normal , and it also shows that the treatment is effective , " he said
@entity1 said his cancer treatment is going well and he is " advancing optimally
" in june , @entity1 announced that doctors had removed a cancerous tumor from his body , but the @entity2 leader has not specified what type of cancer
he traveled to @entity24 last month for about a week of chemotherapy
@entity1 was jovial as he spoke to members of his cabinet for more than an hour after swearing in several new government ministers
he mocked critics for widespread speculation about his illness
" they keep speculating without any scientific basis , " he said
@entity1 also reiterated his support for @entity35 , reading a letter he recently received from the embattled @entity38 leader
in the letter , @entity35 said he was praying for @entity1 's health and decried what he called a global conspiracy against @entity38
@entity1 and @entity35 have a close relationship , having bonded partly over shared opposition to the @entity46 ' global influence
in 2009 , a new football stadium in @entity38 was named after @entity1
the @entity2 leader has spoken out numerous times since unrest erupted in @entity38 , accusing the @entity46 and other countries of blowing the situation out of proportion to justify an invasion
on monday , @entity1 applauded with his cabinet ministers as they chanted , " long live @entity35
" " brother , we are with you and we are with @entity38 , " he said , saluting toward the camera .
