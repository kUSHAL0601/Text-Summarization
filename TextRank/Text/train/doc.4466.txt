-- @entity2 law enforcement officials believe they may have identified the masked man seen in the @entity6 video of the killing of @entity2 journalist @entity8 , two @entity2 officials told @entity0
" they have a pretty good idea of who it may be , " a @entity2 official said
but the official cautioned that " it 's not 100 % yet
" neither official , who spoke to @entity0 on the condition of anonymity , was willing to identify the suspect , citing the ongoing investigation
the official said , " we 've been using all means to identify the person
" that includes voice analysis and analyzing metadata from the video as well as other methods , according to the second @entity2 official
the official declined to elaborate on what those other methods were
in late august , @entity29 ambassador @entity28 said his country was close to identifying the @entity6 militant
@entity28 did n't elaborate about the identity in the august 26 interview , which aired on @entity0 's " @entity34 " with @entity35
" we 're putting a great deal into the search , " @entity28 said at the time , referring to the use of sophisticated technology to analyze the man 's voice
the subject is believed tied to a group of extremists based in @entity47 , the officials said
@entity49 agents have been working with @entity29 authorities to nail down who the subject is , a priority for both governments
the same @entity2 official said the @entity29 has investigative interest because the masked man is believed to be a @entity29 citizen who traveled overseas to engage in conflict
the @entity2 has investigative interest because he killed an @entity2
authorities are still trying to determine the identity of the militant speaking in the video of @entity2 journalist @entity63 and determine if it is the same person in the @entity8 video , according to one of the officials
the source said " it 's too premature " to know with any certainty just one week since the video of @entity63 's death was published
the source said @entity29 and @entity2 authorities would work together to find the masked man , who is believed to be in @entity74
" this person is in an environment that 's highly dangerous
he could meet his demise on the battlefield , " the official said , though the sources did not rule out bringing the suspect back for trial in @entity29 or @entity2 court
@entity8 disappeared on november 22 , 2012 , in northwest @entity74 , near the border with @entity85
at the time of his disappearance , he was working for the @entity2 - based online news outlet @entity89
the video of his beheading was posted to @entity92 on august 19
@entity63 disappeared while reporting from @entity74 in august 2013
the video of his death was posted september 2 .
