@entity0 , @entity1 -- a military prosecutor said @entity4 acted as a " determined insider " in leaking classified information about the wars in @entity8 and @entity9 and should be locked up for 60 years at least , but the @entity12 private 's lawyer contended he can be rehabilitated and should not " rot in jail
" the two sides delivered their final sentencing arguments to col. @entity17 , the judge who convicted @entity4 at trial and will now determine his punishment
he faces up to 90 years behind bars for the largest leak of classified information in @entity25 history
" there may not be a soldier in the history of the @entity12 who displayed such an extreme disregard " for his mission as a soldier , capt. @entity33 , the prosecutor , said
his arrogance , according @entity33 , meant he " felt he alone was knowledgeable and intelligent enough to determine what information was to be classified
" @entity33 asked that @entity4 , 25 , serve a minimum sentence of six decades behind bars , saying his actions created grave risk , disrupted diplomatic missions and endangered lives
defense attorney @entity43 did not ask for a specific sentence , but said his client was an excellent candidate for rehabilitation , and that he should not be left to " rot in jail
" " perhaps his biggest crime was that he cared about the loss of life that he was seeing and could n't ignore it
" @entity43 said of @entity4 's decision to turn over the explosive information to @entity55
" this is a young man capable of being redeemed , " @entity43 said in final remarks
" the defense requests , after the court considers all the facts , a sentence that allows him to have a life
" @entity17 recessed the proceedings until tuesday morning but it is not clear when she will render a decision
@entity4 was convicted of numerous counts in july , including espionage - related charges
he avoided a potential life sentence when @entity17 rejected charges that his actions aided the enemy
in addition to prison , prosecutors also want @entity4 to forfeit pay and benefits and pay a $ 100,000 fine
officials indicated a single sentence would cover all of the guilty counts .
