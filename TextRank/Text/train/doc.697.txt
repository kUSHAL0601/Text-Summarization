president @entity0 took his economic relief plan on the road to @entity3 wednesday , highlighting new measures designed to help college graduates manage student loan debt
one of the president 's measures will push up the start date for more favorable terms on a special loan repayment program based on income
another measure is designed to encourage graduates with two or more kinds of federal loans to consolidate them and get a small break on interest rates
@entity0 discussed the two initiatives -- part of a @entity22 strategy to bypass a polarized , seemingly ineffectual @entity23 -- during an appearance in @entity25
the stop came at the end of a three - day presidential trip that also included stops in @entity30 and @entity31
" these changes will make a difference for millions of @entity35 , " @entity0 told a college crowd
" we should be doing everything we can to put a college education within the reach of every @entity35
" the president also blasted @entity23 for failing to pass his larger $ 447 billion jobs bill , once again accusing @entity42 of blocking his agenda for short - term partisan gain
" it 's time to put country ahead of party , " he declared
" it 's time to put the next generation ahead of the next election
" college education costs have continued to spike in recent years
the price of attending the average public university rose 5.4 % for in - state students to $ 21,447 this fall , according to a report released wednesday by the @entity56
the cost for one year at a typical private college rose 4.3 % to $ 42,224
the average student loan debt for the graduating class of 2009 at four - year nonprofit colleges was $ 24,000 , according to the @entity62
while college costs are rising , employment prospects for new college graduates are dimming
in 2010 , the unemployment rate for college graduates age 24 and younger rose to 9.4 % , the highest since the @entity69 began keeping records in 1985
one of @entity0 's proposals would advance the start date for a special loan repayment program based on income that aims to help struggling graduates
the way the @entity77 works now is that graduates who enroll get charged 15 % of their monthly discretionary income to pay off loans , with debt forgiven after 25 years
@entity23 passed a law set to go into effect in 2014 that would drop the monthly payment for loans originated that year to 10 % of discretionary income and would forgive all debt after 20 years
the administration would improve on the law by fast - forwarding the new terms to take effect in 2012 on loans originated that year , @entity22 domestic policy adviser @entity85 noted tuesday
so far , about 450,000 students are enrolled in the income - based repayment plan , but hundreds of thousands more are eligible
the other proposal would encourage graduates with two or more kinds of federal loans to consolidate their loans , giving them a small interest rate break of 0.5 % , according to @entity85
@entity0 's student loan relief event in @entity3 followed an appearance in @entity30 on monday in which the president unveiled new measures meant to help struggling homeowners refinance their mortgages
most economists cite the depressed housing market as one of the primary reasons for country 's continued economic weakness
political analysts also cite electoral reasons for the president 's current trip , which has included a number of fundraisers for his upcoming re-election campaign
@entity0 carried @entity3 and @entity30 in 2008 , but both states are expected to be hotly contested in 2012
the president 's focus on college loan assistance could also help him with younger voters -- generally a core @entity124 constituency
in 2008 , @entity0 carried two - thirds of all voters ages 18 to 24 , according to national exit polls .
