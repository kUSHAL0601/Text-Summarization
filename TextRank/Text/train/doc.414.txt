@entity1 , @entity0 -- when you are next in the lobby of a @entity6 hotel in @entity7 , take a deep breath
it may not hit you at first , but if you 're careful you should detect a hint of geranium or a note of freesia
branded scents of flowers are becoming a common feature in hotel lobbies the fragrance is part of the hotel chain 's attempt to elevate the senses , transform the space and , above all , create a memorable experience for its guest
@entity6 are not alone in this approach
other business travel environments including business class lounges and planes are filling their air with branded scents as companies cash in on the power of smell as a marketing tool
the idea is that the sense of smell is closely linked to the part of the brain that controls both emotion and memory
in fact , three quarters of our day - to - day emotions are thought to be influenced by what we smell
brands for decades have created logos , and relied on their repeated use to build a visual association , and with that brand loyalty and engagement
but as @entity55 , executive director of @entity56 ( that is spearheading the concept of sensory branding ) says , vision goes to the part of the brain that controls rational thought
" this means we tend to override the signals , " he says
" but because smell goes to the part of the brain linked to emotion , it creates a more direct and powerful response
if we can create associations with a fragrance , then it becomes a very powerful way to enhance the brand
" using smell as a branding technique is not new
since the 1990s , @entity76 has been using its own fragrance , known as @entity78
flight attendants wear it as perfume , it is blended into the hot towels served before take - off and it wafts through the cabin during the flight
as outlined in the book @entity85 my @entity87 , also @entity88 , you may not necessarily remember the smell , but as soon as you step into the aircraft it has the " potential to kick - start a kaleidoscope of smooth , comfortable memories , all reflecting the more obvious customer service and quality efforts of the @entity76 brand
" @entity55 also founded @entity99 that specializes in providing aromatic solutions in marketing
seven or eight years ago he worked with @entity102 to develop a fragrance for seven the airline 's business class lounges
the idea was to bring " the outdoors in " , says @entity55 , through the use of smell of running water
unfortunately , this work coincided with @entity113 's tail re-branding exercise and the smell was literally drowned out
other smells have lingered , however
retailers and food service companies are increasingly using it as a technique and @entity120 has pumping smells into its @entity122 and 125 @entity6 for over 18 months
@entity123 , @entity124 spokesperson for @entity120 says the scent in the @entity6 hotels has proved a hit with guests
as a result , they have now created their own line of candles and potpourris so guests can take the smell home with them
" hundreds of guests asked how to purchase the scent for their home prompting a waiting list for the exclusive collection months before its debut , " she says
but for those who might have thought existing advertising techniques were sinister enough , this new multi-sensory approach may really get up your nose
others have been concerned about the overuse of chemicals and the risk of exacerbating allergies
( @entity120 says its smells are natural and hypoallergenic )
other critics say smells are simply obtrusive
but @entity55 is not deterred
this is not about bombarding people with a smell , he says
" we are talking one or two parts of fragrance per billion molecules of air
humans can detect tiny amount of air , so it should be done very subtly
" and after all , he adds , when you go into a business lounge it 's going to smell of something
so rather than the whiff of a take - away burger or a sweaty traveller create the emotional response , why not use something a bit more refreshing ? e-mail to a friend
