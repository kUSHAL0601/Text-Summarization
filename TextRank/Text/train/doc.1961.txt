@entity0 -- raging clashes between police and protesters in @entity6 on saturday left two people dead and 750 injured , the @entity2 reported , prompting a call from a prominent grass - roots group for citizens to resist the military - led government
the april 6 movement , which figured prominently in the toppling of president @entity14 this year , issued a statement urging its members to descend on @entity0 's @entity17 " immediately because resistance is the only solution
" " down with military rule , " the movement said
the fighting erupted earlier in the day when police worked to clear the area of people who remained in the square after friday 's massive protests in @entity17
tens of thousands of @entity6 turned out friday to protest plans for a constitution that would shield the military from public oversight
as evening came saturday , police blanketed the square and fired tear gas
the security forces soon withdrew and stationed themselves at the @entity36
warning shots were heard throughout the day
thousands of protesters remained at the scene
they chanted against the @entity41 , which rules @entity6 , and field marshal @entity42 , the head of the council who is effectively the interim ruler of @entity6
protesters threw @entity47 cocktails and rocks and torched a police van
scuffles broke out on side streets and clouds of smoke rose from burned tires , witnesses said
clashes between protesters and police also reportedly broke out in the cities of @entity60 and @entity61
two people died after being shot -- one in @entity0 , one in @entity61 -- said @entity63 , a spokesman for the @entity2
state media reported that 750 people were injured , citing the @entity2
the @entity36 also said 20 police officers have been injured and eight people have been arrested
" we sent hundreds of @entity69 and forced out the remaining several hundred protesters who refused to go home
we arrested four thieves and thugs who acted aggressively and beefed up security in and around square overnight , " @entity36 spokesman @entity72 said earlier saturday
the @entity78 held an emergency meeting to discuss the recent clashes and warned they could have a dangerous impact on @entity6 , state media said
the friday throng , dominated by @entity84 parties but including secular protesters as well , turned out ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections set to begin on november 28
@entity72 said the " islamists and revolutionaries had left as they promised not to have a sit - in
" but stragglers remained , and he said many of the people who stayed in the square were families of those injured during the upheaval earlier this year that led to @entity14 's departure and the ushering in of the supreme council as interim rulers
@entity100 , the official spokesman of the @entity102 political party , said he thinks that the violence could affect election plans
" the protesters are a bunch of kids that attacked the security forces which is a red line and could delay elections , " @entity100 said
the military said it wants to transfer power to a civilian parliament and president , but many citizens are dissatisfied with the pace of the transition and the resolve of the military rulers
but protesters were upset friday about proposed principles for the constitution , in which the military 's budget would not be scrutinized by civilian powers
they worry that the military would be shaped as a state within a state
the outpouring reflected the power of @entity84 forces in @entity6 , particularly the @entity133 's @entity132
a leader of that group called for restraint in the wake of saturday 's clashes , state media reported
the demonstrations occurred a day after hundreds of @entity141 marching in @entity0 were attacked by unknown assailants
at least 32 people , including two police officers , were injured
they were heading to @entity0 's @entity17 to commemorate the deaths of @entity147 protesters killed in clashes in the @entity6 capital last month
problems between @entity6 's @entity102 majority and the @entity141 have been on the rise in recent months , with a number of violent clashes reported between the two groups
protests also stretched to the @entity157 on saturday , where demonstrators gathered in the nation 's capital in opposition to military rule in @entity6
protester @entity164 , a member of a group called the " @entity166 , " said @entity6 's military " has been taking civilians before military courts , and we are against that
" they are torturing a lot of young revolutionaries , accusing them of being traitors , and that is not true , " he said
@entity1 's @entity177 contributed to this report
