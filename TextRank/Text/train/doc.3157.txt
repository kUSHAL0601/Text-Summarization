-- police violated the rights of a man charged in the death of a @entity7 , @entity8 , anchorwoman by interviewing him twice without his lawyer present , defense attorneys said in a motion
@entity11 spent five days in the hospital before she died from her injuries
the motion requests a judge bar police from " interviewing , interrogating or otherwise communicating with " @entity16
in their response , however , prosecutors note that @entity16 initiated both interviews with police and waived his right to have an attorney present
a hearing is scheduled tuesday on the issue , according to the @entity27 court clerk 's office
@entity16 , 28 , is charged with capital murder , rape , residential burglary and theft in the death of @entity11
@entity11 , 26 , was found unconscious in her home october 20 and died five days later at a hospital
she was the morning news anchor for @entity36 , a @entity0 affiliate
authorities have said @entity16 is linked to @entity11 's death through dna testing
@entity41 spokesman lt. @entity40 and prosecutor @entity42 declined comment to @entity0 monday , citing a gag order imposed in the case
however , in @entity42 's response to the motion , he notes @entity16 initiated both of the interviews
in the defense motion filed earlier this month , @entity16 's public defenders wrote they notified the court in december that he intended to assert his right to remain silent and communicate only through his counsel
a judge issued an order directing that police provide sufficient notice to defense counsel before transporting @entity16
however , the defense alleges @entity41 transported @entity16 to a police station and interviewed him without notifying them in december and again in february
in december , the attorneys said they were notified by jail staff that @entity16 had been taken for a police interview
they went to the jail and waited at the inmate entrance in hopes of seeing him as he arrived but police " deviated from normal practice and took him through an entrance on the opposite side of the building from that which is ordinarily used , thereby avoiding the possibility that mr. @entity16 would see his attorneys
" they said in december , police did not allow them to speak with @entity16
in february , they claim in the motion , @entity16 was not notified of their request to speak with him during the police interview
although police claim that both of the interviews were initiated by @entity16 , " the detectives ' lack of candor with mr. @entity16 during the interviews violates his @entity94 right to counsel , " the defense motion said
" @entity98 detectives have engaged in subterfuge and have violated both the meaning and the express language of a standing court order in their successful attempts to interrogate mr. @entity16 outside the presence of counsel
" but , prosecutors point out in their response , a defendant is allowed to initiate contact with authorities , even if represented by counsel
" the only issue here is whether the defendant waived his @entity94 right to counsel by initiating contact with the police , and clearly he did , " @entity42 wrote
they also said defense attorneys were notified in december that @entity16 was being transported from the jail -- by the jail staff
and in february , they said , police could not have violated the district court order in the case because the district court lost jurisdiction over the case when it was filed in circuit court -- as spelled out in the order itself
prosecutors also note that despite requests by the defense to speak to @entity16 , " as counsel knows ... law enforcement is under no obligation to allow an attorney access to their client under these circumstances unless the defendant asks for the attorney
" @entity16 's trial has been set for september 9 , according to court documents .
