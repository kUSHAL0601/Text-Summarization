-- @entity1 may help you doze off at night , but it 's the morning after that has officials concerned -- which is why on thursday they halved the recommended dosage for the well - known sleep aid
the @entity8 cited data showing that a person may be less alert and do things such as driving less safely the day after taking @entity1
in particular , the federal agency pointed to one study of 91 healthy adults between the ages of 25 and 40 , some of whom were given 3 mg of @entity1 , while the others got a placebo , or inactive pill
men and women who took the active drug had " severe next - morning psychomotor and memory impairment " some 7Â½ hours later , as well as " impairment to driving skills , memory and coordination as long as 11 hours after the drug is taken , " according to an @entity8 news release
as a result , the @entity8 decided to decrease the recommended starting dose of @entity1 , as sold by @entity34 under the brand name @entity1 , from 2 mg to 1 mg. the federal agency noted that health care professionals could increase the dosage as high as 3 mg while warning of the consequences
" to help ensure patient safety , health care professionals should prescribe , and patients should take , the lowest dose of a sleep medicine that effectively treats their insomnia , " said dr. @entity40 , a drug evaluation director at the @entity8
@entity34 , the company that makes and markets @entity1 , did not immediately respond thursday to @entity0 requests for comment on the recommended dosage change
according to the product 's website , @entity1 is " the no. 1 prescribed branded sleep aid , " with more than 31 million prescriptions for the drug written
the same site states that " more than 30 studies " have shown lunesta " to be effective in many different types of insomnia patients , " adding that " there are no restrictions on duration for taking @entity1
