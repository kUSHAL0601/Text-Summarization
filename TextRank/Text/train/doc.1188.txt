@entity0 , @entity1 -- driving in @entity1 is dangerous in no small part because many drivers tend to ignore traffic rules
in 2011 , @entity1 recorded more than 2 million road accidents , which led to more than 62,000 deaths , according to @entity1 's transport ministry
despite steps to punish violators with harsher penalties , many drivers are crying foul
read more : @entity14 starts in gridlock for @entity1 travelers the revised rules took effect nationwide on tuesday , the start of the new year
they include heavier penalties for drunken driving , talking on the phone while driving , as well as for running red and yellow lights
each violation incurs the deduction of points from a driver 's license , and the deduction of 12 points results in the suspension of a driver 's license
to get it back , the driver must undergo a seven - day class of traffic rules and take a test
many drivers thumb down the tougher rules , especially the one that considers a yellow traffic light the same as a red light
running through them twice within a year can now result in the suspension of a license
" i 'm among the first victims of the new rule , " wrote netizen @entity48 on @entity1 microblogging website @entity49 , " i hit the car before me this morning when the driver slammed on the brake when the light turned yellow
slow down when you 're 1 km away from the traffic lights
" unlike in some cities , @entity0 has not installed traffic lights with numerical countdowns before they change , making it difficult for drivers to slow down or stop in time
" if yellow light equals red light , we do n't even need green lights any more
on and off of one light can do the work , " @ yujianshouqing posted
a poll on @entity49 shows 13,000 users , or 84 % , of netizens who responded considered the new rule as " unacceptable "
@entity0 's traffic management bureau says the new regulations will be carried out strictly , even if countdown screens are not installed
according to local newspapers , the first traffic ticket for running a yellow light was issued tuesday in @entity81 , a city in southwest @entity1
other cities like @entity83 do not plan to punish drivers who run yellow lights -- for now
still , a @entity1 official from the @entity88 's traffic control bureau said road accidents in five major cities -- @entity0 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 -- have decreased by 9 % to 30 % since the new rules took effect .
