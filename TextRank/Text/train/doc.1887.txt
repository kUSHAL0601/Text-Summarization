-- saturday , june 1 , marks @entity2 's 87th birthday
or rather , it marks the 87th anniversary of her birth
it 's difficult , after all , to envision what an 87th birthday might look and feel like for someone who died more than a half - century ago , when she was just 36 years old
here , in a quiet tribute to @entity2 , @entity0 presents a series of color pictures by @entity13 , made at the movie star 's @entity15 home almost exactly 60 years ago in the spring of 1953 , when she was just 26
what 's perhaps most striking about these photos , especially in light of all we now know about @entity2 's fraught and deeply sad life , is how relaxed , self - possessed and ( dare we say it ? ) happy she looks
