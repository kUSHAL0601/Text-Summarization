@entity0 , @entity1 -- with all eyes focused on how the @entity7 will do this november , the story about the divisions unfolding within the @entity5 have equally important long - term consequences for national politics
and now with the @entity12 movement as an additional force in the party , @entity5 leaders are struggling to contain tensions between right - wing activists and fiscal conservatives
in recent months , these tensions have been growing because new faces have emerged within the @entity5 that do n't fit neatly within the @entity12 fold
one of the candidates who has received the most buzz in @entity5 circles is @entity1 gov. @entity23 , dubbed " gov. @entity25 " by one columnist
how @entity23 fares in the coming year will be a critical test to gauging where the @entity5 might be in 2012
the blunt and humorous @entity5 who replaced @entity7 gov. @entity31 has been making a name for himself by taking on @entity1 's fiscal mess
@entity23 , a former @entity35 attorney general who looks and sounds like the kind of guy you would sit next to at a @entity39 game , has focused all of his energy on reducing the budget and limiting property tax increases
he has been willing to challenge powerful interest groups like the teachers ' unions , and he did n't budge when citizen protesters took to the streets and railed against the impact of his budget
@entity23 also instituted reforms to the pensions of government workers
he has received some grudging support from @entity7 and has persuaded the state legislature to go along with many controversial proposals , primarily because most experts acknowledge tough steps are needed to avoid having @entity1 become another @entity62
the first test for @entity23 will be the political response when @entity1 residents see the impact of the budget cuts
historically , at the national level , @entity5 have often backed off from tough talk about spending reduction when programs proved to be more popular than conservatives expected
this is what happened when president @entity75 was forced to back off @entity77 cuts in 1981 - 1982 and the @entity78 stepped away from @entity80 cuts in 1995 - 1996
in @entity1 , it is one thing for voters to hear tough talk on controlling spending coming out of @entity86 , but quite another to see your child 's school program shut down
now that congressional democrats are on the verge of passing legislation to provide aid to the states in these areas of government , the contrast will be even sharper
there are also many questions about whether @entity23 's actions will really be able to stop property taxes from rising
the second test has to do with whether @entity23 , assuming that he continues to be successful , can find a place at the national @entity5 table
in the era of the @entity12 , the @entity5 leadership has been moving toward the right on many nonfiscal issues
last week , senate minority leader @entity110 said he favored the idea of reviewing the 14th amendment -- originally passed to protect the citizenship rights of freed @entity115 - @entity35 slaves
some republicans , including @entity118 sen. @entity117 , want to make sure that citizenship rights are not granted to children who are born to illegal immigrants in the @entity35
also , the ruling by a federal judge that @entity62 's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional is sure to generate pressure on @entity5 to take a tough stand on this issue
following the 2008 election , the conservative commentator and former speechwriter for president @entity131 , @entity132 , a @entity2 contributor , had warned that @entity5 needed to be cautious about doing things to win in 2010 that would harm them in 2012 and beyond
the threat is to radicalize the party by moving it so far off center that future @entity5 candidates would have trouble winning national office
as @entity132 wrote in his blog post with regard to health care reform , " we followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement , and they led us to abject and irreversible defeat
" if @entity5 want to rebuild their party , they must make room for more pragmatic , fiscally minded conservatives like @entity23 , who are generating excitement in famously blue states
if @entity23 can survive politically from the fallout of the budget cuts , he and other @entity5 like him could cause significant trouble for @entity7 by focusing on issues like taxes , deficits and spending that , at least on the campaign trail , have often had far more impact than the social issues that tend to excite the @entity5 's base
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .
