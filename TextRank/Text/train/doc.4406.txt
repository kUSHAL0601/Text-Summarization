@entity0 -- @entity3 female lawmakers are taking the @entity4 to task for a new ban on a number of ethnic hairstyles , guidelines which some are calling racially discriminatory
the group from the @entity12 wrote defense secretary @entity13 on thursday urging the military to reconsider the rule
" though we understand the intent of the updated regulation is to ensure uniformity in our military , it is seen as discriminatory rules targeting soldiers who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain their natural hair , " the letter said
@entity29 , a @entity30 spokesman , said it had received the letter , appreciated their concerns and " will respond promptly and directly to them
" the @entity4 previously said it rejects any charges of discrimination , especially since black women were involved in helping craft the new guidelines regulating everything from the style of hair parts , the width of braids and how far thick hair can extend from the scalp
" @entity3 female soldiers were involved in the process of developing the new female hair standards , " said @entity47 , an @entity4 spokesman
" not only were nearly 200 senior female leaders and soldiers ( which included a representative sample of the @entity4 's populations ) part of the decision - making process on the female hair standards , but the group was also led by an @entity3 female
" the @entity4 has faced pushback from some @entity3 members of the military and black civilian supporters over new guidelines that mandate such things as hair " must be of uniform dimension , small in diameter ( approximately Â¼ inch ) , show no more than 1/8 ( inch ) of the scalp between the braids
" @entity4 rules ban dreadlocks and twists of any kind as well as styles it views as " unkempt " or " matted
" that type of language rankled the @entity12 members
the issue , they say , is that such phrasing implies that ethnic hair that is " natural " or not straightened with heat or chemicals is somehow unruly and must be carefully regulated to fit within white cultural norms
" the use of words like ' unkempt ' and ' matted ' when referring to traditional hairstyles worn by women of color are offensive , " the lawmakers wrote
" the assumption that individuals wearing these hairstyles can not maintain them in a way that meets the professionalism of @entity4 standards indicates a lack of cultural sensitivity conducive to creating a tolerant environment for minorities
" in issuing its newest set of appearance guidelines , the @entity4 has found itself entangled in centuries old identity politics that have been a sore point for the @entity3 - @entity3 community since slavery
