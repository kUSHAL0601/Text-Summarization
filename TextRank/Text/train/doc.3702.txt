the rumor : you can damage your eyes by looking at a computer screen for too long after staring at a monitor for hours on end , have your eyes ever felt dry , itchy or irritated ? has your vision become blurry , or have you even seen double ? has your head begun to pound because of all the squinting and straining ? annoying eye problems like these call for eyedrops -- or maybe for dropping your computer off a cliff
but are @entity14 and pcs really to blame for our eyestrain ? the verdict : computer use can definitely strain your eyes -- but there are ways to combat the damage studies have shown that between 50 and 90 % of people who work in front of a computer screen have some symptoms of eye trouble
" we definitely see a lot of people who complain of eyestrain , " says opthalmologist dr. @entity29
" hours upon hours of close focusing without taking a break is usually the main culprit
" the problem is so common , there 's even a name for it : @entity40 ( @entity40 )
upwave : is technology shortening your life ? @entity29 says that people usually blink around 18 times per minute , which refreshes the eyes naturally
but blink rates are reduced when staring at a computer screen or other digital device , and this can make your eyes burn , dry out , turn red or feel itchy
sitting too close to your computer monitor , or holding a digital device closer to your eyes than you would normally hold a book or newspaper , also poses a problem , according to @entity29
" this forces your eyes to work harder than usual as you strain to focus on tiny font sizes , " he warns
common symptoms of eyestrain and / or cvs include : sore eyes , dry eyes , teary eyes , blurry vision , double vision , light sensitivity , difficulty focusing on images , neck pain , headache or a combination of all of the above

@entity83 , founder of @entity84 and author of the @entity86 , suggests first lowering your monitor
" because conventional reading is normally done with the book or magazine held in a lowered position , having your monitor in a straight - ahead position is unnatural , " he says
" the top of the screen should be level with the eyes of the user , allowing for a slightly lowered viewing angle
" next , reduce glare by angling the monitor so that you can see no reflections of any lights on the front surface of the monitor
the preferred viewing distance is between 20 and 40 inches from the eye to the front surface of the computer screen
@entity83 suggests taking what he calls the " three @entity112 approach : " @entity113 , breathe and break
because we blink less frequently when starting at a monitor , remember to blink often to moisten and refresh your eyes
correct breathing can relax the eye muscles , so be conscious of your breathing -- especially in stressful situations , when people tend to hold their breath
and because computer work often requires intense concentration , frequent breaks are a must
" our eyes are just not designed to be used at that close distance for a long period of time , " he says
" remember the 20 - 20 - 20 rule : every 20 minutes , take 20 seconds and look 20 feet away
