@entity1 , @entity0 -- the world 's oldest known @entity3 goes online monday -- but the 1,600 - year - old text does n't match the one you 'll find in churches today
the @entity9 government bought most of the pages of the ancient manuscript in 1933
discovered in a monastery in the @entity15 desert in @entity16 more than 160 years ago , the handwritten @entity12 includes two books that are not part of the official @entity19 and at least seven books that are not in the @entity21
the @entity19 books are in a different order , and include numerous handwritten corrections -- some made as much as 800 years after the texts were written , according to scholars who worked on the project of putting the @entity3 online
the changes range from the alteration of a single letter to the insertion of whole sentences
and some familiar -- very important -- passages are missing , including verses dealing with the resurrection of @entity37 , they said
@entity38 , the @entity39 project curator , said it should be no surprise that the ancient text is not quite the same as the modern one , since the @entity3 has developed and changed over the years
" the @entity3 as an inspirational text has a history , " he told @entity2
" there are certainly theological questions linked to this , " he said
" everybody should be encouraged to investigate for themselves
" that is part of the reason for putting the @entity3 online , said @entity38 , who is both a @entity3 scholar and a computer scientist
" @entity59 will want to look very closely at it , and some of the web site functionality is specifically for them -- the ability to search the text , the ability to highlight a word , the degree of detail is particularly interesting for scholars interested in the text , " he said
but , he added , " it 's for everyone , really a wide audience , because of curiosity , because they appreciate the value of it
" by the middle of the fourth century , when the @entity12 was written , there was wide but not complete agreement on which books should be considered authoritative for @entity79 communities , according to the web site where the @entity12 is posted
the @entity3 comes from the monastery of @entity82 in the @entity15 desert , where a scholar named @entity85 recognized its significance in 1844 -- and promptly took part of it , @entity38 explained
" @entity85 was in search for ancient manuscripts , so he appreciated the age and value of it , " @entity38 said
he took a handful of pages to @entity95 to publish them , then returned in 1853 and in 1859 for more
on that last trip , he took 694 pages , which ended up in @entity99 , @entity100
the @entity102 government decided to sell them in 1933 -- to raise money to buy tractors and other agricultural equipment
the @entity9 government bought the pages for Â£ 100,000 , raising half the money from the public
@entity38 called that event one of the first fundraising campaigns in @entity9 history
film footage from the time shows crowds of people turning out to see the manuscript , which was considered a national treasure , he said
though the @entity3 has been reassembled online , in the real world it remains scattered
most of it is in @entity1
eighty - six pages are held at the @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity95 , parts of 12 pages are held at the @entity129 in @entity99 , and 24 pages and 40 fragments remain at @entity82 's @entity81 , recovered by the monks from the northern wall of the structure in june 1975
the manuscript contains the @entity3 in @entity136 , including the oldest complete copy of the @entity19
( a copy held at the @entity139 dates from about the same period
) older copies of individual portions of the @entity3 exist , but not as part of a complete text
the @entity12 also includes much of the @entity21 that was adopted by early @entity136 - speaking @entity79
that portion includes books not found in the @entity146 and regarded in the @entity148 tradition as apocryphal , such as @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , 1 & 4 @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154
the @entity19 portion includes the @entity156 and @entity157
as it survives today , @entity12 comprises just over 400 large leaves of parchment -- prepared animal skin -- each of which measures 15 inches by 13.6 inches ( 380 mm by 345 mm ) .
