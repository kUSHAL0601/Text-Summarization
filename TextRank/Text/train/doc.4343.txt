-- cool , calm and collected , @entity1 could not be more different from @entity3 's flamboyant former prime minister @entity2
the former @entity5 commissioner on sunday was nominated to succeed @entity2
@entity3 president @entity6 announced wednesday that he had nominated @entity1 as a " senator for life , " a title bestowed on those who have held distinguished roles , heightening speculation about his candidacy
if he becomes prime minister , @entity1 could be expected to bring a distinctly different approach to governing than @entity3 has experienced over the past three years
while the hot - blooded @entity2 was for many years a master of forming political alliances , @entity1 is known for his achievements as a " @entity19 , " at the heart of @entity5 's institutions
dubbed @entity22 for his work in international finance , he served as a leading @entity26 member for a decade -- including as commissioner for its financial services , market and taxation committee between 1995 and 1999 and as head of its competition committee from 1999 to 2004
in the latter role , @entity1 gained prominence for his part in blocking a merger between @entity41 firms @entity39 and @entity42 , thought to be a move that highlighted @entity5 's newfound regulatory clout
he also tangled with @entity41 computing giant @entity45 , ruling in 2004 that it had broken @entity48 competition law by having " abused its virtual monopoly power over the @entity52 desktop in @entity5
" @entity45 was hit with a huge fine and ordered to share key information with its rivals
while such moves made headlines , @entity1 's interactions in business are still a stark contrast to that of @entity2
besides being active in politics , the outgoing prime minister is also a business personality as the owner of media and financial companies , as well as the legendary football club @entity68
but beyond advisory roles with investment firm @entity71 and @entity72 , @entity1 's resume suggests he 's as much a creature of academics and policy - making as business
born in 1943 in the town of @entity78 in northern @entity3 's @entity80 region , @entity1 earned an economics and business degree from @entity68 's @entity83
he then did his post-graduate studies at @entity85 , before returning to @entity5
in 2005 , shortly after leaving the @entity26 , according to a bio on that international organization 's website , @entity1 launched @entity89 , a @entity91 - based think tank focused on economic issues
the next few years saw @entity1 remain busy in international affairs
that includes being appointed by @entity96 president @entity95 to a panel to look at promoting @entity96 economic growth , as well as helping broker a 2008 electricity - sharing agreement between @entity96 and @entity101
all the while , he has appeared to remain closely linked to his alma mater , @entity83
holding the position rector from 1989 to 1994 , the university notes that @entity1 is president of the school
@entity0 's @entity107 contributed to this report .
