@entity1 's voice trembled as he revealed the news
investigators used dna testing from a bone fragment to confirm that they 'd found his 19 - year - old son 's remains in a plastic bag , he told @entity9 en @entity10
" they gave me the news that my son is now ... he is now dead , " @entity1 said
@entity14 , the youngest of eight siblings , was one of 43 students from a rural teacher 's college in @entity21 's @entity20 state who went missing on september 26
authorities have said they believe the students ' remains were burned at a landfill , then placed inside plastic bags and thrown into a river
but so far , @entity30 's remains are the only ones that have been identified
for weeks , his family has been pushing for answers about the students ' whereabouts
@entity14 's friends from school have donated money to help them as they wait for a response , his father told @entity41
" everyone comes and gives me their support ... but now no one is going to return him to me , " he said
federal authorities say they heard confessions from drug traffickers indicating that the college students were rounded up on the orders of a local mayor and then delivered to the drug gang to be murdered
mounting fury over government officials ' response to -- and possible role in -- the students ' disappearance has fueled demonstrations across the country
at a protest in @entity63 on saturday night , a group of parents said the search for the rest of the group is not over , despite the announcement
" my son , wherever you are , i 'll keep looking for you , even if my heart is breaking by the news , " one father said
@entity72 , a spokesman for the students ' families , said they received confirmation of @entity30 's death friday from @entity78 forensic experts who are working on behalf of the families
but he said the families still believe the remaining students are alive
" if these murderers think that with a dna match of one of our boys , we are going to stop and cry , we want to tell them that they have been mistaken , that after today , this day of action will continue until we find the remaining 42 alive , " he said
at a news conference sunday , @entity21 attorney general @entity87 confirmed that @entity30 's remains had been found
he showed images of the garbage dump and the river , read from a detailed dna analysis from scientists at @entity96 's @entity95 and vowed that the investigation would keep going
" based on my own conviction and the orders of the president , we 're going to continue with this investigation until we detain all the culprits , " @entity98 said
so far , 44 police officers have been arrested inthe case , and authorities are searching for 16 others , he said
authorities have accused @entity110 mayor @entity109 of being the " probable mastermind " in the students ' disappearance
he 's been charged with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide and is now being held in a federal prison , authorities said
in all , at least 80 people have been arrested in the disappearances and the deaths , and the governor of @entity20 has taken a leave of absence amid scorching criticism that he responded too slowly to what 's been called one of the most serious human rights abuses in recent @entity129
families of the missing students have said for weeks that they do n't accept the official version and demand proof of what happened
this weekend , @entity30 's cousin told @entity136 that she was unconvinced by the dna match
" i do n't believe he 's dead , " she said
" what about the rest of them ? i feel like they 're just deceiving us
" crying for justice , clinging to hope top local cop arrested in case
