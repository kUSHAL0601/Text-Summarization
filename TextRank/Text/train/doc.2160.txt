-- there are slews of apps and websites to help you make the most of @entity7 and cyber monday , the two mondo - consumerist @entity10 holidays
but @entity11 , the out - of - nowhere social network that became wildly popular this year , may offer some of the freshest approaches to online gift - giving this season
" this holiday shopping season will mark a turning point for @entity11 , " @entity16 wrote on a @entity18 blog
" the social scrapbooking platform valued at $ 1.5 billion is n't making money itself yet
but it 's been helping retailers connect with customers since it launched a year and a half ago , and now it 's actively trying to help brands cash in
and this all - important shopping season companies are increasingly using it to drive online sales
" here are five ways you can pin yourself to a more productive ( and gift - filled ) holiday
( oh , and if you do n't know what @entity11 is , read this before proceeding
create a secret wish list : on november 8 , @entity11 updated its site to allow users to create up to three private pin boards
you could use one of these to pin images of products that you 'd like to receive during the holiday season , and then you could share that page with a couple of relatives
since posts on @entity11 link back to the website where you found the image you 're sharing , it makes it easy for @entity53 or @entity54 to find exactly the item you 're looking for
the downside : this exercise in " give me this ! " pinning could be a turn - off for family members who want to be more creative -- or for people who have only a vague idea of what gifts they would like to receive
" whatever you pin appears to refer to specific brands , colors , or size , even if that 's not what you intended , " writes @entity68 for @entity69 " @entity11 works wonderfully for sharing images of the exact tennis racquet you want , but is n't as good for convincing your family that any old tube socks will do
pin boards with gift ideas for others : if narcissism is n't your thing , you could use private @entity11 boards to make visual lists of the gifts you 'd like to buy for friends or family members
since @entity11 allows only three private boards per user , it might be smarter to make one board with gift ideas for everyone on your list
download a browser extension for @entity11 that lets you share a photo to your board in a couple clicks
" this is one time i wish @entity11 offered more than three boards , as having one for each person on your holiday list could be most useful , " writes @entity105 for the @entity106
" and if @entity113 uses @entity11 , this could change everything we know about making the list and checking it twice
" using @entity11 's mobile app , you could take these lists with you to the store
or , of course , you could go all cyber monday on it and buy the goods online
get " 30 days of @entity124 " : in a blog post on tuesday , @entity11 announced a guide to the holidays called " 30 days of @entity124 " ( not " perspiration , " but we know you were thinking it , too )
it works sort of like an online @entity131 calendar
over the next month , the company will unveil " a series of holiday boards from people , businesses , non-profit organizations , celebrities , and more , " it says
" from what to cook and how to decorate to ways to give back and health tips for the new year , there 's a little something for everyone
" day 1 : @entity146 traditions from @entity147
follow the project at this site : @entity150
follow tastemakers and stores : conveniently enough , @entity11 announced november 14 that it would allow business to create @entity11 pages
before that , the company 's terms of use prohibited a business to use the site for profit
the switch seems to be effective for websites
in a blog post , @entity11 said that @entity165 , a cooking site , saw 50,000 recipes and 139 mililon impressions in a three - month trial period
several retailers have set up @entity11 pages in time for the holidays
among them : gap , @entity174 , @entity175 's , @entity176 and @entity173
many of these pages highlight women 's apparel and accessories , which makes sense since most of @entity11 's users are female
but there are dude - specific boards too , including @entity186 and @entity187
the @entity189 and @entity190 , technology - focused websites , also have a robust set of gadget boards that may help you shop for that tech - head on your list
@entity196 on family members : finally , and maybe this is an obvious one , but if your family members are active on @entity11 ( or @entity201 or @entity202 ) , you could snoop through the products they 've posted about to get ideas for gifts that may be appropriate
if your loved ones are n't freaked out by this invasion of their public - private life , they may thank you for it later
