@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 remembers the excitement of the " change " argument in 2008
" there was really a change then , " she said with a nostalgic smile
" people were really anxious to have a new person
" working the phones for president @entity14 again four years later , though , change has a new -- and to her troubling -- meaning
it 's a little different , " she said of the then and now reaction when calling @entity20 voters in @entity1
" it was more hype i think back in 2008 , yes
" and now ? " some people are still really excited , " @entity3 said during a brief break from her phone bank work
" others say , ' oh , i do n't know , well , i have n't made up my mind
' " then comes the sales pitch , and the new reality of incumbency -- of 2012
" well you say , ' he has done this , and this , ' " @entity3 told @entity2
" and they say , ' well he promised a lot of things
' " latinos made up 13 % of the @entity1 vote four years ago , and 61 % voted for then - sen. @entity14 as he turned @entity1 blue after @entity43 presidential victories in 1996 , 2000 and 2004
but this time , battleground @entity1 is tougher territory
not that @entity39 have switched loyalties and plan to give significantly higher support to @entity43 nominee @entity47 compared to @entity48 four years ago
the question is not will @entity14 dominate the @entity20 vote , it is whether @entity20 turnout will rival 2008 levels -- here and in other key battlegrounds
@entity3 is a little worried
" yes , yes , it is a little bit harder , " she says of the then and now
" sometimes some of them say , ' well i do n't know who to vote for - these two evils , you know
' " she is a battle - tested volunteer
and shrugs off the idea that this time around is more discouraging
" you go , ' you know , you voted for this person last time
... he needs four more years to do what he needs to do
' " as critical as @entity20 turnout is for @entity14 in @entity1 , the intensity -- and strength -- of the evangelical vote is a pivotal piece of @entity47 's path to victory in the state
" he can not win unless he wins convincingly among evangelicals , " said pastor @entity79 of the @entity80 in @entity81 , a close - in @entity83 suburb
math backs up that assessment ; white evangelicals made up 23 % of the @entity1 electorate in 2008
" think about life , think about liberty , think about character and then cast your ballot , " was part of @entity79 's sunday sermon at @entity83
@entity79 steered clear of any mention of the candidates or political party from the pulpit , though in an interview he made it clear he will vote for @entity47 -- but not without some hesitation
" i was a little frustrated because he seems to have equivocated on the issue of life , and then he has come down quite dramatically on the issue of life , " @entity79 said at a suburban sanctuary that was once a supermarket
in talking to many of his 1,200 congregants , @entity79 said the consistent complaint is unhappiness with both major presidential candidates
" the frustration of not wanting to vote for either , " @entity79 said
" so i feel my role is to encourage people to vote
" will they ? @entity79 said his conversations convince him the combination of economic and values concerns are going to motivate a high evangelical turnout -- " a far greater turnout " than in 2008
visits to the competing campaign headquarters and satellite offices provide instant proof of the urgent emphasis on turnout - the so - called ground game , including nudging less reliable voters to take advantage of @entity1 's early voting window , which opens october 22
" we are , i believe , at ground zero in the presidential election , " is the view of veteran @entity134 strategist @entity133
heading into the final four weeks , @entity133 said @entity1 is again up for grabs -- and a new @entity140 poll released this past weekend backs that up
in the survey , @entity14 received 47 % support to 43 % for @entity47
just shy of six in 10 @entity144 said the economy was the top issue , and they gave @entity47 a slight edge ( 50 % - to 45 % ) when asked which candidate would do a better job on the economy
poll : @entity14 slightly ahead in @entity1 , @entity47 won debate " before the concept of red and blue , before the concept of purple , you remember they called @entity1 a ticket splitter state , " @entity133 said in a coffee shop interview across the street from his @entity83 office
@entity163 won @entity1 in 1992 , but lost it in 1996
@entity164 carried it twice , but never with more than 52 % of the vote
then @entity14 returned @entity1 to the blue column in 2008 , winning rather comfortably with 54 %
since then , however , unemployment in the state has risen a bit , from 7.2 % when @entity14 took office to 8.2 % now
in the @entity140 poll , 23 % of @entity144 said their personal economic situation had improved over the past year , 41 % said it has stayed the same , and 36 % said it was worse
in addition to evangelicals , @entity133 said @entity47 can safely count on deep support from the state 's @entity179 voters - like @entity47 members of the @entity182
" in some places , as you know , there are concerns about @entity187 , " @entity133 said
" people here all know @entity179
you wo n't hear as in some parts of the country , ' who are these people ? are they some weird cult or something ? ' ... the @entity179 thing helps him here
" the keys for the president , he said , are healthy turnout among @entity39 and a heavy focus on suburban women
on that front , @entity133 believes the @entity43 convention gave @entity134 some help
" some of this regressive rhetoric about getting rid of @entity207 or taking birth control out of a women 's health plan - that is troublesome to voters , " @entity133 said
" women are a larger majority of voters in @entity1 than they are in a lot of states
" both campaigns said having @entity83 as the site of last week 's first presidential debate helped bring extra enthusiasm to their state organizations
" it will be close here , " @entity133 said
" it will be close in @entity1 regardless
" more battleground coverage from @entity2 's @entity226 : revived auto industry gives @entity14 advantage in @entity229 @entity231 's six electoral votes could be decisive in @entity233 , swing state politics have real - life impact @entity238 - @entity237 turnout critical for @entity14 in @entity239
