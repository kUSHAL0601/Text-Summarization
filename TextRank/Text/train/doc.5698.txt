-- the incredible discovery of the @entity2 will open up new ways of probing the part of the universe that is invisible to our everyday senses : beyond ordinary matter , into the extraordinary world of dark matter
it is n't often that you get to be physically present at an historic occasion , but i was at @entity15 on july 4 when scientists at the @entity17 announced the discovery of the higgs boson particle
hundreds of young physicists had camped out from the previous night just to get good seats at the technical seminars proclaiming the discovery
what we witnessed was the first solid evidence for the particle that explains how other particles like electrons and quarks get to be massive
part of the excitement stems from the fact that the @entity2 is the final piece in an extremely elaborate puzzle : the @entity35 of particle physics
this boringly named theory has loomed triumphantly over physics for the past 40 years , withstanding all experimental challenges
with this final piece in place , we can justifiably say that we understand the behavior of ordinary matter -- the atoms and molecules that make up ourselves and our everyday world
much more of the excitement , however , had a deeper basis : if the @entity2 is the final chapter in one story , it 's also the prologue to our next adventure
this is true literally as well as figuratively
see also : what is the @entity2 and why is it important ? as successful as the @entity35 has been , we know it 's not the final answer to how the universe works
strong evidence comes from the existence of dark matter : mysterious , invisible stuff that adds up to five times as much mass as the ordinary atoms and particles in the universe
we know enough about dark matter to be sure that it 's not just some kind of ordinary matter that is hiding in the shadows
it is something truly new , something we have n't yet directly seen here on @entity76
multiple experiments are underway to look for the dark matter particles we think are all around us
not only are they " dark , " these particles hardly interact with ordinary matter at all
it 's possible , even likely , that millions of them pass through your body every second
it 's like a city with two populations , each speaking a different language , and no translators or bilingual interpreters
the two groups of people go about their separate lives , never directly speaking with each other
likewise , in our galaxy , dark matter and ordinary matter pass right through each other all the time
the @entity2 could be the bilingual particle we 've been looking for
we do n't know exactly what the dark matter is , but we certainly have our favorite theories
in many of those models , the @entity2 is the one particle that readily interacts both with ordinary protons and neutrons and also with dark matter
see also : the woman at the edge of physics there are several experiments currently running with the goal of detecting dark matter
typically they are deep underground , shielded from cosmic rays and other sources of noise , kept in environments that are as quiet as possible
dark matter particles are able to penetrate through the @entity76 and pass right through the detector
most do so unmolested , but occasionally we 'll get lucky and one will interact with the nucleus of an atom , leaving a bit of energy behind
our best theoretical guess is that the way that interaction will happen is through the exchange of @entity2 bosons
knowing something about the @entity2 will be enormously helpful in figuring out the implications if one of these experiments finds a strong dark - matter signal -- something we 're hopeful could happen in the near future
we 're not just waiting around for dark matter to be detected , either
now that we 've found the @entity2 , we can start studying its properties in detail
how is it made ? how does it decay ? are its properties those predicted by the @entity35 , or are there hints of something new going on ? if everything breaks just right , we may be able to produce dark matter directly at the @entity17
it wo n't be easy , precisely because dark matter interacts so weakly
even if you make it , it 's hard to be sure , because the antisocial dark matter particles tend to zip out of your experiment without leaving any trace behind
but once we better understand the @entity2 and the particles it decays into , we might be able to infer the presence of dark matter just by process of elimination , by pinpointing events in which more energy went into the collision than we detected coming out
even though it was n't discovered until 2012 , the @entity2 was proposed back in 1964
it is very much a child of the 20th century
in particle physics and cosmology , the 21st century promises discoveries that will help illuminate the dark universe around us
that 's the great thing about history being made : you know things are different now , but you ca n't be sure where you 're going to go next
