-- @entity2 civilians were given a brief window on friday to flee the ongoing fighting between government forces and @entity7 militants in the country 's north , according to military officials
@entity2 civilians pack a bus leaving @entity12 , the capital of the troubled @entity13
the @entity2 army is trying to push the @entity7 away from regions within the troubled @entity13
a curfew was relaxed until 2 p.m. local time friday in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity12 -- in the @entity13 -- and in @entity20 , which is a separate district
the government provided an estimated 150 vehicles to evacuate people , as private cars are not allowed to enter @entity12
the @entity7 have been concentrating forces there -- digging trenches , laying mines , taking positions on rooftops , according to strategic expert @entity31 of @entity33 , a firm that describes itself as a global intelligence company
" the @entity7 are concentrating forces in @entity12 -- digging trenches , laying mines , taking positions on rooftops , " said @entity31
" it is not clear if the @entity2 military is trained and even equipped to go into a situation like that , " she said , adding that even the @entity42 military " would have to think twice " about such an offensive
she estimates there are 5,000 @entity7 fighters in the area
" the question is : are they going to try to stand and fight , or try to regroup ? " she asked
with a government offensive against the @entity7 nearly three weeks old , a spokesman for @entity2 's army said the military intends to drive the @entity7 out of the contested area
" the whole resolve of the government and the military is to once and for all finish the @entity7 from the @entity60 , " @entity2 military spokesman maj. gen. @entity61 told @entity0 's @entity62
the @entity2 military is trying to push the @entity7 away from the heavily forested and mountainous regions of the @entity13 district toward the south , so the army can encircle the militants , @entity31 added
according to the chief minister of @entity2 's @entity70 , some 1.5 million people have been displaced by 10 months of fighting between the military and @entity7 militants along its border with @entity75
the number of people at the @entity80 displaced - persons camp in @entity82 district is expected to reach 2 million , @entity76 said
the military announced earlier this week the number was 1.3 million
the huge refugee camps that the conflict is creating could be " the perfect recruiting grounds for the @entity7 to prey on , " @entity31 said
meanwhile , the @entity89 ' top official on refugees told @entity0 thursday the world must launch a " massive international effort " to care for the refugees , or it will be " absolutely impossible " to provide for them
@entity2 prime minister @entity97 , in a speech to parliament thursday , called the refugee crisis a massive and unprecedented predicament
" they are our own people and their children are my children , " @entity97 said .
