@entity0 -- longtime local news anchor @entity2 will no longer fill her familiar co-anchor chair at @entity0 's @entity5 station , according to a company statement
@entity2 , 68 , who has spent more than three decades on - air for @entity8 and was reportedly at one time the highest paid local television anchor in the country , will not get her contract renewed when it expires in june
" we have tremendous respect and admiration for @entity2 , " said @entity12 , a spokesperson for the station
" for decades , @entity2 has been a critical part of @entity0 's longest tenured anchor team in the city and has more than earned her iconic status
" the announcement of her departure spawned a " save @entity2 " facebook page , and prompted other social media postings about her past exploits
her anchoring is punctuated by what some called a quintessential @entity0 attitude , and her often sassy comments , smirks and grins go against what might be considered typical news anchor decor
@entity35 , a @entity1 commentator who co-anchored with @entity2 for 13 of the 32 years she has worked for @entity8 , called her a " breath of fresh air in the otherwise stuffy , pretentious world of journalism
" @entity40 , a columnist for @entity41 , tweeted : " @entity42 , i hope you all get that this is wrong , stupid and evil , " her newscast was ranked no. 1 in the fiercely competitive @entity0 local news market this year among advertisers ' favorite demographic , ages 25 to 54
@entity2 did not immediately return calls seeking comment
the contract of her co-anchor , @entity53 , 68 , has been renewed for another three years
@entity2 ' role had been diminished in recent years , anchoring only the station 's 11 p.m. newscast
the show dropped her from the 6 p.m. slot last year after she returned from back surgery
she will remain on the air until her contract expires , the station said .
