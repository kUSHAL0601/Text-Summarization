-- two of the biggest stars in the @entity3 will be team - mates next season after a blockbuster trade which sees @entity7 move from the @entity8 to the @entity9 -- the home of league mvp @entity11
@entity7 is hoping his arrival will put a smile on the faces of @entity9 fans
the 37 - year - old @entity7 is one of the all - time greats of basketball , winning four @entity3 championships , three straight with the @entity20 and the other with @entity22
@entity11 is widely recognized as the sport 's current superstar , but the 24 - year - old has been left frustrated by @entity9 's failure to win the title
he stormed off the court after their loss to the @entity30 in the @entity32 finals , not even shaking hands with 2008 @entity35 teammate @entity34
the trade , which sees @entity8 get center @entity37 and guard @entity39 , has been talked about since february but finalized on thursday night
" i was elated about the trade because i get to play with one of the greatest players to ever play the game in @entity11 , " @entity7 was quoted on the @entity3 's official web site www.nba.com
@entity7 averaged 17.8 points and 8.4 rebounds in 75 games for the @entity8 last season and believes he still has much to offer the @entity3
" my numbers are not good enough to retire
three more years left , " @entity7 wrote on his @entity51 blog
his career averages are 24.7 points , 11.3 rebounds and 2.4 blocked shots , with his peak seasons coming as he led the @entity20 to three straight titles from 2000 - 02
the @entity20 traded him to @entity22 where he spent three seasons , helping them to the @entity59 three years ago
he has played in @entity8 for the past two years , restricted by injuries in his first season
the @entity9 , powered by @entity11 , won 66 regular season games and their first eight in the playoffs before coming unstuck against the @entity30
they will be hoping that @entity7 will be the final piece in the jigsaw to land the first @entity67 sports championship for @entity9 in 45 years .
