-- when @entity1 signed a multi-million dollar deal to add @entity3 to their ranks they must have salivated at the thought of the world 's top player going head - to - head with stablemate @entity10
imagine the marketing potential of their twin titans battling it out down the stretch at major championships for years to come , bedecked , of course , in @entity1 gear
that dream may well be realized in time , and @entity10 at least has one title to his name this year , but at the most high - profile tournament of 2013 to date both crashed and burned at the first hurdle
@entity25 was eliminated in the first round of the @entity27 by @entity29 's @entity28 in @entity30 , to add to his missed cut at his only other appearance this year , in @entity32
woods , the world no. 2 , did n't fare any better , losing to @entity35 the other two top seeds , @entity38 's @entity37 and @entity40 's @entity39 , the world no. 3 , went safely through to round two
@entity3 squandered early chances against @entity28 , who came to life on the back nine , chipping in for birdie at 11 and 12 before an eagle at 13 put him in the driving seat
the @entity47 won 16 to reduce the deficit to one shot but @entity28 , ranked 68 , held firm to sink a four - foot putt at the last to claim a famous triumph
" i did n't make enough birdies in the end , " @entity3 told the @entity54 's official website
" @entity28 had a nice little stretch around part of the back nine
i hung in there , but i just did n't do enough
" " deep down i knew i could beat him , " a jubilant @entity28 said
" i 'm not here for no reason
i 'm not here to make up the numbers
" i said to @entity65 , my caddie , walking down 11 or 12 , ' he 's not liking this one bit
he 's the one under pressure , i 've got nothing to lose , so let 's have a go from here
' " i 'm feeling quite good now , but it 's important not to get too high now because it 's only the first round , and i 've got another match tomorrow
" heavy snow curtailed the first day and delayed the start on thursday as the course was prepared for play
and in fading light , @entity10 and @entity35 decided to continue playing in near gloom to reach a conclusion
woods squared the game on 13 but @entity35 birdied the 15th and 16th to go two up , wrapping the match up on the 17th
woods was naturally disappointed in defeat but was pleased with his performance
" i played well , i really did , " @entity10 said
" i hit a lot of good shots out there
" it 's the nature of the format
you 've just got to beat the guy you 're playing against , and i did n't do that today
" elsewhere , defending champion @entity100 moved into the second round after a comprehensive 5 & 4 victory over @entity103
@entity39 , the 2011 champion , fought hard to beat @entity105 's @entity104 on the final hole while fellow @entity40 , and @entity110 @entity109 hero , @entity107 beat @entity111 2 & 1
@entity112 edged a close game with @entity114 , @entity115 defeated @entity116 while 2012 @entity117 champion @entity117 and 2012 @entity119 winner @entity118 moved into round two
there were other high - profile departures in the form of 2011 @entity126 pga champion @entity124 , @entity127 and 2012 @entity129 winner @entity128 .
