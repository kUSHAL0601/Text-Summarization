what 's worse than 7 feet of snow piled up in front of your house ? how about the flooding that comes once those 7 feet of snow melt ? that 's exactly what some @entity8 will grapple with when temperatures monday warm up to around 60 degrees
swift - water rescue teams and helicopters are already on standby in western @entity13 in case anyone gets caught in a deluge
@entity13 gov. @entity17 said residents should n't wait until the last minute to evacuate if they think their homes will get inundated
he advised such homeowners to clear their basements of valuables
the governor said dealing with flooding is worse than the snow
" it 's not water , " @entity17 said
" it 's a toxic brew
it has sewage in it ; it has runoff in it
" state officials have beefed up stockpiles of generators and pumps and prepared almost 180,000 sandbags
after last week 's nationwide bout with frigid weather , @entity38 temperatures could reach as 60 on monday , according to the @entity41
freezing temperatures are not expected again until tuesday night
" at least 3 feet of snow has melted so far , " @entity43 of @entity44 , @entity13 , told @entity46 's @entity45 on sunday afternoon
but @entity49 spokesman @entity48 said so far , the snow has been melting at a " relatively even pace
" " the pace of the melting and the lack of additional rain has kept it manageable , " @entity48 said late sunday night
about 700,000 people are under a flood warning until wednesday , @entity46 meteorologist @entity55 said
officials have been moving pumps into neighborhoods and sandbags near creeks
so far , the county has n't received reports of major flooding
but @entity17 has asked residents to clean out storm drains in front of their houses " so the water has some place to go
" collapsing roofs there 's also the threat of more building collapses as all the rain saturates the snow on the tops of buildings , making the load even heavier
several dozen roofs have already collapsed from just the weight of the snow , @entity49 officials said
while most of the fallen buildings were unoccupied , @entity48 said , a roof collapse at a dairy barn roof killed 25 cattle @entity17 said structural engineers will examine schools and other government buildings that might be in danger of roof collapses
he said most state government offices will reopen monday
@entity94 winds too the @entity41 in @entity38 issued a high wind warning from monday afternoon until early tuesday morning
high wind warnings are issued when sustained winds of at least 40 miles per hour are expected for at least an hour , with gusts of at least 58 mph at any time
the winds could topple trees and power lines , officials said
and with ongoing snow melt , the saturated ground will make it easier for some trees to come down
' @entity108 ' @entity110 of @entity38 was so bored that he rented a small snow tractor to clear driveways on his street , @entity46 affiliate @entity109 reported
on the way back from the rental company , he saw his pregnant wife standing in the street outside their house
so @entity110 put her on the tractor and pushed through whiteout snow to @entity124 , @entity109 said
eleven hours later , the couple 's third daughter was born
and despite the intimidating heaps of snow , strangers came to help any way they could
@entity133 of @entity134 , @entity13 , told @entity46 's @entity45 from @entity134 , @entity13 that people had come to her town from other areas to help shovel snow and drop off donations
" @entity38 is called the @entity108 for a reason , " she said
" there were people everywhere helping out
