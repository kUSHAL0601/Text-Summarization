-- i 'm going to be honest : i did n't expect to get excited over the new @entity2
in fact , just last summer i wrote about how i had fallen out of love with my @entity2
i spoke of the thrill being gone
and even though i knew it was n't the fault of the @entity2 , but @entity8 , it did n't make it any better
i was clearly taking my @entity2 for granted
in fact , i found myself checking out other phones -- sneaking a glimpse at my best friend 's @entity12
i even would @entity15 images of the new @entity16 when i was home alone
but the new @entity2 has changed all that
i dare say it 's making me fall back in love with the @entity2
and it appears i 'm not alone ; a record 9 million - plus new iphones were sold on the first weekend they were available
another view : why i 'll never ditch my blackberry look , how could anyone resist the new @entity2 ? it 's the gold standard for smartphones -- and in fact it comes in gold
that color phone is for sale on @entity32 for $ 1,500 , slightly higher than an actual ounce of gold
the new @entity2 may look the same as the old one on the outside , but just like the guys from " @entity38 " have taught us , just because things look the same , it does n't mean they are
the new @entity2 boasts a faster processor , an updated camera and even a @entity44 fingerprint system for better security
while i do n't have the new iphone yet , its rollout has made me appreciate my older @entity2 and the great times we had together
like when it helped me find my way with its " maps app " when my older gps had lost satellite reception because it was " too cloudy
" or when an @entity2 app became a white noise machine helping me sleep me on a long plane flight
and , of course , i ca n't thank my @entity2 enough for all the hours it spent with me in the bathroom as a replacement for reading a newspaper
in fact , the @entity2 is making me forget about all the arguments i had with @entity64
and when i say " arguments , " i mean me yelling at my @entity2 because @entity64 kept nagging me with comments like : " sorry , @entity69 , i do n't understand what you 're asking
" @entity16 : why breaking up is hard to do is the @entity16 better than the @entity2 ? it 's like comparing " @entity73 " with @entity72 's " newsroom
" sure , " @entity73 " may be popular , but watching it will make you dumber
the @entity2 has been a big part of my life for more than six years
and during that time we have shared so many great moments , which are all conveniently stored as photos in my @entity2
so keep your @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82
i 'm an @entity2 man and will likely be one for years to come , and not just because of the $ 350 early termination fee
i may not be perfect , but @entity8 appreciate loyalty and i appreciate the inner and outer beauty of my @entity2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity89 .
