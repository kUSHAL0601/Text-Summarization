-- @entity1 and @entity3 ' bid for a fifth consecutive @entity5 doubles title ended when they were beaten in the @entity8 quarterfinals
the defending champions were beaten 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 by @entity11 pair @entity10 and @entity12 -- their first defeat at the championships since 2003
@entity12 could potentially meet @entity3 in the single 's final if both win their semifinals on thursday
the @entity11 plays @entity18 , from @entity19 , who beat @entity1 on tuesday
@entity3 is due to play unseeded @entity22 @entity21
the @entity3 ' sisters raced through the opening set but were pegged back by their @entity11 opponents in the second
@entity12 and @entity10 broke early in the deciding set and never looked back as they powered into the final four
it means @entity8 is over for @entity1 -- the first time she will leave the @entity31 in @entity32 without a trophy since 2006
during the last three years the sisters have only been beaten five times in 60 matches and only twice in 29 matches at @entity8
@entity1 and @entity3 became the top ranked female doubles pair in the world after winning the @entity41 in @entity42 earlier this month .
