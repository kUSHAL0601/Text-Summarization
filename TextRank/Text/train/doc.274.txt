-- any doubts that @entity3 's big - name stars will struggle to play together this season were seemingly blown away in a remarkable 8 - 2 thrashing of @entity6 on saturday
world player of the year @entity7 scored a hat - trick , last year 's marquee signing @entity10 netted twice and recently - arrived @entity12 star @entity11 was also on the scoresheet in the @entity15 top - flight match
@entity17 striker @entity16 , a loan signing from @entity19 , grabbed the final two goals after coming on as a late substitute
it was the first time the club has scored eight goals in an away @entity27 match , and the winning margin matched the 7 - 1 success at @entity30 in the 1987 - 88 season
" we showed the quality we have
we have a phenomenon in @entity7 and we have other players with great quality , " coach @entity34 told reporters
" they combined very well together and that was the best thing we can take from the game
" @entity34 's team made an impressive start to its @entity44 title defense in midweek , beating @entity45 5 - 1 , but the club 's early domestic form has been patchy
this victory , after a win and two defeats , left @entity3 three points behind big rival @entity52 , which travels to bottom club @entity53 on sunday seeking to maintain a 100 % record
city rival @entity55 , which won the @entity15 title last season but lost to @entity3 in the @entity59 final , dropped points in a 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity63 later saturday
" the season is very long and recovering points on the leaders just now is n't the problem , " @entity34 added
" we have to improve
today we showed the quality everyone knows we have which is the capability to score in many different ways
" we need to continue improving the balance and our consistency
after two defeats we have scored 13 goals and that is a good sign that we have responded well
" @entity7 , who netted against @entity76 side @entity45 on tuesday , scored his 23rd hat - trick for @entity3 since joining in a then world - record $ 130 million move from @entity79 club @entity19
@entity11 , who won the golden boot as top scorer at @entity82 2014 before joining @entity3 for a reported $ 121 million from @entity83 , then scored his second goal in a week as he curled in a superb left - foot effort
@entity7 made it 3 - 0 before halftime but @entity6 pulled a goal back after the break with a penalty after @entity91 was ruled to have handled the ball
@entity10 -- whose move from @entity94 last year eclipsed the @entity97 captain 's transfer fee -- took center stage with two well - taken goals
@entity6 , which had conceded only four times in three previous games , went 6 - 1 down as @entity7 sealed his treble from @entity11 's pass before @entity104 headed a consolation
@entity16 , who replaced @entity10 , fired in a left - foot volley from the edge of the area and then added another long - range effort -- this one deflecting into the net off a defender
@entity55 conceded an early goal to @entity113 but led 2 - 1 at halftime through @entity115 and defender @entity116 before @entity117 leveled with a 53rd - minute penalty
the draw left @entity121 's team a point behind @entity52 in second , with @entity125 third on goal difference after winning 1 - 0 at @entity127
@entity128 three - time defending champion @entity129 secured a third win from three this season , as @entity134 striker @entity133 scored the only goal at @entity136 on saturday
the 71st - minute decider gave coach @entity138 a notable victory over the club that sacked him in january
it left @entity136 in second after a first defeat this @entity145 season , while @entity146 can join @entity129 on three wins from three by beating @entity148 on sunday
@entity149 @entity152 champion @entity150 was held 0 - 0 at second - bottom @entity153 on saturday , leaving @entity155 's team fourth on goal difference after a second draw in four matches
promoted @entity159 , which travels to @entity150 's @entity160 on tuesday , is top after a 2 - 0 win over @entity162 that was capped by a spectacular late volley by @entity164 from just outside his own penalty area
the top four teams all have eight points after second - placed @entity168 upset last season 's runner - up @entity169 2 - 0 and @entity172 , in third , won by the same score at @entity174
@entity175 @entity176 went top on goal difference after saturday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity179 , as @entity175 forward @entity180 scored twice
it put @entity176 above @entity182 , which won 2 - 1 against bottom side @entity183 on friday
sixth - placed defending champion @entity185 hosts @entity187 on sunday , when @entity188 could go top by beating @entity190 .
