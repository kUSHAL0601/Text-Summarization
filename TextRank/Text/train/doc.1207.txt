@entity0 -- prisoners in ice , more than 100 @entity2 in far eastern @entity4 risk death unless rescued soon
the flock of gentle ghost - white whales was trapped in ice floes in the @entity10 off the @entity11 near the village of @entity13 , said a statement from the @entity15
@entity16 reported that the whales were concentrated in two relatively small ice holes , where , for now , they can breathe freely
but the @entity2 ' chance of swimming back to water is slim due to the vast fields of ice over the strait
the whales have little food , and the ice floe is increasing , the statement said
they are at risk of rapid exhaustion and , ultimately , death by starvation or suffocation
trapped whales are also susceptible to predators like polar bears and killer whales
the @entity15 government has sought help from federal authorities and asked for an icebreaker to help rescue the @entity2
a rescue tug , @entity44 , was in the area helping a @entity47 cargo ship that ran aground on the southern coast of @entity15 but it would take one and a half days for it to reach the whales , the statement said
trapped belugas are a frequent phenomenon in the @entity52 waters but are not often detected by people
in @entity15 , the last relatively successful case was recorded in 1986 , when an ice - breaker helped free trapped beluga whales .
