-- @entity1 , the country music legend whose graceful , evocative voice gave depth to some of the greatest songs in country music -- including " @entity7 , " " @entity8 " and " @entity9 " -- has died , according to his public relations firm
@entity1 , 81 , died friday at @entity12 in @entity13 , the public relations firm said
he had been hospitalized since april 18 with fever and irregular blood pressure
@entity1 ' career was marked by a tumultuous marriage to @entity18 and bouts with alcoholism that led to occasional concert cancellations
( one of his nicknames was " @entity1 " ; after he got clean , he puckishly used " no - show " on his license plates
) but there was no denying his talent
@entity27 once wrote a song that said , " @entity1 might show up flyin ' high , if @entity1 shows up at all / but he may be , unconsciously , the greatest of them all
" famous friends chimed in after learning of his death
" my friend , the greatest singer of all time , has passed , " @entity33 wrote on @entity34
" to those who knew him , our lives were full
to those of you who do n't : discover him now
" in a statement , @entity44 said , " the world has lost the greatest country singer of all time
" @entity1 , nicknamed " @entity50 " for his resemblance to the animal , was born in 1931 in east @entity53
his early life was marked by poverty and a violent , alcoholic father
@entity1 taught himself to play guitar , and by the time he was a teenager he was singing on the streets and in the clubs of @entity61 , @entity53 , not far from his birthplace of @entity63
stars react to his death after a quick marriage and service in the @entity68 , @entity1 was discovered by @entity70 co-owner @entity69 , who guided his early career
@entity1 ' first single , 1954 's " no money in this deal , " failed to chart , but 1955 's " why , @entity75 , why " was a hit
by 1959 , @entity1 had moved to @entity13 and recorded his first no. 1 , " @entity78
" @entity1 ' early hits , such as " @entity78 , " " @entity80 " and " @entity81 , " were in a high - powered , rockabilly mode , but he found his biggest success as a crooner
ensuing years were marked by such songs as " things have gone to @entity87 " and " @entity88 for the @entity89 , " which highlighted broken or thwarted romance and the kind of longing that suggests late , lonely nights in bars
it was a life that @entity1 started knowing all too well
his second marriage , to @entity97 , was marked by frequent benders
@entity1 recalled one that became legend : he had been drunk for several days , and @entity97 hid the keys to all of their cars
however , he pointed out , she 'd forgotten one vehicle : their lawnmower
they lived eight miles from a liquor store but that did n't stop @entity1
" i imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour , " he recalled in his 1996 memoir , " i lived to tell it all
" " it might have taken an hour and a half or more for me to get to the liquor store , but get there i did
" share your memories of @entity1 @entity1 and @entity97 divorced in 1968
a year later , he married @entity18 , one of @entity13 's biggest names
the two had a number of huge hits together , but the strain of their marriage was indicated in song titles such as their " @entity127 " and the @entity1 solo song " we can make it
" ( one of @entity18 's singles was called " @entity134 " ; one of those " things " was " i want a divorce
" ) " by now , the couple 's marriage was becoming a public soap opera , with their audience following each single as if they were news reports , " wrote @entity135 in its @entity1 biography
@entity18 filed for divorce in 1973 , reconsidered and then filed again two years later
however , though the couple were divorced , they continued to sing together for years afterward
@entity1 ' life went into a tailspin
he started using cocaine and missing shows more frequently , 54 in 1979 alone , according to @entity135
his weight dropped from 150 to 100 pounds
he entered rehab but left after a month
and yet at this time he recorded perhaps his greatest song , 1980 's " @entity9 , " the tale of a man who continued pining for his lost love many years after she left him
the song , written by @entity158 and @entity159 , has been voted the greatest country song of all time in a @entity163 poll
@entity1 continued to struggle in the early ' 80s -- once leading police on a car chase in @entity13 -- but with the help of his fourth wife , @entity167 , he got clean
though his hit - making slowed down , mainly thanks to changing tastes in country music , he became a revered elder statesman , often credited as an influence by generations that followed
he paid tribute to his own and preceding generations in a 1985 hit , " @entity175
" other singers stood up for @entity1
at the @entity179 in 1999 , @entity1 was asked to shorten his hit song " choices
" he refused and boycotted the honors
but at the awards , @entity183 cut his own song short and went into " choices , " giving @entity1 his due
" not everybody needs to sound like a @entity1 record , " @entity183 once said in an interview , according to the @entity188
" but that 's what i 've always done
" his singing remains a model
" there are n't words in our language to describe the depth of his greatness , " @entity195 said in a statement
" i 'll miss my kind and generous friend
" @entity1 , a member of the @entity205 , was honored by the @entity206 in 2008 and received a @entity207 in 2012
