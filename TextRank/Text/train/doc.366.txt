-- @entity1 is not having a good year
as the company scrambles to get the @entity5 and @entity6 music service back online , it 's suffering from yet another security breach
this time it 's a hacker attack on various websites associated with @entity10
a team of individuals going by the name @entity14 , who recently managed to deface @entity17 's homepage , announced that they have broken into @entity18 and compromised more than 1 million user accounts
an additional 75,000 music codes and 3.5 million coupons were also uncovered
the attack , part of a campaign known as @entity25 , was announced on @entity26 and on the @entity14 website
@entity14 said that it did n't have enough resources to copy all the data that it was able to access
but the group did manage to grab a collection of databases that contain thousands of usernames
the accounts , presumably associated with any sort of registered activity on @entity18 ( or its subsidiaries or partners ) , contain information like passwords , email addresses , dates of birth and other @entity1 opt - in data
this certainly is n't as dangerous as the information that was exposed during the @entity5 hack , but it could still be used to gather access to more important accounts elsewhere
the scariest part of this attack is n't what was taken , but how easy it was for the @entity14 members to take it
according to the groups own press release , access to the main @entity10 website was gained using a very basic tactic called a sql injection
we have n't had a chance to examine the released files to see what this injection was , but it 's likely that an out - of - date software stack and relatively unprotected web server made passing the injection trivial
@entity14 says that all of the information it took was unencrypted
" @entity1 stored over 1,000,000 passwords of its customers in plaintext , " says the hackers ' press release , " which means it 's just a matter of taking it
" seeing as this is the second security breach of a major @entity1 - branded website in just outside of a week , we have to ask : is anyone at @entity1 employed to handle web security ? sure , managing a large number of brands and properties that are often connected in name only has to be a challenge , not to mention the logistical and administrative challenges of managing websites that can store millions of user profiles
still , that does n't make up for what by all appearances is an abysmal security record
@entity14 has been on a tear , infiltrating the websites and databases for the @entity102 television program , " @entity103 , " parts of @entity105 , @entity106 and many parts of @entity17 in the past three weeks alone
the attacks , while often juvenile in nature and execution ( the @entity112 website plays the theme from " the @entity114 " ) , underscore just how important it is for brands to keep their web servers updated , hardened and monitored
in the age of simple publishing tools like @entity121 , it 's easy for managers to underestimate the importance of having someone on contract or on staff to keep data encrypted and protected
we can only hope the most recent cyber attacks convince executives to think seriously about investing in online security
