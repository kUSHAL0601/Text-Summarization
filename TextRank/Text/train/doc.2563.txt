@entity0 , @entity1 -- polls opened sunday in @entity1 as the nation holds its first election in 20 years -- an electoral contest critics say is aimed at creating a facade of democracy
riot police could be seen earlier on some streets in the city of @entity0 , the former national capital that is also known as @entity0
in the countryside , teams of election workers for the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) had campaigned
the party is supported by the governing junta of mostly of ex-military members
" these are our candidates for this region , " a @entity20 election worker told one resident
" it is not important to put down the name of the party , but the people have to know our symbol and make their mark right here
" because many citizens in rural areas know so little about the political process , election workers said they also had to show people how to vote
" i am not just campaigning for our party , " the election worker said
" i am educating the people on how to vote
many people do n't know how to vote
" their word is very influential -- especially in rural areas , where most people in the nation live
" i do n't know anything about the election , " one woman said
" if someone tells me what to vote , i will follow that guideline
" opposition parties like the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) are complaining that a lack of money is keeping them from running and campaigning in most areas of the country
an @entity51 representative said the party will only contest in about 15 percent of constituencies
several residents told @entity2 they did not expect any change as a result of the election
" nothing will change after the election , " a farmer said
" the government is not trying to convince us
we do n't matter to them because we are poor
" not that it seems to matter to him
" i do n't care who will be elected , " he said
" i do n't know whom i will vote for because i have no knowledge of politics
" government critics say the election is a sham
the country 's ruling military junta has refused to allow international monitors to oversee the elections and recently overhauled @entity1 's constitution in a way critics say is aimed at tightening the regime 's grip
the constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament
@entity1 , also known as @entity1 , has been under military rule since 1962
in october , the military regime rejected international monitoring of sunday 's elections
" since we have many experiences in election , we do n't need experts on this issue , " said @entity95 , chairman of the election commission
" and since we have all ambassadors who are representing their countries , we do n't think we need to invite any special group to observe the election since all the ambassadors are here and can watch it on election day , " he added
leading democracy activist @entity112 has rejected voting in the elections , her lawyer said
the @entity115 , @entity112 's party , announced in march that it would not participate
a new law forced the @entity115 to choose between honoring @entity112 as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal , or ejecting @entity112 from the party and contesting the elections
" since @entity115 is not participating in this coming election , she does n't want to vote , " her lawyer @entity121 said in october
@entity112 's party won a landslide election victory in 1990 , but the military junta rejected the results
the regime recently passed a law that made @entity112 ineligible to run because of a court conviction
the @entity132 laureate has called the law unjust
@entity112 , who was awarded the @entity134 in 1991 , has spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest
a @entity1 court convicted @entity112 in august 2009 for breaching the terms of her house arrest after @entity140 @entity139 swam uninvited to her lakeside house in @entity0 and briefly stayed there
in february , a court rejected her appeal for release
@entity112 's current house arrest is due to end in mid-november , but her lawyers are skeptical that the military junta will actually release her
her supporters have said her latest conviction was a way to remove her from the election campaign .
