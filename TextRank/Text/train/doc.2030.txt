@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity0 , @entity1 , lawyer , whose well - publicized bout with tuberculosis caused an international health scare , is suing the @entity7 for invasion of privacy
@entity9 held hearings in june 2007 to discuss @entity13 's @entity12 case and the ensuing health scare
in the suit filed this week , @entity13 alleges that the @entity7 released his name and sensitive medical information to the media in 2007 , an act that harmed his reputation , his occupation and led to the ruin of his marriage
speaker did not specify a dollar amount he was seeking in damages in the suit filed in @entity29 in @entity0 , @entity1
on may 29 , 2007 , the @entity7 held a press conference stating a patient with a rare form of tuberculosis , extensively drug - resistant tb which often proves fatal , had taken an international flight
the @entity7 , the suit alleges , did not in that press conference or other press conferences , tell the public that the organization told speaker that he was not contagious and that the @entity7 knew speaker had planned to take the trip to @entity42 for his wedding
instead , the @entity7 unlawfully released extensive information about speaker such as " the fact that he had flown to @entity42 to get married , the fact that he was a lawyer in @entity0 , and most importantly , his identity -- none of which needed to be released to the general public in order to accomplish any legitimate public health purpose , " the suit said
on july 3 , 2007 , speaker 's doctors changed his diagnosis to multi-drug resistant @entity12 , a less dangerous but still potentially fatal form of the illness
the suit alleges that the @entity7 's inaccurate release of information about him caused major harm
" speaker became the object of unwanted public attention , including expressions of public scorn and contempt ( including death threats ) due to the inaccurate light in the information presented , resulting in so much strain on his marital relationship that he and his new bride parted ways after the wedding but before filing the marriage license , " the suit alleges .
