a glimpse of @entity14 's urban future or utopian fantasies ? the jury might still be out , but these are the snapshots of urban life being touted by international property developers who are announcing plans for new satellite cities and vast modern compounds across @entity14
they are usually planned to be built from scratch on the edges of the continent 's existing metropolises , many of which are creaking under the weight of growing populations and rapid urbanization rates
from the @entity34 outside @entity35 , to @entity36 near the emerging port of @entity38 , @entity39 , through the luxurious @entity40 on @entity41 in @entity42 , these urban projects are designed to offer high - quality services and modern infrastructure
