@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities stepped up security at @entity7 's @entity6 airport sunday as hundreds of @entity9 activists were due to arrive in the country in a " fly - in " campaign to protest @entity3 's policies in the @entity13
some activists were barred from entering the country for refusing to promise not to engage in disorderly conduct , but @entity3 did allow some other activists to enter , @entity3 officials said
by sunday night , 60 activists had been refused entry at the airport , @entity3 police spokesman @entity20 said
nine protesters were arrested for attempting to disrupt order at the airport , @entity20 said
he said there were 500 police officials there
@entity31 , a spokesman for the " @entity33 " campaign , said that more than 1,000 uniformed and plain clothes security officers were at the airport , in what he called a sign of " unprecedented @entity3 hysteria and paranoia
" authorities " violently arrested " the nine activists , he said
activists who were sent home were being given a letter sarcastically thanking them for " choosing to make @entity3 the object of your humanitarian concerns
" the letter says protesters could have focused on " the @entity53 regime 's daily savagery against its own people , " or the actions of @entity56 or @entity57 , but instead " chose to protest against @entity3 , the @entity59 's sole democracy , " according to a copy posted on @entity61 by @entity62 , a spokesman for prime minister @entity63
" we therefore suggest that you first solve the real problems of the region , and then come back and share with us your experience
have a nice flight , " the letter says
organizers of the " fly - in " event said some 1,500 to 2,000 activists mainly from @entity74 , the @entity75 , and @entity76 would board civilian flights for @entity3 in order to make their way to various events in @entity81 and other @entity13 cities
by sunday night , only three activists who flew in had made it to @entity81 from the @entity7 airport , they said
another 20 had entered a few days before after crossing a land bridge between @entity87 and @entity3
one of the activists who made it through said 27 other people who had flown with her from @entity92 , @entity93 , had been detained
the woman , a @entity93 citizen named @entity95 , declined to provide her last name because she said she feared repercussions from the authorities
activists told reporters sunday that the event would be a success , no matter how many people participated
" our success is measured in terms of the media publicity the @entity33 to @entity109 campaign made in shedding light on the true fate of @entity3 's dictatorship and apartheid , " organizer @entity104 said
another organizer criticized @entity3 's letter
" i tell @entity3 they are contradicting themselves about their so - called democracy when they are deporting and detaining people who are coming to visit @entity122 , " said @entity116
activists said they were trying to draw attention to what they claim are prejudicial @entity3 border policies that force many international visitors coming to @entity122 areas to lie about their destinations
" we believe , like prisoners in prisons , we are entitled to receive visitors and @entity135 under @entity3 occupation are also entitled to receive visitors , " @entity31 said
" so we are entitled to get international visitors to come and visit and show solidarity with us to learn about the situation , but @entity3 chooses to prevent these people from coming
" on sunday , he said a number of activists had reached the @entity13 , but did not say how many
the activists who were denied entry on sunday were from @entity147 , @entity76 , @entity148 , @entity93 , @entity149 and @entity150 , said population and migration authority spokeswoman @entity151
last year , organizers staged a similar event and @entity3 authorities detained and deported dozens of activists who entered the country
on tuesday , @entity3 's public security minister , @entity159 called activists " provocateurs " and told @entity3 news portal @entity160 that they would " be dealt with in a determined and quick way , " adding that " if they arrive in @entity3 they will be identified , removed from the plane , their entry into @entity3 will be prevented and they will be moved to a detention facility until they are flown out of @entity3
" to that end , @entity3 officials have been in touch with airlines and provided them with lists of people who are forbidden from entering the country
" usually airlines do n't allow these people to embark , because then they have to cover the expense of the return flight , " said @entity3 @entity183 spokesman @entity181
" what we did last year is we had a list of number of people who have been banned from entering the country in the past , and others who will be banned now because they have openly declared that they will come here to disturb public order in one way or another , " @entity188 said
@entity188 said arriving passengers who are denied an entrance visa have the right to appeal but could face three days in detention before their hearing
on sunday , one activist in the @entity206 said she was in a group of 30 passengers who were blocked from boarding a flight from @entity210 to @entity7
" @entity3 was able to stop us , @entity206 passport - holders , and @entity3 has the power to extend its apartheid to other countries and borders , " activist @entity211 said
@entity31 insists the event is entirely peaceful in nature and suggested that @entity3 authorities were over-reacting
" the @entity3 internal security is paranoid and is turning the airport into a military camp
they want to arrest the activists and are calling us provocateurs and demonstrators as they always do " @entity31 said
" the activists are coming peacefully and will visit the @entity13 and help us build a community school and then they will go home with no problems , @entity3 is creating the problems and not us
" @entity1 's @entity234 contributed to this report .
