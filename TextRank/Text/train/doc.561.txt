@entity0 -- in recent days , rogue @entity3 security forces have killed six servicemen from the @entity6 - led military coalition , pushing the number of such fatalities past 50 in a single year for the first time
the death toll highlights one of the biggest challenges facing the coalition as it nears the end of its role in @entity3 's war
these killings , known as " green - on - blue " or " insider attacks , " have increased substantially within the past two years , accounting for 14 % of coalition casualties in 2012
though statistically small compared to the numbers of @entity23 - related ( roadside bomb ) deaths , these attacks have a significant impact on the coalition 's mission in @entity3
the two provinces burdened with the bulk of green - on - blue attacks are @entity31 and @entity32
it is no coincidence that these areas are where the @entity36 are strongest , and where the country 's highest levels of opium poppy cultivation help fund the insurgency
@entity42 - on - blue attacks began to accelerate in 2011 , just after @entity44 president @entity43 announced his plan to pull @entity44 forces out of @entity3 and end combat operations in 2014 , transferring security responsibilities to the @entity3 forces
the success of the transition from @entity6 - led to @entity3 - led forces depends on the competence and commitment of the @entity55 and @entity56
but the @entity36 , operating from safe havens in @entity58 , say they have stepped up efforts to infiltrate both groups , and regularly claim responsibility for each incident
the spread of green - on - blue attacks has left coalition forces increasingly suspicious of the @entity3 forces they are training and fighting alongside
news : @entity44 restricts @entity3 operations after ' green - on - blue ' killings some @entity3 in government believe that insider attacks are based on resentment towards coalition forces based on the increasing number of civilian deaths after more than a decade of the @entity36 insurgency
in a step towards the transition , @entity3 and the @entity44 have reached a deal to curb night raids on @entity3 homes , giving @entity82 a veto over the operations , which are unpopular with local people
but although cultural and social differences may play a role in the increase in attacks , defections by @entity3 security , sometimes motivated by economic reasons , play a far more significant part in the green - on - blue attacks
the @entity44 military has tried to take action to prevent attacks by @entity3 forces , appointing monitors to provide security for troops working with @entity3 , boosting its counterintelligence infrastructure in @entity3 , adopting an eight - step vetting process for @entity3 recruits and revising the training they receive
in addition all @entity44 and @entity6 troops were recently ordered to carry loaded weapons at all times
so far , though , none of these strategies appear to be stemming flow of violence , only serving to increase the trust deficit between coalition and @entity3 forces the @entity36 have utilized green - on - blue attacks in their propaganda : last month , @entity115 , leader of the @entity36 faction known as the @entity117 , claimed the @entity36 had " cleverly infiltrated in the ranks of the enemy " and encouraged @entity3 government officials and security personnel to defect to the @entity36 as a matter of religious obligation
one could argue the @entity36 communicate better with the @entity3 people than coalition troops , distributing internet videos through websites and mobile phones , which are becoming omnipresent -- more than half of the @entity3 population is reported to own a cellphone
the anti-islam video which went viral this month created a spark that quickly spread , engulfing the @entity136 world in anger , with radical militant groups fanning the flames
recent events provide reminders of what happened when the @entity144 newspaper published controversial cartoons of the @entity146 in 2005 , triggering mass protests across the @entity136 world and inspiring several terrorist plots
but the video may have even greater long - term consequences than the cartoons , especially in the age of new media
once a video goes viral , it can not be contained
the item may be taken down from some websites but it will be uploaded on others
it can be edited , altered , re-imagined , and sent instantaneously to fuel tensions and exacerbate problems
the @entity36 may use this video to provoke resentment within the @entity3 security forces on the one hand , and increase anti-western sentiment on the other hand , potentially contributing to further green - on - blue attacks
the @entity36 's aim seems to be to wear out coalition forces before the handover , and to diminish the @entity173 's credibility among the local population
they know the coalition 's limitations and have been emboldened by the scheduled withdrawal of foreign forces
news : quarter of @entity3 insider attacks by @entity36 , according to general coalition forces may be content to contain the @entity36 threat to a " manageable level " before they leave , but this adversely affects their efficacy in the eyes of the @entity3 populace
the @entity36 have numerous advantages over coalition forces in @entity3 : they have a wide recruiting base , and thanks to the drug trade they can pay recruits better than the @entity3 army or police , giving them greater staying power
the number of volunteers seems to be increasing on a daily basis
it 's worth remembering that the @entity36 is not a homogenous group : it has many factions and is a mixture of characters from ideologues , warlords and land owners to criminals , drug dealers and people out of work
the displaced and disillusioned followers of the @entity36 were molded by their country 's history of violence , and the coalition 's desire for a peaceful but quick resolution has resulted in a cheap , flawed peace initiative
the @entity36 realize the @entity173 is under pressure and do not feel any desire or need to seriously negotiate when they can simply bide their time and wait for the withdrawal of troops to stake their claim to control @entity3 in the future
the scheduled withdrawal of foreign forces means they do not need to make any commitment to prevent @entity231 and its affiliates from returning , to halt the opium trade or to improve the rights of women
what the coalition does not seem to realize is that by firstly advertising their departure date in advance and secondly holding firm to their withdrawal timeline , they have complicated the situation and worsened the damage
clearly , the hope of talking to the @entity36 has failed
they are far from being contained and instead feel they are in the ascendency
despite the enormous security problems that exist -- suicide bombings , ied attacks , and green - on - blue incidents -- abandoning @entity3 will create lasting consequences
not only will the @entity36 reassert its authority throughout the south of the country through , fear , repression and discrimination , @entity3 will again revert to becoming a cesspool for terrorist groups like @entity231
in addition , the cultivation of opium poppies will turn parts of @entity3 into a narco - state controlled and sanctioned by the @entity36 , providing resources to a terrorist infrastructure in @entity3 and safe havens in neighboring @entity58 to plot and plan attacks across the globe , making the situation potentially more vulnerable than it was before the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks
