-- two people were executed tuesday in @entity2 for their part in a tainted milk scandal that killed at least six babies and sickened about 300,000 others , state - run media reported
@entity10 was executed for endangering public safety and @entity12 was executed for producing and selling toxic food , the @entity9 news agency said
the tainted formula came to light in september 2008 , after several babies fell ill from drinking formula that contained melamine
melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates , wood adhesives , fabric coatings , ceiling tiles and flame retardants
some @entity2 dairy plants added the chemical to milk products so they would appear to have a higher protein level
the tainted milk caused kidney stones and urinary tract problems in hundreds of thousands of children
the 22 @entity2 dairy producers that made the formula have offered compensation to victims ' families
in all , 21 people were tried and sentenced in january for their roles in the scandal , @entity9 reported
among them , @entity10 and @entity12 were sentenced to death , and most others received at least 15 years in prison .
