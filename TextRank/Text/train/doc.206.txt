-- the @entity4 should use the " utmost caution " as it makes the @entity5 a key focus of its newly announced military strategy , @entity3 's state - run @entity2 news agency said in a commentary published friday
on thursday , president @entity10 and top defense officials unveiled a new @entity4 defense strategy that focuses heavily on the @entity5 , a fast - growing economic powerhouse with numerous potential flashpoints that the administration has identified as crucial to @entity4 interests
while resulting in a leaner force , the new strategy also calls for the @entity4 to increase its military 's " institutional weight and focus on enhanced presence , power projection , and deterrence in @entity5 , " defense secretary @entity17 said thursday
while welcoming a peaceful @entity4 role in the region , @entity2 's commentary friday warned the @entity4 against acting like a " bull in a china shop
" " the @entity4 role , if fulfilled with a positive attitude and free from a @entity34 - style zero - sum mentality , will not only be conducive to regional stability and prosperity , but be good for @entity3 , which needs a peaceful environment to continue its economic development , " the @entity2 editorial said
" however , while boosting its military presence in the @entity5 , the @entity4 should abstain from flexing its muscles , as this wo n't help solve regional disputes
" the new defense strategy , which still lacks many specifics , is meant to pare @entity4 defense spending by at least $ 487 billion over the next decade and drops a long - standing doctrine calling for the ability to fight to simultaneous ground wars
the result will be a more " agile , flexible , ready - to - deploy , innovative and technologically advanced " force prepared to counter terrorists , rogue states and the threat of nuclear weapons worldwide , @entity17 said thursday
gen. @entity55 , chairman of the @entity56 , said the focus on the @entity5 is crucial
" the strategy talks about a shift to the future , " he said thursday
" and all of the trends -- demographic trends , geopolitical trends , economic trends and military trends -- are shifting toward the @entity5
" with @entity4 wars in @entity68 and @entity69 winding down , the focus on the @entity5 has become a key theme of the administration 's foreign policy commentary in recent months
in november , @entity10 toured the region to highlight its economic and strategic importance to @entity4 interests and announced plans to eventually station a task force of up to 2,500 @entity78 in @entity79 " the @entity4 is a @entity5 power , and we are here to stay , " he said at the time , pledging that the coming defense cuts would not affect the country 's military posture in the region
he reiterated that pledge thursday
" as i made clear in @entity79 , we will be strengthening our presence in the @entity5 , and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region , , " he said .
