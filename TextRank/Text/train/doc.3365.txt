@entity1 a bleeding woman collapses on the ground
a police officer totes a weapon behind her
it 's an image that spread rapidly on social media -- and fueled furor among activists in @entity10 who claimed it cast light on a devastating reality , four years after protests shaped a revolution that toppled @entity10 's government
activists say the woman , @entity18 , was peacefully participating in a small protest commemorating the revolution in @entity1 's @entity21 on saturday when she was shot dead
police deny using anything but tear gas as they quelled protests
but @entity27 's colleagues at the @entity28 say police fired shots and killed her
" if there were any attempts to hold security officers accountable over the past four years , @entity18 would n't have been killed , " said @entity32 , a spokesman for the @entity33
@entity27 was one of at least 16 people killed in protests over the weekend at events marking the fourth anniversary of @entity10 's revolution , officials say
fifteen were killed sunday , including a police conscript , according to the @entity45
two of those killed were men trying to plant a bomb in @entity50 , ministry spokesman @entity46 said
it was not clear sunday night how many people had been arrested , because some were released on the spot or shortly afterward , the @entity51 said
eight journalists covering the sunday protests were among those detained , the @entity56 and @entity57 reported
meanwhile , the prosecutor general has launched an investigation into @entity27 's death and called policemen on duty that day in for questioning , along with six @entity28 members arrested at the saturday march
@entity69 , spokesman for the party , called @entity27 's death an assassination that " sends a message against political and partisan life
" four years ago on @entity76 , a national holiday celebrated january 25 , thousands of @entity10 marched to protest security violations
the protests quickly gained momentum as clashes with security forces left hundreds dead and culminated in the ouster of then - president @entity83
almost all the police officers implicated in the 2011 violence were acquitted
last november , a @entity1 court dismissed charges against @entity83 and acquitted his interior minister and top security aides on charges related to the protesters ' deaths
thousands have been killed and thousands more arrested since 2011 as local and international rights groups decried the impunity with which security forces operated
the toll dramatically increased in the summer of 2013 following the removal of ex-president @entity99 in the wake of another wave of mass protests
the crackdown on his supporters in august 2013 left at least 1,000 killed
many of the famous activists associated with the original january 25 demonstrations are now behind bars
rights groups have scaled down operations as the government announced the activation of an old law that would restrict activities and funding
those who marched with @entity27 on saturday chose to demonstrate the day before january 25 " so they do n't get confused or lumped with the @entity120 protests , " @entity32 said
@entity10 's government has said a surge in terrorist attacks have forced stricter measures , as hundreds of army and police personnel were killed in bombings and shootings
the @entity51 said in a statement to state media last december that it had arrested 10,000 rioters , saboteurs and terrorists in 2014 alone
the opposition has consistently condemned these attacks but says the regime is using terrorism as an excuse to impose more restrictions
on sunday , @entity10 military armored personnel carriers closed @entity21 to traffic
state celebrations planned to mark the day were canceled to mourn the passing of @entity147 's @entity146
secular political parties that now see demonstration as an ineffective and costly tool for change dissuaded youth members from protesting on the anniversary day
" today there 's a new phase of revolutionary work
the coup has to realize that the revolution has taken a new turn , " @entity120 spokesman @entity157 tweeted
" â€‹ sunday 's demonstrations and marches took place away from the iconic square
the @entity166 , which was launched to support @entity99 but has witnessed the departures of @entity169 parties and movements seeking different strategies , posted photos and videos of marches and clashes with the police in and outside @entity1
for @entity179 , a 47 - year - old member of the leftist @entity180 , this clampdown on political life is the battlefront
it was the killing of april 6 @entity184 's @entity183 during the demonstrations last january 25 that convinced @entity179 to reconsider his belief that revolutionaries should n't legitimize the regime by political participation
" i 'm not ready to see another kid shot
i had to think about changing the mechanism of the revolution
demonstrations and protests had to be changed to protect the youth of the revolution , so that no one else is shot dead
enough with blood , " he told @entity2
@entity179 and fellow party members have an enduring goal : maintaining a place on the political scene until emerging parties are strong enough to mount a serious challenge
electoral campaigning would provide a state - sanctioned framework to reach out to people , network and organize in a bid to achieve the goals that fueled the revolution , he explained
days before the anniversary , @entity179 was in @entity1 's @entity216 neighborhood telling potential voters about a revolution that hoped to make authorities accountable
" the revolution did n't give us anything , " a man told him
others voiced numerous concerns about security , health care , unemployment and housing
they had little hope that @entity179 or any elected official would bring about change
in a televised speech sunday , president @entity233 struck an optimistic chord
" the fourth anniversary represents to all of us a new flame of hope , development and action , " he said
" there is no doubt that there are shortcomings that exist and will take time until we all overcome them
with the will to work and the will to change , we will be able to overcome these shortcomings and achieve our hopes
" finance minister @entity254 told @entity2 late last year that the government is working on multiple fronts : battling inflation , increasing spending on education and health care , increasing the minimum wage and backing a new smart card system to deliver subsidies more efficiently
" so we are dealing with this while the most important thing is to rebuild confidence in the @entity10 economy to attract investors again and because we believe very much that having a job is your first line of protection against poverty and hardship , " he said
in addition to a megaproject developing the @entity277 , @entity10 is planning an international investment conference in march
in the densely populated , low - income @entity216 , @entity179 echoed the chant so popular during the revolution : " bread , freedom and social justice
" " when there is bread and freedom , social justice and human dignity will be achieved
for people , it begins with bread
" the debate on how to achieve these goals is still going on , with the voices that oppose contesting elections gaining momentum after @entity27 's death
" we ca n't imagine that elections supervised by the @entity51 , presided over by the minister killing our youth , can be fair elections , " @entity282 and @entity299 spokesman @entity298 said at a joint press conference on sunday
" political parties that claim to battle for democracy , social justice and a civilian system should take a unified stance , " @entity33 head @entity305 said at the press conference
a monday meeting will decide whether that means withdrawing from elections
despite the setbacks , @entity179 was hopeful
" the revolution did n't fail
the revolution is on the path typically taken by all revolutions in the world
revolutions do n't happen and succeed in three to four years
the revolution is accumulative , " he said , " and we wo n't see results before 10 or 15 years at least
