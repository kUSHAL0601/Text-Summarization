lawyers for suspected @entity2 bomber @entity1 have asked a federal court to strike comments he made at a hospital after suffering wounds during a manhunt that paralyzed the city in the days following the 2013 race
in a motion filed wednesday , they asserted that authorities repeatedly questioned @entity1 , 20 , as he begged for rest and requested a lawyer at least 10 times
defense attorneys said @entity1 was groggy and under the influence of several pain medications after undergoing emergency surgery when @entity21 agents began questioning him hours after his capture on april 19
@entity1 had suffered several gunshot wounds , including one to the head , according to the motion
his left eye was sutured shut , his jaw was wired closed and he was unable to hear out of his left ear
he was unable to speak after undergoing a tracheotomy , according to the motion
unable to respond verbally , @entity1 wrote answers to interrogators ' questions in a notebook , where his attorneys said he scribbled the word " lawyer " 10 times
the motion said other notes showed that he also wrote : " can we do this later ? " " i 'm exhausted , " and " you said you were gon na let me sleep
" defense lawyers claimed that any comments @entity1 made during these interrogations -- which went on intermittently for hours at the hospital -- should be inadmissible in court because they were not given voluntarily
government officials have indicated that @entity1 was questioned under what is called the " public safety " exception to the @entity51 warnings , which allows for limited questioning by law enforcement of a suspect to determine if there is imminent danger to the public of an attack
but defense lawyers said @entity1 told police after being captured that he had discarded his gun and where it could be found
@entity1 is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race , along with his brother @entity66 , who was killed during the manhunt
his trial is set for early november , with the government seeking the death penalty
defense lawyers are expected to argue the younger @entity1 was under the " domination and control " of his brother
in a separate motion on wednesday , the defense asked the court to declare the death penalty unconstitutional , calling the practice " cruel and unusual
" the defense listed several objections to the @entity82 , including " public and worldwide revulsion over the recurring spectacle of botched executions
" lawyers specifically pointed to the case of @entity88 , a convicted murderer who died in april of an apparent heart attack almost 45 minutes after his execution began at @entity91
authorities said one of his veins collapsed during the administration of a previously unused combination of lethal injection drugs
defense lawyers also argued the federal government 's authority to impose the death penalty should be limited because it is illegal in @entity104 , where @entity1 's trial is scheduled
in seeking the death penalty , prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor @entity1 's " betrayal of the @entity109
" they claim that after receiving asylum from the @entity109 , he " enjoyed the freedoms of a @entity109 citizen ; and then betrayed his allegiance to the @entity109 " by killing and maiming its people
defense attorneys also requested in a separate motion that prosecutors turn over instructions given to the grand jury that indicted @entity1
the lawyers hope to determine whether jurors knew that some findings would be used in the prosecution 's pursuit of the death penalty
they argued that this point is particularly significant because the jury was made up of @entity104 citizens
the state banned the death penalty in 1984
at the time the grand jury was considering its indictment , prosecutors had not publicly revealed their intention to seek the death penalty .
