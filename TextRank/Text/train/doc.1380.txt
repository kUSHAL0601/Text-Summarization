@entity0 -- anti-government protesters in @entity3 have stormed the offices of the country 's finance ministry , as mass demonstrations raise political tensions to the highest level since the deadly unrest of 2010
anti-government protest leader @entity11 , a former deputy prime minister under the previous @entity13 - led government , led the group of protesters who entered the ministry compound , in the protesters ' boldest act since demonstrations broke out three weeks ago
@entity22 , a senior researcher with @entity23 , told @entity1 the compound had been taken over by protesters , pockets of whom had become increasingly hostile to local and foreign media
he said a @entity27 photographer had earlier been attacked during a protest at the headquarters of the @entity30 monday morning , where thousands of demonstrators had called for an audience with police bosses
" we demand to meet with police commissioner - general @entity36 , " protest leader @entity34 told @entity1
more than three weeks of anti-government protests led by the opposition @entity38 rose to a crescendo sunday as about 100,000 demonstrators turned out in @entity0 , and escalated monday as leaders vowed to extend their rallies to government offices , tv networks and military installations
prime minister @entity46 responded by extending the areas around @entity0 where police are enforcing an internal security law that restricts gatherings by demonstrators
" what has been going on now is affecting people 's livelihoods and orderliness , as well as disrupting services at government offices , " she said monday
" therefore it is necessary for the government to enforce the law
" the government had imposed the security measures in central @entity0 several weeks ago
but the law has n't so far been strictly enforced
thaugsuban told demonstrators gathered sunday of plans to march on media outlets and government buildings monday , calling on civil servants to join the cause
" we will separate into 13 groups to march to 13 locations to express our stance , " he said
" our protest will not stop until @entity75 's regime is wiped out
" protest leaders are calling for an end to the government of @entity46 , sister of former premier @entity75 , the telecommunications tycoon who was ousted in a 2006 coup
critics of the @entity3 prime minister accuse her of being a puppet of her older brother @entity75 , a deeply polarizing figure who was removed from power by the military while in @entity89 in 2006
he has since lived in exile , except for a brief return in 2008 , and was convicted by @entity3 courts for corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in jail later that year
the current protests have reanimated the tensions along @entity3 's political faultlines -- @entity75 's mostly rural support base on one side , the @entity0 - based elite and middle classes on the other -- that left the country wracked with turbulence for four years after the 2006 coup , culminating in a 2010 army crackdown on @entity75 supporters that left more than 90 dead
an estimated 40,000 pro-government " red shirts " -- many from the rural areas -- gathered in a @entity0 stadium sunday in a show of support for the embattled prime minister , who came to power in a 2011 election
the current round of protests was triggered in response to a government - backed amnesty bill that could have extended a pardon to @entity75 and opened the door for his return to @entity3
the @entity3 senate rejected the amnesty bill on november 11 , but since then demonstrations have only grown , with @entity11 calling for the current government to be replaced by a new administration
@entity46 has responded to the escalating situation with a call for unity , reconciliation and respect for law
" the government has instructed police and all security officers to handle the situation gently , based on international practices , so the demonstration wo n't be used as a tool by people who want to make changes in a non-democratic way , " she said in a statement on her official @entity141 page
more than a dozen countries have issued travel warnings for citizens to avoid areas near protests in @entity0 .
