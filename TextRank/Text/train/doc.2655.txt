-- i know whose house i would avoid on @entity4 if i lived in @entity5
instead of handing out candy , a local woman called into a radio station , saying she plans to pass out letters to trick - or - treaters she feels are " moderately obese
" how do you say killjoy ? " i just want to send a message to the parents of kids that are really overweight , " said the woman , who identified herself only as @entity14 , during an interview with @entity16 in @entity5
" i think it 's just really irresponsible of parents to just sort of send them out looking for free candy just ' cause all of the other kids are doing it , " she said
since news of such a @entity4 plan went viral , people have called @entity0 affiliate @entity30 questioning whether the story is a hoax , according to the station
but " @entity36 , " @entity16 's morning co-host , told @entity0 it was definitely not a radio station stunt
" the woman @entity14 did call into our show , " he said
" we have been unable to get her back on the phone
" it remains unclear if the woman truly plans to hand out obesity letters or if this was all a prank
" @entity47 goes through with handing out letters or not seems to be a @entity4 mystery , " said @entity46 , brand manager for @entity16
" if any local children do get a letter , we 're encouraging them to stop by ( our ) studios and we 'll exchange it for a piece of candy
" the radio station said the woman e-mailed it the following message for parents : " your child is , in my opinion , moderately obese and should not be consuming sugar and treats to the extent of some children this @entity4 season
" my hope is that you will step up as a parent and ration candy this @entity4 and not allow your child to continue these unhealthy eating habits
" her goal , she said in the interview , is spurring action to battle a communitywide problem
" their kids are everybody 's kids
it 's a whole village , " she said
@entity83 contributor @entity81 said he was motivated to write a response of his own after hearing about what he calls the " fat - shaming letter
" " any kind of fat letter is just a shame
it does n't solve anything , it just shames people , " he said in his @entity83
prank or not , @entity81 said the whole concept could still affect people
" it can influence others to send in fat letters , too
when i was a child , i was overweight
i think the more that people pointed it out , it only put me through hell
" @entity81 said he plans to hand out his own positive letter along with @entity4 candy to trick - or - treaters , pointing out how " awesome " they are
" i do n't think ( my letter ) is going to affect kids or parents , but it is better than handing out fat letters
this is a holiday for kids to have fun ; this is n't a holiday for candy , " he said
plenty of people in my social community had some other choice words
" this is despicable , " said @entity121 , author of the book " @entity123 : advice and @entity126 , " on @entity127
" talk about giving a child a complex and deflating their self - esteem especially in front of their peers
" " holy cr * p ! this is just plain mean , " said @entity137 of @entity138 , a children 's book author and blogger , also on @entity127
" it 's just plain heartless
can we videotape someone giving her a ' you 're a heinous creature of a human being ' note ? " " this is terrible , particularly for the girls already overly concerned about body image , " said new mom @entity147 of @entity148 , @entity149
opinion : ' fat letters ' from schools to parents are wrong @entity157 , president and ceo of the @entity159 , agrees , saying such a concept , along with letters from schools to parents about a child 's body mass index , would be the wrong way to go
" so - called ' fat letters ' have no place in schools and certainly no place in our kids ' @entity4 buckets and bags , " @entity157 said
" bringing attention to a child 's weight and size in this way is yet one more thoughtless approach that targets and bullies children , putting them at risk for low self - esteem and ultimately developing an eating disorder
" she added , " @entity187 should be assessed by a medical doctor , certainly not a stranger who might be dressed as one
" everyone in my social networking circles was horrified by the @entity195 's possible approach , but some also recognized there 's a real problem
" i agree that the community as a whole should support and promote healthy lifestyles because it does take a village , but this is not the way to go about it , " said @entity198 on @entity127
said a reader who goes by the @entity205 handle @ nunoc3 , " wrong strategy for a real problem
" " maybe she should just give out healthy snacks to all , " @ patgee59 tweeted
" do n't be the fat monitor
" yes , she can join the small number of families ( less than 5 % according to a poll for a story i did a few years back ) who give out healthy snacks -- raisins , fruit , even toothbrushes and dental floss on @entity4
like the woman in @entity195 , i guess these families also have good intentions , but come on , folks , it 's @entity4
@entity228 , a stay - at - home dad in @entity229 , had another idea
" i want to hand out letters to people who hand out raisins or dental floss ... although with a kid there , i suppose the correct response would be , ' thank you
' still , killjoys , " said the blogger and author of the book , " @entity242
" i agree , which is why i sent my children to school with what my husband called an " unconscionable " amount of candy in small baggies to give out to their friends
now i just hope their moms do n't send me a letter
