-- a man detained in the disappearance of a @entity6 woman during a vacation in @entity2 will remain behind bars at least until the end of october , @entity2 prosecutors said monday
@entity10 was arrested by @entity2 police on august 5 , three days after his traveling companion @entity12 was last seen on a beach on the @entity14
attorney @entity15 went to court monday morning and asked for @entity10 's release
@entity15 argued that authorities do not have enough evidence to continue to hold the 50 - year - old @entity6 man , but the court did not agree
" @entity10 defense attorney 's request for release has been denied , " said @entity22 from the @entity2 prosecutor 's office
@entity10 's next detainment hearing is scheduled for the end of the month , @entity22 said
@entity10 has maintained that he had been snorkeling with @entity12 , when he signaled to her to swim back , according to a statement from the prosecutor 's office
when he reached the beach , @entity12 was nowhere to be found , he allegedly said
he was arrested three days after the incident at the airport in @entity2 as he waited for a flight back to the @entity36
he has been held for more than 70 days
authorities say @entity10 was the beneficiary of a $ 1.5 million accidental death insurance policy on @entity12 , taken out just days before their trip
on friday , @entity10 hired a new lead defense attorney , @entity41 , who spent two days in lengthy meetings with @entity10 at the prison in @entity2 where he is confined
@entity41 said @entity10 has never changed his account of what happened
instead , it is the police who come at @entity10 with different theories as to what might have happened , he said
even after all of their investigating , authorities " can not prove that a crime has been committed , " @entity41 said
@entity41 said @entity10 is simply trying to " hold it together , " and " feels boxed in , accused of something he did not do
" at one point in their conversation , @entity41 said , his client " broke down in tears " of frustration
@entity41 will be working with @entity10 's @entity36 - based attorney , @entity63
@entity41 , who has 17 years of experience as a criminal defense attorney on the island , represented two @entity2 security guards who were arrested early in the @entity69 case in 2005 and were subsequently released
the guards had been implicated by @entity71 , who said he saw a security guard approach @entity73 after he dropped her off at her hotel the night she vanished
@entity73 's disappearance remains unsolved
@entity71 was arrested but never charged in connection with the disappearance , although he has faced other legal problems since then
@entity41 bristled at any suggestion of similarity between the @entity12 case and the @entity73 case
" you had a suspect that kept changing his story , " @entity41 said of @entity71
" in this case , ( @entity10 's ) story has been the same
