the most deadly @entity2 terrorist attack ever in @entity3 followed weeks of warnings from @entity3 officials that the threat had risen to unprecedented levels
late last year @entity3 prime minister @entity8 said his country had never faced a greater terrorist threat
officials tell @entity0 the threat of terrorist attack in the @entity14 is greater than at any time since 9/11 because of the emergence of jihadist safe havens in @entity17 and @entity18
but no country faces a greater terrorist threat than @entity3 , with support for @entity22 running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the rundown , crime - ridden banlieues that surround many @entity3 cities
the numbers tell the story : 390 @entity3 extremists are now fighting with jihadist groups in @entity17 and @entity18 , according to @entity3 officials , with 231 believed to be on their way
fifty - one have been killed in suicide bombings and combat
and 234 have left the conflict zone , with 185 now back in @entity3
since the summer of 2013 , @entity3 police say they have thwarted five terror plots
nerves were rattled in the run up to @entity40 after a knife attack in a police station in @entity43 and car - ramming attacks in @entity46 and @entity47 on three consecutive days
the @entity43 attack was the only one of the three that was definitively linked to @entity2 terrorism
a few days after posting an @entity22 flag on his @entity54 page , @entity56 , a @entity3 - @entity58 extremist , entered a police station in the central @entity3 town of @entity43 on dec. 20 and stabbed several officers before being shot dead
@entity22 threats to @entity3 @entity22 has explicitly called for lone - wolf terrorist attacks in @entity3 because of its participation in airstrikes in @entity18 by the @entity67 - led coalition
" if you are not able to find an ied or a bullet , then single out the disbelieving @entity67 , @entity3 or any of their allies
smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him , " @entity22 spokesman @entity73 stated in an audiotape in september
on nov. 19 , three @entity3 @entity22 fighters appeared in a @entity3 language video put out by the group 's propaganda arm , repeating the call for attacks in @entity3
one of them stated : " terrorize them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror
there are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit
even poison is available , so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of @entity101
kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars
do whatever you are able to do in order to humiliate them , for they deserve only this
" a significant number of the nearly 400 @entity3 nationals now fighting in @entity17 and @entity18 are believed to have joined @entity22
that includes @entity117 , a 22 - year - old convert from @entity119 who @entity3 authorities suspect participated in the grisly on - camera beheading of more than a dozen members of the @entity17 armed forces in november orchestrated by the @entity126 " @entity125
" @entity3 officials have for some time been worried that those on their way back to @entity3 -- or already back in the country -- could launch attacks
in february , police in @entity132 broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in @entity3 by @entity135 , a @entity3 - @entity137 extremist who had allegedly just returned from fighting with @entity22 in @entity17
police say they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive tatp in his family 's @entity132 apartment building
@entity135 has denied the allegations against him
@entity22 - linked terror on the @entity147 @entity148 , a @entity3 - @entity137 @entity22 fighter who allegedly helped guard @entity150 hostages in @entity17 before returning to @entity151 , allegedly shot and killed four people at a @entity154 museum in @entity155 in may
@entity148 was arrested in @entity3 and extradited to face trial in @entity157
he has denied the charges
in both the @entity132 and @entity155 plots , investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam
no evidence has been publicly released suggesting @entity22 leadership signed off on the plots
it is not just isis causing concern to @entity3 security officials
@entity151 counterterrorism officials tell @entity0 a relatively high number of @entity3 extremists have joined @entity22 rival @entity173 , @entity174 's affiliate in @entity17
of most concern : @entity176 , a @entity3 convert from @entity177 who has emerged as one of the most skilled bomb makers in the @entity181 group , an @entity180 based in @entity17 's @entity183 province with ties to @entity173
@entity67 officials tell @entity0 they believe @entity186 has been working on nonmetallic explosive devices that the group hoped to smuggle on board western passenger aircraft and has been talent - spotting @entity151 extremists in @entity17 who can be trained for attacks in @entity151
@entity176 was injured in a @entity67 drone strike that hit a vehicle he was traveling in november
@entity181 bomb maker thought dead survived new laws , old grievances in november , @entity3 adopted tough new anti-terror legislation making it easier to shut down jihadist websites and confiscate passports and identity cards of those suspected of wanting to travel overseas to fight jihad
but critics say the @entity3 government has done too little to tackle one of the key contributing factors to radicalization : the deep sense of alienation toward mainstream society felt by a significant number of young @entity213 immigrants in the banlieues
in the years after 9/11 , @entity3 was held up as a model by many for its " assimilationist " agenda and its zero tolerance of extremist radical preachers
@entity126 , by contrast , was criticized for a " multicultural " approach that for too long offered political refuge to extremists from around the world
but by the late 2000s , @entity2 extremism had also become a significant problem in @entity3
although @entity3 leaders paid lip service to assimilation , the concept was only theoretical for young unemployed @entity213 living in impoverished banlieues whose socioeconomic grievances were more acute than their counterparts in the @entity126
while @entity3 could crack down on radical preachers in the 1990s , it was powerless to prevent the growth of jihadist websites and social media in the second half of the 2000s
@entity243 in @entity17 has become a " cause celebre " for @entity3 extremists able to access this content online
while many @entity126 extremists traveled to @entity174 's safe havens in @entity249 and @entity250 in the years before and after 9/11 because of their language and kinship ties to the region , much of @entity3 's banlieue population hails from @entity255 , making travel to jihadist battlegrounds in the @entity259 world easier and more attractive .
