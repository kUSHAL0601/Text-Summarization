@entity0 , @entity1 -- we all know that vaccines save lives by protecting people against disease
what is less well - known is that vaccines also are an engine for economic growth -- far beyond their health benefits
i am reminded of this in @entity1 this week , where my organization , the @entity14 , is hosting a conference for its partners
@entity14 's mission is to save children 's lives and protect people 's health by increasing access to immunization in developing countries
we do n't do this alone
we have many partners , including prominent companies that work closely with @entity14
they recognize that in addition to the humanitarian need , countries such as @entity1 are emerging markets that can fulfill their economic ambitions only if they also can ensure good health for their citizens
the private sector is a critical part of the equation
our corporate partners know they can do well by doing good
it has an ambitious five - year development plan that aims to transform the country into a middle - income economy by 2025
the plan includes critical funding to ensure a healthy population by strengthening the health system , which will significantly improve child and maternal mortality rates
@entity1 already has begun this process by working closely with @entity14 and its partners to significantly increase its routine vaccine coverage rates to above 90 % today from 79 % in 2001 , the year before @entity14 began its work there , according to data from the @entity55 and @entity56
at the same time , @entity1 's gdp growth has been astounding , rising to $ 23.7 billion last year from $ 10.2 billion in 2001 , according to the @entity58

but we know for a fact that vaccines -- in addition to saving lives and improving health -- are the cornerstone of a vibrant economy , fuel growth and serve as a magnet for foreign investment
indeed , research has shown vaccines to be among the most cost - effective investments in global development
this has been borne out of several independent studies that look beyond the health impacts toward areas such as cognitive development , educational attainment , labor productivity and financial attainment
in other words , healthier children -- spurred by immunization -- attend school more often , learn more while they are there and remain in school longer
as adults , they therefore are more productive , earn more money , save and invest more , and live longer
healthier children also spread less disease through the adult population , further increasing productivity

for instance , i attended a landmark meeting in @entity115 in july organized by the @entity116 , where its president @entity117 brought together a variety of ministers and experts to discuss how to allocate budgets and make healthcare a national priority
i was in @entity115 because of the wide recognition that immunization can be the high - octane fuel that leads to increased trade , capital infrastructure projects and technological improvement
this brings me back to the private sector and the benefits many companies now see in playing a role in supporting global health , including immunization services
one benefit , of course , is humanitarian
the @entity14 -- with help from partners such as @entity56 , @entity55 , the @entity141 , the @entity58 and donors -- has helped countries immunize 370 million people , saving more than 5.5 million lives since 2000
@entity14 now is in the midst of helping immunize another quarter billion people , which could save an additional 4 million lives by 2015
the private sector is involved , providing core business skills to tackle key obstacles to immunization in the developing world
for example , @entity14 is working with a leading telecommunications company to explore the use of its mobile technology with hopes of improving vaccine stock management in implementing countries and alerting parents when children are due for vaccines
@entity14 is constantly looking for partners to lend their business savvy to help us accomplish our mission
an increasing number of them are responding , compassionate in their outlook while aware of the underlying economic value of vaccines
they understand that this is the highest return on investment they could ever make
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .
