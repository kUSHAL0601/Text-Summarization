@entity0 -- the courtroom claim that @entity3 , a protege of global media baron @entity5 's , and @entity7 , a former spin doctor for @entity9 prime minister @entity8 , had a six - year affair has set @entity9 media abuzz
the two are accused of charges including conspiring to hack voicemails and conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office
@entity18 also faces a charge of perverting the course of justice
their trial at the @entity25 in @entity0 has gripped the @entity9 press -- and the prosecution 's claim thursday that the two had a clandestine affair made the front pages of half a dozen national newspapers friday
several quoted at length from a letter allegedly written by @entity18 as @entity7 tried to end their relationship and read out by prosecution lawyer @entity37 to the court
reportedly found on a computer seized from @entity18 ' home , it said , " the fact is that you are my very best friend
i tell you everything , i confide in you , i seek your advice , i love you , care about you , worry about you
... in fact without our relationship in my life , i am really not sure how i will cope
" the @entity51 called it a " hacking bombshell , " saying the court was " told of gushing love letter from @entity55 editor
" the @entity58 headlined its story " the affair they did n't expose , " a reference to the tabloid newspapers ' history of revealing other people 's cheating
it 's not clear whether @entity7 ever saw the letter , the media reports said
the @entity70 cited @entity37 as saying the jury needed to know about the secret relationship because the two are accused of conspiring together
it revealed how close they were and the level of trust they had , he said
the affair ran from 1998 to 2004 , the newspapers cited the prosecution as saying , during some of which time both @entity18 and @entity7 were married to other people
@entity18 and @entity7 , both former editors of the now - defunct @entity86 , were both formerly close to @entity8
@entity7 , who edited the @entity86 from 2003 to 2007 , went on to become @entity8 's director of communications before resigning early in 2011
@entity18 , who also edited @entity88 , was a friend of the prime minister and his wife
@entity18 , formerly chief executive of @entity86 's parent company , @entity91 , resigned from that role in the wake of public anger over claims of hacking by the newspaper 's employees
three former journalists who worked at the @entity86 have pleaded guilty to phone hacking , @entity9 media reported wednesday , citing the prosecution in the case
the three who pleaded guilty are @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 .
