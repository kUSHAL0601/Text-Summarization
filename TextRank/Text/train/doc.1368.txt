-- at first glance , it does n't seem that remarkable : an old black - and - white scene of a strangely deserted city , smudged in places by some primitive photographic process
but this image , taken in @entity8 , @entity9 , in 1838 , is believed to be the earliest known photograph featuring a person
look in the photo 's lower left corner and you 'll see a man getting his boots cleaned on the sidewalk
the boot - cleaner is there too , although he is harder to spot
the image has been posted online before , but it gained a higher profile after news site @entity24 published a full - page version on wednesday in partnership with @entity27 , a website that archives photos from the past
it was taken by @entity32 , the @entity9 photographer famous for pioneering the daguerreotype , an early type of photo produced on a silver plate or a silver - covered copper plate
according to @entity40 's @entity39 , the exposure time for the image was around seven minutes
the street appears deserted because while the two human figures were relatively still , other pedestrians and horse - drawn carriages were moving too fast to register on the plate
the photo shows the @entity48 , a then - fashionable area of shops , @entity51 © s and theaters
the two people on the sidewalk are the most recognizable human figures in the photo , although @entity39 points out that a detailed examination reveals other possible people on a bench and in a window of the building in the foreground
the image is not close to being the earliest known surviving photograph , though
that distinction belongs to a photo by @entity66 © phore @entity67 , one of @entity32 's partners , who used a crude camera to capture the view from a window at his @entity9 estate in 1826 or 1827
today , when almost everyone has a phone camera in their pocket and more than 350 million photos are uploaded to @entity80 every day , @entity32 's milestone seems quaint
in 2014 , he might have just snapped a selfie .
