@entity0 is thinking about running for the presidency a second time
he 's super serious about it
you can tell because not only has he quit his tv show to spend time thinking about it , and written a book ( " @entity12 , " due out on january 20 ) , but he 's also booked a tour of @entity11
next to @entity14 , @entity13 might be the best place to run a hotel at election time
we should be serious about @entity0 too
as @entity21 points out in the @entity22 , when he ran in the 2008 @entity20 primaries , he not only took @entity23 but swept much of the @entity24 as well -- scooping more than 20 % of all the votes cast nationwide
@entity21 attributes this to @entity0 's unusual appeal within the evangelical community , which is linked to @entity0 's previous role as a preacher
for sure , there was a regional pattern to the vote
but he also had a tremendous potential that went unrealized in ' 08
@entity0 quit early due to a shortage of cash , so we never got to see how well he could run in a great number of states
moreover , his early performances were hindered by the candidacy of @entity44 -- a dour , sour old stick who only seemed to be in the race to hurt @entity0
it 's fair to say that @entity44 denied @entity0 a win in @entity50 and thus the momentum he needed to go the distance
the strange bitterness of the @entity55 fight is a reminder that the @entity20 is far more philosophically diverse than the @entity58 alternative
@entity0 is loathed by conservatives of a more libertarian , anti-state hue
they suspect that he is a big - government conservative
by that they mean a ruthless populist who will spend money to buy votes while keeping die - hard conservatives on board with appeals to religious prejudice
a more generous interpretation is that @entity0 was a @entity20 elected to office in a traditionally @entity58 state ( @entity75 ) which also had a serious poverty problem
he eschewed low - tax , anti-government rhetoric in favor of spending money in the interests of the common good -- a cautious , rational position that is widely regarded as philosophically conservative everywhere but at the wealthy think tanks of @entity85
the libertarian @entity86 provides a list of @entity0 quotes intended to damn him , including one in which he describes their anti-tax agenda as " a heartless , callous , soulless type of economic conservatism because it says ' look , we want to cut taxes and eliminate government
if it means that elderly people do n't get their @entity100 drugs , so be it
if it means little kids go without education and healthcare , so be it
' well , that might be a quote pure economic conservative message , but it 's not an @entity111 message
... that 's not historic @entity113
@entity114 does not hate government ; it 's just there to be as little of it as there can be
" @entity0 's analysis is historically accurate and canny
americans may have a cultural distrust of large government in general , but polls and election returns suggest they still favor those parts of state activity that benefit them personally
and why not ? if the state were to shrivel up to nothing , the result would not be conservative as much as anarchic
those who wish to preserve family , tradition and the @entity111 way have little to gain from unleashing the full forces of amoral , unrestrained capitalism
free markets do not respect @entity137
for instance , did deregulation of the banking sector really result in rugged individualism and families flourishing free from the state ? or did it wreck the economy , tearing apart communities and triggering even greater political demand for government intervention ? chaos often excuses authoritarianism
the libertarian might say that this argument is liberal in @entity20 clothing -- but , again , it 's a matter of what kind of society people are trying to preserve
@entity0 would likely not use the state for progressive causes as the @entity58 would , but for conservative ones
and what makes him such a compelling candidate is his unique ability to articulate that right - wing vision
it was his debate performances that pushed him to the front of the 2008 pack , when he gave a defense of marriage , life and biblical teachings that suggested he was a @entity170 without being angry about it
most republicans who talk about social conservatism come off as either fanatical or disingenuous
such an ability to sell conservative ideas with a glimmer of humanity has n't been seen since @entity177
will it work again in 2016 ? maybe
@entity0 faces the problem that the social - conservative field is crowded , already containing both @entity181 and @entity182
media attention and intellectual excitement might be focused on @entity185 and @entity186
and if @entity188 runs , then frankly , the field will have another blue - collar , ordinary - person candidate of above - average size ( a matter that @entity0 has tried to cash in on with a book )
but none of these men has @entity0 's unique ability to speak through the television cameras and straight to the viewer at home
and , aside from @entity181 , none of them has run for the nomination before
@entity20 are typically cautious voters who encourage a candidate to run twice , or even thrice , before nominating them : @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity177 were all veterans of the presidential primaries
as such , @entity0 enters this race with a key asset : he 's a conservative statesman
his history alone ought to guarantee him top - tier status .
