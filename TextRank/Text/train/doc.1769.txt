@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity1 commuters crammed onto buses , scrambled for taxis , cycled or simply walked on wednesday as a strike by @entity8 workers shut down most of the subway network
commuters queue for packed buses in @entity1 on wednesday morning
the strike began tuesday at 7 p.m. ( 2 p.m. et ) but the first full effects were felt during wednesday 's morning commute
the strike was set to last for 48 hours with a normal service resuming friday morning , according to @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , which runs the city 's transportation network
the @entity18 trade union called the strike after talks with management over pay , job cuts , and disciplinary issues broke down
" @entity18 does n't resort to industrial action lightly , " general secretary @entity24 said in a statement
" the fact is that @entity8 workers have been driven into walking out today
" transport commissioner @entity28 said the talks had been making progress on all issues and he urged the @entity18 to return to the table
" the @entity18 leadership says we were close to a deal , " @entity28 said in a statement
" if that is the case , then they should call off the strike , return to talks ... and resolve this issue without any more disruption to @entity43
" @entity14 was running extra buses and free shuttle services across the @entity46 during the strike
electronic travel cards used for the @entity14 network were temporarily being allowed on all train lines in greater @entity1 , it said
while most services on the @entity8 were shut because of the strike , one line -- the @entity50 -- was running normally and five others were running on a reduced schedule , @entity14 said
" it 's been really good , " a girl on @entity55 told @entity2 about her commute
" the northern line is running perfectly
" still , some bus services were packed with commuters who normally ride the underground trains or who failed to find a taxi
" i think we 'd all like to strike for more money , but unfortunately we ca n't , " said one woman at @entity65 , where the @entity8 is closed
others hit the pavement and walked
" it 's ok -- quite refreshing , " said a man on @entity71
he said he had just walked from @entity73 , a train station as well as a tube stop that is more than 2.5 miles away
the @entity18 represents about half of the 20,000 employees on the @entity8 , a @entity14 spokeswoman said
other unions including @entity80 and @entity81 represent the rest , she said , and were not on strike .
