@entity0 -- president @entity2 is asking for more than $ 230 million in the 2011 budget to buy and prepare an idle @entity5 prison to house terrorism suspects now detained at @entity7 , @entity8
the @entity10 budget for 2011 unveiled monday calls for about $ 172 million for the federal government to acquire and renovate the state - owned prison in @entity13 , @entity5 , and another $ 66 million to eventually staff and equip it
the budget requires congressional approval , and several lawmakers in both the @entity19 and @entity20 have vowed to block the funds , potentially preventing the transfer of many of the 192 remaining @entity7 detainees to @entity26 soil
" even though @entity26 are facing tremendous economic challenges , the administration has chosen to spend $ 237 million dollars in taxpayer money to provide free travel , room and board in @entity13 , @entity5 for some of the most dangerous @entity7 detainees , " said a statement monday by rep. @entity28 of @entity29 , the ranking @entity30 on the @entity31
" it is time for the president to focus on the security and economic needs of the @entity26 people , rather than on the needs of those dangerous extremists who seek to do us harm
" even if the funds are approved by the start of the 2011 budget year in october 2010 , @entity10 officials said monday the transfer of any detainees was unlikely to start until several months later
in addition to the cost of the @entity5 prison , the @entity10 budget seeks another $ 73 million dollars for the transfer , prosecution and incarceration of five @entity7 detainees currently slated to stand trial in criminal court for their alleged roles in the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks
@entity10 officials told reporters that includes about $ 23 million for security , $ 15 million for transportation , $ 15 million for litigation , $ 7 million for detainee housing and another $ 12 million for related expenses
@entity72 , the acting deputy attorney general , said the @entity10 is committed to a civilian trial for @entity74 and four others charged in the september 11 , 2001 , terrorism case
@entity72 said no decision has been made on whether the trial would be moved from @entity79
@entity19 press secretary @entity80 also said monday that the government was still examining whether to hold the trial in @entity79 or somewhere else
federal officials informed @entity79 authorities that the cost of a long - running trial in @entity79 could approach $ 1 billion
@entity79 officials including mayor @entity88 are increasingly opposed to conducting the trial in @entity90 due to the high cost and disruptions it would cause
@entity94 , chairwoman of a city community advisory agency , proposed four alternative locations for the trial within the @entity98 of @entity90 : @entity99 , @entity100 in @entity101 , the @entity102 at @entity102 , and the @entity104 jail complex at @entity105
the latter three are all in @entity108 , @entity79 , a county less than an hour away from @entity79 , county executive @entity106 told @entity1
@entity109 opposes holding the trial in @entity108 , and warned he would mount a legal challenge to try to stop it
a @entity102 spokesman said last week that no one has officially requested a review of demands for such a trial , which would require in - depth study of legal and security concerns .
