@entity0 , @entity1 -- wednesday broke in @entity1 with news of a new blaze at the damaged nuclear plant that crews have struggled to control since last week 's devastating earthquake and tsunami , adding to radiation fears in a country racing to avoid a full - on nuclear crisis
the fire was discovered wednesday morning in the northwestern corner of the no. 4 reactor building at the @entity16 plant , an official with @entity18 told reporters
it was the latest setback for a country struggling to dig its way out of the wreckage wrought by last week 's earthquake and tsunami
at least 3,676 people have died , the @entity26 said wednesday morning
another 7,558 people are missing and 1,990 were injured , it said
@entity31 - shocked survivors huddled in cramped shelters , grieved over lost loved ones and worried about relatives who are missing across villages and towns inundated by the tsunami waves spawned by friday 's 9.0 - magnitude quake off the east coast of @entity40
@entity1 prime minister @entity41 has called the disaster the country 's worst crisis since @entity45 , and one firm says that the earthquake and tsunami are likely to surpass @entity49 as the most expensive disaster in history
stocks in @entity1 opened higher wednesday morning , one day after the nation 's main market index suffered one of its biggest drops on record
tuesday , the @entity59 economic powerhouse reeled as stocks plummeted , sending shock waves through global markets
" the scale of this event has taken everyone by surprise , " said @entity63 , a @entity64 spokesman
" it 's stretched resources to the max. " the latest fire at the @entity16 nuclear plant in northeastern @entity1 comes one day after another fire there and an explosion at the plant 's no. 2 reactor
radiation level readings spiked at the building gate during the first fire but went down after the blaze was extinguished
chief cabinet secretary @entity83 said amounts returned to a level that would not cause " harm to human health
" radiation levels in @entity89 were twice the usual level tuesday , but they were too negligible to pose a health threat , officials said
but @entity1 authorities could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at the troubled reactors
while sea water was being pumped into the reactors in an effort to prevent further damage , " it can not necessarily be called a stable situation , " @entity83 had said tuesday
a meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods can not be cooled , thus melting the reactor core and causing a release of radioactivity
in the worst - case scenario , the fuel can spill out of the containment unit and spread toxic radioactivity through the air and water
that , public health officials say , can cause both immediate and long - term health problems , including radiation poisoning and cancer
the plant 's owners have taken precautions to protect the people in @entity121 , where the reactors sit
the plant is about 138 miles ( 225 kilometers ) from @entity89
they evacuated all but about 50 workers from the facility and urged people within 18.6 miles ( 30 kilometers ) of the plant to remain indoors
the government imposed a no - fly zone over the 30 - kilometer radius " because of detected radiation after explosions " there , the country 's transportation ministry said
@entity83 said analysts also have their eyes on reactors no. 5 and 6 at the plant , where cooling systems were n't functioning well , though the temperature had dropped slightly tuesday
concerns about hot radioactive fuel boiling off cooling water and catching on fire continued into wednesday , with plant operators and government officials considering a plan to use helicopters to drop water into the cooling pond through the damaged roof of the reactor building , according to a @entity156 report
for many across @entity1 , calming jittery nerves is becoming increasingly difficult as the situation at the damaged facility looks increasingly dire
" i think , from a sanity standpoint , i 'm trying to side with the cool - headed point of view because i do n't want to think about the possibly of a full - blown meltdown , " said @entity162 resident @entity161
" so far , the winds are blowing north - northeast , so if a lot of radiation leaks , @entity89 should n't get a lot of the exposure , " said @entity167 , who lives in suburban @entity89
" of course , if the winds change , that 's a different story
we 've been advised to wear long sleeves , a cap , a surgical mask to reduce the amount of exposure -- that is , cover as much skin as possible
" across the country , emergency workers from @entity1 , foreign governments and international aid groups continued to scour tangled and displaced piles of debris , searching for survivors
ninety - one countries and regions and six international organizations have offered assistance , according to the @entity1 foreign affairs ministry
public broadcaster @entity194 reported that 450,000 people were living in shelters , and many schools had turned into emergency shelters
in the area of @entity0 , the capital of @entity201 , several tractor - trailers with cars on top had flipped over
personal belongings -- a child 's doll , an empty shoe , wedding photos covered in mud -- lay in heaps where houses once stood
cold weather has increased the hardship for disaster victims and rescuers
rescuers report that some victims have been exposed to cold weather and water , in some cases for days
conditions are expected to worsen , with temperatures forecast to drop below freezing by wednesday across portions of the earthquake zone , accompanied by snow , heavy rain and the threat of mudslides
already in @entity0 , cold rain and sleet fell on the decimated city tuesday , and snow fell in parts of northeastern @entity1
rescue work is also being complicated by the hundreds of aftershocks that have rocked @entity1 since friday 's quake
the @entity238 reported tuesday at least three quakes with magnitudes of 6.0 or greater , and more than a dozen others greater than 5.0 or greater
experts predict that the earthquake and tsunami will rank among the costliest natural disasters on record
@entity247 , senior vice president of research and modeling for @entity250 , said it is clear that the total losses will " be far greater than we experienced in @entity49
" that 2005 hurricane , which devastated @entity255 and the @entity257 @entity256 , had estimated losses of $ 125 billion , according to the @entity259
while agencies are working to raise money , donations have been slow to come
the @entity263 , a newspaper covering nonprofit organizations , says donations to nonprofit organizations have reached about $ 25 million so far
the total is far below the first four - day totals of other recent natural disasters , including @entity49 and the crisis in @entity271 , it said
wide - scale economic problems also loom
@entity1 stocks closed down 10.55 % tuesday , the third steepest percentage fall in the @entity276 's history
that was on top of a 6.2 % drop monday , the first full trading day after the quake
wednesday , the nikkei 225 index , the most prominent measure of @entity89 market stocks , rose 520 points , or 6 % , shortly after the market opened
all three of the major @entity257 stock indexes closed down about 1.2 % tuesday , after plunging much deeper earlier in the day on fears of the @entity1 economic downturn
friday 's quake was the strongest in recorded history to hit @entity1 , according to @entity238 records that date to 1900
the @entity238 revised the magnitude of the quake from 8.9 to 9.0 on monday
@entity2 's @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .
