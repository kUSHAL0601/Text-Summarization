-- despite the daily foot traffic , @entity1 is one of the most under - appreciated parts of @entity5
it 's not just a playground for suits bound for @entity10 bank jobs or tourists following the old @entity13 crooked plan through skyscraper canyons heading to the @entity15 -- or , increasingly over the coming months , crowding to get a glimpse of the new @entity17
as someone who has spent most of the last two decades in @entity5 , i ca n't begin to count the number of times visiting friends and friends of friends have asked me for " fun things to do in @entity5
" the hidden sides of @entity1 fit the bill
if you 're heading to visit the @entity17 and are looking for other things to do in the area , try these tips : @entity0 : 40 free attractions in @entity5 1
@entity34 's gravestones @entity5 's most historic church , dating from 1698 , faces @entity10 from @entity36
visitors often pop in to see the stained glass and perhaps peek into the free museum ( which includes a cut - out $ 10 bill so you can pose as @entity42 )
the @entity44 focus is there because the country 's first @entity47 secretary of treasury -- who was shot in a duel by the former vice president @entity50 in 1804 ( no , @entity51 was n't the first vp to shoot someone ) -- is buried outside
but that 's not the best part of the cemetery
on the bigger plot , on the north side of the church , there are shady spots to sit , and at the far northeastern corner lies @entity62 , who left a coded message atop his tombstone
according to @entity67 's superb book " @entity68 , " the code was finally cracked nearly a century after his death in 1794
the message : " remember death
@entity71 @entity1 got its name from the @entity74 word for either " place of hills " or " place of inebriation " ( the latter is certainly more apt in the past few hundred years ) , and @entity36 itself follows old hunting trails that date centuries before @entity82 wandered this way
a great place to learn more about all of the @entity87 ' pre-columbian inhabitants is this free , relatively quiet museum
part of the @entity92 ( and open every day ) , the exhibit of artifacts fills the gorgeous century - old @entity93
many equate @entity94 with images seen in old westerns -- usually wearing the attire of the @entity98 , evident in a shirt that may have been worn by @entity102 legend @entity100
the " @entity104 " exhibit gives a fuller picture
i also enjoyed thumbing through @entity108 newspapers from around the country and seeing works like a painting by @entity112 , a @entity113 " prisoner - of - war " at @entity115 , @entity116 a century ago
@entity118 dining i 'm always shocked by how many people eat lunch at unmemorable places on @entity36 or chains at @entity123
locals instead bee - line for the city 's first paved street , @entity118 , a small traffic - free winding lane filled with covered tables a few blocks east of @entity36 ( and south of @entity10 ) , lined with good food and bars
it gets busy on weekday lunches ( noon to 1:30 p.m. ) and as work winds down ( after 4 p.m. )
go then , and share an outside table
i like @entity139 ( 54 @entity140 ) the best , but it comes in one big size -- do n't go solo
@entity0 : how to cycle @entity5 like a pro 4
@entity144 ok , most people wo n't want to walk down @entity146 , an l - shaped alley near the corner of @entity148 and @entity149 , en route from the @entity151 to @entity123
in 2001 , @entity153 spent many nights here for four seasons , watching a terrifying scene of " relay teams " of eight to 10 rats storming into garbage bags that roared like " a bar brawl in a pup tent
" @entity153 's book , " rats , " is creepily fascinating , giving more info than you may want to know about @entity5 's most famous " wildlife
" you wo n't see rats during the day
( by the way , @entity149 is a common path for visitors to take -- and its scene of chains and discount shops is very simply the least interesting walking street in all of @entity1
@entity174 one of @entity5 's newest museums -- the fascinating @entity174 site built in a new @entity177 in 2010 -- sees , on a good day , about 250 people
you may be alone , and you might not see @entity5 the same way afterward
during most of the 18th century , as many as 15,000 @entity181 -- mostly slaves -- were buried in this 6.6 - acre corner of the city , and the small museum makes a big impact with the corner of the @entity187 it occupies
watch the 20 - minute film ( " this is @entity194 ' @entity193 , " one person says in it ) and walk past some of the over 400 graves found while building this controversial building in the ' 90s
this is the population who really built the city , including a giant wooden barrier wall to protect @entity13 from the @entity204 attack -- the namesake for @entity10
around the corner , just east along @entity207 , there 's a small plot saved from the building plans with a monument to those buried here -- along with visible mounds of crypts underground
