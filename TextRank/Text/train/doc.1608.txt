@entity0 , @entity1 -- speculation was intense friday over where and when prince @entity4 will marry @entity6 , with many predicting the couple will choose the iconic , thousand - year - old @entity8
@entity6 was photographed leaving the abbey wednesday night with her parents , and @entity12 newspapers reported they had a private after - hours tour
@entity8 is the " venue of choice " for the wedding , the @entity15 tabloid reported friday , and it even published a seating plan for the big day
@entity21 betting agents seemed certain friday that @entity8 would be chosen , giving it 1/33 odds
a @entity2 / @entity25 poll out friday found the @entity12 public largely positive about the engagement , which was announced tuesday , a few weeks after @entity4 proposed
nearly eight in 10 of those surveyed -- 79 percent -- said they believe the engagement will be good for the monarchy
opinion was split , however , on who should succeed @entity34 -- whether @entity35 , who is next in line , or @entity4 -- though more respondents said @entity4 and @entity6 would make a better king and queen than @entity35 and his wife , @entity40 , @entity40
in general , older people and those in higher income groups were more likely to take a traditional line and be more favorable toward @entity35 and @entity40 , compared to those who are younger or in poorer income groups , according to the poll , which surveyed 2,015 adults in @entity12 between wednesday and friday
@entity8 was founded in 960 , with the present @entity50 church dating to 1245
since 1066 , it has been the " coronation church " -- the place where kings and queens are crowned when they ascend to the throne
its close ties to the monarchy mean it has also been the site of many royal weddings and funerals
@entity34 married prince @entity61 there in 1947 , when she was still a princess ; her father , @entity63 , got married there in 1923
the funeral service for @entity66 , @entity4 's mother , took place there in 1997
another possible venue is @entity70 , where @entity66 married prince @entity35 in 1981 in a wedding watched by millions worldwide
@entity21 gave that option 10/1 odds , and 16/1 odds for @entity75 at @entity76
others have also suggested as possible venues the @entity0 church of @entity80 , the central church of the @entity82 , in which prince @entity4 serves -- or the @entity83 at the @entity84 , where the prince and @entity6 met as students
the palace has said the wedding will take place in the spring or summer of 2011
the most likely month for the nuptials , according to @entity21 , was may , followed in order by july , june , then august
@entity12 prime minister @entity95 wants a national holiday for the day of the wedding , his office at @entity94 said friday , though the government must approve that first .
