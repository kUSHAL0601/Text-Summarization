more than 6 - in - 10 @entity0 believe that @entity2 ' decision to cancel the release of " @entity4 " was an overreaction , according to a @entity8 / @entity7 poll released on tuesday
but the @entity0 public does think that the incidents which led to that decision were acts of terrorism on the part of @entity15 and nearly three - quarters of all @entity0 say that @entity15 is a serious threat to the @entity0 that puts @entity15 at the very top of the public 's threat list -- only @entity22 comes close
and @entity23 is the most unpopular world leader tested in the poll
eighty - four percent of all @entity0 have an unfavorable view of @entity23 ; only 1 % say they have a positive view of him
that ranks @entity23 higher ( or lower , depending on your point of view ) than @entity31 , @entity32 , and the leaders of @entity22 , @entity34 and @entity35
three - quarters of the public call for increased economic sanctions against @entity15
roughly as many say that country is a very serious or moderately serious threat to the @entity0 related : read the entire @entity8 / @entity7 poll nonetheless , only 36 % of those polled say that pulling the film from theaters was the right decision ; 62 % believe that @entity2 overreacted
men are less likely to endorse that decision , but women approached that issue more cautiously and were closely divided
the @entity8 / @entity7 poll is based on interviews with 1,011 @entity0 adults and was conducted december 18 - 21 , 2014
