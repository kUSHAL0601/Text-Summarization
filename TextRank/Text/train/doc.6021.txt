-- since there have been cars , people have chosen their rides based on what their cars say about them
@entity0 put a list of cars before automotive industry experts to capture their take on several popular cars
drivers of the dependable @entity13 know what 's important in life , says expert
our panel consisted of @entity19 , senior manager at @entity20 ; @entity21 , editor and publisher of @entity23 and @entity24 , veteran automotive consultant from @entity25
rest assured , these experts did not pull any punches
@entity28 : @entity29 no matter its color @entity19 looked through the company 's vast data on the @entity28
" buying a prius shows the world that you love the environment and hate using fuel , " said @entity19
" compared to the overall industry , @entity28 buyers are more often women , have fewer kids and more often have college educations
" @entity21 adds , " @entity43 buyers want to be part of the ' green ' club
" " prius drivers like the video - game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements , " said @entity19
@entity24 opines : " there 's a good chance that if you come upon a line of slow moving traffic , a @entity28 driver will be at the front of the line , self - righteously driving under the speed limit on his or her way to save the world
" we 're just quoting here , folks
@entity65 : performer for the mid-life crisis the @entity65 " seems to be more often a reward car
its buyers are older than the industry average , with 88 percent born before 1946 , according to @entity20 data
only 11 percent of @entity65 owners are in @entity73 or @entity74 " @entity21 adds : " sadly , the usual stereotype of the @entity65 buyer as a 57 - year old male deep in a mid-life crisis is proven
" better car than its image suggests @entity21 sees another side to the @entity65
" it is the absolute greatest performance bargain on the planet , " said @entity21
" it 's an affordable giant - killer
" @entity24 adds , " there have been 1.5 million corvettes produced since 1953 , and while plenty of old guys drive them , they are an engineering marvel that will run 180 mph or return 30 + mpg highway fuel economy
" @entity13 : a major transportation appliance " i think the @entity13 gets a bad rap for being the ' microwave oven ' of the car industry , " said @entity21
" it 's boring , reliable , efficient , and common
but to many drivers , these words are exactly all they are looking for , making the @entity13 their own personal rock star
a @entity13 in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life , and it 's not your car
" @entity108 : the transcendent pony car the @entity108 looks more like its original than the 2010 @entity111 or @entity112
according to @entity19 , the @entity108 appeals to @entity114 who like styling and power
but almost 30 percent of @entity108 buyers are @entity74 or gen @entity119 , this beats out the @entity28 , a more forward - looking vehicle ; only 18 - percent of its buyers are @entity74 or @entity73 @entity20 's data shows that the @entity108 is winning buyers too young to remember the original 1970 - 74 challenger
" all ages stop and stare at this car , " said @entity21
" especially when it 's in @entity130 , from old - skool @entity131 to the @entity134 crowd
" this wide appeal makes pegging the @entity108 owner more challenging
@entity137 : working man 's truck according to @entity20 data , the driver of a @entity141 ( a plain , regular - cab model ) , is an employed man
@entity24 confirms with this : " basic @entity111 trucks , like the @entity146 , make a good tool for the guy who works hard for an honest living
" @entity21 adds , " we 'll see fewer non-work trucks because using them for commuting has lost its shine
" @entity154 : a marketing mystery " with 2008 sales of only 7700 vehicles , we do n't have enough information about buyers to provide a strong picture of why somebody drives an @entity154 , " said @entity19
" the more expensive @entity163 and @entity162 each sold three times as many
" @entity24 states , " the @entity154 has always been a contradiction , looking like a minivan but not delivering on functionality
" @entity21 quips , " my experience tells me that its few buyers are attracted to its three - pointed star ( badge appeal ) or the large discounts because the @entity154 has n't sold well
" the r - class , a " tweener " that is somewhat minivan , somewhat wagon and somewhat crossover , has few rivals
only the @entity177 and the new @entity178 seem to come close
experts ' first thoughts @entity21 on @entity181 : " i hope it 's a rental
" @entity19 adds , " it 's an old person 's cars , with only four - percent of its buyers from @entity73 " @entity21 on the @entity188 : " they 're members of the @entity190 for @entity188 lovers
" @entity24 on @entity192 : " experimenters with a sense of humor who would rather sprint away from a light than hold up traffic
