no , not with a man
but with a @entity6 apartment
an apartment i had yet to find
but i knew exactly what i was looking for , and exactly how it would make me feel
like a city girl , tough and tender , coming home
my place would be clean , bathed in sunlight , in an elegant prewar building , with a spare room for my college - age daughter
it would certainly not be fixer - upper ( a " wreck , " as we say around here ) , and would have updated plumbing and wiring
i 'd walk out of there every day feeling like a character in a @entity28 movie
i simply could n't live anywhere else
not so long ago , i wrote about a similar quest -- for a good man
that did n't quite pan out
now , after selling my suburban @entity34 house of 22 years , i set my sights on finding an affordable apartment in @entity37 in a vibrant , safe neighborhood
i know what you 're thinking : good luck with that
@entity6 2013 is the @entity43 of real estate
a seller 's market ? that 's an understatement
according to the @entity50 , a go - to place for apartment listings , in october 2009 there were 8,150 apartments listed for sale in @entity37
three years later , there were 6,241
by october 2013 , that number had dwindled to 4,344
based on their listings , the average price for an apartment in @entity37 , according to the @entity50 , is $ 1.1 million
@entity6 , we have a problem
the " man - apartment " similarities abound
sometimes , if you 're online dating and reach out to a good prospect , he does n't respond
busy , or not interested -- who knows ? but unavailable , for sure
trolling the real estate websites , you click on a link and find the apartment of your dreams
but it 's already taken : " @entity72
" strolling the avenue , you see a nice - looking guy
dare to lock eyes with him ? stop right there
did n't you see that little gold ring ? a good man in @entity6 is like prime real estate , snapped up before you can blink
photos are a source of hope and despair for both apartment - and man - hunters
any veteran online dater knows how important attractive profile photos are -- and how deceptive they can be
feeling butterflies before a first date ? perhaps because you 're not entirely sure the person you 've been chatting with online even resembles his profile photo
only by meeting will you know if this relationship is doomed , because more often than not , you 'll be burned by the big reveal
it 's the same with properties
using wide - angle lenses , photographers can make a closet seem like a ballroom
to help find my apartment " match , " i signed with an experienced buyer 's broker : @entity112 of @entity113
i might be in love with @entity6 , but i needed a reality check
" be prepared to be disappointed , " @entity112 said
" it 's ok to fall in love with an apartment , but you ca n't get too attached to an apartment
unless you 're making an offer on a dump , expect a bidding war
dozens of people show up for open houses , even waiting on line in the bitter cold to see apartments
a broker may hand you the sales sheet , which lists the apartment features and price , while declaring : " that 's not really the price
it 's going up today
" it 's a head - spinning exercise
you think you 're close to clinching a deal , and suddenly another buyer swoops in to offer cash for an apartment
your bid may be accepted , but until the seller signs the contract , you 're in limbo
could another buyer steal your apartment , and your heart , away ? @entity112 and i found a lovely place on the @entity152
the moment i walked in , i just knew
" i want that apartment , " i told her in the elevator
we entered a bid within hours
for days , the selling broker flirted with me , toyed with me
" there are other offers , but she 's a great candidate , " he told @entity112
we entered our " best and final " bid , but were tied with another buyer
in the end , someone offered $ 12,000 more
i guess best and final was n't really " final
how far will @entity6 buyers go to get an apartment they want ? once , when there were multiple offers , @entity112 recalled , " a buyer delivered a signed contract with a check for $ 100,000 over the asking price of the apartment
" there had been no negotiation
" the seller , of course , went with them , " she said
after losing two bids , i finally found the apartment i would buy
@entity112 , the ultimate real estate matchmaker , found me the right space at a decent price
it was n't love at first sight
( the ' 80s decor was nearly enough to kill all desire
) and it was not the prewar building i had pined for
but it was a good deal -- and with a little luck , everything fell into place
how could meeting a man in @entity6 possibly be as difficult as landing an affordable apartment ? @entity6 matchmaker @entity202 , of @entity203 , says it 's infinitely harder
just as in real estate , there 's a dearth of inventory
" in general , you have four single straight women to every single straight man , " @entity202 explains
" it 's the worst city
men here have so much choice that it gets distracting , " she adds
" @entity37 , specifically , attracts the most ambitious people on the planet
" and all those type - a personalities do n't work well for matchmaking
" you 're talking about the top 5 % , or top 1 % of women
they do n't take no for an answer and they have incredibly high standards , " says @entity202
as for men , " you have single dads , divorced dads , widowers , a good portion looking for women 10 years younger than they are
it 's a huge mismatch
" so , now that i 've gone to all the trouble of moving here -- how can i ever meet a nice guy ? maybe i should try another city
in @entity242 , for example , " there are four single men to every single woman , " says @entity202
" the men look incredibly good
they all work out , they all dress nice , they all have nice apartments
" that is , if i can ever bear the thought of moving again .
