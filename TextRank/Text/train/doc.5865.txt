-- nearly 2,000 homeowners in @entity2 who had their lives turned upside down by @entity4 were wrongfully denied recovery funds , according to a new report released thursday
four of every five homeowners who appealed denials from the @entity9 , @entity10 , and @entity11 ( @entity13 ) program and the resettlement programs in @entity2 had their rejections overturned , according to the @entity16 , an organization that advocates for the rights of poor homeowners
the fate of thousands of other homeowners affected by @entity4 remains unclear , according to the report
the @entity13 program provides up to $ 150,000 to cover the cost of rebuilding and elevating a home
public records obtained by the @entity16 show that 3,196 applicants were told by the @entity27 administration that they were ineligible for the program
of the 1,033 who appealed the denial , 788 , or 79 percent , were told they were in fact eligible for recovery funds
a similar percentage of residents who were denied up to $ 10,000 to cover non-rebuilding costs also had their rejections overturned in the appeal process , for a total of 1,090 households
thousands more who were denied funds from either program did not appeal , according to the report
" we were pretty shocked , " said @entity45 , staff attorney at the advocacy group
" thousands of people were wrongfully rejected , and it was impacting people all over the state
we were just shocked by the sheer magnitude of it
" the report shows that a majority of the applicants who were denied funds were minority homeowners
" i think it 's a breach of faith in the basic fairness of government and appalling behavior , especially when it is directed toward people recovering from a disaster , " @entity45 said
a statement from the state 's @entity67 , which administers @entity4 recovery programs , said : " @entity71 analysis leaves out both significant facts and context
@entity67 has ensured that anyone initially rejected received a thorough review of their application , resulting in reinstatement of eligibility and the award of recovery funds in every single eligible case
" the agency is placing part of the blame on the federal government
" noting the high number of ineligibility determinations , we investigated and learned @entity89 provided the @entity90 with inaccurate damage assessment data
as a result , we obtained ( @entity94 ) approval to allow applicants to demonstrate damage through third party sources , " the statement said
a statement from gov. @entity27 's office released on monday said that more than 5,100 @entity4 - affected homeowners have been preliminarily awarded @entity13 grants and that approximately 3,000 would be moved off the waitlist
@entity27 met on tuesday with a few homeowners impacted by the storm in @entity106
he acknowledged their frustration with the slow recovery process
but he said things are improving and pointed out that nearly $ 1.2 billion in @entity4 recovery funds have either already been distributed or are in the pipeline in @entity2
" half the money is going toward housing
when you had 365,000 homes damaged or destroyed in the storm , this is the longest and most difficult part of trying to deal with the problem , " @entity27 said
@entity27 blamed any delays in distributing funds on the process used to decide who gets what
there are two deciding factors : the amount of damage and the level of need based on a family 's economic situation
" that means you have to get more information to us
that means we have to review more information
that means the federal government will then review more information , " he said
" and it almost invariably means one of us will ask you for more things
" the @entity16 is standing by its findings
" the @entity27 administration 's widespread rejection of large numbers of families actually eligible for @entity4 aid shows that the @entity4 recovery process has been flawed from start to finish , " @entity45 said
concerned by the findings , @entity156 sen. @entity155 , @entity157 , is calling for more oversight
" my office is aware of complaints from constituents concerned with discrepancies , long waiting lists and delays in receiving the help they need to rebuild their homes and lives , " he said in a written statement
" that is why i am calling for @entity173 hearings to explore ways to expedite relief to so many struggling @entity2 families still recovering more than a year after @entity4
" @entity156 rep. @entity177 , @entity157 , is also calling for greater oversight of @entity4 recovery funds
he raised concerns about the firm hired in may to help process applications for funding
@entity184 was fired by the state last month
" we need a full accounting of the @entity184 contract , and i urge @entity94 to require the appointment of an independent monitor before the next round of funding goes out to ensure there is n't further mismanagement , " @entity177 said in a written statement
the report comes at a critical point in the recovery effort in @entity2
the state is preparing to distribute $ 1.46 billion in a second round of @entity4 funding
at the same time , the @entity156 attorney 's office is investigating claims from @entity205 mayor @entity204 that members of the @entity27 administration linked @entity4 recovery funds to her approval of a real estate development project in her city .
