the @entity1 cavalcade trooped into @entity3 this week for three days of testing at a sultry @entity6 circuit
while there were no surprises about the man leading the pack , results further down hint at an interesting season ahead in motorcycle racing 's top class
@entity17 's @entity16 blew away the winter cobwebs with a typically imperious blast around the track
the youngest - ever double world champion 's best lap of one minute 59.115 seconds was more than three - tenths of a second clear of the field -- a blink of an eye , perhaps , but a significant gap in a sport of fine margins
the @entity31 's appetite for success appears undiminished and he was in the mood for work , clocking up 73 laps on the final day of testing -- more than anyone else on the grid
" we 're finished today with our homework done , " @entity16 said
" i do not think there are many more new things to try
" behind the @entity45 there were several eye - catching rides in track temperatures that reached a scalding 49 degrees @entity49 ( 120 Ëš f )
@entity51 's @entity50 finished second on his @entity51 despite struggling with the intense heat
" it was really difficult to keep a good lap time and pace , " @entity50 said
" the bike felt not so good with so much temperature
i decided to stop as i was n't feeling confident in braking
" reportedly in the shape of his life , the man from @entity60 clocked a satisfying one minute 59.437 seconds -- his fastest ever lap at the track -- and looks set to be @entity16 's closest challenger this year , especially as both his teammate @entity63 ( 5th ) and @entity17 's @entity64 ( 7th ) left @entity3 with work to do
while no eyebrows were raised at the top two riders , the man in third place will have got them twitching
@entity74 's @entity73 endured a miserable 2014 for the most part with @entity76 , but was getting to grips with the @entity79 bike before he departed for @entity80
he appears to have settled immediately , and an impressive showing in @entity6 bodes well for the combative @entity83 's season
not a fan of the circuit , @entity73 departed with a smile on his face after registering a hugely impressive one minute 59.658 seconds
" for a track that i dislike , that 's my fastest ever lap around here by nearly eight - tenths of a second , " @entity73 said
" i felt good and comfortable on the bike , and it 's not a bad lap considering the conditions of the circuit today
" fellow @entity100 @entity99 , on the @entity98 team , also performed well
on day two he already felt the team was " 95 % there , " and his sixth place on day three was promising
the progress of two teams in @entity3 was under particular scrutiny with @entity76 debuting its new @entity107 bike and @entity108 stepping up for its eagerly anticipated return to the sport with its @entity111
@entity76 team principal @entity112 was satisfied with the @entity107 's showing
" it seems that everything is going well : we lapped for three days without any major reliability issues and this is surely important for a completely new bike , " @entity114 said
new recruit @entity121 impressed with an outstanding fourth place on the final day
" i 'm happy with the way it 's improved in such a short period of time , " @entity121 remarked
@entity108 's @entity127 was also satisfied with his machine 's progress
on monday , he said that he had been surprised by the speed and power of the @entity111 , and was also content with its performance in that day 's wet conditions
" i feel very comfortable , " the @entity45 said
" it is small and easy to handle so i feel confident
" one more test remains for the teams , at @entity140 's @entity139 circuit , before the season gets underway at the same track on 29 march .
