the boys at @entity2 -- members and sponsors alike -- are in a big bind
nine years after i led an unsuccessful effort by the @entity7 to open membership in the club to women , the " woman problem " is back
this time it involves @entity13 , the first female chief executive of @entity14
@entity14 is a major sponsor of @entity2 's @entity15 , and up to now its ceos have always been given membership in the club
but none has ever been a woman
so what happens now -- will @entity2 open its doors to women ? or will @entity14 pull its sponsorship and force its other executives to resign their club memberships ? these are the only two real choices
we 've said all along that this is not about golf
it is about access to the places where big business is done , deals are made and careers are boosted or broken
half of @entity2 's membership ( which reads like a roster of @entity38 ) probably does n't even care about golf , but the members do care about power relationships
according to @entity46 , " golf remains the true communications hub of @entity45 's business elite
" back in 2003 when opposition to the all - male policy was making headlines , i got two calls from sponsors who said they were " in dialogue " with the club
the first was from @entity57 , saying its board was going to make a decision after talking to " @entity61 ( @entity62 ) and @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , " board members who were also @entity2 members
i was promised a call in the next two or three days
my second call was much more hostile
it was from @entity14 , telling me my organization was " forcing " them to do something they did n't want to do , and generally dressing me down for making an issue of the bald - faced sexism that their sponsorship supported
a few days later @entity75 , then chairman of @entity2 , stepped to a microphone and announced the club was releasing its sponsors , broadcasting the tournament without commercials
the boys had clearly made a deal that went like this : we 'll " release " you as sponsors , you 'll keep your mouths shut , and when all this woman stuff blows over you can quietly come back
two of the three did not return ( @entity14 was the exception ) , but none of the sponsors ever condemned the male - only policy at @entity2
@entity14 is surely scrambling for what it hopes will be another face - saving deal
the @entity98 senior golf columnist @entity97 predicts that club chairman @entity100 will offer @entity13 a membership a few days after the @entity15 ends next week : " she shows up at the tournament in 2013 in green , after the gender issue has died down
that way , the club avoids the appearance that @entity100 has been backed into a corner or forced into making an accommodation
" sorry , but that dog wo n't hunt
telling @entity13 to be a good girl and wait a little longer with @entity14 's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company 's image , but for @entity13 's credibility as its leader
@entity97 's scenario would scream that @entity14 values the relationship with a club that proudly discriminates more than it values its own integrity -- or its first female ceo
what if , on the other hand , @entity13 makes an announcement that she 's not interested in membership ? that wo n't work either
it would be widely assumed that she was under pressure from the company to make such a statement , and in the bargain accept her second - class status
after all , @entity133 ( male and female ) do n't get where they are by making waves
but fixing this should n't be put on her
it 's the responsibility of the board of directors to insist that their ceo be treated exactly like -- well -- one of the boys
besides , whether she would accept a membership is completely irrelevant to the question of the appropriateness of the club 's all - male policy and @entity14 's tacit support of it , and it does n't get the club out of its bind anyway
before she can reject a membership , she has to be offered one
if @entity2 admits it was prepared to make an offer but she would n't accept , it has admitted that membership is open to women , and it will immediately be asked who the next candidate will be and when
if the club remains silent , @entity14 's problem reverberates louder
and saying the gender issue will die down is wishful thinking
the women 's movement opened the doors to the executive suites for women like @entity13 with 30 years of hard work that made sex discrimination in hiring and promotion in corporate @entity45 illegal
if we had n't raised the ruckus in 2003 , you can bet it would n't be front and center now
and though we have n't succeeded yet , we wo n't stop until females are treated equally in corporate - supported venues like @entity2 , or until those companies are shamed into pulling support
if this were about race discrimination and a black ( male ) ceo , @entity14 surely would n't be in the mix , and no other national sponsor would go near this club
but it 's only the girls -- and sex discrimination is just not as serious
or is it ? we 're listening for @entity14 's answer
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .
