-- q : sgt. @entity2 has been accused of killing 16 @entity4 civilians
he served three tours in @entity6 before this and his lawyer says he may have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or a traumatic brain injury
what 's the link between violence and those disorders ? a : psychiatrists understand some types of aberrant behavior pretty well and can do things to help resolve it
but , unfortunately , in other instances -- and often the most interesting ones -- we can only mumble generalities that require no special expertise and that offer no hope for a diagnosis or treatment
take the case of @entity30 sgt. @entity2 , accused of massacring 16 @entity4 men , women and children while they slept unprotected in their village
the first thing a psychiatrist would want to know is whether the person who committed such a heinous act was psychotic at that time , meaning out of touch with agreed - upon human reality
did he perform the killings as a result of deeply held false beliefs or in response to hearing voices commanding him to act ? if yes , then although the tragedy remains , the psychiatric mystery is solved
but at this point , although @entity51 has reportedly told his lawyer he remembers nothing about the night of the massacre , there is no evidence he was psychotic immediately before the killing spree
nor do we have any evidence at this point that the killings were motivated by some larger political purpose , which might also explain , but certainly not justify , them
so why would someone who had appeared normal to everyone around him suddenly commit such a hideous act ? @entity30 reviewing ptsd evaluation program much has been made in the media about the fact that @entity51 was on his fourth deployment
moreover , he had suffered mild traumatic brain injury in @entity6
traumatic brain injury can cause a wide range of mental difficulties , from poor decision making and memory to increases in impulsive behavior , irritability , depression and personality change
so how likely is it that @entity51 ' traumatic brain injury explains the accusation that he massacred 16 @entity4 villagers ? the answer is : not very likely
why ? consider , as alternative possible explanation , mania
mania is often characterized by the sudden onset of bizarre , agitated behavior in public and it is not necessarily related to traumatic brain injury
traumatic brain injury almost never causes otherwise solid citizens to ruthlessly massacre men , women and children
thousands upon thousands of people develop severe manic episodes every year
thousands upon thousands of service men and women have been multiply deployed and have suffered various levels of traumatic brain injury , and yet there is only one @entity51
that is why it does n't fit very well
mass murder is just about as rare in people with brain damage as in people without brain damage
note that i said " just about
" in fact , organic brain damage can be a cause of mass violence
probably the most classic example of this in @entity124 history was the case of @entity126 , who went on a shooting spree from atop the @entity129 tower that resulted in the death of 16 people
although he was under multiple stressors at the time of the incident , he was found to have a brain tumor in the " rage area " of his brain ( i.e. the amygdala ) upon autopsy
in the case of @entity51 , if he is guilty of the massacre , his actions may eventually be found to be related to a clearly causative organic factor
but my clinical experience tells me not to bet on this
it happens , but pretty rarely
when people behave in unexpected ways for no good reason , it often turns out that when the full story of their lives is understood , the behavior no longer appears as unexpected
that which is neither clearly linked to either a medical or psychiatric illness is very likely intertwined in a person 's longstanding personality
so , i suspect that if 100 psychiatrists were told that a previously normal service person massacred 16 civilians and was neither medically impaired nor psychotic , the majority of them would immediately suspect that the person in question might not have been as normal across his life as initial reports suggested
in fact , as more comes out about @entity51 this appears to be the case
it now appears that he was involved in fraudulent business dealings
what makes the case so strange , however , are the multiple contrasting reports of his remarkably caring and selfless behavior on numerous occasions and his status as something of a small town hero
i seem to end many of my @entity183 pieces with some type of comment about how unsatisfying our current level of psychiatric understanding is
this pieces , alas , is no different in this regard
frankly , at this point nothing in @entity51 ' actions makes psychiatric sense
on the other hand , how many highly admired , hard - working , patriotic , caring small - town heroes are embroiled in financial fraud or may have other dark behaviors in their backgrounds ? maybe the fact that @entity51 himself may not make sense is the best place for us to start in our understanding of the horrible events in @entity4 .
