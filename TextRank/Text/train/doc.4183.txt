-- @entity1 has beaten @entity2 6 - 3 6 - 2 in saturday 's @entity4 semi final to continue his fine run of form in the build up to the @entity8

the @entity14 will face world number one @entity16 in the final after he ran out 7 - 6 6 - 3 over his fellow @entity19 @entity18
@entity1 , who has lost in the final at @entity4 three times before , always looked comfortable against @entity2 , with the @entity14 showing the form that helped him win the @entity8 in 2011

so i 'm very much looking forward to trying to get the title
" the @entity4 crown is one of only three masters crown the former world number one has yet to win
@entity2 had several opportunities to take the lead , but struggled to make the most of his chances
" i had i think six break point in the match and i did n't take one
against @entity1 , or the top players , if you do n't take your opportunities , you will lose for sure , " the @entity40 star told the official website
the 2009 @entity8 winner , @entity2 was struggling with a wrist injury throughout the match , having to take pain killers at the end of the first set
" i have experience in wrist problems , and i would like to take time to fix this little problem , " he said
@entity16 goes into sunday 's final after a solid week in @entity4
he was pushed all the way by @entity18 in the first set , but managed to show some of the form that took him back to the top of the rankings in the second and record a comfortable win .
