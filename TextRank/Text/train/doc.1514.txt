@entity0 -- tuesday 's @entity3 decision in @entity4 -- holding that , after being informed of their rights , suspects must explicitly tell police that they want to stay silent to invoke their @entity10 protections -- indeed turns @entity10 " upside down , " as one dissenting justice put it
its potential consequences are as predictable as night following day : police will interrogate criminal suspects who do not explicitly invoke their rights -- often , those will be suspects who are unsophisticated , poorly educated or mentally ill -- for hours on end
this will lead , just as inevitably , to more coerced -- and therefore unreliable -- confessions
and this will result in wrongful incarceration and diminish our collective security
this is the very phenomenon that @entity10 aimed to eliminate
to be sure , the ruling is a setback for the protections designed to ensure an effective criminal justice system ( @entity10 requires police officers to inform suspects of the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney )
but there is one silver lining in @entity37 ' cloud : the ruling demonstrates that the @entity3 is not shy about curtailing @entity10 protections , even without prodding from @entity39
hence the ruling should derail @entity39 ' recent calls to enact an unnecessary , likely overbroad and possibly unconstitutional statute further restricting @entity10 's requirements
the issue arose when attorney general @entity44 , among others , called on lawmakers to step in and limit @entity10 by expanding the " public safety exception
" that exception allows law enforcement officials to interrogate suspected terrorists for a limited time before advising them of their miranda rights -- if the officers are " reasonably prompted by a concern for public safety
" but this call for codifying has always been somewhat baffling , as it is so clearly not needed
expanding of the public safety exception legislatively may score political points for lawmakers or government officials bent on appearing tough on terrorism , but such action would not improve the efficacy of our counterterrorism policy
in fact , the public safety exception in its current form has proved extremely effective in allowing law enforcement the necessary flexibility in questioning terror suspects
after two recent attempted terror attacks , both the " underwear bomber " suspect , @entity77 , and " @entity80 bomber " suspect @entity78 were questioned under the public safety exception
they both reportedly provided interrogators with valuable intelligence during that time and continued to do so even after being advised of their rights
as the attorney general himself observed , " the giving of @entity10 warnings has not stopped these terror suspects from talking to us
they have continued to talk even though we have given them a @entity10 warning
" legislation on the public safety exception is also risky
while courts consider the issues that come to them on a case - by - case basis , deciding what the law requires in the context of a particular set of circumstances , @entity39 must act in the abstract , imagining a variety of situations that might occur and attempting to draft a law able to address each of them
thus any congressional attempt to define the scope of the public safety exception , especially in a political environment dominated by a sense that the next terrorist attempt might occur at any moment , is likely to overreach
moreover , we know from the 2000 case @entity121 , which struck down a law aimed at limiting the scope of @entity10 , that the @entity3 will draw the line on curtailing @entity10 's protections
thus any statute passed now to expand or codify the exception runs the risk of judicial invalidation
the result would be that any convictions secured through confessions elicited under the invalidated law would be reversed
today 's decision , however , removes any doubt about whether @entity39 should take action
without @entity39 ever introducing a bill or taking a single vote , the @entity3 just expanded significantly law enforcement officials ' ability to interrogate at length all criminal suspects , terrorists or otherwise , even after they have been properly mirandized
until suspected terrorists unambiguously assert their desire to remain silent , government officials may continue to interrogate them for hours or even days , using any statement they make against them in subsequent prosecution
moreover , this decision sends a strong signal : while it might look with hostility on congressional attempts to rein in the scope of the @entity10 rule , the @entity3 itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that @entity10 affords criminal defendants
and it is willing to reach relatively far to do so
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .
