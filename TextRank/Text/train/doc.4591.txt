-- do n't confuse @entity1 for @entity2 -- it 's a common mistake
@entity1 says being a mother has been her greatest teacher -- for all her roles
while her infamous alter ego was uneducated , @entity1 is thoughtful and well - spoken ; @entity2 's fashion is time - warped ( hello , bouffant ! ) , @entity1 's is earthy ; for every ounce of laziness in @entity2 's body , @entity1 has a multitasking one to match
it may have taken years for the actress to shake her tv counterpart , but watch @entity1 as fierce matriarch @entity17 on @entity19 's motorcycle drama " @entity21 " ( which was released on dvd tuesday ) , and you 'll start to wonder , " @entity2 who ? " @entity24 : you 're known for playing three very different mothers -- " married with @entity29 's " @entity2 , @entity27 from " @entity28 " and now @entity17
plus , you have three kids of your own , two teenagers and a 2 1/2 - year - old
given all that on - and off - screen mothering experience , is there any universal quality that you would say all moms have ? @entity1 : being a mother has been my greatest teacher and also the most self - sacrificing thing i 've ever done
i 've never loved anybody the way i love my children
it 's an experience i was surprised by
you have your boyfriend , your husband , your friends , but it 's a different thing
it 's deeper , and it 's a fantastic -- and risky -- commitment to love that deeply
i think the characters i 've played all have that quality , even @entity2
she was devoted and loyal to her children in her own wacky way
but @entity17 is intensely dedicated to her family and would do anything to protect her son and her extended family , which is the club
in my personal life , i do n't know that i would go to the lengths for my kids that @entity17 does , but close
@entity24 : you were @entity2 before you were actually a mom
once you had your first child , id having firsthand experience change the way you played her ? @entity1 : well , i 've always been a maternal type , but yes , everything was different once i had kids
your whole perspective on the world changes -- i love how i was n't so self - obsessed anymore ! i ca n't say my characterizations of @entity75 necessarily changed much
i just understood more what i was doing
@entity24 : you mentioned your husband , @entity78 , who is also the creator of your show
what 's it like to mix family with business ? @entity1 : most of the time it 's super great
there are moments when it 's not , of course , but most of the time it 's nice because we actually get to see each other
his job is intense , so he does n't get a day like i have today where he can stay home from work
when i 'm there , we can sometimes have lunch together , stuff like that
the hard part gets to be like " ok , maybe we should talk about something else
" it becomes the constant topic of conversation , the show and the kids , and we have to make a conscious effort to say , " let 's not talk about it tonight
" @entity24 : people used to say that women of " a certain age " -- over 40 -- could n't find any roles in @entity118
that 's certainly not true anymore , especially on cable , and you might be playing one of the toughest women out there
why do think that has changed ? @entity1 : i do n't know why it 's changed , but i 'm really grateful it has
maybe it has to do with the fact that we 're all living longer and suddenly it 's okay to get older
maybe there 's a broader audience for these characters
the stories you can tell about older women are deeper
plus , cable has opened up enormous possibilities
in feature films , you 're still lucky if you 're not the girlfriend or the wife
but i just read yesterday that @entity145 is going to be on television now , she 's doing a series with @entity148 , so tv is where our stories are being told
@entity24 : @entity17 's a pretty controversial character
how do you feel about her ? @entity1 : i really like her
i like that she 's flawed but she does n't think that she is
she 's survived a lot , and people like that tend to live in a lot of denial
she knows how to get through life in her way , and she does n't question it
it 's just , " this is how it is
" for instance , i do n't think @entity17 's ever been to therapy
she 's not that girl
what you see is what you get
@entity24 : what 's on tap for her this season ? @entity1 : something very dark happens
the club is going to go through some turmoil -- when you live an outlaw lifestyle , that 's the risk you take
as my husband says , this season is all about loyalties
@entity184 and @entity185 are on the show this year , and they ... well , i do n't want to say too much , but they 're not really good guys
@entity24 : i promised a co-worker i 'd ask you about " lost
" she 's dying to know if your character , @entity191 , is really dead
even though we saw the grave , she does n't believe it 's the full story
got anything on that ? @entity1 : i was just reading an article this morning at the gym about how they were going to bring back people who were dead on " @entity190 , " and they did n't mention me ! nobody tells me anything
i 'm always thinking that @entity191 should come back and show up on the island , but as of today , no one 's sent me a plane ticket to @entity207
so i do n't think it 's going to happen , but i do n't know
they 're very close to the chest with all that stuff
