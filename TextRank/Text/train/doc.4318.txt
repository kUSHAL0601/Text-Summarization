@entity0 , @entity1 -- the six @entity4 rangers suddenly crouched , whispering , on their way up the rocky mountain trail
it was early friday afternoon , the first day of the @entity8 , and the rangers were out in force , hiking to the spot where dozens of volunteers worked with picks and shovels to move and bury @entity0 's makeshift water line
shhh ! look ! do you see it ? the rangers stopped in their tracks
binoculars emerged from pockets , and fingers pointed to a stand of trees
and there it was , a @entity27 spotted owl , perched high in a pine tree
it was a male , the rangers said , with his back turned to the intruders
but mostly , the owl seemed to be watching the nest in a nearby sycamore tree where his mate tended to an owlet
the owl is a threatened species , and until a few days ago its presence in fire - scorched @entity43 was a matter of speculation
but now that it has surfaced , the owl could be a game - changer in the water war between the @entity4 and the @entity48 city made famous by the 30 - second gunfight at the @entity50
@entity0 is trying to repair a 26 - mile pipeline that has brought mountain spring water into the city since 1881
it was damaged during last summer 's @entity53 and monsoon rains that brought mud , water and boulders crashing down the denuded slopes
the @entity59 , where owls nest in the trees above @entity0 's pipeline , was hit particularly hard
sections of pipeline simply vanished , and @entity0 's reservoir ran dry by august
@entity66 , project manager for the @entity0 pipeline , said the repaired pipeline needs to be shored up or it surely will be washed away when the monsoon rains return next month
planned tasks for the shovel brigade include reinforcing the spring and diverting its flow by using boulders , sand , downed trees and other flood debris
as for the owl , nobody could say for certain after the fire whether it would return
but it 's the big reason why the @entity4 would n't simply hand @entity0 a permit to use heavy construction equipment to fix the pipeline
@entity0 responded by taking the feds to court
since then , the conflict has escalated , taking on a life of its own
@entity0 now asserts that it owns 25 springs in the @entity91 and should n't have to ask anyone for permission to maintain its own water line
the @entity4 says @entity0 holds permits for just five springs , and it argues the city is trying to exploit a natural disaster to expand its water system
with the conservative @entity101 taking on @entity0 's legal work , the court battle has blossomed into a full - blown states rights dispute
@entity0 is getting the attention of activists from @entity106 , @entity107 and other @entity109 states who say the federal government has gone too far
it has become ground zero in a rekindled @entity113
" i 'd love to say that this is a partisan issue and that if this administration changes , it 's going to be all sweetness and light , " said @entity114 , a @entity0 native who now heads the @entity115
" but i have 22 years of experience telling me otherwise
it 's not a partisan issue
" @entity114 said she has battled the @entity4 often on behalf of ranchers in her state and has found that " people in @entity128 just do n't understand the @entity48
they do n't understand the wide open spaces and how we live and how we manage the land
" the federal government controls millions of acres in the @entity48 , and some folks believe the feds have reneged on a promise to turn over large swaths to local control once statehood was achieved
it 's a battle cry once made by oilmen and ranchers , and now state and local governments are taking up the cause
the leaders of the @entity148 , which in 2000 used volunteer muscle power to move a boulder and reopen a wilderness road near @entity152 , @entity153 , rallied to @entity0 's side
a nonprofit organization was set up , and @entity0 so far has received $ 2,000 in donations and about 400 shovels
the @entity148 contingent then traveled to @entity0 , hiked up the mountain and labored on the pipeline
so did @entity161 , a state representative from @entity106 , who won passage of legislation that seeks to turn over federal land to his state
he says the conflict playing out in @entity0 is an example of the @entity4 dictating to , rather than working with , local government officials
he says the feds suddenly cut off @entity0 's access to springs and roads the city has maintained for 130 years under " an arbitrary and irrational federal policy
" as a result , @entity161 said , @entity0 " is minutes away from going up in smoke " because it is " a wooden town in the middle of the desert in the middle of a drought
" at the center of the debate is the @entity27 spotted owl
" what is more important , owls or the people of @entity0 ? " @entity189 , a @entity4 supervisor who oversees the wilderness , was asked in court earlier this year
@entity192 responded that there was no easy answer , which left jaws dropping on @entity0 's side of the courtroom
so far , the @entity4 had been winning in court ; @entity0 's request for an emergency injunction went all the way to the @entity203 @entity202 but was turned down
the feds seemed to be losing in the court of public opinion , though
@entity0 tells a compelling story , portraying the @entity4 as a rogue agency of obstructionist , tree - hugging bureaucrats
the @entity4 had offered little comment , and when it did say something , it sounded to the people of @entity0 , well , tree - hugging and bureaucratic
but the rangers came out in force on friday , presenting their helpful side
a group of @entity4 firefighters hiked up the mountain and used a two - man crosscut saw to take down a tree and clear a path for the pipeline
while everyone agrees the relationship between @entity0 city officials and @entity4 rangers has improved in recent weeks , their differences simmer just below the surface
the agency is working with the city to come up with a plan to keep water flowing to @entity0 , but it is n't standing down
the @entity4 granted permits thursday for the city to bring the all - volunteer shovel brigade into the canyon to shore up the pipeline
@entity0 has until 8 p.m. saturday to finish the job
and so , under an unforgiving desert sun , about 100 people -- including @entity48 cowboy types with monikers such as " whiskers " and " @entity240 " -- gathered at @entity0 's old high school football field friday for the first day of an event that was billed as part protest and part work party
@entity114 , who heads the cattle growers group , grew up in @entity0 and remembers playing powder puff football on that field during the 1970s
her great - grandfather was among @entity0 's first settlers and made a name for himself in banking and ranching , but she considers herself " an economic refugee from @entity1
" she says she knows all too well how difficult navigating @entity4 regulations can be
" the idea that the @entity4 is trying to take water away from my hometown is just beyond words , " she said
" i 'm very proud to be here today to help and to fight
we 're going to fix this , and the @entity4 is going to listen
" the three - mile hike up the mountain was grueling in the 100 - degree heat
the trail is steep and rocky , and some of the volunteers did n't make it to the top
those who did found themselves moving boulders , digging trenches and sliding on gravelly slopes
soaked with sweat , they staggered down the mountain after a couple of hours of hard labor
" it 's just a lot of manual labor , " said @entity278 , president of @entity0 's @entity280 post
it was frustrating , he said , because " we should n't be doing it by manual labor , we should be using equipment
" his friend @entity287 , a fellow veteran , said he considered it his " patriotic duty " to stand up for @entity0 's water rights
meanwhile , @entity0 's cause has found a champion in @entity128
@entity203 rep. @entity292 , an @entity1 @entity293 , recently introduced @entity294 , the @entity295
it proposes to set aside @entity4 restrictions against the use of construction equipment during state - declared water emergencies
@entity292 and @entity300 , @entity0 's archivist , were among the witnesses who testified before a subcommittee of the @entity303 on friday
@entity292 said : " the unforeseen consequences of federal laws and regulations threaten to do something outlaws , economic busts and the @entity1 desert could n't : kill the town too tough to die
