@entity0 -- @entity3 is in an " open war " with @entity5 , president @entity2 said monday , as he pointed the finger at @entity3 and @entity7 for last week 's bombing in @entity9 that killed five @entity5
in an exclusive interview with @entity1 , @entity2 said @entity5 would act to prevent further attacks
@entity2 said @entity5 had " enough " hard intelligence to link the @entity9 attack to @entity3 and its proxy @entity7 and believes more attacks are being planned as part of what he called an " open war against @entity5
" prime minister @entity19 has said that @entity3 and the @entity21 - based @entity7 movement were responsible for a number of attacks and attempted attacks against @entity5 targets in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and other countries
asked whether the @entity9 bombing and the other attempted attacks were revenge for the assassination of @entity3 nuclear scientists , which @entity3 blames on @entity5 , @entity2 said that @entity5 has never claimed responsibility for the killings
but he noted that @entity5 has a right to prevent killing of its citizens
read more on the tension between @entity5 and @entity3 " we do n't have an initiative of terror , " @entity2 said
" we do n't do it
but self - defense is the right and the must of every people
" he said @entity5 's policy was one of " prevention , " rather than " retaliation
" " if you have enough information about a certain person which is a ticking clock that can explode a bomb that can endanger civilian life , clearly you have to prevent him from doing so , " @entity2 said , citing reports that the @entity57 has killed as many as 3,000 people in drone strikes aimed at terrorist enclaves
with neighboring @entity68 in a spiral of violence , @entity2 said @entity5 will be forced to seize @entity68 's chemical weapons if there is a risk president @entity74 would use them against @entity5 or that the arsenal could fall into terrorist hands
over the weekend , defense minister @entity78 said he ordered the military to prepare contingency plans to attack @entity68 's chemical weapons arsenals , should the need arise
" the use of chemical weapons is internationally forbidden ... and what do you do when somebody violates the law ? you fight against it , " @entity2 said
we shall not remain indifferent and tell them , ' do what you want
' " when asked how far @entity5 would go to secure @entity68 's chemical arsenal , @entity2 simply said : " until it will stop being a danger
" with @entity5 facing a potential influx of refugees , @entity2 said although no @entity68 have tried to enter the country , @entity5 would not help any refugees who want to cross the border and would use force against any armed individuals
" if they will come by force , we shall stop them by force , " @entity2 said
" if they shall come in without force , we shall stop them the way any country defended her border with civilian means
" @entity2 spoke a day after @entity5 marked the 40th anniversary of the 1972 @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , where 11 @entity5 athletes and coaches were killed
while he would n't go into details , @entity2 said @entity5 was taking precautions to ensure @entity5 athletes would not be targeted at the @entity124 , which start later this week
he argued , however , that if @entity5 intelligence services been at @entity117 , they would probably have been able to prevent the attack .
