-- the worst secret in boxing is out of the bag : " @entity5 " @entity4 is the most likely opponent for @entity7 's next fight
the 39 - year - old @entity9 boxer used @entity10 to announce that discussions between the two camps are at an advanced stage , with confirmation expected in the next 24 hours
" just excited about the fight with @entity16 [ @entity7 ]
i know you 're going to be there , " he tweeted to former world heavyweight champion @entity18 on the social networking website
" the ink has n't dried yet but it 's pretty much a go
" speculation has mounted over who would fight the @entity26 eight - division world title - holder on may 7 at the @entity27 in @entity28 , with @entity29 mooted as another possible opponent
@entity32 fight will define @entity7 's career but in a subsequent interview with the @entity35 , @entity4 confirmed that he would meet with @entity7 's representatives on tuesday to finalize a deal
" we 've already discussed the fight about three to four weeks ago , so now we 'll go over it again , " said @entity4
" both sides just need to commit to what we 've talked about and then i think we 're done
" @entity7 's trainer @entity44 had earlier ruled out @entity29 while , at the same time , insisting on an important caveat if @entity4 was indeed chosen
" [ @entity4 ] wo n't be an easy fight for @entity7 , " @entity44 told assembled reporters in the @entity26 , where he was celebrating @entity7 's 32nd birthday
" he can punch with either hand
but if the fight pushes through , i 'll insist on a drug test
he 's been known to take steroids and it shows in his body
" @entity29 calls out @entity7 for rematch @entity44 was referring to a 2003 @entity9 grand jury submission by @entity4 where he admitted using @entity58 , a performance enhancing drug , as he prepared to fight @entity59
but @entity4 never tested positive , and denied knowing what it was or that it was illegal
" i 'm disappointed that this is coming out again , four years after i 've been to the grand jury and gave my truthful testimony , " @entity4 said in a 2008 statement , issued after the allegations first came to light
" i even took a lie - detector test back then to let everyone know that i was n't trying to be an unfair fighter
" but it looks like @entity4 will now have a chance to fight arguably the best pound - for - pound boxer in the sport to prove his detractors wrong .
