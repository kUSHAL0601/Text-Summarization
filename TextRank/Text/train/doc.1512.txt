-- on sunday morning , a strange word suddenly started trending for me on @entity3
i had no idea what it meant , so i did the smart thing and asked my dog
" @entity9 , what 's a @entity11 ? " through nonverbal communication , he indicated that it might have something to do with his groin
though , to be fair , he 'd been indicating this for the better part of an hour
and with varying degrees of intensity
so , just to be sure , i googled this strange new word and discovered that @entity11 was actually a popular game app for your mobile device
and for some reason -- i still have no idea why -- at 10 a.m. on sunday , lots of people were tweeting about it
thus , i had to learn more
i do n't generally care on sundays
nevertheless , a little half - hearted research revealed that this uber - popular word game seemed to be the offspring of a wild and kinky one - night - stand between @entity32 and @entity33
apparently , things got a little crazy at the bar , there was a shared cab ride and , lo and behold , we now have @entity11
the underlying message : be careful with tequila , kids
after downloading the app and opening a game account ( for which i was denied the user name " @entity46 " ) i soon learned that @entity11 consists of three two - minute rounds in which you and your opponent each get 16 letters placed in four rows of four that can be linked together to create words by gliding your finger over the screen at any connecting angle
each letter is also given a point value based on difficulty , and some even award extra points by doubling or tripling the letter or overall word score
in the end , the player with the most points after three rounds is the one who does n't get shingles
obviously , it 's a game of high stakes
yeah , it 's @entity74
i wo n't be in this week
what 's that ? yes
" ok , so the player with the most points actually just wins
however , if you 're competitive like me , losing is just as bad as a blistering skin rash
which is why playing my mom was a horrible idea
but i 'm a glutton for punishment and told her to sign up so she could give me something to write about and , perhaps , humiliate me in the process
which she promptly did on her first attempt : 859 - 805
the ensuing e-mail conversation went like this : @entity95 : " good game
" me : " i 've got your good game right here ! " @entity95 : " oh , my , that does n't sound nice ... " i 'm a particularly sore loser
and she 's gone on to destroy me three more times
" i just want you to play as well as you can , dear
" constantly getting beat by your mom
man , what a drag
since then , i 've at least found a way to defeat two random strangers whom i 've played against , and this has temporarily restored my limited sense of self - worth
fortunately , there are plenty more strangers to go around
and " plenty " is a bit of an understatement
the maker of the game , @entity118 - based @entity116 , boasts that it now has more than 9 million players in over 100 countries
it 's also available in 10 languages
i 'm currently utilizing the @entity123 version of the game because , after 34 years , i 've somehow managed to grasp it at a solid third - grade level
much like one @entity128 who oh - so - intelligently chimed in on sunday morning with " ... pop a book open
then you 'll stop loosing [ sic ] in @entity11
so @entity11 is officially something that matters , and , at press time , it was the no. 4 overall free app in @entity136
it was also the no. 1 word game , apparently beating out @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 with friends
that last one might not actually be a game
anyway , now i 'm included among the millions who play @entity11
but probably not for long
i get bored easily , and my interest is already starting to wane
plus , i just keep " loosing " to my mom .
