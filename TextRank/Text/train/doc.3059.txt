-- a brain - eating amoeba that lurks in fresh water has prompted warnings from @entity5 officials after it killed a 9 - year - old girl
@entity7 was an avid water skier and spent the past few weeks swimming in several bodies of fresh water
she died last week from @entity10 , a brain - eating parasite that lives in warm , standing water
at @entity7 's funeral monday , her family wore matching t - shirts with the logo of her water - skiing club , @entity0 affiliate @entity17 said
relatives honored the young athlete by announcing the @entity20 at @entity21
" our precious daughter , @entity7 , loved life and part of her great joy was spending time playing in the water , " her family said in a statement
" her life was taken by a rare amoeba organism that grows in many different fresh water settings
we want you to know this tragic event is very , very rare , and this is not something to become fearful about
" ' it just causes destruction ' while naegleria fowleri infections are rare , they can have devastating effects
" the amoeba ... finds itself way back in our noses and then can work its way into our central nervous system , around our brains , " said dr. @entity39 of @entity40
" and once it 's there , it just causes destruction
" symptoms usually show up five days after infection , the @entity5 @entity49 and @entity50 said
in addition to a severe headache , fever , nausea and vomiting , @entity58 fowleri infections often cause death
more frequent in summer the cases are often reported in the summer , when more swimmers take a dip in fresh water
last summer , 12 - year - old @entity65 of @entity66 became infected after he went knee - boarding in fresh water near his home
also last summer , @entity70 of @entity71 went for a swim and was infected by the parasite
despite incredible odds against her , @entity70 survived
over the past 50 years , about 130 naegleria fowleri infections have been reported
of those , only three people -- including @entity70 -- have survived
while humans can get infected swimming in fresh water , people can not get infected from drinking water contaminated with the amoeba , the @entity78 said
how to protect yourself the extreme rarity and randomness of infections can make it difficult to predict where they might occur
" it is unknown why certain persons become infected with ( naegleria fowleri ) while millions of others exposed to warm recreational fresh waters do not , including those who were swimming with people who became infected , " the @entity78 said
the @entity5 health department advises swimmers to use nose plugs when swimming in fresh water
it also suggests not stirring up the sediment at the bottom of shallow freshwater areas and keeping your head above the water in hot springs and other untreated thermal waters
but @entity10 is far from the biggest danger in summertime water activities
while 34 people were infected with the amoeba in the @entity116 between 2004 and 2013 , there were more than 34,000 drowning deaths in the @entity116 between 2001 and 2010 , the @entity78 said .
