the artificial breathing support for a clinically dead woman who is 18 weeks pregnant has been switched off by the @entity7 hospital treating her , an official with detail knowledge of the case said saturday
@entity7 's @entity8 ruled friday that doctors can withdraw the artificial breathing support as there is " no reasonable prospect " her unborn child will survive
the 26 - year - old woman was pronounced clinically dead on december 3 after suffering serious brain trauma
prior to the @entity8 ruling , doctors had refused to turn off the machine providing artificial breathing support out of concern for the rights of the unborn child
under @entity7 's constitution , the unborn have the same right to life as the mother
abortion is illegal except in cases where the mother 's life is at " real and substantial risk " due to medical complications or the threat of suicide
the court said in its ruling that this was a " tragic and unfortunate case , " and that medical experts showed no medical or ethical basis to continue " with a process described as verging on the grotesque
" the woman had two children ages 6 and 4 years and was engaged
@entity7 's @entity44 also called the case tragic , but said the court proceedings were necessary
" while it is very difficult for the families concerned that cases like this sometimes end up in court , the fact is that it is a sign of a healthy democracy that life and death issues are taken seriously and appropriately determined , " the group 's @entity46 said in the statement .
