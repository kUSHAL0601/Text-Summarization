-- may the force be with you , even in the airport
we all know that 's not always the case , especially when we 're carrying something that raises concerns from the @entity9
the 7 - foot - 2 - inch tall actor @entity10 , best known for playing @entity11 in the @entity13 movies , ran into a security line delay last week when he was stopped for his lightsaber inspired cane
@entity10 , 69 , was heading home from @entity18 when his movie - inspired cane provoked a second look by @entity9 agents
@entity10 travels regularly to different conventions , meeting fans and tweeting photos
next stop is @entity26 and comic con in july
@entity10 quickly took to his @entity29 account to protest the inspection of his cane , and credits @entity29 for its speedy release
he 's seen in a @entity29 photo sitting in a wheelchair , which he says he 's also using because of a bum knee
one @entity11 tweet : " magic words to @entity9 are not ' please ' or ' thank you '
. it 's ' @entity29 '
. cane released to go home
" the cane was not detained , says the @entity9 , which e-mailed @entity0 this statement : " because of the unusual weight of the passenger 's cane , a security officer alerted a supervisor
less than five minutes later , the passenger and cane were cleared to travel
" a check of the @entity9 's " prohibited items " list revealed this information about lightsabers : " sadly , the technology does n't currently exist to create a real light saber
however , you can pack a toy light saber in your carry - on or checked bag
may the force be with you
" ( the @entity9 spells it " light saber
" ) " even if an item is generally permitted , it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process , appears to have been tampered with , or poses other security concerns
the final decision rests with @entity9 on whether to allow any items on the plane
" " @entity13 " fans had a field day on @entity29
" @ @entity77 learned @entity13 lesson # 1 : ' let the @entity79 , ' " wrote astronomer @entity76
