@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's brutal conflict between regime and rebel forces is creeping closer and closer to nervous residents in the areas of @entity0 still under government control
but in some suburbs of the capital , all - out war is already here
snipers swap shots around the clock in @entity15 , a district in southern @entity0
the front line here has been static for months now , but fighting has increased recently as the government has won back neighboring districts and opposition fighters have fled to this area
" it is pretty much every day that they try to attack our positions
it happens in the mornings , the afternoons , the evenings and at night
when we see them , we shoot , " one @entity1 soldier told @entity2 , never taking his eyes off the battle - scarred swath of @entity34 visible through his sniper scope
the battle for the suburbs of @entity0 will be key to deciding the outcome of the civil war in @entity1
much of the southern and eastern ring around the capital has fallen into the hands of rebel forces , often led by @entity47 brigades , but the @entity1 army is slowly winning back turf -- often at a high cost for both sides
the front line in @entity15 has gone back and forth between the rebels and the military for a long time
the commander in charge , who would only let us identify him as @entity58 , took us through a street that runs parallel to the front
" we call this the lifeline , " he said
" we used this street to move around and resupply when the rebels nearly broke through
it was vital to holding on to this area
" most of the residents have fled the buildings near the front line , but only a few yards away life continues at almost a normal pace
children play in the streets , shops are open and cars edge along debris - littered streets
" we had to leave our houses a few times because the fighting came so close , " one local woman said
" but the military was able to hold the opposition fighters up and things have become more calm recently
" @entity1 president @entity85 has made winning back the outskirts of @entity0 a main priority
while @entity1 soldiers in @entity15 are merely holding the line , in other districts , the army is on the offensive
regime forces recently won back the district of @entity95 south of the capital and have also made gains in @entity98 , the district just west of @entity15
@entity58 , the commander in charge of taking back @entity15 , says there are many foreign jihadists among the rebels his forces have encountered
" the fighters from foreign countries are leaders , " @entity58 said , " especially from places like @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110
we hear from our sources inside that there are many foreign fighters there
" one opposition leader in the @entity117 region around @entity0 who calls himself @entity119 called the army 's siege of rebel - held areas " genocidal
" " we are facing a severe shortage of medicine and all medical supplies , " @entity119 told @entity2
" they are basically non-existent
we have gone back to the stone age
" rebels say the @entity85 regime is trying to starve the civilians still stuck in contested areas
there have been reports and videos on social media of severely malnourished children and people eating leaves to survive
a photo that surfaced on @entity141 in the past week allegedly shows residents of one @entity0 subrub killing the lion at the local zoo for food
but the government claims the opposition is keeping aid convoys from reaching the districts under siege
international aid groups have blamed both sides of using access to food as a weapon
when asked what @entity1 's military was fighting for , @entity58 , the commander in @entity15 , insisted it was about more than simply preserving @entity85 's rule
" this is not a battle of good against evil , " he said
" this is the battle of a secular state against @entity47 ideals
we want to preserve @entity1 as a diverse society
" the soldiers in @entity15 say they are placing little hope in the @entity1 peace talks scheduled to take place in @entity172 , @entity173 next january
right now they ca n't see beyond the mostly deserted streets of a neighborhood that both sides are reducing to rubble .
