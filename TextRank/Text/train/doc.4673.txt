editor 's note : @entity2 is deputy editor for the @entity3
before joining the newspaper , she was a senior adviser for the @entity5 and was named a public affairs director in the @entity7 by president @entity8
@entity2 says president @entity8 will be remembered for keeping @entity10 safe
@entity11 ( @entity12 ) -- in his final radio address as president - elect on the sunday ahead of his inauguration , @entity13 said president @entity8 " extended the hand of cooperation " to him throughout this period of transition
it was a final act of civility , on mr. @entity8 's part
it is a trait that is not surprising to those who know @entity8 ( or those paying some attention at least half of the time )
at least one @entity30 has given him credit for it
unfortunately , that tone of civility has been lost on the @entity37 leadership over the past eight years
civility aside , how others -- more importantly , history -- will judge the 43rd president of the @entity10 , is the question that has followed @entity8 out the door
lucky for him , it wo n't just be up to @entity37 to determine
" i believe president @entity8 will be vindicated , " said secretary of state @entity45 in an interview a couple of weeks ago
she may be an ardent defender of @entity8 , but i believe she 's right
she , like i , have a different vantage point than what has been routinely portrayed
while sitting in the @entity50 with the 43rd president , for what was his last official week in office last thursday , i got the sense that he feels he will be vindicated , too
he wo n't say as much , directly , but indirectly points to what matters most in his eyes -- protecting the homeland
" history will eventually see ... that not only was it necessary to take the steps i took , but [ they ] led to a better world , " the president told me
on a personal level ( and for the sake of full disclosure ) , i must say that i have had the pleasure of working for and knowing @entity8 from his first campaign for president and throughout his presidency
i started as a volunteer in 1999 , then worked as a spokeswoman during his second campaign and then as an appointee in his administration
not only have i counted it an honor and a privilege to serve the 43rd president , but i have always had a deep respect for him as a person of faith , his strident conviction in doing what was right for the country and his commitment to closing the disparities that exist between black and white @entity10 -- no matter the mistakes made and lessons learned
above all , it is his dignity and civility that stand out to me most
yet , for many conservatives ( not just liberals ) , @entity8 has failed on many fronts
from the miscalculation of the insurgency in @entity101 , to failed intelligence gathering and the issues of maintaining fiscal conservatism and delivering real immigration reform -- i ca n't tell you how many @entity107 and conservatives i 've spoken to over this past year who have told me how " disappointed " they 've been with @entity8
a few among them voted for " change " as a result
the legacy @entity8 leaves behind wo n't be everything he wanted ( particularly as it relates to popularity ) , but on many fronts , it will be better than that of his predecessor
@entity120 may have been popular , but his moral failings brought shame on the office of the presidency and tainted the people 's house
that will forever be a stain on @entity120 's legacy
not to mention , there was no such " civility " or " cooperation " when @entity120 turned the keys over to @entity8
i prefer principle over popularity any day
on the moral front , president @entity8 delivered
on the social front , he delivered
on the fiscal front he failed considerably
yet , on the national security front and on many domestic policies , he succeeded
depending on your vantage point , success may mean something wholly different
the details will be debated for decades to come
among the many uncertainties , one thing is certain -- you ca n't judge history in the midst of it
declaring one " the worst " president while he 's still in office is an effort in rhetorical futility
historians know this all too well
the best prediction one can make was summed up by presidential historian @entity159 on " @entity160 " last year : " if @entity101 became the model democracy or even just a democracy , and in doing so changed the whole complexion of the @entity164 , then obviously that would be the legacy that would justify what @entity8 did and what our troops did
" and that 's exactly what mr. @entity8 is banking on
during my @entity50 interview with the president , i asked him to complete the sentence " president @entity8 was ... [ fill in the blank ]
" he responded ( uncharacteristically in third person ) : " president @entity8 was the president at a time when our nation was attacked , he clearly saw the dangers , he pursued the enemy , he put tools in place so the professionals could better protect the people , and the homeland was not attacked
" that is the legacy he wants
popular or not , he kept @entity10 safe
and if nothing else , for that , he will be vindicated
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
