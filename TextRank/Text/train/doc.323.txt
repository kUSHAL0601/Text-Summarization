@entity0 -- women have long dominated the heated discussion around gender equality
but one group not engaging in the conversation is men , says @entity9 coo @entity8
what 's more , in her new bestseller " @entity10 , " @entity8 argues gender parity is impossible without them
" i think it is too hard for men to talk about gender , " says @entity8
" we have to let men talk about this ... because we need men to talk about this if it is ever going to change
" and with men at the helm of most large companies , engaging the other 50 % of the population in the gender debate is the key to gender equality , she says
" i do n't think men should be part of " lean in " or part of equality because it 's nice for women
they need to be part of it for themselves ... as managers and as peers in the workforce this is a competitive advantage for men
" if 86 % of the top jobs are held by men and they tend to be older than the women who have just joined their companies , inviting this group of decision makers to help mentor women into top roles is the logical way forward , explains @entity8
" [ for ] every man out there , it should be a badge of honor to mentor young women
not something you 're ashamed to do , not something you 're afraid someone will assume something bad , but a badge of honor that you are willing to spend your time giving the benefit of your experience to young women in the workforce
" as a female leader who has only worked for men and been mentored by men , her track record and success is proof in itself
" i 've never worked for a woman
most women , if they get senior , have never worked for a woman , because again , 86 percent of the top jobs are held by men
i 've had great mentors and great sponsors and part of @entity10 is trying to help people find the right way to develop those mentors and sponsors
" as a @entity95 graduate , she was selected to join the @entity96 by her former professor , @entity97 and later went on to become his chief - of - staff at the @entity99 after working at @entity100 and earning her @entity101 in the midst of moving to @entity103 and then @entity9 , @entity8 wed and had two children , a boy and a girl
but @entity8 's book -- what she calls " a sort " of feminist manifesto -- has n't been without critics
the @entity9 executive received overwhelming reactions from female columnists at @entity115 and the @entity116 as well as authors specializing in gender workplace issues
one notable reaction came from @entity120 , who runs a global management consultancy , 20 - first , that helps companies achieve greater gender balance
in a recent @entity126 article , @entity120 argues @entity8 is insulting women by suggesting they need to be more like men to succeed and even suggests she 's blaming them
" we 've never , in all of human history , seen a generation of brighter , better educated or more ambitious women , " she writes
" they have the keys
we just still have n't figured out how to adapt our organizations to optimize their talents
" but @entity8 explains her point is quite the contrary
" i 'm not telling women to be like men
i 'm telling us to evaluate what men and women do in the workforce and at home without the gender bias
" what 's more , @entity8 has also noticed it is women , not men who 've been most vocal about the book
@entity152 : 10 most powerful women in tech " most of the debate about " lean in " has been women , especially the first couple weeks before the book was out
the most surprising thing was that no man said a word
i could n't find a man writing a line , not saying a word
" @entity8 is n't just pointing out the stalled feminist revolution ; she also offers a solution with @entity167 , a not - for - profit foundation that will help spur change by offering women the ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals
funded by her book and corporate sponsors , the foundation will allow professional women to review social science research , share stories and receive online training and practical advice on career development -- to help women " take a seat at the table "
" @entity10 is not about fixing women
and it 's certainly not about any one person doing this on their own , " she asserts
" @entity10 is about all of us coming together to understand the stereotypes that are holding women back and fix them
and to start having an honest conversation about women in the workplace
