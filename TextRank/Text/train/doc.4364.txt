-- questions abound about how to best inoculate the world against swine flu as health officials plan for a campaign that could dwarf any previous flu vaccination effort
researchers in @entity8 sort through eggs for a swine flu vaccine
companies worldwide are working on vaccines
among the issues to be resolved are the amount of vaccine likely to be available , the timing of the vaccine 's availability , how it would be distributed , who would provide the shots , who would pay for them and whether it will be possible to track potential side effects
at a recent meeting at the @entity26 , health officials said @entity28 demand could reach 600 million doses of vaccine , enough for two doses for each of the approximate 300 million people in the @entity28
that 's in case two doses are required for children and adults under 50 , @entity26 representatives said
that would come on top of the 115 million doses of seasonal flu that are distributed annually , health officials said friday
although there has been no official decision to undertake a major vaccination campaign , senior officials are hinting strongly that they would recommend such an effort
@entity50 passed a supplemental appropriation for $ 7.5 billion , which president @entity52 recently signed , to cover the costs of preparing for the virus , which includes a vaccination campaign , @entity26 spokesman @entity49 said
small studies in ferrets at the @entity26 suggest that when compared with seasonal flu , the virus appears to cause more severe disease but also seems to spread less easily
ferrets are often used in flu research because the animal 's respiratory tract responds to flu viruses in much the same way as a human 's
still , it 's too soon to draw any conclusions , said @entity71 , director of the @entity26 's influenza division
more detailed results will be published in the journal @entity75 this week
the @entity76 declared the virus , also known as the novel influenza a ( @entity78 ) , a global pandemic june 11
more than 70 countries have reported cases of human infection with the virus , and more than 70,000 cases have been documented worldwide , according to the @entity76
there are 27,717 cases in the @entity28 , according to the @entity26
as the first pandemic strain to emerge since 1968 , the novel @entity78 virus has attracted interest from pharmaceutical companies around the world
samples have been sent to dozens of potential vaccine makers , said @entity94 , lab team leader for the novel @entity78 response at the @entity26
most vaccine production will involve the traditional route of growing a modified virus in eggs , but demand is so high that newer methods are getting a serious look
one comes from a small company called @entity104 , based in @entity105 , @entity106 , which recently received a $ 35 million contract from the @entity28 @entity108 to pursue a new vaccine technology
" the technology has advanced in recent years to a point that we believe it could help meet a surge in demand for @entity28 - based vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu , " hhs secretary @entity110 said in a statement last week
the company is producing 100,000 doses of vaccine per week , said @entity121 , ceo of @entity104 the technology involves caterpillar ovary cells , which were isolated 20 years ago , and a virus called baculovirus that infects insects but does not harm humans , @entity121 said
scientists inject a protein of the novel @entity78 virus into the baculovirus , which can multiply quickly in insect cells
making large quantities of this vaccine is faster than with traditional production methods because the basic cells are able to be frozen and stored , the company said in a statement
@entity104 will have the vaccines ready for use in clinical trials in a month , @entity121 said
they will also be ready for human use if the @entity145 issues an emergency authorization to start distributing swine flu vaccines
" we 'll be paving the way for everybody , because the data that 's generated in those trials will allow other people to get any idea of what it 's going to take , how to make an effective vaccine , " @entity121 said
but the researchers do not know what is the appropriate dose size for this vaccine or whether it should be given once or twice , he said
these are issues that may be resolved in clinical trials
a more established player in the vaccine arena is @entity166 , which could have vaccines for the novel h1n1 virus available for clinical investigation in humans this summer , spokeswoman @entity163 said
supplies could become available to public health authorities in four to six months , and the @entity145 is reviewing the final clinical trial design , she said
@entity174 , another large pharmaceutical company , announced june 12 that it had produced the first batch of @entity78 vaccine weeks ahead of expectations , using cell - based manufacturing technology
the company plans for clinical trials to start in july and expects licensure in the fall
abroad , the @entity184 's department of health has signed contracts with pharmaceutical giants @entity186 and @entity187
the advance purchase agreement allows for up to 130 million doses , but there is flexibility in the contract , spokesman @entity188 said
the @entity184 health department expects that 75 million doses will be produced before the end of the year , with the first supplies arriving in august , @entity188 said
@entity186 spokesman @entity198 said his company 's first doses are expected to be available in four to six months
@entity187 has just gone into full - scale production of its novel @entity78 vaccine and is hoping to deliver it for clinical trials as early as july , said @entity205 , spokesperson for the company
the clinical work for this vaccine is based on the @entity210 avian flu , she said
" the clinical trials [ part ] is a little tricky , given that this is a brand new virus , " she said
" no one has done clinical trials with this particular virus
" in planning , @entity28 health officials are taking into account the experience of the 1976 swine flu vaccine campaign , which strove to immunize against the strain found at @entity223 , @entity224
more than 40 million people received the vaccine before the campaign ended because some recipients developed @entity230 syndrome , which causes temporary paralysis
there 's still no good working theory on what caused it , @entity71 said
comparisons between the two episodes are limited in value , she said , because genetic analysis shows that the current @entity78 virus is very different from the 1976 swine flu virus
