the parents of @entity1 , the @entity2 soldier held captive by @entity3 for more than five years , left their protest tent outside prime minister @entity6 's office wednesday , thanking their supporters before heading home
" our happiness will be filled with concern until @entity1 returns , " his mother @entity9 said , a day after @entity6 said a deal had been made to free him in exchange for more than 1,000 @entity13 prisoners
" it is clear that we wo n't be getting back the same boy
but the best professional people in @entity2 will be made available to help us , " she said after she and her husband @entity19 met president @entity20
they did not take down the protest tent they erected more than a year ago to draw attention to their son 's plight
@entity1 is expected to return to @entity2 within a few days , @entity6 said tuesday night , before the @entity29 voted in emergency session 26 - 3 in support of the swap
all @entity2 feel powerful emotions about @entity1 , said @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity35 , @entity34
" he really is the child of us all , " @entity34 said , noting that almost all @entity2 do military service
" seeing @entity1 coming home ... is really coming home to every family
but at the same time it 's very bittersweet , " he said , since " every one of us in some way has been touched by terrorism
" @entity6 said tuesday that the government would " return @entity1 healthy and whole to his family and all of @entity2
" " the negotiations were difficult
... we had to make difficult decisions but ( the ) correct one
with all the change taking place in the @entity54 we did not know if a better deal or any deal would have been possible
" @entity6 said on @entity57 that the " arduous negotiations " brokered through @entity62 mediators resulted in a deal last thursday and it was signed formally by @entity2 and the @entity13 on tuesday
in a speech broadcast on @entity3 - run @entity65 television , exiled @entity3 leader @entity66 said the prisoner exchange will involve the release of 1,027 @entity13 prisoners , including women
" the deal will happen in two stages -- the first stage the release of 450 @entity13 prisoners , including 315 @entity13 prisoners that have one or many life sentences and the ones who are with high sentences
the second stage will include 550 @entity13 prisoners , " he said
@entity3 is the militant @entity13 movement that controls @entity84
of the 450 @entity13 prisoners to be freed during the first stage , 110 will go to the @entity87 while 40 will go abroad , according to @entity88 , @entity6 's spokesman
the 550 prisoners scheduled to be released during the second stage will be freed two months later , he said
according to @entity88 , jailed @entity13 lawmaker @entity90 is not among the prisoners @entity2 has agreed to release
palestinians captured @entity1 in june 2006 after tunneling into the jewish state and attacking an @entity2 army outpost
@entity2 immediately launched a military incursion into @entity84 to rescue @entity1 , then 19 , but failed to free him
since then , he has been held incommunicado by @entity3
in october 2009 , @entity3 released a tape of @entity1 to prove he was still alive in exchange for the release of a number of @entity13 prisoners being held in @entity2 jails
since then , there has been no proof of life
there have been ongoing attempts to broker a deal to release @entity1 , but all had failed .
