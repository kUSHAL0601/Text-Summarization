@entity0 , @entity1 -- this old @entity4 city is still waking up when the first members drift into the church basement
they turn on the lights , pull metal chairs across the wooden floor and settle in with paper cups of coffee and the weight of the week
there 's work or not enough work
tonight 's dinner and tomorrow 's , too
parents in prison , neighbors just getting out
kids who want some faraway , high - cost college and kids who do n't want to get out of bed on sundays
then there 's money -- always , forever money -- to think about
they 've heard weekly sermons about how to plan , overcome and grow , but the lessons really start to apply in bible study , like today , when they 'll pore over a line and relate it back to the messy , wonderful business of living
worry is nothing new for the congregation at @entity39 , which is well into its third century and one of the oldest black congregations in the @entity42
but this is a loving congregation , they say , and always the type to take action when times are hard
of course they will feed the hungry , clothe the naked and teach the young , but they also want to preserve their space
members say it was the first brick structure in @entity1 that was built , used and owned by black people , that it 's their own living history of slavery , civil rights and freedom
it 's just so much
" this is not new for us , " says @entity59 , a lifetime member and 7 a.m. bible study regular
" there 's just more needs
" so , with darkness pouring in the windows and a long day still ahead , the rev. @entity65 sits in his folding chair and reminds his followers of the @entity71 passage he repeats most , from the book of @entity73 : " but seek first the kingdom of @entity75 and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added to you
" as they all know , it has worked for this congregation before
faith first , then freedom more than 150 years ago , slaves built this church by fire and moonlight
they raised the walls with clay and sand blocks known as @entity90 , and a white ceiling patterned after a nine - patch quilt , a symbol of safety from slavery
after the first bible study of the day , @entity96 explains this to a small tour group seated in the church 's curved oak pews
he was baptized in @entity39 's chilly pool at age 7 and began giving tours as a teen
he 's 22 now , one semester shy of graduation from @entity107
he learned the church 's history through a thousand sermons and older members ' memories
several times a week , he leads tours of each level , and shares everything he knows
he talks about the earliest church leaders , who were whipped and harassed by white residents who balked at the idea of a black preacher
he tells of schisms that divided the flourishing black congregation
he explains that in the 1830s , a white congregation planned to move to a new location , and offered its land and an aging wooden building to @entity39
the price was $ 1,500
most of the church members were slaves , whose labor fueled @entity0 's agriculture and shipping economy
but many could earn money of their own by working after - hours or taking odd jobs
some could save enough to buy freedom for themselves and their families
so , they faced a choice , @entity96 says : use money saved to free themselves , or pool their funds to purchase a church for all
he imagines that they read the line from @entity73 , about seeking @entity75 's kingdom first ; he knows that within a few months , they came up with the money , and the church was theirs
but the building was already deteriorating when @entity153 moved in
by the 1850s , @entity0 was a growing city of 14,000 free residents and 7,000 slaves
the pastor championed a new structure , one made of brick , one made to last
this very building , @entity96 says
he points out the handiwork of members who toiled through the night from 1855 to 1859
they designed a tall sanctuary , balcony seating and pews with ancient @entity39 languages carved into the sides
perhaps their best plan was mostly out of view , @entity96 explains as he leads visitors down stairs and into the basement
beneath the wooden floor , builders left a space four feet tall , large enough to hide hundreds of slaves following the @entity180 to freedom
they punctured holes in the floor in the cross-and - diamond shape of an @entity39 prayer symbol , the @entity182 , and publicly worshipped its ancient meaning
quietly , underneath , runaways worshipped the light and air the symbols allowed
" you 're talking about working 12 to 16 hours , then turning around to come build a church at nighttime and going back to work on fields after that , " he tells the tour group
" if i can say so , that 's a lot of hard work , and a lot of dedication to the task at hand
" most of the builders were still enslaved after the church doors opened , but freedom came to them a few years later , anyway , through the @entity209
@entity96 repeats the passage from @entity73 again , " all things shall be added
" " that was no coincidence , " he tells the crowd
the pastor interrupts the tour to invite the guests to stay
there 's another bible study at noon , and everyone is welcome here
rebuilding the church " do we see ourselves as programmers , or do we see ourselves as builders ? " the pastor asks
it 's time for the evening bible study , and the crowd has outgrown the basement
they 're sitting in pews in business suits and blue jeans ; @entity65 is in the same suit he started the day in 12 hours before
they murmur the question , wondering what trick he has thrown at them
he asks again : programmers , doing service as a thoughtless habit ? or builders , serving to edify their church and its mission in the community ? since @entity65 took over in 1982 , he has simplified how people worship
he encouraged members to decentralize ministries and take the lessons from church into their everyday lives
he wants them to consider the community 's needs and use their talents to serve the church , whether they 're passing out water at football games , teaching a seminar about financial planning or leading a church tour
this will never be a church that has to look far for service projects , @entity65 says
he needs only look at their building
it needs a kitchen ; the old one was removed to make wheelchair - accessible bathrooms
they want to replace the steeple with a 100 - foot replica of the original , which was knocked down by a hurricane about a century ago
they want to rip the stucco off the exterior and preserve those old gray bricks , then build a museum out back to teach thousands of visitors who take their tour every year
it will cost millions , and nobody wants to spend a dime till they can do it without debt
in @entity0 , a city where history now drives much of the economy , they 're likely to get community support
still , @entity39 - @entity42 spaces have long fallen behind others
where there are well - preserved plantation mansions , slave quarters are often long gone
aging churches all over the country are at risk , too -- there will always be other worries and other causes that need to be funded first
but there 's no ignoring history , and especially faith , the pastor believes
" just the fact that we 're in this building is a constant reminder of where @entity75 has blessed us , " @entity65 says
" those who were enslaved were able to build a sanctuary , an edifice like this , that 's built four - brick deep , that 's meant to stand for the ages -- surely we can keep it up
surely , we can do other great and wonderful things in this day and time , regardless of how the economic times are
" we are builders , he tells the congregation , and builders must have plans .
