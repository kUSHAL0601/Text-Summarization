-- when @entity2 , the voice " assistant " on the @entity4 , made its debut in 2011 , it was welcomed as futuristic way to interact with our gadgets
you could ask it simple questions , banter and flirt , or launch applications with one push of a button and without slogging through touchscreen menus
two years later , @entity18 is giving @entity2 a major overhaul as part of wednesday 's upgrade to its @entity23 mobile operating system , and it 's marking the occasion by finally dropping @entity2 's " beta " label
( calling software beta usually means it is still a work in progress and that the company is ironing out any bugs
) what else has changed in the full - fledged , non-beta @entity2 ? the most obvious update is that it has added an option for a male voice
@entity4 owners in the @entity36 already had a male @entity2 voice , but this is the first time it will be available in @entity39 and @entity40 , with more languages expected to get their own male versions in the near future
hands - on impressions of the new @entity4 the voice gender can be swapped on the phone by going to @entity2
the female voice has also been improved to sound a little more natural
though @entity2 's new male voice is a few octaves lower , the words and answers seem to stay the same
@entity53 still has the same canned responses to joke questions like " what are you wearing ? " ( " @entity66 glass and aluminum
@entity64 , huh ? " ) and the phrasing of its answers to real questions does n't seem to change between the male and female settings
visually , @entity2 has been overhauled so its design on the phone 's screen is more in line with @entity23 's flattened look
instead of a dark gray background sliding up from the bottom , it throws a translucent blurred background over whatever screen is on your phone when you launch @entity2
it shows a single wavy line that moves as it registers your voice
@entity2 has added @entity84 and @entity86 integration , so you can ask to see recent tweets about a hot news story or see the @entity86 entry for something specific without leaving the @entity2 interface
you can ask to see what 's trending on @entity84 , tweets for a specific hashtag , or simply , " what 's going on ? " new @entity4 hardware , software a boon for gamers @entity2 has also expanded its powers to include control of common @entity4 settings , something that was noticeably missing in beta @entity2
you can now turn settings like @entity107 and @entity108 on and off , change your screen brightness , turn on @entity110 or view a specific app 's settings
if you use the new @entity114 feature , you can vocally express your enthusiasm or displeasure with specific songs to customize music stations
one of the biggest challenges facing new @entity2 is some serious competition from @entity121
slowly and with less fanfare , @entity121 has been building up its own powerful natural - language voice search in recent years
although it lacks a catchy anthropomorphic name , @entity124 takes on many of the same tasks as @entity2
in addition to typical @entity121 search results , it pulls answers from @entity132 , @entity133 and other @entity121 accounts the way @entity2 does from the e-mail , contacts and calendar apps on the @entity4
@entity124 is less chatty , but by cutting out extra words it is sometimes faster to return an answer
it can not be used to control phone settings or launch applications on an @entity4 , but if you are a @entity146 user it is a legitimate alternative for tasks like calendaring
the competition between the two companies helps explain the new @entity2 's most unfortunate change
@entity2 has dropped @entity121 as its default search engine of choice and switched to @entity155 's @entity154
when a question ca n't be answered by @entity2 itself or a @entity86 entry , it will pull up web results from @entity154 directly in @entity2
unlike in @entity161 , there 's no way to switch the default search engine to @entity121
keeping answers in @entity2 does save time , however
previously a @entity2 web search would launch @entity121 in @entity161 , requiring you to unlock the phone
but do n't dismay , @entity121 fans
you can still ask @entity2 to " @entity121 " something , and it will launch @entity161 and do a regular @entity121 search
opinion : give @entity18 your fingerprint ? it 's your call
