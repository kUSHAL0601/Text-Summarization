@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's strategic bombers have resumed the @entity7 's @entity6 practice of flying long - haul missions to areas patrolled by @entity10 and the @entity11 , generals said on thursday
a @entity1 @entity13 bomber , the type of plane used on long - range sorties into areas patrolled by @entity10
a @entity1 bomber flew over a @entity11 military base on the @entity20 island of @entity21 on wednesday and " exchanged smiles " with @entity11 pilots who had scrambled to track it , said maj. gen. @entity25 , head of long - range aviation in the @entity1 air force
" it has always been the tradition of our long - range aviation to fly far into the ocean , to meet [ @entity11 ] aircraft carriers and greet [ @entity11 pilots ] visually , " @entity25 told a news conference
" yesterday we revived this tradition , and two of our young crews paid a visit to the area of the [ @entity11 @entity38 ] base of @entity21 , " he said
president @entity40 has sought to make @entity1 more assertive in the world
@entity40 has boosted defense spending and sought to raise morale in the armed forces , which were starved of funding in the chaos that followed the fall of the @entity7
@entity25 said the sortie by the two turboprop @entity50 bombers , from a base near @entity52 in the @entity53 , had lasted for 13 hours
the @entity13 , codenamed " @entity13 " by @entity10 , is @entity1 's @entity6 icon and may stay in service until 2040
" i think the result was good
we met our colleagues -- fighter jet pilots from [ @entity11 ] aircraft carriers
we exchanged smiles and returned home , " @entity25 said
@entity11 officials told @entity63 , however , that the two bombers came no closer than 100 miles to any @entity11 aircraft and no closer than 300 miles to the @entity67 ships , and that there was no visual contact
@entity70 , @entity0 office director of the @entity72 - based @entity71 , said he saw nothing extraordinary in @entity0 sending its bombers around the globe
" this practice as such never stopped , it was only scaled down because there was less cash available for that , " he said
" it does n't cost much to flex your muscles ... you can burn fuel flying over your own land or you can do it flying somewhere like @entity21 , in which case political dividends will be higher
" the bombers give @entity1 the capability of launching a devastating nuclear strike even if the nuclear arsenals on its own territory are wiped out
during the @entity6 , they played elaborate airborne games of cat - and - mouse with @entity97 air forces
lt. gen. @entity98 , air force chief of staff , said the @entity99 would have to come to terms with @entity1 asserting its geopolitical presence around the globe
" but i do n't see anything unusual , this is business as usual ... like it is normal for the @entity11 to fly from its continent to @entity21 or , say , the island of [ @entity111 ] @entity110 , " @entity98 said , referring to a remote @entity104 atoll used as a military base by the @entity11 on wednesday , young pilots of strategic bombers passed a series of tests , including missile launches
" we fired eight cruise missiles , and all hit bull 's eye , " @entity98 said
he said one crew had taken off from @entity121 in southwestern @entity1 , hit a target in the north and then flown thousands of kilometers before finally landing in the @entity53
@entity121 is home to @entity1 's supersonic @entity126 strategic bombers , in service since 1987 and codenamed " @entity130 " by @entity10 while called " @entity129 " by @entity1 pilots
the generals said under @entity40 long - range aviation was no longer hindered by a lack of fuel , the aircraft enjoyed better maintenance and the crews much higher wages -- not the least because the @entity140 leader once made a five - hour sortie as part of a " @entity129 " crew
" the president learned about the pilots ' work the hard way , " @entity98 said
" this one flight yielded an awful lot
