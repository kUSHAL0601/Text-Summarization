@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 may not pull in the same number of tourists as its safari - toting neighbors
but that does n't make the country any less special
nicknamed the " @entity8 " for its friendly locals and temperate weather , @entity1 has a wealth of offerings that make it an attractive travel destination in its own right
flames of fire @entity1 means " flames of fire " in the local language -- a term that partly refers to the country 's stunning sunsets
" describing a sunset is like asking you to describe humanity , because it comes in so many forms , " says @entity24 , owner of local yacht - rental company @entity25
" one day you can look at it , and it seems sad
the next day , it 's happy
the next day , intense
the next day , it 's slow
a lot of the time , it 's very romantic , " he adds
@entity1 's many natural wonders -- from the azure waters of @entity41 to the dramatic rock formations of @entity43 -- are made more picturesque when bathed crimson with the help of the setting sun. one thing 's for sure : your travel pics will look amazing
@entity1 though @entity1 is landlocked , its namesake lake makes up more than three - quarters of the country 's eastern border
at nearly 30,000 square kilometers , @entity1 is the third largest lake in @entity53 , and the ninth biggest in the world
a @entity56 , it is also home to over 1,000 species of fish -- 99 % of them unique to the region
" it 's like an evolutionist 's holy grail , because a lot of the species have sort of evolved over the years from a single species into various different sub-species , " says @entity24
he notes that the lake makes for an incredibly popular enclave with scuba divers and snorkelers
" there 's a dive site just north of here called @entity77 , and it 's an incredible dive
you can dive there 50 times and not do the same dive twice , " he says
catching the ' big five ' @entity1 only recently got in the game of introducing visitors to the " big five " ( the @entity86 became the first safari park in 2012 after a nine - year and $ 2.5 million drive to restock the park with big game )
while it has yet to draw the level of numbers seen in nearby @entity93 and @entity94 , this just makes for a more tranquil safari experience
" we have over 2,000 hippos just in this area and 360 species of birds , " says @entity96 , a wilderness safari guide at @entity98
the park , a protected area , also houses more than 500 elephants
paging dr. @entity107 one of @entity1 's great claims to fame is its connection to @entity112 explorer @entity107 , who in the mid- 1800s led the legendary @entity113 through the area
today , visitors can follow in his footsteps
" the @entity117 is very special to dr. @entity107 's history
when we read the histories , we find he sailed through this river to @entity1 , " says @entity96
visitors curious about @entity107 's history can also visit the @entity124 -- founded by one of the doctor 's disciples
the site offers beautiful views of @entity1 , and is perched near a scenic eco-lodge
living @entity131 compared to other , similarly scenic travel destinations , @entity1 has remained relatively undeveloped
of the 15 million people that call the country home , 85 % live in rural areas
in many of @entity1 's more isolated villages , life assumes a more traditional track
many villagers live in huts constructed from brick , mud and grass , and agriculture makes up much of the day - to - day
in addition to growing tobacco , tea , coffee and sugar , @entity148 also grow maize , which makes up a large part of their diet
it is also the main ingredient in entoba , or sweet beer
" in the village , it 's expensive to buy @entity165 , so instead we make our own here , " explains @entity161 , leader of @entity162
" it 's sweet , just like soda
