in a brief statement , the @entity6 confirmed @entity8 , 60 , died on sunday after spending the weekend in hospital because of his " health condition
" he collapsed just two days after being appointed to the job
the ministry did not disclose any further details about what had happened
@entity15 closes @entity4 plants after protests previously a deputy minister for foreign affairs , @entity8 was due to replace the current @entity3 envoy in @entity22 , 72 - year - old @entity19 , in the coming weeks amid heightened tensions between @entity3 and @entity4
the @entity3 government 's recent purchase of a set of disputed islands in the @entity27 from a private owner has angered @entity22 , which has called the acquisition " illegal and invalid
" @entity31 islands dispute : who claims what ? on friday @entity4 sent six surveillance vessels to carry out patrols around the remote islands , which @entity3 calls @entity37 and @entity4 calls @entity37 , in an effort to underscore its claim to sovereignty
the ships briefly entered @entity3 territorial waters despite warnings not to do so , the @entity41 said
the dispute also hit a nerve with many ordinary @entity4 , as tens of thousands took to the streets at the weekend to protest against @entity3 's stance
in @entity22 , @entity3 's embassy was attacked with eggs and bottles , while angry mobs in other cities across @entity4 ransacked @entity3 businesses and burned @entity3 - made cars
@entity57 : caught in @entity59 protest though @entity3 officials have sought to play down the significance of the deal to buy the islands , the dispute has come to represent what many @entity4 people see as unfinished business : redressing the impact of the @entity3 occupation of large swathes of eastern @entity4 during the 1930s and 1940s
@entity4 says its claim goes back hundreds of years
@entity3 says it saw no trace of @entity4 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity3 sovereign territory in 1895
@entity3 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers
the @entity3 surrender at the end of @entity84 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further
the islands were administered by the @entity88 occupation force after the war
but in 1972 , @entity90 returned them to @entity3 as part of its withdrawal from @entity95
@entity1 's @entity96 contributed to this report .
