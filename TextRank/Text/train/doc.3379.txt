-- the young man 's call echoed throughout the remote village in northern @entity4 -- the marriage ceremony was about to begin
@entity6 and his wife wait for @entity9 drugs at a hospital in @entity4
under the dusty sun , the fathers of the bride and groom agreed to the marriage and this ancient @entity17 tradition proceeded as it has for hundreds of years
but unknown to the gathered villagers , the couple is hiding a modern secret
both bride and groom are @entity23 - positive and marrying with the support of a local government program that encourages such " hiv - marriages " in the hope of preventing the virus from spreading
after the ceremony and away from the village , the husband agreed to speak with @entity0 as long as he was not identified
" the woman i marry loves me -- i love her , " he said
" and we promised that we can keep ourselves healthy and clean
" according to the @entity36 , @entity4 has the third - largest @entity23 population in the world , with about 3.1 percent of its 148 million people infected
officials working for the @entity42 for the @entity43 , known as @entity44 , hope to put a dent in those numbers -- not just by treating hiv - positive people with free antiretroviral drugs but , they say , by helping more than 100 hiv - positive couples marry
the agency offers to pay for the dowry , provide counseling and even employment within the agency
@entity44 officials hope that , by keeping hiv - positive couples together , they will keep @entity57 from spreading to anyone not infected
" if someone having @entity23 marries another @entity57 person , that means there will be no @entity23 transmission to another negative person , " said @entity59 , the @entity44 chairman
however , @entity66 , the @entity36 agency tackling @entity23 and @entity57 , has its doubts , arguing such marriages do not prevent the spread of @entity57
" there are better methods to address the prevention of @entity23 and @entity57 rather than encouraging that kind of union , " said @entity70 , the @entity66 @entity4 coordinator
" we have made it very clear from @entity66 that the best way to address hiv infection is universal access to prevention , treatment and care
" there is no evidence that such marriages stop the spread of @entity57
however , for many of the couples , the marriages support their personal fight against @entity57 and the stigmatization it often brings from society , friends and family
that stigmatization can lead hiv - positive people to become outcasts , discriminated against and sometimes physically abused
queuing for their antiretroviral drugs at a local hospital , @entity6 and his wife said they married last year and have since had a child
" before , i was lonely , " @entity6 said
" being with my wife , i feel great -- because we stay together , we discuss different issues together
" for those couples who decide to have children , @entity44 tries to reduce the odds that the child will be born infected with @entity23 by ensuring that the parents have antiretroviral agents and medical advice
still , the decision to have a child is a controversial one when the parents who decide to do so are sick and unlikely to be able to raise the child .
