more than 1.7 million children in conflict - torn areas of eastern @entity2 face an " extremely serious " situation , the @entity6 children 's agency has warned , with their suffering exacerbated by harsh winter weather
many families have been forced from their homes and lack access to safe water , sanitation and schooling
" children continue to bear the brunt of this conflict , with schooling disrupted and access to basic services limited , " said @entity16 - @entity15 , @entity17 regional director for @entity18 and @entity19 and @entity20
she called for extra resources to be provided to those in need
" extremely harsh winter conditions have made the impact of the crisis more acute , " she said
government forces and @entity35 rebels have been battling for control of eastern @entity38 and @entity39 regions since april , after @entity40 annexed @entity2 's southeastern @entity42 region the previous month
according to a @entity17 press release friday , 147 schools have been closed in parts of the @entity38 region where fighting is ongoing , disrupting the education of about 50,000 children since september 1
while some schools are in ruins , others are closed because of safety concerns
in government - controlled areas , 187 educational institutions in total have been damaged or destroyed , @entity17 said
the closures mean that besides lessons , children are missing out on the stability and routine that can be provided by school at a time of crisis , helping to alleviate their stress , the agency said
more than 1 million displaced it 's not just those still living in conflict areas who are affected
since march , more than 1 million people have been displaced by the fighting , including nearly 530,000 within @entity2
of those , at least 130,000 are children , according to @entity17
in many cases they are not attending a new school because their parents have not registered them , anticipating further displacement or planning to return home
@entity17 says it needs $ 32.4 million to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of 600,000 children and their families in @entity2
the funds would help provide access to schooling ; enable support to reduce children 's high levels of stress ; pay for polio vaccines ; and ensure 250,000 children and women get safe water and hygiene supplies to prevent outbreaks of disease
the agency has received $ 9.4 million in funding and pledges to date
amid the fighting , at least 44 children have been killed in @entity2 this year , according to the agency
pressure on @entity105 while @entity2 's civilian population suffers , there is little sign of progress in reaching a diplomatic resolution to the crisis
western powers accuse @entity40 of sending troops and equipment to help the separatists in their fight against @entity2 government forces and have imposed repeated rounds of economic sanctions against @entity40 interests in a bid to put pressure on @entity105
but president @entity122 appears to have little appetite to repair relations with the @entity125 , despite his country 's tanking economy
@entity122 told reporters gathered in @entity105 on thursday that his country was ready to mediate in the @entity2 crisis
he also denied that @entity40 killed in @entity2 were members of his country 's military , repeating the long - standing @entity40 line that any @entity40 fighting in @entity2 were volunteers
a ceasefire deal was reached september 5 in @entity136 , @entity137 , after talks between representatives of @entity2 's government , @entity40 and rebel leaders in eastern @entity2
a subsequent agreement on september 19 in @entity136 set out more measures
but fighting in @entity2 has since resumed , with a @entity145 security official last month telling @entity146 that the conflict had returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire
military spokesman @entity150 said during a televised briefing friday that five @entity2 soldiers had been killed and seven wounded in the past 24 hours
militants , including snipers , fired on @entity2 positions using rifles and small arms , said @entity150 .
