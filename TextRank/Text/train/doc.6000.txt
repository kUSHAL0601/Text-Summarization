-- @entity3 rebels are prepared to release 10 hostages on monday and wednesday , officials said
the @entity5 , or @entity5 , had announced the impending release of the 10 -- the last of the government hostages they hold -- in february , and since then has been negotiating details of the release
monday and wednesday have been designated as the two days for the hostage releases , said @entity12 , head of the @entity14 delegation
" we know the families and the loved ones of all these people have been waiting for so long : 12 , 13 , 14 years , and now is a very difficult moment , a moment of nervousness , " he said
" our main message to them is to be patient for two or three more days because this is an extremely complex operation where many people are involved and the key point of it all is to do it in a safe way , security is an extremely important to us
" @entity30 helicopters will arrive in @entity3 on sunday and will be used in the operation , he said
support from the @entity14 will not end with the reuniting of the hostages with their families , @entity12 said
psychological support , both for the families and the hostages who have been captive in the jungle for more than a decade , is very important , he said
the story does n't end with the hostages ' release because " after so many years of separation , there is still a lot to do to help them overcome the trauma of this period of time that they have not been together , without news , to help them reintegrating into society , " he said
the leftist rebels have been at war with the @entity3 government since the 1960s
while severely weakened in recent years , the group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces
in february , the @entity5 announced that it was releasing the hostages , and would stop kidnapping civilians for money
it did not address the fate of its civilian captives , nor did the group renounce kidnapping for political purposes
@entity0 's @entity67 and journalist @entity68 contributed to this report .
