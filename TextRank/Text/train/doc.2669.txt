@entity0 -- there 's little doubt which country @entity4 is targeting under its immigration scheme for the super-wealthy ; the investment visa is called sub-class 188 and its permanent visa is called sub-class 888
in @entity12 , the number eight is culturally associated with wealth , prosperity and good fortune and rich @entity12 nationals have been queuing up for the opportunity to live in @entity4 under the millionaire visa program
since the scheme was launched in november 2012 , 91 % of the 545 applicants for the visas have been @entity12 nationals , according to figures from the @entity4 @entity24
so far , @entity4 has granted 65 ' significant investor ' visas to mainland @entity12
the requirements for getting one of the highly prized visas are simple : all you need is a clean criminal record and $ a5 million ( $ us4.37 million ) to invest
there is no language requirement , upper age limit and applicants do not even have to set up a business in @entity4
those able to park their a $ 5 million investment in @entity4 -- complying investments include government bonds , managed funds and @entity4 proprietary companies - for more than four years can apply for a permanent visa
under the scheme , visa holders can keep their operations running in @entity12 if they wish
it 's hoped that the move will attract a greater range of immigrants to @entity4
@entity51 partner and global immigration leader @entity50 told the @entity53 the days of @entity12 investors coming to @entity4 simply to start a corner store or a small business were over
" @entity4 is now looking to attract a larger scale of investment to feed a greater level of infrastructure development , " @entity50 said
according to a report by professional services company @entity64 , the patterns of @entity12 investment are beginning to change , with more private @entity12 investors expanding their interests in the country
the report said that while @entity12 state - owned enterprises ( @entity69 ) accounted for 64 % by value of the amount invested in @entity4 agriculture between 2006 - 2012 , @entity12 private investment accounted for 70 % of the deal volume
" @entity12 companies are playing a more active role compared to other sectors such as mining and gas , where @entity69 have dominated , " the report said
according to immigration specialists in @entity0 , @entity80 and @entity81 -- where property prices have risen 10 % and 6 % respectively over the past 12 months -- are the preferred destinations for mainland @entity12 immigrants
the chief executive officer of @entity86 , @entity85 , said that @entity12 buyers had boosted prices in certain sectors of the @entity4 property market
" in some suburbs 90 per cent of new product will sell to @entity12 buyers , " he told the @entity53
" i think it is quite centralised in certain pockets , so i do n't think it is doing great damage or harming local buyers ' opportunities to buy here still
" according to the @entity103 , the proportion of @entity4 immigrants born in @entity102 increased from 24 % in 2001 to 33 % in 2011
around 6 % of immigrants born overseas came from @entity12 -- the third largest group in @entity4
while this group , along with @entity107 , represented one of the fastest growing groups , it was still a long way behind immigration from the @entity113 , at 20 % , and @entity114 at 9.1 %
immigration has been a politically charged and emotive subject in @entity4 , where the conservative @entity117 won election last year partly on a platform of promising tougher policing of the country 's immigration laws
@entity4 turns away thousands of refugees and asylum seekers but at the same time is suffering a skills and manpower shortage for manual jobs .
