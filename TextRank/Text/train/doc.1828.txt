-- on the final episode of @entity5 's " @entity4 , " sunday night , @entity2 's @entity1 finally meets his broken - bad destiny , whatever that means
on the opening episode of the new season of @entity13 's " homeland , " the same night , @entity9 ' @entity8 is about to undergo another very tough stretch
what does it mean about television , and ourselves , that these two very volatile loners -- @entity1 , the former high - school chemistry teacher turned murderous meth manufacturer , and @entity8 , the bipolar @entity22 agent whose instincts are as good as her psyche is fragile -- have captured the pop - culture zeitgeist ? it could mean that , ever since @entity32 's " @entity31 " gave us permission more than a decade ago to embrace imperfect heroes , even anti-heroes , at the center of our tv dramas , it was only a matter of time , and a few short steps , before we could empathize with cancer - ridden @entity1 and , on " homeland , " @entity37 ' ( literally ) tortured @entity38
we were led here in impressive increments : @entity42 ' @entity41 in @entity44 's " @entity43
" @entity46 in @entity44 's " @entity45
" lots of flawed characters on @entity50 's " @entity49 , " fx 's " @entity51 " and other quality tv dramas
but really , credit the writers and the performers , and directors and other crew members , of these two dramas for raising the bar so high that their shows have become essential topics of conversation
at a time of ever fragmenting viewership , when fewer people are watching television in " real time , " " @entity36 " and " @entity4 " continue to break through
" " homeland " hit a fever pitch its first season , and though it 's still strong , is not as dominant a conversational topic as it was its freshman year
" @entity4 , " on the other hand , built slowly , brilliantly
by the time it got to the midseason break of its final year , it seemed the bandwagon pulled up and everyone , absolutely everyone , climbed on
" @entity4 , " regardless of its audience levels on @entity5 ( another show from the network , " @entity87 , " draws almost twice as many viewers ) , is the show of the fall 2013 tv season
does n't matter what else is out there , or whether it 's on broadcast or cable
" @entity4 " is it
partly , this is because series creator @entity96 has promised , and scheduled , an actual ending -- an approach that @entity99 hit on in 1967 , when @entity50 gave producer @entity100 enough advance warning that his ongoing narrative drama , " @entity102 , " would not be renewed
@entity100 turned around and gave viewers the ending they 'd been waiting for
presto : in the dog days of august , that finale to " @entity102 " drew the biggest ratings in the history of television up to that time
since then , some of the most ambitious tv dramas have ended not with a bang or a whimper , but with a preconceived farewell ending
some were perfect , like @entity32 's " @entity117 " and @entity44 's " @entity43
" others were disappointing , like @entity50 's " @entity49 " and , most recently , @entity13 's " @entity119
" and some infuriated some while delighting others , like @entity122 's " @entity121 " and @entity32 's " @entity31
" but " @entity4 " may be in a category all its own
the last time , as a tv critic and as a viewer , i 've anticipated a television drama as eagerly as i have " @entity4 " was in the glory days of " @entity129 " at the dawn of the 1990s
back then , there was no internet as we know it to spread the word and parse every image and line of dialogue -- but some serious - minded fans did the pre-internet equivalent , and launched a monthly magazine devoted to " @entity129 , " called wrapped in @entity141 , the name derived from a key line of dialogue in the show
had the @entity132 not been around for " @entity4 , " we might have another magazine on our hands : yeah science , @entity149 ! instead , it is the very existence of new technology that has allowed new fans to find and embrace " @entity4 " so fervently , and to dive into " homeland " so completely
not only does the @entity132 , through fan and media sites , keep the focus on these shows and their ambitious story lines , but viewers can catch up by watching old episodes on streaming sites , or buying dvd sets
the constant , instant exposure helps , and so does the incessant media attention
but this infatuation with these dark dramas would n't occur if these tv series were n't as good as they are
before i saw the pilot episode of " @entity4 , " the written premise in the press release was so grim -- meek science teacher with pregnant wife and teen son learns he has terminal cancer , and starts making meth to provide a nest egg for his family -- i had never heard of a show i wanted to see less
now , as it reaches its conclusion , i ca n't think of a show i 've ever wanted to see more
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .
