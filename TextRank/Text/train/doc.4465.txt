-- if the best architecture aims at eternity , to paraphrase famed @entity5 architect @entity4 , then these new hotels are bound to be immortal
the 11 hotels on our list all opened within the last four years , and each is an example of awe - inspiring design in its own right
you can stay in a wave - like skyscraper in @entity15 , a stack of cantilevered cubes in @entity18 , or a hotel tucked into the wild cliffs of an @entity22 island
and , even better , it wo n't cost a fortune to spend a night in these architectural wonders
seven of the 11 are under $ 200 a night
see more photos of the hotels @entity28 ( @entity29 , @entity30 ) the two structures that make up the @entity28 each incline at a slightly different angle
or as the architects sweetly put it , the towers are drawn to each other , " yet seem a little shy
" in fact , the creative use of angles is employed both inside the property and out -- geometric angles give the exterior a filigreed look , while inside the hotel there are rooms where there are no 90 - degrees at all ( there are over 200 different room shapes in the 812 - room hotel )
the location , in the @entity29 neighborhood of @entity54 five miles from the city center , actually inspired the leaning - tower design
the buildings are so close to the airport that height restrictions dictate that they must not exceed 246 feet
011 - 45/3247 - 3000 , bellaskycomwell.dk , from $ 155 per night
jumeirah at @entity61 ( @entity62 ) @entity64 architecture firm @entity63 won the @entity66 's @entity65 for 2011 for this stunning $ 1 billion residential and retail center
the complex is made up of five towers on a beachside stretch on a peninsula in @entity62
constructing the buildings that now dominate the modern skyline posed structural challenges
the towers all curve , meaning each floor slab is a different shape
the 382 - room @entity80 hotel takes up 66 stories of one of the towers
888/645 - 5697 , @entity84 , from $ 192 per night
@entity0 : 12 elevators you have to see to believe @entity87 ( @entity88 , @entity89 ) perched atop a ridge , this collection of 10 freestanding , wood - clad modernist cubes , or " @entity92 " suites , opened in 2009
located in the rural mountain town of @entity98 ( a three - hour drive from both @entity100 and @entity101 ) , the sleek cubes create a beautiful juxtaposition with the groves of olive and almond trees that surround them
each suite has a sliding glass wall that opens onto a private terrace , and , inside , sparse interiors combine slate , copper - treated pine , and metal sheeting
the hotel incorporates some classic elements as well : a converted 14th - century hermitage serves as a communal area for guests

@entity119 ( @entity120 , @entity22 ) architect @entity121 designed this lodge to blend into the dramatic surroundings of @entity120
tucked back behind cliffs , the hotel opened in 2008 and consists of 21 suites cascading down a windswept slope , following the natural curve of the land , each with floor - to - ceiling glass walls and sweeping views of the @entity119
suites were constructed from lightweight materials -- steel screw piles , timber framing , iron cladding -- that could be carried in to create minimal disturbance to nature , and which also could handle the challenge of building on precarious soil conditions ( several feet of sand atop solid limestone )
inside are environmentally sound sandblasted limestone floors and recycled spotted - gum walls
the off - the - grid location led to innovations such as sculptural containers for collecting rainwater
931/924 - 5253 , southernoceanlodge.com.au , from $ 1,000 per person , per night with a two - night minimum @entity152 ( @entity153 ) this trio of 55 - story towers opened in 2010 and hold an incredible 2,561 hotel rooms , plus a museum , casino , convention center , waterfront promenade , shops , and restaurants
architect @entity163 has said that his challenge " was to create a vital public place at the district - urban scale - in other words , to address the issue of megascale and invent an urban landscape that would work at the human scale
" his way of dealing with that was to design the complex around two central axes to give a sense of orientation
the towers are connected at the top by the cantilevered , two - and - a - half - acre @entity181 , home to gardens , 250 trees , a public observatory and a 492 - foot swimming pool -- all perched high in the sky like a fantastical cruise ship forever suspended in midair
011 - 65/6688 - 8868 , @entity190 , from $ 350 per night
@entity0 : @entity66 's 16 most picturesque villages @entity192 ( @entity62 ) this 499 - room hotel was the first to be built straddling a @entity195 racetrack ( it opened in 2009 and was renovated in 2011 to become a @entity196 )
the structure consists of a pair of 12 - story towers joined by a sweeping , 700 - foot curvilinear skin of glass and steel -- actually 5,800 pivoting , diamond - shaped glass panels that reflect the sky by day and are illuminated up by an led system at night
the architects ' aim was to reflect artistry and geometries associated with ancient @entity211 art and craft traditions , and from a distance the panels create the appearance of a spectacular veil
888/622 - 4567 , viceroyhotelsandresorts.com ; from about $ 210 per night
@entity217 ( @entity218 , @entity219 ) the piece de resistance at this 414 - room hotel of white polished stone and rough black stone is its attached conference center -- a glass structure with an exterior made up of 13 miles of semi-transparent stainless steel rods
they reflect the sky and water , radically change the skyline , and are what architect @entity232 describes as " a reminiscence of the @entity234
" the interiors of the hotel , which opened in 2011 , follow straight lines and geometric precision
800/333 - 3333 , @entity239 , from $ 155 per night
@entity240 ( @entity241 , @entity18 ) the 88 - room @entity240 was a striking addition to the folkloric village of @entity241 do @entity244 when it opened in 2008
the exterior is made up of reflective aluminum , black glass , and green stone , and the cantilevered design changes the shape of the hotel depending upon your vantage point
the contrasting interior consists of white finishes and materials including wood and stone
it 's all edged by a shimmering outdoor pool and surrounded by views of the @entity262 and @entity263
011 - 351/258 - 802 - 000 , @entity264 , from $ 100 per night
@entity265 ( @entity266 ) the 10 - story @entity265 sits on the site of a former parking garage in @entity271 's @entity270 neighborhood
neighbors were likely pleased with the swap when the hotel opened in 2011
the building looks like a massive metal sculpture -- perfect for the gallery - filled neighborhood -- with floors connected by catwalks and wrapped with stainless - steel mesh
the industrial façade holds 56 rooms plus two restaurants , a lobby café and two basement bars ; for urban escape , there is a roof deck with a pool , bar , and peaceful garden terrace
212/216 - 0000 , hotel - americano.com , from $ 295 per night
@entity0 : 12 hot springs worth traveling for @entity294 ( @entity295 , @entity296 ) rising like a geometric spaceship in the @entity298 is this distinctive hotel made of concrete , sheet metal , violet glass , @entity303 , and stone
@entity305 opened in 2011 and is divided into three parts , one of which seems to levitate above the ground , plus two side wings containing the 44 rooms
the arrangement means that all of the rooms have views of the surrounding mountains
the striking hotel also has an impressive art collection , with works by @entity320 , @entity321 , and @entity296 sculptor @entity322
known for his large - scale installations , @entity324 's works here include an almost 30 - foot - tall stainless - steel man pushing against the exterior of the hotel
011 - 420/558 - 761 - 100 , www.miura.cz , from $ 126 per night
@entity331 ( @entity15 , @entity332 ) architect @entity333 literally made waves in a city full of iconic skyscrapers with her showstopper building
the 82 - story glass structure 's exterior has undulating concrete balconies resembling the swirls and ripples of nearby @entity343
such a unique design brought with it a unique construction challenge -- each floor plate is a different shape , which means a different concrete pour was required for every story
to manage it , the concrete was poured into a specially designed flexible metal edge that was reused over and over again -- an important detail for green architecture
much of the building is designated for private residences , but the 334 - room @entity355 opened on 18 floors in november 2011
