i pump the gas to the crest of the muddy hill , engine roaring
a sharp hairpin bend immediately requires a swift swing of the wheel , but the tires keep their grip and i bump my way down a steep incline of mud , rocks and tree roots
at the bottom i 'm greeted with a deep flooded section of track and as the vehicle plows through , a colossal splash of muddy water swamps the hood
through the swampy greenery of reeds and ferns , i feel , for a moment , like a khaki - clad explorer of the @entity26 , navigating the jungles of @entity28
in fact i 'm cruising in a brand new @entity30 , from @entity31 to @entity32 in the @entity33 , on day two of @entity30 's " @entity35 " tour , having kicked off in style with a night of world class luxury at the legendary @entity38
my mission is to become even more @entity40 than i already am , delving into my own culture with abandon , discovering the land and its history , in order that one day i might be able to order a " @entity51 , " play a game of croquet and use the word " chap " in a dozen different ways without sounding like a charlatan
if my lunch stop is anything to go by , it wo n't be long before i 'm ordering that quintessential @entity56 drink from a butler too -- after a pass of @entity59 and the @entity60 we pull up at the gilded gates of @entity63
5 must - play golf courses in the @entity65 @entity63 " welcome to the birthplace of @entity70 and residence of the @entity72 and @entity73 , " announces our host in a cut - glass accent
this 18th century @entity75 masterpiece is a @entity76 and despite a recent land - selling controversy , it remains a day trip destination that 'll tire the kids out nicely , with an adventure playground , maze and mini-train just some of the attractions besides the house tour and grounds
quickly , we 're whisked off for our victuals in the @entity88 , its colonial furniture and tropical decor harking back to a time when @entity40 really did rule the waves
a retired army colonel gazes at the exotic milieu , " ah , could be @entity96 1895 , " he muses wistfully
the days of the @entity97 live on in this corner of @entity99
strolling around the gardens , i do a mental check of my kit list for the next few days
@entity108 hound and a tweed deerstalker cap ? er.
. well , maybe that would be taking this whole aristocracy fantasy a bit far but it 's easy to get carried away on this trip
this is the @entity99 of @entity115 and @entity116 -- an exclusive tour through our green and pleasant land , staying in historic palaces , ancient manor houses and chocolate box villages along the route
traditional country pursuits are all part of the fun too , although nothing as contentious as fox hunting
and though i 'm doing this tour in that icon of @entity40 motoring , the @entity30 , it of course does n't take a @entity135 vehicle to negotiate the tarmac roads of southern @entity99
which is why we are heading for @entity32 , @entity30 's training and testing ground since 1962
the sumptuous castle will be our home for the next two days and when we 're not bouncing around on our antique four - poster beds or rubbing shoulders with suits of armor we 'll be out in the 5,000 - acre estate , putting our off - road driving skills to the test on a private network of forest tracks , steep hills , deep water and of course , this being @entity99 , plenty of mud
having " done the practical , " later we 'll find out how this car favored by @entity99 's land - owning elite is actually put together too
driving and discovery the @entity163 jacket and green wellies come into their own the following day as we stride out across the castle 's grounds , shotguns over our shoulders for our own version of the legendary hunting parties of the @entity173 and @entity174 age when shooting skills were considered the mark of a man , alongside horsemanship and a stiff upper lip
while no feathered friends are bagged ( just pigeons of the clay variety ) , we do get to hang with some top birds -- falcons
" now , this is real hunting , " says the falconer with pride
" people have been hunting with @entity189 in @entity99 for 1,200 years , since the @entity190 times
" never mind the history ; seeing these predators in action gives you a sense of the wild like few other things and its popularity is booming in the country
but we must n't dither , for after heading across country , stopping for a proper @entity99 cream tea and a night in the honey - stone village of @entity203 ( it really deserves a nicer name ) we arrive in @entity206 , the home of @entity30
this is where we get our petrol head on for the engineering tour of the plant plus a chance to drive some of the vintage vehicles , harking back to a time when men were men and @entity216 were workhorses
we 'd already run these machines through their paces at @entity32 , careering through flooded fields and up and down muddy hillocks on the test track -- and now we got to see how all that engineering was put together
from what was simply a riveted steel utility vehicle to today 's air - conditioned dream machine with computerized terrain response , the @entity30 really has come a long way since the first series 1 model rolled off the production line back in 1948
take it from me -- the men on the trip found it fascinating
shaking it all off of course , this being the @entity35 tour means it can end only one way -- with @entity240
we 're off to @entity241 to experience the genius of the @entity243 at the @entity244 with the added bonus of dinner on the theater 's rooftop restaurant and @entity249 and petit - fours during the interval
and did i mention that we have the best seats in the house ? a final day in the luxurious surroundings of the @entity255 on the @entity256 sees some of the group attend the famous @entity258
but for me , the fantasy is over
the last six days have been an immersion in elegance , excellence and impeccable good taste -- and a unique window into the grandeur of @entity40 's past
i hand over the keys to my @entity30 with a farewell pat , as i know it is unlikely we 'll ever be reacquainted , and make my way back to real life
where can one find a decent " @entity51 " ? the @entity273 of @entity40 ' tour runs from august 31 to september 8
prices from £ 3,995.00 ( $ 6,463 ) per person
@entity258 extension from £ 1,695
