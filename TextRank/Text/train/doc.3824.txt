and on tuesday , @entity6 died from what the @entity8 school said was " apparent meningitis
" her loss rattled many in the @entity3 community
while stating " proper medical precautions have been taken and members of the campus community do not need to take additional action at this time " to guard against meningitis , the school advised students on how and where they could get medical help
it also offered counseling for those grieving the loss of a fellow student and friend
" @entity32 gained an angel today i 'm going to miss you so much , " wrote one such friend on @entity6 's @entity31 page
that comment was underneath a message that appeared friday on @entity6 's @entity31 feed : " this is what dying must feel like
" responding later that day to someone 's question , @entity6 wrote " 105 fever i think i 'm dying
" school officials have not disclosed when , where or how @entity6 got sick , including whether it might have had anything to do with her education at @entity3
