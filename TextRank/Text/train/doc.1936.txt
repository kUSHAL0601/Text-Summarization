@entity0 -- with just 72 hours of calm under the current cease - fire , @entity2 are rushing to try to fix some of the worst of the destruction caused by the conflict in @entity0
among the most urgent problems : sewage pipes that have been spewing raw effluent for weeks , a lack of clean water and severe power shortages
aid groups are distributing basic supplies like mattresses and bottles of water
but as @entity2 and @entity20 officials hold indirect talks in @entity22 to seek a more lasting end to hostilities , residents of @entity0 are confronting the longer - term question of how the territory can rebuild
more than 60 construction industry companies , which provide crucial building materials , were hit by @entity20 strikes , according to @entity2 officials
' they destroyed our business ' @entity34 's factory made pavers for roads and concrete ready mix for buildings
" you ca n't rebuild @entity0 again until these kind of factories rebuild , " he said as he stood amid the building 's wreckage
@entity34 said he does n't know why his factory was a target -- he sold only to the @entity46 and aid groups
all of it , he said , was closely monitored by @entity20 authorities
the @entity20 military said it was looking into why the construction factory was hit
" we are not following @entity54 policies , we are following @entity20 policies , " @entity34 said
" they destroyed our business , they destroyed our factories
and they want peace ? how ? " last month , @entity20 began its offensive against @entity54 , the militant @entity63 group that holds power in @entity0 , in an effort to stop rocket fire across the border
it later sent in ground troops with the aim of destroying @entity54 ' network of tunnels , some of which extend into @entity20 and have been used to launch attacks
over 100,000 homeless the need for reconstruction following weeks of heavy fighting is pressing
the @entity80 estimates that 16,700 homes in @entity0 were destroyed or severely damaged in more than a month of fighting , leaving more than 100,000 people homeless
residents say @entity20 strikes flattened entire neighborhoods , like the one where @entity86 and his family lived
" i do n't even know where my house is , " he said
" where is the road ? where is my neighbor 's home ? " the @entity46 estimates that rebuilding the homes in the impoverished territory will cost more than $ 455 million
limits on imports the reconstruction issue plays into the talks in @entity22 between @entity20 and @entity2 delegations
@entity20 says the rebuilding of @entity0 should be linked with demilitarization of the territory , which @entity54 opposes
@entity54 says it wants , among other things , the lifting of @entity20 restrictions on the movement of people and goods in and out of @entity0
@entity20 authorities say the measures are necessary to prevent weapons being brought in
@entity20 limits imports of construction materials into @entity0
the @entity20 military says that @entity54 used much of the materials that were allowed in to build more tunnels rather than civil projects like schools , hospitals and libraries
@entity20 : halt to violence is key @entity20 would be willing to ease sanctions " if all aggression from @entity0 stops , " @entity20 government spokesman @entity124 said monday
" i believe if the @entity2 -- if @entity54 -- ceases violence , ceases to target @entity20 citizens , then anything is possible , " he said
the @entity2 delegation includes representatives from several factions , including @entity54 , @entity133 and @entity134 , the group that governs the @entity136
@entity54 officials have said the current round of @entity140 - mediated talks are crucial , suggesting it 's the last time they 'll be willing to participate
the truce began early monday and is due to end early thursday
talks during a previous 72 - hour cease - fire last week failed to yield a breakthrough
that truce ended friday with a resumption of attacks
the @entity46 said monday that 1,960 @entity2 have been killed during the conflict ; 71 % of them were civilians
@entity20 officials say 64 @entity20 soldiers died , and three civilians were killed
