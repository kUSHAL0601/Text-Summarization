@entity1 , @entity0 -- candles in hand and singing hymns , hundreds of @entity1 residents stunned by the discovery of 11 bodies in a local home gathered outside the house sunday night to remember the victims
but @entity12 , whose daughter @entity13 was among the dead , said she could barely stand to look at the home
" it 's hard , because i want to burn it down , " she said
" i know my baby was in there , and she got killed in there , " @entity12 added
" i know what other people feel like when they lost a child
i did n't , but i do now
that was my only daughter
" @entity27 , 31 , had three children , ages 2 , 4 and 6 , her mother said
she had last been seen in june
her body was among the first identified in the home of @entity32 , who is now facing five counts of aggravated murder , rape , felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths
all of those found dead were @entity43 - @entity42 women
a @entity45 judge has set bail at $ 5 million for @entity32 , a registered sex offender who served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape case
he was released from jail in 2005
" whenever i see him on tv or think about him , i have to pray , " @entity12 said
" because i believe that one day , i 'll have to forgive him for what he 's done
but right now , i ca n't , because i 'm numb
" about 500 people joined the march , which followed a packed memorial service at the neighborhood 's @entity57
the turnout " means that people do care , " @entity12 said
" there is a little compassion in the world
" @entity57 pastor @entity64 , who led the memorial service , called the @entity32 home a house of " horror
" " it brings trembling to the bones to think about what all went on right here , " he said
@entity32 has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney , according to @entity32 's public defender @entity76
a psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it 's unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury , the next expected step in the case
police recovered the first bodies after they went to @entity32 's home to follow up on a rape accusation
last month , neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor , but no charges were filed
neighbors called 911 after the october 20 incident
firefighters and paramedics responded , and later notified police
the woman told officers that she was at the home and " partying , " when she fell off the roof
@entity100 , the suspect 's half - brother , told @entity2 he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago
their stepmother , who lived in the house after @entity32 got out of prison , said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time , @entity100 said
the stepmother tried to get @entity32 evicted from the house in 2007 because he was n't paying rent , @entity100 said
@entity32 said he should n't have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father , who died in 2004 , and remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007 , his half - brother said
agents from the @entity119 's @entity121 are assisting @entity1 police , @entity1 @entity119 spokesman @entity118 said
the agents are preparing a profile of @entity32 for police , tracing his life and habits , and his dna will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes
@entity100 said he was aware of his half - brother 's prison record , but " just could n't fathom " the accusations now facing him
" i did n't think he was in that bad of a mental state , " @entity100 said
" you never think it would happen to your family
it 's a horrible feeling
" at 66 , @entity100 is 16 years older than his half - brother , and the two did n't meet until @entity32 was 9
he added , " he deserves whatever he gets from the justice system
" @entity2 's @entity142 and @entity143 contributed to this report .
