the @entity1 executive who delayed a flight over a bag of macadamia nuts may face legal action after @entity7 's transportation ministry said on tuesday it had filed a complaint to prosecutors
@entity11 , who resigned from her post last week , may be in violation of aviation safety laws , the ministry said , after she ordered the @entity16 - bound plane to turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed all because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class
testimonies of crew members and passengers confirm that @entity27 used " violent language in a loud voice , " which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight , the @entity23 said in a press release
although her role put her in charge of in - flight service , she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity
@entity27 , whose @entity7 name is @entity42 - ah , will report to the prosecutor 's office on wednesday , as part of an ongoing investigation
the airline also faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain 's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight , said the ministry
calling it quits @entity27 resigned last week from the airline 's catering and in - flight sales business , and from its cabin service and hotel business divisions , @entity1 said
but the 40 - year - old kept her title as a vice president of the national carrier , according to company spokesman
the company chairman , @entity67 , who is also her father , publicly apologized for the incident , saying that she will resign from the vice president job and positions held in affiliate companies
public outcry the incident , which took place last week at @entity77 's @entity76 , stirred anger among the @entity7 public
" she was one of the passengers , not the vice president of @entity1 at that moment
i 'm not sure what she was thinking , but it 's likely she was bossy and acted above her position , " @entity83 , a @entity7 resident , told @entity84
" it was an abuse of power , and a wrong action to take , " he said
angered internet users have condemned @entity27 for bringing about international embarrassment and shame to the country
they are calling for @entity1 to change its name to @entity97 in a petition on @entity99 , a popular @entity7 online discussion forum
@entity1 is owned by @entity7 's large family - owned corporations , known as @entity97
" @entity102 's ' @entity1 ' is no longer a national company
they should not use ' @entity7 ' in the name
as a citizen of @entity7 , i can not allow the word @entity7 to be used , " commented " @entity108 " , one user on the site
despite the public outrage , the scandal has triggered an unexpected boon for some of @entity7 's online retailers
booming sales sales for macadamia nuts have surged 20-fold over the past week on @entity120 , @entity7 's most popular online shopping site which is owned by @entity122 , said @entity123 , a company spokesperson who declined to give his full name
the round , white nuts have become the top two best sellers on another @entity7 online retailer , @entity129
