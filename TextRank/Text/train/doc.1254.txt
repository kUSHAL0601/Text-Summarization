-- at least 18 people were killed saturday when chaos broke out at a music festival in @entity5 , @entity6 , police said
the panic at " @entity8 " left " many " injured , according to police , who declined to give a specific number because many of those injured were taken to hospitals around the country , including some who had to be airlifted
@entity17 of @entity0 affiliate @entity18 said that the number of injured was possibly into the hundreds
@entity6 chancellor @entity21 issued a statement offering her condolences to the victims ' families , saying " my sadness and empathy goes out to them
" " the young people came to celebrate ; instead people were killed and injured , " the statement said
" i am distraught and sad in the face of the suffering and pain
" @entity17 told @entity0 that some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular festival , which features dozens of djs spinning techno music for hours
organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees , so they opened an additional event site to accommodate more people
the deadly crush happened in an underpass between the main event site and the expansion area
witnesses told @entity18 that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded
the panic began as festival - goers began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other
after the panic , a line of emergency vehicles , including helicopters , could be seen parked on the highway leading to the festival site , carrying away people injured in the crush
the festival itself , however , went on
police were afraid that ending the music altogether could cause further unrest among the massive crowd
witnesses also told @entity18 that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded
@entity18 reported that there were 1,400 police officers on hand to monitor the event
the festival was supposed to take place from 2 p.m. ( 8 a.m. et ) to midnight
by the evening , the entrance and adjacent roadway remained closed
thousands inside the venue continued dancing , but many could be seen leaving the area
the @entity8 was first held in the @entity6 capital , @entity84 , in 1989
