-- call it the ultimate in military logistics
as land routes from @entity7 into @entity8 are cut , sabotaged or otherwise interrupted , the @entity5 military has developed alternative railroad routes that make the @entity10 look like a branch line
they are called -- rather prosaically -- the @entity13 , or @entity14
the main route begins at the port of @entity17 in @entity18 , from where freight trains roll across @entity21 , and continues along the edge of the @entity23
it crosses the deserts of @entity26 and into @entity27
about 10 days after beginning their odyssey , the containers cross into @entity8 , carrying everything from computers and socks to toilet paper and bottled water
other routes begin at the port of @entity37 in @entity38 on the @entity39 and at @entity40 in the @entity41
the @entity21 first offered transit for nonlethal equipment bound for @entity8 in 2008
according to diplomatic cables released by @entity46 , it took nearly a year for the @entity5 and @entity47 to negotiate transit rights with central @entity50 governments such as @entity27 , although two - thirds of jet aviation fuel bound for @entity8 was already transiting @entity27
the first shipment of supplies crossed @entity21 in may 2009 ; just in time , because the " surge " meant that even more @entity5 troops needed resupplying , and transit routes through @entity7 were about to become a pawn in the deteriorating relationship between the two countries
use of the routes has since grown rapidly ; the @entity14 now carries 40 % of the supplies @entity5 forces in @entity8 need ( while @entity7 routes see 30 % , according to the @entity66 )
it does n't carry ammunition or weapons , which are flown in to airbases such as @entity71 and @entity72
but airlifting can not be much expanded ; the @entity5 @entity74 is already stretched , and air transport is much more expensive ( about $ 14,000 per ton of freight , according to @entity47 estimates ) than overland transport
@entity47 estimates the cost of moving supplies overland is one - tenth that of airborne freight
the @entity14 poses challenges of its own
ships have to use @entity17 because other ports in the @entity86 are not reliably ice - free in winter
there are bottlenecks , especially at the @entity8 border terminus at @entity91
and there have been allegations of " improper payments " made for fuel in @entity27 to keep the trains running and for preferential treatment to ensure that supplies get across the border as quickly as possible
rules change frequently , according to one contractor involved in getting freight into @entity8
and one diplomatic cable about negotiations to use @entity27 territory in 2008 noted that " corruption remains endemic throughout all levels of the economy
" but with @entity5 lobbying , funds from the @entity110 enabled @entity27 engineers to extend the line last year to the @entity8 city of @entity115
as one @entity27 official puts it : " @entity8 is the only country in the world without railways ; that 's why it 's not developed
" ( a historical aside : the @entity115 route is the first working railway line in @entity8 since 1929 , when there was a line all of four miles long out of @entity124
only recently , @entity47 helped move one of the historical locomotives from that line to the @entity128 in @entity124
) the @entity14 may seem a daunting and expensive challenge , but as @entity5 relations with @entity7 have frayed , the northern option has proved good insurance
land convoys through @entity7 from the port of @entity135 travel nearly 1,000 miles to reach @entity8 , with the last part of the journey often being a painfully slow trek through the @entity139
there is the added risk of ambush -- many tankers and trucks have been attacked and destroyed in the last two years
in one incident alone in december 2008 , the @entity7 @entity145 set ablaze 100 trucks at a rest stop near @entity149
the @entity7 routes are also vulnerable to the vagaries of the @entity5 - @entity7 relationship
for 10 days last year , @entity7 closed the overland routes ( via @entity154 on the @entity139 and @entity155 south of @entity72 ) into @entity8 in retaliation for @entity5 air attacks that mistakenly killed @entity7 soldiers
the northern routes are safer and more reliable , but not entirely immune to disruption
relations between the @entity5 and @entity21 are sometimes tense ( over such issues as the ballistic missile defense shield ) , and central @entity50 states have taken offense at @entity5 complaints about their human rights record
even so , @entity21 gains advantages from allowing its territory to be used ; it does n't want @entity8 sliding into chaos
@entity41 president @entity171 said at the @entity5 / @entity21 summit 2009 : " we value the efforts that are being made by the @entity5 together with the other countries in order to prevent the terrorist threat that was emanating and still coming from the @entity8 soil
" the @entity14 benefits plenty of other parties
for @entity27 , it helps defray the heavy cost of investment in its railway network , largely with loans from @entity50 banks , and increases demand for local goods
for @entity17 and other ports , it provides income at a time when economic growth is weak
and most of all , @entity8 stands to benefit from the " transformational potential " ( in the words of one @entity5 diplomat ) of a rail network that could make it an @entity50 transport hub
as the @entity5 drawdown gathers pace next winter , the @entity14 may acquire another role : helping to remove the vast amounts of equipment invested in the decade - long mission in @entity8
the irony is that tracks now carrying supplies to @entity5 soldiers in @entity8 were first built to resupply @entity207 forces when they occupied the country in the 1980s .
