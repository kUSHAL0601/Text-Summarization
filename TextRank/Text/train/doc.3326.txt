-- @entity1 has a dynamic and varied nightlife , although , as with the city 's restaurants , many of the best bars are tucked away off the beaten track
@entity1 has a buzzing clubbing scene
the ultra-stylish @entity9 is among the best rooftop bars in the world
located on the 52nd floor of the @entity14 ( 3 - 7 - 1 - 2 @entity15 ) it offers spectacular views of the glowing , futuristic cityscape that is @entity1 after dark
there 's fantastic food and live jazz , and as an added bonus , you may recognize it as the bar where @entity26 first meets @entity27 in " @entity28
" at @entity30 it 's the stunning interior that will catch your eye
at once kitsch , cozy and classy , it 's a truly unique space by @entity1 design gurus wonderwall
you 'll find it tucked away on the seventh floor of the @entity37 ( 1 - 5 - 1 @entity38 ) right across the street from @entity40
if you manage to locate it , you 'll discover that @entity42 ( @entity43 , @entity44 , 2 - 7 - 18 @entity45 , @entity46 - ku ) is one of the city 's coolest bars
take the metro to @entity51 , leave by exit 2 and turn right
an unmarked metal door will lead you to a barely - lit basement bar artfully kitted out in dark wood and antique furniture
it 's open until 5 a.m. and manages to feel laid back and indulgent at the same time
perennially popular with foreigners is the @entity60 area
full of bars and restaurants , it 's always lively -- and a bit tacky
@entity67 ( @entity66 3 - 14 - 9 @entity60 , @entity46 - ku ) is an unfussy , affable shot bar with a good - value happy hour
a world away from garish @entity60 is the @entity72 area of @entity73
a ghetto of dark alleyways crammed with tiny ramshackle bars , @entity72 evokes a bygone bohemian @entity1 of the 1960s
some establishments are n't keen on foreign customers but @entity80 ( 1 - 1 - 8 @entity79 , @entity73 - ku ) is a friendly little drinking den that 's sure to offer a warm welcome
a new arrival on the clubbing scene is the intimate @entity85 ( @entity86 , @entity88 - @entity87 - ku ) , the @entity1 outpost of the @entity91 night club
designed in part by @entity94 , it attracts a trendy and glamorous international crowd
more established , and much less intimate , is @entity1 's finest superclub , @entity97 ( 2 - 16 @entity98 - cho , @entity99 - ku )
more like the interior of a spaceship than a nightclub , @entity97 has dazzling lighting and attracts top international @entity105 and @entity104
where to stay what to see where to be seen where to eat where to shop ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
