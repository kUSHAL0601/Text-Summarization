-- goalkeeper @entity1 tells @entity0 the current @entity3 women 's team want to emulate the achievements of the 1999 @entity6 - winning squad
@entity8 's @entity3 face @entity9 in the @entity11 final in @entity12 on sunday , 12 years after a team containing stars such as @entity15 and @entity16 defeated @entity17 on penalties to claim the sport 's biggest prize
@entity23 was 17 when the @entity3 clinched their second @entity6 triumph on home soil at the @entity26 in @entity27 and , now 29 , the @entity22 goalkeeper wants the class of 2011 to create their own piece of sporting history
" of course they [ the 1999 team ] inspired me , " said @entity23 , " @entity16 being the true inspiration
soccer inspires post-quake @entity9 " not only me but many members of this team
she was a true , true winner and we hope she 's back there watching
the ' 99 team truly paved the way for all of us
" we would n't be where we are today as a federation [ without them ]
they set the standard , they set the bar high ... with that said , 12 years on this team wants to write their own storybook ending
" solo has been one of the standout performers in the @entity3 team 's run to the final , her highlight being a save from @entity62 during a pulsating penalty shootout victory over @entity64 in the quarterfinals
@entity66 heads to @entity6 final but despite the plaudits that have come her way , @entity23 insists the @entity3 squad will not be satisfied unless they return home with the @entity6 trophy
" we 're not surprised where we stand right now
we came into this tournament with one goal
it was n't to beat @entity64 in the quarterfinal , it was n't to make it to the final
it was to win the whole thing
" i think when you get this close , you would have a lot of regrets if you walked away and you did n't win it all
