-- the @entity2 administration had " very detailed contingency plans " for military action against @entity5 forces if they had tried to stop the @entity7 attack on @entity9 's compound , according to two @entity7 officials familiar with the plan
their names are not disclosed because of the sensitive intelligence information involved
" no firepower option was off the table " during the @entity19 ' 38 - minute mission on the ground , or during the time @entity7 helicopters were in the air , one official told @entity0
" we would have done whatever we had to in order to get our men out
" the two @entity7 officials also told @entity0 about the plan if @entity9 had been captured alive , which included taking him to @entity29 and then out to the @entity30 in the @entity31
all of the senior @entity7 officials in the @entity35 during the assault were prepared to call their @entity5 counterparts if fighting between @entity7 and @entity5 forces appeared imminent , one of the officials told @entity0
the seals at all times retained the right of self - defense , and they could have fired at the @entity5 to defend themselves
during the time the @entity19 were on the ground , while some were inside the compound , others were covertly placed just outside the compound walls to provide perimeter security and keep people away
some of those @entity19 would have been able to speak enough of the local language to communicate with townspeople if they had come across them , one source told @entity0
as the assault on @entity9 's compound commenced , the @entity7 had a number of aircraft flying protective missions
none of the aircraft entered @entity5 airspace , but they were prepared to do so if needed
these included fixed wing fighter jets that would have provided firepower if the team came under opposition fire it could not handle
additionally , the @entity68 had a full team of combat search and rescue helicopters including @entity71 and @entity73 helicopters flying
the helicopter that came in to replace the crashed stealth helicopter was carrying a battlefield medical team that was flying overhead and ready to land if @entity19 were wounded , one of the @entity0 sources said
that helicopter landed at the compound within about thirty minutes of being called
@entity7 military and intelligence assets were conducting continuous reconnaissance of @entity5 military installations to watch for any indication of movements , but the @entity5 military never responded while the @entity7 forces were there , one @entity7 official indicated
on monday , @entity5 prime minister @entity90 praised the @entity5 military 's response to the sudden arrival of @entity7 forces
" the air force was ordered to scramble , " he said
" ground units arrived at the scene quickly
our response demonstrates that our armed forces reacted , as was expected of them
" still , he added , " there is no denying the @entity7 technological ability to evade our radars
" even though it was anticipated that @entity9 would resist the @entity19 that assaulted his compound , and therefore be killed , the @entity2 administration had a plan in place for dealing with @entity9 if he was captured alive , according to both @entity7 officials
the plan was for @entity9 to be flown back to @entity29 aboard @entity7 military helicopters and then flown out to the @entity30 in the @entity31
there was a team of lawyers , medical personnel , interrogators and translators standing by to deal with @entity9 if that was the scenario that unfolded
a major concern was to immediately " preserve evidence " and put @entity9 into a legal framework that would ensure he could be charged and tried some day , the official said
" we did n't want to have some case thrown out on a technicality
" the official indicated the standby teams included the type of expertise normally within @entity7 units in @entity29 , so it 's likely personnel did not even know who their potential target would have been
the official noted that @entity9 would have undergone the same type of medical checks and photographing that surrounded @entity140 when he was captured
after @entity9 was killed by the @entity19 at the compound , his body was flown back to @entity29 , and then to the @entity30 where he was buried at sea
admiral @entity145 , chairman of the @entity146 , placed a phone call to his counterpart general @entity148 asking for @entity7 aircraft to re-enter @entity5 airspace -- several hours after the raid -- so the body could be flown out to the @entity30 .
