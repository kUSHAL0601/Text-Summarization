@entity0 -- nearly five years to the day after a @entity5 - @entity4 newspaper editor was gunned down in broad daylight , a judge acquitted all 19 defendants in his trial of charges that they were members of an " armed terrorist organization
" one defendant , @entity12 , received a life sentence for conspiring in the planned killing of @entity15 , editor - in - chief of the @entity4 - language newspaper " @entity17
" prosecutors accused @entity12 of purchasing the murder weapon , a 7.65 millimeter @entity5 - produced handgun
@entity12 was also accused of recruiting a 17 - year old soccer player named @entity22 to use the gun to kill @entity15
another defendant , @entity24 , was cleared of charges in connection to the murder
instead , he was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison for the 2004 bombing of a @entity31 's restaurant in the @entity33 city of @entity34
attorneys for the @entity15 family denounced the sentences , arguing it downgraded a politically motivated assassination to the level of a common criminal murder
" this decision was unexpected , " lawyer @entity42 told journalists outside the courthouse
standing next to @entity15 's widow , @entity46 , @entity42 called the trial a " comedy
" " the tradition of the state of political murders and the tradition of the state to make enemies of some of its citizens by classifying them as ' others , ' this tradition continues , " @entity42 continued
" this was was an opportunity for democratization in @entity5 , but they did not seize that opportunity
" @entity15 was gunned down on the sidewalk outside the @entity0 office of the @entity17 newspaper in 2007
surveillance cameras caught the convicted murderer , @entity22 , fleeing the scene wearing a white hat
the confessed killer was later sentenced to more than 22 years in prison
he received a lighter sentence because he was a minor
at the time of the murder , @entity15 was defending himself in court against a number of cases accusing him of " insulting @entity5 identity , " for comments made about the massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic @entity85 in the final days of the @entity86
@entity15 argued the killings amounted to genocide , a term the @entity5 state continues to vehemently deny
in 2010 , the @entity91 fined @entity5 more than $ 100,000 for failing to " protect the life and freedom of expression " of @entity15
in interviews before his murder , @entity15 said he had received death threats for his outspoken opinions
investigative journalist @entity99 later wrote in a book that @entity0 police were aware of threats to @entity15 's life
@entity99 is currently in prison , facing charges of plotting to overthrow the @entity5 government
" the @entity5 authorities have failed to address state officials ' alleged involvement in the killing of journalist and human rights activist @entity15 , " @entity107 wrote this week
" the security services knew of the murder plot and were in communication with those accused of the murder yet nothing was done to stop it taking place ... nothing short of a full investigation into the actions of all the state institutions and officials implicated in the murder will represent justice
" after tuesday 's court ruling , @entity15 's family and attorneys , along with several hundred supporters , marched in protest through the streets of @entity0 in sub-zero temperatures carrying signs saying " we are all @entity4
