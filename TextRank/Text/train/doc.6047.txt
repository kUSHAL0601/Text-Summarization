-- was it a miracle ? perhaps not
but saturday 's much anticipated @entity5 men 's hockey showdown between @entity6 and @entity7 sure was one amazing game
and it was a long one , at that
after 60 minutes of regulation , then after five minutes of overtime , even after the three required shootout attempts for each team , the contest was still all tied up
@entity16 finally broke the ice , notching his fourth goal in the shootout stage -- which happened to be all four of the @entity7 ' shootout goals -- to give his @entity22 squad a 3 - 2 victory
" my hands are a little tingling , my feet are tingling , " @entity16 admitted afterward
" it was pretty nerve - racking out there
" see game - winning goal his heroics , and that of @entity7 goalie @entity35 , capped a tight , hard - fought affair
there was n't as much at stake compared to the historic 1980 @entity40 game in @entity41 , @entity42 , between the underdog @entity7 and the @entity44 ( the closest thing to today 's @entity6 )
@entity47 's goal lifted the @entity7 to victory , setting the stage for their gold medal win
and the loss hardly eliminates the host @entity6 , which entered the @entity53 with high hopes , and high pressure , to take home gold
they still have a good shot to reach the quarterfinals , having one preliminary round victory under their belt and another game in this round -- against @entity65 -- to go
as @entity6 forward @entity67 said , " everything is ok
" @entity67 , who once starred in the @entity70 but now plays in @entity71 in @entity6 's professional league , even saw positives
" we played good and showed our character by equalizing the game at the end , " he said , " and now we will be getting ready for the future
" still , the energy in the @entity80 , the presence of @entity6 president @entity82 and the intense attention worldwide all suggested that this was n't just any other game
it helped , too , that both squads are talented , played well and had legitimate shots at winning gold
a report by @entity70 described the sounds of air horns blasting through the arena in what was mostly a @entity96 crowd
@entity6 flags and chants of " @entity99 " echoed throughout , according to the report
" it was loud , crazy , a circus - like environment , " @entity70 reported
" it was the @entity40 at their finest
" @entity6 grabbed an early lead , before the @entity7 responded with a pair of power play goals -- one in the second period , another in the third -- to jump ahead
then @entity6 's @entity108 of the @entity70 's @entity109 netted his second goal of the day to tie the score 2 - 2
and with just under five minutes to go , @entity6 appeared to score a go - ahead goal on a blast
but after mulling it over , the referees called off this score because -- before the shot went in -- the net had moved off its moorings , barely
see controversial shot that was disallowed that set the stage for the five - minute overtime period and , after no one scored then , the shootout
the @entity7 were on the verge of winning until -- on @entity6 's third chance -- @entity67 got one past @entity35 , who plays for the @entity128
after that , things reset
unlike in the @entity70 , where no player can have more than one shot in a shootout , the international rules allow for players ( after the first three attempts by each side ) to go again and again and again
@entity16 -- whose day job is with the @entity70 's @entity139 -- did just that
he went five more times , beating @entity6 net minder @entity142 's on three of those attempts
@entity142 , who also plays in the @entity70 for the @entity146 , was n't as positive afterward as his teammate , @entity67
" it was a shootout ; we wanted more , " the @entity6 goalie said
" @entity16 himself said he felt some pressure , " but then the puck hits your stick and you start skating
it 's just you and the goalie
i was fortunate enough to keep him guessing
" and afterward , @entity7 had no doubt what they think of @entity16
as one person said on @entity164 : " @entity16 put his country on his back ! unreal
" showdown was physical and intense
