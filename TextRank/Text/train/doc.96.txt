it 's hard to believe @entity2 did n't exist 130 years ago
it used to be a dusty , one - horse kind of place where a few farmers eked out a living from the land , although traces of early human habitation go back millions of years
@entity11 was born with the discovery of gold
almost overnight , it became one of the fastest - growing cities in the world as fortune - seekers rushed in
the stories that make up the @entity2 's past shape its character today , rewarding visitors who venture beyond the sanitized streets of wealthy @entity25 to discover the real heartbeat of @entity2 , the " @entity27 , " as it is also known
it has golden foundations the richest city in @entity31 , @entity2 is also one of the biggest economies in @entity31 overall -- its wealth built upon that discovery of gold in the late 1800s
" there was no indigenous population , no water and the only reason for this city 's existence was the discovery of gold , " says @entity37 , editor of @entity38 , a guide to the history of the city
" it laid the foundation for everything else that happened , even the layout of the roads
" within a few years , @entity2 had become like an @entity55 @entity54 , its wagons and tents transformed into brick buildings and the dusty gathering places become thriving market squares
but the wealth came at a cost : poverty forced many black @entity55 to work in the mines and they lived in terrible conditions
nowadays , gold is no longer such a significant part of @entity2 's economy
but that frontier spirit -- a sense that anything is possible -- remains and continues to attract people
@entity73 , south of @entity2 ( +2711 248 6800 ) , provides a glimpse of the city 's golden past
sure , it 's a bit kitsch but the recreated mining town features an original mine shaft you can ride down and you also get the chance to pan for gold
@entity84 in the cbd or @entity85 ( 5 simmonds st. ) features a small museum around a mine shaft inside the building , and from the top of the 50 - storey @entity90 ( 152 commissioner st. ; +2711 308 1331 ) you have a good view of the mine dumps surrounding the city
@entity96 ( +27 11 678 3905 ) is one of the best companies for walking tours around the @entity85
everyone 's from out of town -- originally everyone in @entity2 seems to come from somewhere else
that contributes to the openness of the place compared with places such as @entity106 , which can feel cliquey to outsiders
" everyone in @entity2 is a migrant , whether they [ their families ] arrived here 125 or two years ago , " says @entity108 , founder of a company , @entity96 , which runs tours of the city center
" @entity2 is the whole of @entity31 , or the world , in one city -- you could be eating braaied fish cooked by someone from the @entity122 in @entity123 one minute and then @entity125 street food in @entity126 the next
" different ethnic neighborhoods reflect the various communities that moved here a century ago in search of riches -- @entity126 has an @entity132 feel while old @entity133 in @entity134 in the @entity85 and new @entity133 in @entity135 are the best places for a curry or dim sum
many of the migrants found the streets were not paved with gold , and that was especially true of black @entity55
mine workers living in rundown hostels were eventually forced out of the city to live in townships such as @entity148 and @entity149
today , it 's wealth rather than legislative segregation that means many people still face very long commutes into the city
a great place to learn about the history of migrant labor is the @entity159 , in a vividly restored former @entity161 hostel ( 52 jeppe street ; +27 11 492 0600 )
@entity2 was at the center of the anti-apartheid fight the people of @entity2 , and especially @entity149 , were instrumental in the struggle against apartheid
@entity167 moved to the city from the @entity169 to study at @entity170 and opened the first black law firm in @entity31 with another @entity173 activist , @entity172 , at @entity174 in downtown @entity2
the restored building ( corner @entity176 and @entity178 ) now houses a ground - floor photographic museum
also worth a visit is @entity181 in the affluent northern suburb of @entity183 ( 7 @entity184 ; +27 011 803 7882 ) , where 19 @entity173 activists including @entity167 were arrested and brought to trial leading to his imprisonment for 27 years on @entity189
music and the arts played a significant role in the anti-apartheid struggle , and the @entity2 neighborhood of @entity195 was at the heart of this cultural movement in the 1950s
legendary musicians such as @entity199 and @entity200 played in the jazz clubs of this then racially integrated area that was the first target of forced removal of black people in the 1950s
today , the spirit of @entity195 is being revived through arts projects
the @entity208 ( cnr @entity209 and @entity210 ; +2783 550 7130 ) runs walking tours in the area
some of humankind 's oldest traces have been found here @entity2 has one of the longest recorded histories of human habitation in the world
the earliest residents can be traced back 3 million years -- their presence preserved in a @entity220 called the @entity221 ( +27 14 577 9000 ) 50 kilometers north of the city
the area has been the scene of some of the world 's most important paleontological finds , including the perfectly preserved hominid skeleton " @entity229
" @entity221 , the visitor center housed within a giant grassy mound , has displays showing humankind 's journey through time
you can also walk through the @entity237 , scene of some of the most exciting archaeological finds in the area
@entity241 ( 121 @entity242 , @entity161 ; +27 11 833 5624 ) has a wide range of displays exploring @entity31 's first civilizations
@entity246 ( @entity245 , @entity247 ; +27 11 482 4797 ) , a nature reserve in the heart of @entity2 with evidence of @entity252 settlements , is a good place to escape the hectic pace of the city
it 's inadvisable to go here alone , so join a guided walk .
