-- @entity1 won a brutal third stage of the @entity3 which saw @entity4 reclaim the leader 's yellow jersey and the hopes of a number of race favorites , including @entity10 , dented
the 213 kilometers from @entity11 to @entity12 contained seven stretches of cobblestones , which caused the peloton to split into small groups after a series of crashes and punctures
@entity1 and @entity20 winner @entity4 were in a six - strong group which forged ahead to gain valuable time on their rivals
neither man is a serious contender to win the @entity3 , but the group contained two men who are , @entity4 's @entity28 teammate @entity27 and world champion @entity29 of @entity30
@entity1 took the sprint for the stage honors from @entity34 's @entity33 , the @entity35 rider moving up to second overall for his efforts , with all six awarded the same time
behind them , @entity35 's @entity38 , fourth overall last year , improved his chances by finishing in the second group , 53 seconds down , with @entity42 @entity41 , a former winner of the @entity43 and @entity44
race favorite and defending champion @entity46 came in a further 20 seconds down after puncturing in the run in to the finish
but seven - time @entity44 winner @entity10 lost valuable ground on his main rivals after a puncture held up the @entity53 team leader as he conceded two minutes and eight seconds to the leading group
he has slipped to 18th in the overall standings , two minutes 30 seconds behind @entity4
@entity10 admitted it had been a " very frustrating " day for his team and that for all his preparations on the cobbles it had proved daunting
" when we hit the key sections -- i ca n't lie , i was on the limit
so it was a lot different to training , " he told @entity64
and for @entity27 's brother and @entity28 teammate @entity69 , the race is over after a heavy crash on the cobbles
@entity73 's @entity72 , who held the yellow jersey after winning the second stage , also punctured twice and lost too much time to remain in the lead
the stage victory for @entity79 's @entity1 strengthens his grip on the points leader 's green jersey with arch - rival @entity83 of @entity84 out of the placings
like @entity4 , @entity1 is a specialist in the @entity20 one - day classic which also features the feared pave cobblestones which caused such havoc to the @entity44 riders .
