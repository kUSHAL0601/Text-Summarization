-- so long , @entity1
at least , that 's what fans of " live ! with @entity8 " will be saying when the 80 - year - old co-host tapes his last episode of the syndicated talk show on friday , november 18
@entity1 made the announcement during today 's show
" friday , november 18 is my last day , " @entity1 said , adding , " but do n't worry , the show goes on
" back in january , the television icon officially announced that he would be stepping down from " live ! " after co-hosting for nearly 28 years
@entity1 said of his retirement from the show at the time , " there is a time that everything must come to an end for certain people on camera , especially certain old people
" the emmy - winner joked on tuesday , " last january i made the announcement that i 'll be moving on
but i never gave you an exact date
so i 'm pushing it back five years
" while no new co-host has yet been named for @entity1 's right - hand woman @entity27 ( we here at @entity0 had some suggestions of our own , however ) , the two discussed finding a replacement
" @entity27 will be trying out new co-hosts , just like we did 11 years ago when we found her , " @entity1 said , kidding that @entity27 would be looking for a " new young hot " male co-host
@entity27 , who joined @entity1 in 2001 after @entity34 exited , fired back by saying that she was just looking for someone , " alive and breathing
