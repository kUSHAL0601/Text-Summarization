a rescuer at the entrance to @entity10 's @entity11 , @entity6 , sunday
lt. @entity12 , an @entity13 spokesman , said the students -- two women and one man -- were reported missing early sunday after a trip into @entity17 , about four miles south of the university 's campus
they were found about halfway down the 12,000 - foot - long cave , which has few spaces big enough for an adult to stand upright and is explored primarily by experienced spelunkers
the students were located shortly before 5 p.m. ( 6 p.m. et ) , about 30 hours after they entered
their names were not released sunday night
a friend called 911 to report them missing at 5 a.m. the group had told friends to call 911 if they were not back by midnight sunday , according to @entity5 - @entity31
earlier reports that four students were in the cave were incorrect , @entity12 said
authorities did not know sunday evening why the students were in the cave for so long
but @entity12 said it would have been easy even for experienced cavers to get lost in @entity10 's , which he compared to the roots of a tree
" there are so many ways to go , " he said
