-- a few kilometers from the city center of @entity3 , @entity4 , is a natural phenomenon called " the meeting of the waters
" here , the @entity9 and @entity10 rivers join , but do n't mix -- light and dark waters , flowing side by side for 8 - 10 kilometers , due to different water temperatures , speed and acid levels
eventually , the two rivers become one , and the mighty @entity10 continues its journey through northern @entity4
it is just one of the countless features that makes @entity3 such a unique city
with the @entity24 as its backyard , @entity26 and city officials hope it will also be enough to draw in fans from around the world as one of @entity4 's 12 host cities for the @entity33
the city of two million people rises from the rainforest , isolated from much of the rest of @entity4 's population
traffic jams clog the streets
fishing boats dot the river
ports swarm with activity during the day , and overnight
in the middle of it all , a stadium is being built from the ashes of one that stood before it
in this spot , the @entity51 is being constructed to welcome the world next summer
the renderings of what the completed stadium will look like can be seen all over the city , from the sides of city buses to billboards above the busy streets
but in reality , there is still much to be done
in june , it was a still a concrete shell , with no seats , no roof , no grass
to complicate matters , having the rainforest as a backdrop is both a blessing and a curse
instead of having a full year to prepare , @entity3 has just a few months remaining until the intense rainy season hits in december
if the stadium is not ready by then , construction will become that much more difficult
@entity76 is the city liaison 's officer to @entity26 , overseeing @entity33 preparations for the city , and that includes the @entity51
in june , he estimated the stadium was about 65 percent complete , and on track to finish in december
sustainability the construction of the stadium is as unique as the city that 's building it
to save time , parts of the stadium -- such as the roof , for example -- are being built in other locations like @entity94 , @entity95 and southern @entity4
the pieces are then assembled in @entity3 , creating another challenge
" these logistics give us a big headache , " @entity76 said
" we need very good planning to have everything here at the right time
" meant to look like a basket made by indigenous tribes in the rainforest , eco-friendly elements have gone into its construction , so ample rainwater will water the pitch , while sunlight and wind will be harnessed for power
" when we thought about making this arena , we thought about sustainability , " @entity76 said
" everybody here in the @entity10 region worries about the environment , so we tried to follow that way of thinking ... like saving the rain water , using sunlight , and using the wind
" when it is complete , the stadium will hold 44,000 people , and cost an estimated $ 550 million @entity4 reais , or about $ 225 million -- if it is completed on time , and on budget
during the recent @entity130 , protests erupted over whether the money being spent on the @entity33 might be better invested elsewhere and in @entity3 the big question remains -- what will happen when the @entity33 is over ? @entity3 ' local football teams do n't draw in a big crowd
so the city has plans to use the stadium for other events , like concerts , conferences , and even @entity143 fights -- with jujitsu as perhaps the area 's most popular sport
city organizers are focused on the bigger picture , knowing the @entity33 can bring more than just a new stadium
they hope it will leave a lasting legacy of infrastructure improvements the city so desperately needs -- like more reliable electricity , internet , and transportation upgrades
long after the final whistle blows next summer , and a champion is crowned , that will be the true legacy of @entity3 as a @entity33 host city .
