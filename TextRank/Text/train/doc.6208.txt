@entity0 -- @entity3 , the surviving suspect in the @entity5 bombings , lies in a hospital with a gunshot wound to the side of his neck , sedated and intubated , sources say
but he could be brought out of sedation in minutes so he could answer questions from law enforcement officials , doctors tell @entity1
intubated and sedated patients are often put on " sedation holidays
" what we know about the suspects under normal circumstances , doctors use these holidays , which last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours , so they can ask patients questions to assess neurological and cognitive functioning
the patients ca n't talk , since they have a tube down their throats , but they can write
" they 're still pretty out of it on these holidays , pretty confused and sleepy , but they could be able to understand what 's being said to them , " said dr. @entity30 , an internist and attending physician at @entity32
while many patients are groggy during these holidays , others are quite awake and thoughtful
did one brother brainwash the other ? @entity3 , who has been hospitalized since his capture on friday , has been communicating with officials , two sources told @entity1
" they have been questioning him since yesterday , " a senior law enforcement source said
" there is some form of communication between law enforcement and the suspect
" neither source would divulge what @entity3 has been communicating
dr. @entity52 , a gastroenterologist and professor at @entity54 , remembers visiting his grandmother in the intensive care unit while she was intubated and sedated
fearing she might be dying , he asked her physicians to decrease her sedation so he could have one last conversation with her
she still could n't talk but she could write on a notepad
" she woke up in five minutes and had a conversation
it was march , and she told me where her tax materials were so she could file her taxes , " @entity52 remembers
after a " sedation holiday " patients are put back under full sedation
" it 's like these patients are asleep , " said @entity30 , a professor of health policy and management at the @entity71
" they ca n't hold a conversation
they 're really out of it
" despite the sedation , some patients do respond a bit to what 's going on around them
they might , for example , grunt if a doctor taps them on the shoulder or says their name
" they might squeeze your hand in response to a command or move their heads to a sound , but they ca n't answer questions , " said dr. @entity87 , associate professor of anesthesia and critical care at @entity54
doctors sedate intubated patients because it 's uncomfortable and painful to have a tube down the throat and a machine forcing air into the lungs
