a mocked - up image of @entity20 wearing a hoodie went viral on the @entity22
and a page on the popular blogging service @entity25 drew hundreds of often poignant essays from people -- many of them white , middle - class and far removed from the civil rights struggle -- who said the death of 17 - year - old @entity33 , and @entity35 's acquittal , had moved them profoundly
" i think if i looked like @entity33 i could 've been shot or arrested or antagonized and hated
i could 've been dead at 17 , " wrote one poster who identified himself as a 31 - year - old white man
" i think if @entity33 looked like me he could 've grown up to be someone that did something wonderful for the world
" a @entity5 jury acquitted @entity35 saturday following a nearly four - week trial
the @entity48 former neighborhood watch volunteer acknowledged shooting and killing @entity33 last year , but said he did so in self - defense after the teenager attacked him
juror : ' @entity52 ' that @entity35 feared for his life critics of the verdict , however , say they believe the jury got it wrong -- that @entity35 was an overzealous wannabe police officer who racially profiled @entity33 and hatefully shot him down
they want federal civil rights charges and changes to laws like @entity5 's @entity16 , fearing a spate of similar incidents
" anyone walking or committing no crime can be followed or approached by another civilian and they can use deadly force and say it was self - defense , " the rev. @entity62 said tuesday in @entity63
" that is something that is frightening and can not be allowed to sustain itself in our society
" although @entity35 's attorneys did not seek a @entity80 before trial , the judge 's instructions to the jury did allude to provisions of the law , and a juror interviewed by @entity85 's @entity84 on monday said it came into play during deliberations

" i could have been @entity33 , " one @entity137 - @entity6 teen wearing a hoodie -- the same garment @entity33 was wearing -- told the station
" but this case is n't about racial issues
this case is about violence
this case is about the judicial system
" why this verdict ? on tuesday : -- protesters in @entity5 staged a sit - in tuesday at the governor 's office , demanding a special legislative session to consider changes to the @entity16 , a spokeswoman told @entity85

civil rights leader , @entity199 , now a member of the @entity171 police commission , said those behind the violence " have their own agendas that have nothing to do with justice , and very little to do with @entity33
" taking @entity35 's side of course , not everyone disagreed with the jury 's verdict
on a @entity212 page dedicated to discussion of the trial , @entity212 user @entity211 said the jury got it right
" the jurors have spoken
... kudo 's to this great defense team , " @entity211 wrote
more controversially , conservative rock singer @entity221 called @entity33 a " dope smoking , racist gangsta wannabe " in defending the verdict in a column for the website rare
" here 's the lesson from all this , @entity6 , " @entity221 wrote
" teach your children to not attack people for no good reason whatsoever
conduct yourself in a responsible , civil manner , and everything will be just fine
try to kill someone and that someone just may be exercising his or her @entity239 rights and you could get shot
it 's called self - defense , and it is the oldest , strongest and most righteous instinct and @entity245 - given right known to man
" meanwhile , @entity35 's parents , @entity248 and @entity249 , offered more conciliatory words in an @entity252 interview
" we are deeply sorry for this tragedy , " @entity249 said
now that he 's free , can @entity35 make a living ?
