-- kindergartens in three @entity3 provinces are accused of giving prescription drugs to children without their parents ' knowledge , according to @entity8 , @entity3 's state - run news agency
the drugs were given to prevent the children from getting sick in order to boost attendance , the news agency reported
the schools get paid based on attendance
the scandal started last week in one kindergarten in the city of @entity19 and has now spread to several in the country , prompting @entity3 's education and health ministries to require its local branches to check all kindergartens and primary schools for illegally administered drugs , according to the @entity28 newspaper
almost 2,000 children who attended the suspected kindergartens are receiving medical attention as some reported side effects from the medication , such as dizziness , stomachaches , leg pains and genital swelling , @entity8 said
in an article tuesday , state media called it a " crisis of confidence in kindergarten managers
" it said that many parents are fed up with private kindergartens " which are poorly funded , poorly managed and frequently in a bad state of repair
" @entity3 's preschools have been riddled with what the state media called " a long history of avoidable problems " such as food safety and physical abuse
some angry parents of the affected kindergartens rallied in front of the facilities and local government buildings
first incidents last week , @entity8 reported that a parent accused a kindergarten in @entity19 , in @entity64 province of administering an antiviral drug to children
one parent told the @entity28 that several kindergarteners had been complaining about stomachaches or night sweats
when their parents took them to the doctors , they found abnormal results in urine and blood tests -- traces of possible damage to the kidney or liver , the parent told @entity3 media
the doctors were stumped over the diagnosis
local authorities said that the administrators at the @entity88 had given children moroxydine @entity90 , a medicine which can cause side effects such as sweating , loss of appetite and hypoglycemia since 2008
the prescription drug is used to treat the flu
" teachers told my child the pill was good for him but should be kept secret , " one parent , identified as @entity99 told @entity8
" they have been taking it for nearly three years
" another kindergarten in @entity19 , called @entity104 has also been suspected of following the same practice , @entity8 said
together , the two kindergartens have 1,455 students
little known about drug in question dr. @entity110 , professor of infectious diseases at the @entity112 , said not much is known about moroxydine @entity90
the drug was produced in the 1950s and could have some antiviral effects such as suppressing the flu virus , but there are no reports or clinical trials in @entity119 means doctors know little about how helpful or harmful it could be
for kindergartens to administer such a drug with little research or data is something @entity110 said he has never heard of
" i think the most effective , suitable way to prevent flu infection is to ask the students to get flu vaccines every year
it 's the proven , safest way to prevent flu , rather than taking long - term medication with unknown side effects and efficacy
" similar incident in @entity138 province days later , another kindergarten came under scrutiny , this time in the northeastern province of @entity138
investigators told @entity8 that a branch of the @entity144 in @entity145 had given some children the same drug -- moroxydine @entity90 -- to prevent them from catching colds and infectious diseases
the kindergarten staff were reported to have said they were using the drug to improve attendance
three administrators have been arrested , according to @entity8
the kindergarten 's 375 students are getting checked at hospitals , it reported
latest incident in @entity161 province the parents of children who had been attending @entity164 in @entity161 province , had become suspicious , telling @entity8 that their children developed symptoms such as stomachaches , irregular heartbeats , itching , vomiting and dizziness
kindergarteners told their parents that they were forced to swallow " white , bitter - tasting pills
" the principal and vice principal of the kindergarten " admitted to having fed pupils an over-the - counter anti-fever drug and vitamins to boost their immunity and improve attendance , " reported @entity8 on tuesday
the kindergarten , located in @entity182 , was shut and about 200 students are receiving medical check - ups , according to @entity3 's state media
authorities are looking into where the schools got their supply of prescription medication .
