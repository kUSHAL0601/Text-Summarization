@entity0 -- @entity5 sent hundreds of troops with armored vehicles onto the streets wednesday to protect the @entity9 , the army taking over from the police , as anti-government protests raged
the confrontations began when a planned memorial for people killed in @entity5 's revolution earlier this year turned into an angry demonstration against the country 's interim military government
clashes began tuesday afternoon and continued overnight and into wednesday , with intense confrontations between relatives of victims on one side and security forces on the other
many @entity5 are angry at the slow pace of change since president @entity26 resigned on february 11 after protests
a group called the january 25 coalition issued a range of demands wednesday night , a day after the demonstrations began
they called for the " speedy trial of snipers and killers of protesters , the removal of @entity0 's head of security and the official spokesman of the @entity42 " and " an immediate investigation in the events of last night
" the group , named for the day anti-government protests began this year , also called for the release of detainees held overnight and the " immediate expulsion of security officers who continue to butcher and kill @entity5 people , " among other demands
protesters burned tires and threw @entity56 cocktails , and police responded with tear gas , bullets and pellets in the biggest demonstrations in @entity0 in months
but despite the efforts of police , demonstrators maintained their positions in @entity0 's @entity66 , increasing their numbers to about 2,000
dr. @entity68 , the minister of health , said 75 people were admitted to hospitals , with 10 still there after 65 people were treated and released
@entity9 spokesman dr. @entity73 said earlier that 32 police officers were injured and more than 590 people were treated at the scene of the clashes
some 23 ambulances were running to help care for the wounded , he said
nine people were arrested , said @entity82 , a spokesman for the @entity42
" thugs carrying swords and weapons infiltrated the protesters and attacked the @entity42 with @entity56 cocktails and rocks , " @entity83 said
a makeshift clinic was established in a nearby mosque where dozens of people were treated for minor wounds and fatigue from inhaling tear gas
many people were seen bleeding from their heads and had suffered bullet wounds to the chest and face
several thousand protesters chanted against gen. @entity102 , who heads the @entity103 of the @entity104
the council has been running the country since @entity26 was forced to step down
the council said the demonstrations " have no excuse but to destabilize the security and stability of @entity5
" the armed forces statement urged " the great @entity5 people ... not to follow these calls ... for the sake of the security and safety of @entity5 in these difficult circumstances
" ambulances streamed out of the square in the aftermath , transporting protesters to hospitals , while others were treated on the scene
@entity126 , the son of presidential candidate @entity127 , was seen bleeding with a serious injury to his eye and was later transferred to the hospital
the protesters blocked the entrances to the square as calls were made on the internet for more people to join the cause
the imam of the nearby @entity139 called via loud speaker for police to stop attacking the protesters , saying @entity66 belonged to " the revolutionaries
" he also urged the demonstrators to go home
by late afternoon wednesday , the square that was the center of the revolution was no longer blocked , but demonstrators remained at the @entity9 , the focus of much of the anger
the human rights group @entity152 has estimated at least 840 people were killed and more than 6,000 wounded during the 18 - day revolution that began in late january
the military - led government that took over when @entity26 resigned has been prosecuting several former officials accused of ordering security forces to fire on protesters
a police officer accused of killing 20 protesters during a january 28 demonstration has been sentenced to death
former interior minister @entity163 has been sentenced to 12 years for corruption charges but still awaits the verdict for the charge of killing protesters
@entity26 is scheduled to face the @entity169 on august 3 on charges of corruption and deaths of protesters , the justice department said wednesday
@entity5 's military rulers have set parliamentary elections for september
protests have continued in the months since @entity26 's ouster as @entity5 have demanded speedier reforms and economic improvements
