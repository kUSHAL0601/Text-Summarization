-- now this is about much more than @entity2 and a grand jury 's decision not to indict the officer who shot him
from @entity8 to @entity9 to @entity10 , college students nationwide have walked out of classes or staged " die - ins " to decry police violence and racial profiling
they 've been joined by demonstrators across the country who say they wo n't stop clamoring for change until they see real action
and more and more , the protesters reflect a wide array of races and backgrounds
" we come from a privileged background , and it 's easy for many of our friends to deny what 's going on in this country , " one white prep school student told @entity0 affiliate @entity27 as he protested monday in @entity28
" but we feel it 's our duty to speak up for what 's right -- speak up for justice
" outside @entity38 , a sea of students lay on the cold bricks to draw attention to @entity2 's death
others did the same in @entity46 and in front of the @entity48 in @entity49 , mimicking the way @entity2 's body lay on a street for 4 1/2 hours
in cities across the country , one sign was so prolific that the words on it proved true : " @entity58 is everywhere
" moving forward so how does the country go from die - ins and walk - outs to actual change ? after meeting with law enforcement officials and activists monday , president @entity63 outlined several new efforts
" i 'm going to be proposing some new community policing initiatives that will significantly expand funding and training for local law enforcement , including up to 50,000 additional body - worn cameras for law enforcement agencies , " @entity63 said
the president addressed concerns about " whether we are militarizing domestic law enforcement unnecessarily
" he ordered a review after the widely criticized heavy - handed police response to @entity58 protesters in august , and that review suggests largely leaving intact federal programs that provide surplus military equipment to local police departments
but @entity63 plans to issue an executive order to tighten some of the controls over the programs to better track equipment provided to law enforcement agencies
the president also announced a new task force , chaired by the @entity91 police commissioner and a criminology professor , that will reach out to law enforcement , community activists and other stakeholders to come up with best practices on creating accountability and trust between communities and police
that task force must present their recommendations to @entity63 in 90 days
the president admitted than in the past , task forces have fallen short
but " this time will be different , because the @entity105 is deeply vested in making it different , " @entity63 said
" in the two years i have remaining as president , i 'm going to make sure that we follow through
" @entity109 heckled in the first leg of his national dialogue , attorney general @entity109 met with community members at @entity114 's @entity113 -- where @entity115 preached
@entity109 's speech was interrupted by a group of protesters chanting , " no justice , no peace " and " we have nothing to lose but our chains
" but the attorney general did n't criticize the hecklers
in fact , he praised them
" there will be a tendency on the part of some to condemn what we just saw , but we should not , " @entity109 said
" what we saw there was a genuine expression of concern and involvement
and it is through that level of involvement , that level of concern and i hope a level of perseverance and commitment , that change ultimately will come
and so let me be clear , let me be clear , i ai n't mad atcha , all right ? " complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity58 @entity0 's @entity147 and @entity148 contributed to this report .
