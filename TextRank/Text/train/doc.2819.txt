@entity0 -- this @entity2 , enjoy the turkey and roast beef
but do yourself a favor , and skip the duck
this whole controversy over @entity10 's hit show " @entity11 " is whacked
better make that " quacked
" first , the network puts @entity13 , the family patriarch , on indefinite suspension for making insensitive remarks in a magazine interview
then , the rest of the family rallies around their leader and suggests that the hit show will not go on without him
as you probably know unless you 've spent the last couple of weeks crouching in a duck blind , @entity13 -- in paraphrasing a @entity26 verse -- appeared to liken homosexuality to bestiality and used crude language to describe his own sexual preference
in speaking to @entity33 , he also seemed to minimize the discrimination that @entity36 - @entity35 suffered in the @entity37 before the civil rights movement
criticism of @entity13 poured in , but so did support for one 's right to express oneself
the patriarch responded : " i would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different than me
" in fact , @entity13 claims he and his family are the ones who have been treated disrespectfully -- by the producers of the show , and the entertainment industry in general
in an interview two months ago with the @entity56 , @entity13 said that television editors in @entity58 " with no moral compass " have routinely manipulated the show 's footage to intensify the language and make the family appear more profane and unruly than they really are
" they inserted fake beeps like somebody had used profanity , but no one had used profanity
if you want that , you can get all of that you want , " @entity13 continued
" just turn the station
there 's plenty of that ! and if we 're not using profanity , why make it look like we 're using profanity ? what is the point ? why do n't you just run it and say what we say ? " eventually , he said , producers gave in and " quit doing that
" according to @entity13 , the editors also took out the phrase " in @entity90 ' name " when the family prayed
it makes you wonder exactly how much reality is behind some of these reality shows
and now , it looks like the whole spectacle of @entity13 being taken to the woodshed by the network could be part of the show
according to @entity102 , @entity10 will -- starting january 15 -- air new episodes of the show that will include scenes featuring @entity13
these new episodes were already in the can
still , if @entity10 is sincere in its outrage over what @entity13 said , then it should stop trying to profit from the show he helped make successful
@entity113 , senior vice president of corporate communications for @entity10 , told me that since filming is n't set to resume until the spring , the network has not yet had to make a decision on @entity13 's role
he said he could n't comment on the @entity56 interview
despite the fact that an average of 14.6 million @entity35 tune in each week to track the adventures of the @entity13 family when you count @entity127 recordings , i 've never understood the appeal
for me , the question is n't why @entity13 was suspended
the real mystery is why he and his family -- who run a successful business making supplies for duck hunters -- have a television show in the first place
here is what you need to keep in mind as you waddle through this controversy : the reason that " @entity11 " is on television is to make liberal studio executives at @entity10 , and parent company @entity145 feel superior , while making big profits for the studio
the @entity148 are on television so that people in @entity151 and @entity58 -- the kind of folks who refer to anyplace in between as " flyover country " -- can feel progressive and enlightened by comparing themselves to simple country folks in @entity157 who , according to the elites , are neither
( and can make lots of money doing so
) " @entity11 ' is this era 's ode to " @entity163
" in that show -- which aired on radio and television from the 1920s through the 1960s and which was created , written and produced by white people -- @entity35 were given the opportunity to laugh at @entity35 , adding insult to the injury that this group of citizens was already sustaining before the civil rights movement
now , @entity35 have a new group to laugh at -- a self - described " bunch of rednecks from @entity157
" here 's the irony
this show is successful at least in part because the characters say things that many @entity35 consider colorful and crude
that 's the schtick of the @entity13 clan
now @entity13 is in hot water for staying in character and saying something colorful and crude
that is , @entity13 was suspended for doing in print what he has , for the last four years , been paid to do on television
that 's awfully hypocritical of @entity10
the network is embarrassed and would surely like to distance itself from the @entity13 family
however , it seems , it would like to stay acquainted with the millions of dollars the show generates each year
the network should be embarrassed
not by what @entity13 said ; it could n't control that
it should be embarrassed about what it could control : the way it responded and the mess it made of this situation
in discussing this story , commentators have been talking a lot about rights
@entity13 had the right to express his opinion
the network that has chosen to co-mingle its brand with the @entity13 brand had the right to suspend him
viewers who support the family have the right to boycott the network
but with rights come responsibilities , and -- as far as @entity10 executives are concerned -- they include the responsibility to avoid the hypocrisy of continuing to profit from a persona they created that they now claim to find offensive
now if you 'll excuse me , i think the " @entity11 " holiday marathon is well under way
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .
