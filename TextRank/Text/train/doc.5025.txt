-- whether or not you care about the big game on sunday , if you have plans to visit @entity4 any time in the near future , you 're a winner of @entity6
when the final seconds tick away on the scoreboard , @entity9 and the some 10 million visitors likely to travel to the @entity4 this year will be left with a new - and - improved mecca on the @entity12
local officials say the process of putting its game face on for the @entity16 helped push the memories of @entity19 damage even deeper into the history vaults
" this is probably the greatest example i can give you of resiliency
here we are , seven years after @entity19 , the @entity28 has awarded us the biggest party and biggest celebration that they have , " said @entity24 , president and ceo of @entity26
the ' new ' @entity4 the tourism marketing organization says the game inspired $ 1.3 billion in infrastructure improvements , including upgrades to downtown hotels , a total makeover at the airport , enhancements at the @entity40 and repairs to area highways , streets , sidewalks and the streetcar line
also funded were five new playgrounds that will be completed as part of the " @entity48 " the day before the @entity49 and 49ers compete for the @entity50
@entity24 says the city used @entity6 as the goalpost , timing-wise , for countless projects that have brought the city to a new level of @entity57 recovery
@entity58 beyond bare breasts the @entity63 , many visitors ' first and last impression of the city , has been noticeably lacking in authentic @entity4 food and flair
with the @entity28 and its entourage heading to the @entity4 , $ 356 million was dedicated to revamping the amenities and the aesthetics of the terminal buildings
among the improvements that took flight : new restaurants , signage and runway approach lights
while the city surpassed pre-katrina visitor spending in 2011 -- with $ 5.47 billion spent that year -- the actual visitor count has yet to rise above the bar of 10.4 million visitors , the number of arrivals in 2004
@entity24 says he does n't like to speculate , but he 's optimistic about 2013 being a record - breaker , especially with this three - week party kicking off the year
" the @entity16 footprint is very large
then you have the added impact of @entity58 , which brings in several hundreds of millions of dollars on its own
so when you combine the two , it 's a wonderful , positive , double whammy for the @entity4 , the state of @entity91 and the region , " he said
his organization puts the economic impact for the three weeks of what 's been dubbed " @entity96 " at approximately $ 730 million
@entity97 , president of @entity98 and co-chair of the @entity100 , says the overhaul is " just another building block to @entity4 being rebuilt and becoming a city of the 21st century where everybody would want to be
" best bites in the @entity4 football frenzy even though their team is n't marching into the @entity40 on sunday , many @entity109 fans are still riding the high of winning the @entity16 in 2010
@entity112 , executive director of the @entity113 , is glad to see football filling the city 's 37,000 hotel rooms , but she 's even more emotional about what the sport has meant to her city , calling the @entity109 " the true catalyst to the recovery of @entity4
" it has been two years , but the euphoria still lingers
having the @entity16 at the @entity40 calls to mind how the @entity109 ' victory helped " wash away whatever negative emotions people were holding onto from the impact of @entity19 and the levee breaks , " says early
she says fans still looking for a room for the weekend should keep checking with their desired hotel for cancellations
she also recommends @entity134 , where several hundred bed and breakfast listings can be found
hosting this game ties @entity4 with @entity137 for the city that has been home to the most @entity16 ; the last time was in 2002
@entity97 says he 's certain that if @entity19 had n't struck , @entity4 would be alone in the top spot
" our hospitality is the biggest plus
i guarantee , you come to @entity4 and you 're going to be treated better than you 'll be treated anywhere else that you 're ever going to go for a @entity16 , " says @entity97 , whose @entity98 is a beehive of activity now , as workers put the finishing touches on hundreds of floats soon to be parading through the city streets
@entity58 day is february 12
the city spread out its annual carnival celebration this year , altering the parade schedule to allow for a pause on the days immediately surrounding @entity16 sunday
if @entity49 and @entity158 fans get a taste of the city and hate the thought of leaving , @entity24 and other city leaders are urging them to stay for a parade or two
@entity97 is hoping that exposing the sports crowd to the joys of @entity167 and @entity58 will help communicate the family - friendly reality of the event
two smiling tourists from @entity171 are proof that seeing is believing
" before coming here all we heard about was drunk people in the streets , but everyone 's been friendly and not so crazy , " said @entity172
her friend @entity177 agreed , adding , " it 's really easy to get around
i feel very safe and it 's cleaner than what i expected
" another group of friends from @entity183 , @entity184 , was enjoying an early @entity58 parade on friday afternoon , dancing along with the @entity186
" in @entity184 , we play soccer
we do n't know so much about the @entity192 , " said one of them , with a smile
" but we are here for the @entity58 and the vacation
" even before the kickoff for @entity6 , city officials are planning their next mission
@entity97 has no doubt the @entity16 will make a return trip fairly soon
and the tourism marketing corporation is strategizing for 2018
that 's when @entity4 will turn 300 years old , or if you start over and count time forward from the storm -- as so many in this region were forced to do -- it will be in its 13th year of renewal
so who 's going to win on sunday ? according to @entity24 , " in the long term , the citizens of the area are the biggest winners because they 're going to benefit from all these great things that have happened in the city
" 3 ways to enjoy the @entity4 on a budget ride a streetcar : for a mere $ 1.25 , there are several options
the @entity219 line is one of the most popular , and this time of year , visitors will get to see trees and street signs draped in @entity167 beads
hop on where @entity219 hits @entity226 for a rewarding low - cost tour
take the free ferry : the @entity229 leaves every 30 minutes from the dock right next to the aquarium to cross the @entity12
get off at @entity232 and walk around , or simply ride across and back while enjoying the view
fans in town this week should go at dusk for the special treat of seeing @entity238 lit up by the media crews
browse the art co-op : from @entity242 , follow the sidewalk behind @entity244 ( yes , the powdered sugar - covered treats are a must ! ) and just before you reach the colorful shopping bazaar that is the @entity248 , you 'll discover the @entity250 's co- op. browsing is free , but you 're likely to find a unique souvenir that you ca n't live without -- and you might even meet the person who created it .
