@entity0 -- @entity2 shares pictures of some of his most cherished memories : the first time he saw the beach , a @entity8 race and a party from his childhood when all his friends dressed as clowns
and yet he has lived the last 43 years -- almost his entire life -- in @entity16 's biggest hospital
as an infant , he contracted polio and was left paralyzed from the waist down
he breathes with the help of a respirator
it was the 1970s , before vaccines eradicated polio in @entity16 , and @entity2 was sent to live in the polio ward with eight other children
" it was a wonderful time
i 'll never forget it , " he said during a recent interview from his hospital bed
" even though most of our friends are no longer with us , i never stopped dreaming about them
" his mother died two days after he was born and the rest of @entity2 's family soon stopped visiting
he points to a black and white picture of a boy in a pointy hat and clown makeup curled up in a wheelchair
" that 's @entity44 , " he says
" back then , it was him and me , we were very close
" over the years many of the children died , including @entity44
" it was december 26 , the day after @entity50 , " he says
" everything that i planned with my friend , life did n't have the same meaning
but it made me stronger
" the children were given little chance of surviving past the age of 10 , but two people did : @entity2 and his lifelong friend and roommate @entity59
they still live together in a room tucked inside the @entity63 of @entity0 's @entity64
" we 're like brother and sister and we look after each other , " @entity2 says
@entity59 suffered paralysis caused by polio when she was a baby
she has lived in the hospital for 38 years
" i 've been here since i was 1 year and 9 months old , " she tells us
" i learned to write , to paint , to use a cell phone , a computer , things i like
" they were both encouraged to push beyond their physical limitations
more polio cases confirmed in @entity82 , @entity80 says @entity59 recently wrote a book about her experience growing up in the hospital
she also discovered painting , patiently dabbing at the canvas with a brush taped to a tongue depressor
the wear and tear on her teeth meant she had to limit herself but she has n't stopped
@entity2 trained as a computer animator and wrote a screenplay for an animated series
with the help of crowd - funding and a group of animators , the series is coming to life
" they 're inspirational , " says dr. @entity102 , a physician who has worked in the @entity63 since 1988
he says that when they have patients who have been paralyzed in car accidents they take them to spend some time with @entity2 and @entity108
" they 're examples to show it is n't the @entity111 , " he says
still , they both wish they could visit , or even live , in the outside world
" when i turned 10 , the hospital tried to convince my relatives to take me in , " says @entity2
" but that 's not what happened
" @entity2 's biggest passions are movies and videogames , opportunities to escape his own world
" i like to live outside my reality , " he says
" to get out of reality i play games , because in the games i can go where i want without suffering any pain
" there was a decade of freedom when @entity2 used an electric wheelchair to come and go with relative ease
but then post-polio syndrome set in , causing gradual weakening in muscles that were affected by the original infection
it became impossible for him to straighten his legs enough to sit in a wheelchair -- so travel is now only done lying down in hospital beds
but that has n't stopped him
on one of our visits he invites us to join him on an outing to a big videogame convention
moving around is complicated -- he travels in an ambulance with medical technicians paid for by donations
another complication : the respirator
@entity2 does n't need it 24 hours , but he feels more secure , having it just in case
but once inside the videogame convention , we enter @entity2 's world
he laughs with excitement as a group of medical technicians and friends roll him around on a mobile hospital bed
then he tries his hand at a few games
" you do n't pay attention to anything else around you , " he says
" it 's great , you just want to discover more
" for a day , at least , the tubes , the respirator , the hospital bed , they all fade into the background , and @entity2 becomes invincible .
