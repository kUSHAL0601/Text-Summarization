@entity0 , @entity1 -- across the country , insurance companies , trial lawyers and legislators are closely watching a november referendum in the state of @entity1 that could change how insurers are required to treat their customers
insurance companies are using the referendum process to try to strike down a new law in @entity1
insurance giants like @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 have poured more than $ 8 million into the referendum battle
their goal is to convince voters to reject a law passed earlier this year that could force insurers to pay up to triple damages and lawyer fees if they fail to pay a legitimate claim and then lose in court
a " yes " vote on the referendum allows the law to go into effect while a " no " vote strikes the law down
supporters of the law say it forces insurance companies to pay legitimate claims in a timely and fair fashion and frees the courts from relatively minor cases that clog the system for months and even years
one supporter , the @entity41 , has raised almost $ 900,000 to fight the insurance industry over the referendum
" insurance companies have figured out that they can make more money if they do n't pay your claim , '' said @entity1 rep. @entity44
@entity44 and his fellow @entity1 state lawmakers heard so many complaints from policy holders who believed insurers were n't treating them fairly that earlier this year they passed a law called " @entity55
" hearings were held , the bill was revised -- even watered down , according to @entity44 -- and both the @entity58 and @entity59 passed it
the governor readily signed it
but the very next day a coalition , funded primarily by insurance companies , moved in to stop the law from going into effect by filing petitions for a voter referendum on the law
representatives of the insurance industry say the law will raise premiums and that the system is working fine as it is
the law , they said , will only make things worse , and they want voters to have the final say
" the insurance companies stepped in and said , ' consumers , you get to decide if you want to do this , ' '' said @entity77 , executive director of the @entity78 , which is leading the insurance company charge to defeat the new law
@entity77 said the state 's own insurance commissioner sees no need for the law
" his own information that he provided to the legislature and the public says that this law simply is n't necessary , '' @entity77 said
but that 's not what insurance commissioner @entity93 told @entity2 in a recent interview in @entity0
@entity93 said he strongly supports the new law and that if insurance companies act responsibly they have nothing to fear
" if companies act in good faith , [ they are ] not going to have a problem , " @entity93 said
" it 's not going to cost any more money
there 's not going to be any legal action
there 's going to be no treble damages , because if companies deal with their customers in good faith there 's no penalty
" the campaign to woo voters has already begun
the insurance industry - backed group is already running television commercials depicting greedy lawyers planning to sue and warning consumers that the law will lead to frivolous lawsuits and higher rates
it 's not a new tactic by the insurance companies
earlier this year , @entity2 exposed a controversial insurance industry strategy that began in the mid- 1990s
former insiders say insurance companies began limiting or denying legitimate claims in minor injury cases and reaped billions in profits as a result
the strategy has tied up courts across the country -- over minor claims , judges told @entity2 -- for months and even years
how did they do it ? " it really came down to basically three elements : a position of delay , a position of denying a claim and ultimately defending that claim that you 're denied , " said @entity138 , a former insurance industry insider
but @entity147 , with the industry - backed @entity148 , said the strategy was not intended to deny valid claims but to attack fraud , which , he claimed earlier this year , was rampant in minor accident cases
" what insurers are doing is trying to monitor costs
and every insurance company is under the same pressure to do it , " @entity147 said
@entity1 resident @entity159 plans to vote for the law because she says she has experienced the strategy first - hand
she says her two accidents convinced her insurance companies do n't want to play fair
@entity164 was working for an insurance company when she got rear - ended on the freeway
ten weeks later she got hit again , this time by an uninsured motorist
the two accidents , she said , resulted in back injuries that required medical treatment
the first company agreed to pay but her own insurer , @entity14 , refused to pay even though she had coverage
" i just wanted my medical bills paid because i did n't want my credit being hurt , '' @entity159 said , adding that the total came to about $ 18,000
she said @entity14 dug into her medical past
" they brought out stacks of medical records , you know , to see if i was at all deceptive
" an arbitrator sided with @entity164 , but @entity14 refused to pay
the case went to court , where a jury , too , ruled for @entity186
finally , four years after the accident , the company paid her claim
@entity14 said it could not comment on individual claims but said cases like @entity164 's prove " that the current judicial system is working
