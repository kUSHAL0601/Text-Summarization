-- a @entity2 woman accused of killing her toddler daughter and dumping the body in @entity5 has been found guilty of murder by a jury in @entity5 , @entity2
@entity8 received a life sentence without possibility of parole in the murder of her daughter
@entity8 , 20 , showed no emotion as the verdict was read late monday
@entity8 had pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence in the case , but pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charge
she received a life sentence without the possibility of parole
the body of @entity8 's daughter , @entity23 , was found in october 2007 in a large blue plastic container on an uninhabited island in @entity5
two - year - old @entity23 's case drew national attention after a fisherman found her body
authorities did n't know her identity , and police dubbed her " @entity33
" after authorities distributed composite sketches of the girl nationwide , @entity34 , the girl 's paternal grandmother , contacted police from her @entity41 home to say the drawing resembled her granddaughter
dna testing confirmed the child 's identity
according to an affidavit , @entity8 told police @entity49 had been beaten and thrown across a room and that her head was held under water before she died on july 24 , 2007
another piece of evidence shown to the jury during the trial was a page of @entity8 's journal where she talked of beating the child , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity60
" i just kept hitting her with the belt again and again
i do n't know how long , but i remember her trying to get away and me knocking her back down , " the journal said
@entity8 's husband , @entity65 , 25 , also faces capital murder and evidence tampering charges , but is being tried separately
a court date has not been set in that case .
