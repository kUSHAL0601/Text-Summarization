-- @entity1 and his bride , @entity2 , look like an ad for their @entity5 resort , glowing , in love and sun - kissed in paradise
the picture does n't tell the whole story
@entity1 , a @entity12 , said the resort had no record of the couple 's reservation for the honeymoon suite , leaving them half - asleep in the lobby until the middle of the night
the private beach ? not so private , with wandering drug dealers who did n't take kindly to the @entity24 graduate and his wife declining their products
" the @entity5 pics being quite different than the story was an accident , " said @entity1 of @entity27 , @entity28
" i wish i had pics of the ( possibly human ) bone fragment ( i found on the beach ) , the cop giving me a hard time when i reported it , the massive storm that flooded @entity33 's and stranded me there for three hours while my wife thought i 'd been kidnapped for ransom , and on and on
" it might have been the vacation from hell , but it seems that any trip can be turned into a great tale with amazing pictures
inspired by the true stories behind picture - perfect photos , we asked @entity0 's @entity51 to share their dream vacation photos and the real stories behind them
almost everyone had amazing and sometimes horrifying stories that the camera did n't catch
10 budget friendly all - inclusive resorts they did n't let illness ruin their trip @entity62 , another ireporter , had hoped for lovely times with her mother during a three - week vacation through @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , the @entity70 and @entity71
her aunt joined them for part of the trip
it did n't go as planned
less than a week after they arrived , her mother got a cough that turned into a viral chest infection
a few days later , her aunt had a heart attack
@entity81 started to feel sick the next day and visited a hospital emergency room just to make sure she was ok
the special night out she planned for her mother 's birthday , including a dinner cruise down the @entity88 ? they did n't make it
despite their illnesses , @entity81 does n't dwell on the negative aspects of the trip when she looks through her pictures
" one of the best things for me was to spend about a week and a half with my aunt and get to know her from the perspective of an adult , " wrote @entity81 , an @entity97 , @entity98 resident , in an e-mail
" the trip to the @entity107 ( in @entity67 ) was amazing and worth the entire 13.5 hours it took us , as we did it as a day trip , " she wrote
" my mum , who was born in @entity68 , had always wanted to see @entity113 and was finally able to do so
that was good for her to see it and for me to be the one to take her
" five beautiful bike trips attack of the killer sand flies @entity119 , an ireporter from @entity121 , @entity122 , loves to take pictures and was immediately drawn toward @entity124 , " a little jewel of an island where we could have some scenic solitude " for his honeymoon
the happy couple knew that they would n't have air conditioning , which would n't have been a problem if sand fly season had n't started earlier than usual
" my wife would like me to clarify that we did n't just itch a little from bugs , " he added
" we actually spent most nights getting to sleep with her on the couch and me in the other room because we fell asleep whenever we became too exhausted to stay awake
" the highlight of the trip ? visiting the island 's only hospital in search of relief from the itching
" the hospital was an old , barely staffed facility in which half of the equipment used was outdated and / or rusted , " he wrote
" she chose to take antihistamine in pill form as opposed to getting a shot because we could n't help but question the sterility of the environment
" he said , " now almost exactly a year later the memory of the biting pests has faded for me , not so much for my wife , and we are left with pictures that would make it hard to believe that we were treated to anything less than paradise during our first week of marriage
" @entity168 does n't blur the memories while photos usually gloss over the back story , they 're great for calling up those cherished , if not picture - perfect , family memories
@entity176 @entity12 @entity175 and his wife recently scanned a collection of family camping trip photos from 20 years ago to create photo books for their grown children , now 24 and 28
looking through pictures of the @entity98 and @entity183 , the @entity184 , the @entity186 and @entity187 coasts and the @entity188 sparked many memories not documented in the collection
@entity191 can clearly remember his daughter , " at age 5 sitting , arms folded and crying because she was having difficulty setting up her tent , or the moose that would n't let me out of the campground shower building for several minutes
" " my son and daughter set up and slept in their own tents , starting at a very young age
everyone pitched in , from gathering fire wood to preparing meals to cleaning up
we were lucky to see and experience many wonderful things
we all remember our meals , some of the best food ( ever ) cooked over the fire
" the photo books were a hit with his kids during a recent family celebration
" they were completely surprised , " he wrote
" the day 's celebrations basically stopped while they slowly flipped through the books
" @entity191 said he 's also grateful that his 90 - year - old father is dedicated to reviewing and scanning his collection of photos that date back to @entity191 's great - grandparents ' days
" every image tells a story , some short -- some longer , " he wrote
" it 's not uncommon for an e-mail trail to go on for weeks , becoming pages long , containing the discussions these images conjure up from the recipients
" the pictures offer some perspective ireporter @entity241 was taking a day trip to @entity244 , across the @entity245 in @entity246 , when the skies decided to open up
as @entity241 ducked into a small shelter along the river to stay dry , children began to play in the rain , and an amazing photo opportunity presented itself
" in the tropics , the people deal with the rain as a minor inconvenience , and do n't let it hinder their mobility , " he wrote
" from the vantage point of the shelter , i was able to snap off pictures of people coming and going through the intersection
" he added , " i made it to one more vantage point , an open restaurant near the ferry drop - off
this was a very vibrant spot as people arriving from the @entity245 side , were on their way home
they were n't concerned about being drenched as they were getting close to home
" one man 's washout is another 's photo opp
and the rest of the world just goes about its business
