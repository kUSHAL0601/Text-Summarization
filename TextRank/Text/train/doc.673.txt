-- october 29 , 2009 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity14 , @entity15 : today marks a milestone for the stock market , one that most people probably do n't want to celebrate
we 'll explain why in a bit
sitting in for @entity24 , i 'm @entity25
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : first up , officials in @entity5 are speaking out against the most violent attack to strike the country this year
it happened yesterday in the city of @entity4 , when a car bomb exploded in a busy marketplace that 's popular with women
more than a hundred people were killed by the blast and at least 200 others were injured
the bomb sparked fires that quickly spread through nearby fabric stores
the attack happened just hours after secretary of state @entity43 arrived in @entity5 to take part in meetings about the nation 's fight against the @entity48
she issued a challenge to the people responsible for yesterday 's violence
@entity43 , @entity53 secretary of state : if the people behind these attacks were so sure of their beliefs , let them join the political process
let them come forth to the people of @entity5 in this democracy and make their case that they do n't want girls to go to school ; that they want women to be kept back ; that they believe that they have all the answers and that the rest of us who are people of faith have none
@entity70 @entity27 : back in @entity6 , president @entity71 has signed a law that makes it a federal crime to assault someone because of his or her sexual orientation
the new legislation was included in a defense spending bill and it expands on the government 's existing hate crimes law
some critics of the expanded law argue that it 's not necessary to specify one particular group
they believe the existing hate crimes law protected people based on their sexual orientation
there 's also some concern that the law could be used against people who may say something controversial , although government officials say it will only be used in the case of violent acts
@entity95 @entity27 : and president @entity71 took part in another ceremony yesterday , this one honoring @entity98 , who you see there on the right
he was the first @entity103 elected to the @entity104 by popular vote
and yesterday , mr. @entity98 was awarded a @entity95 , @entity107 ' highest civilian honor
@entity108 served as a @entity109 senator from @entity110 from 1967 to 1979
during yesterday 's ceremony , president @entity71 said @entity108 ran for office in order to bring people together who had never been together before
and former senator @entity108 had a similar message yesterday as he urged political leaders to put politics aside and come together
@entity120 @entity121 , @entity15 : today 's first @entity122 goes out to mrs. @entity124 's 2nd period journalism class at @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127
@entity128 is the @entity130 god of war
who is his @entity133 counterpart ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity139 , b ) @entity140 , c ) @entity143 or @entity144 ) @entity145 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity139 is the god of war in @entity133 mythology
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity151 @entity27 : and now , @entity139 might help people reach @entity128
huh ? we 're talking about @entity154 and its @entity155 , which includes the new @entity157 rocket
after several days of delays due to bad weather , a test flight of the new @entity139 rocket launched yesterday , climbing 24 miles above the @entity163
according to @entity154 , this is the largest rocket in the world
the craft is scheduled to replace the space shuttle , and might one day take astronauts to the moon , @entity128 and beyond
before yesterday 's launch , @entity170 checked in with a preview of @entity154 's new program
( begin video ) @entity175 , @entity0 correspondent : on launch pad a , the space shuttle
it is the present and soon to be the past
on pad b , the @entity157 rocket ; the future , maybe
built to replace the retiring shuttle fleet , @entity139 would be the first vehicle since the @entity143 years to take humans out of low @entity163 orbit , perhaps to @entity128
@entity187 , vice president , @entity189 : it behooves us to build an architecture that can serve a multitude of missions for those next 50 - plus years
and that 's where this was first envisioned , was to think about space station , lunar , asteroids , beyond
@entity201 : the @entity202 has still not decided whether @entity139 , built with a budget as thin as the rocket itself , should be the shuttle 's replacement
@entity154 and the rocket 's developers have pressed ahead
over the summer , the rocket segments were put together in the vehicle assembly building
the upper part of the rocket is made up of dummy segments designed to mimic the real deal
the lower stage of four segments of solid rocket will burn for two minutes , producing 3 million pounds of thrust
the entire vehicle is filled with a web of 711 sensors
@entity224 , @entity157 program manager : the goal of an early flight test is to get the test off early enough that you can actually use that data to influence and make course corrections , if you will , to the design on the full vehicle
@entity201 : but course corrections might cause further delays
the first flight with humans sitting in a capsule on top of the rocket wo n't take place until 2015 , at the earliest
at least five years after the last space shuttle flight
@entity242 : booster ignition , liftoff of space shuttle discovery ! ( @entity246 ) shoutout @entity247 @entity248 , @entity15 : time for a @entity249 ! @entity250 's infamous " black tuesday " happened in what year ? you know what to do
was it : a ) 1929 , @entity254 ) 1953 , c ) 1987 or @entity144 ) 2008 ? another three seconds on the clock --- go ! october 29 , 1929 is referred to as black tuesday
that 's your answer and that 's your @entity249 ! black tuesday @entity27 : do the math , and that means that today is the 80th anniversary of black tuesday
it 's called that because on that day in 1929 , the @entity264 , which gives an idea of how the whole stock market is doing , dropped nearly 13 percent
it became the most famous stock market crash in @entity53 history
and many experts point to it as the start of the @entity273 , a global economic slump that would last almost a decade
@entity275 takes a look back at that fateful day
( begin video ) @entity278 , @entity279 : this is where everything started
and for centuries , this is where everything happened
@entity275 , @entity0 correspondent : the crash
no , not last year 's stock market plunge , but the @entity289
it all went down 80 years ago this week
@entity291 : 1929 was the greatest fall in the @entity264 over a two - day period
in today 's terms , it would be like a 2,200 - point drop
@entity296 : @entity297 and lifelong friend @entity298 give tours every anniversary of the @entity289
@entity301 , @entity279 : this whole area was filled with people who had come down to see what was going on
@entity305 : the tremendous crowds which you see gathered outside the stock exchange are due to the greatest crash in the history of the @entity312 in market prices
@entity296 : quite a shock , especially because the friday before , following a large drop , newspapers proclaimed the stock market crisis was over
@entity305 : but in october 1929 , the @entity250 bubble burst
@entity296 : the historic collapse was just starting , eventually leading , many believe , to the @entity273
@entity305 : and then it actually loses 89 percent of that value in the stock market crash in 1929
@entity296 : at the @entity324 on @entity250 , a ticker - tape machine from the crash days
the end of a mania for stocks based on easy credit
@entity331 , @entity332 : it 's leverage
i mean , we learned in the latest financial crisis that firms and individuals can take on too much leverage
that 's exactly what they did in the 1920s
@entity296 : a familiar replay to someone born during the crash years
@entity346 , museum visitor : it did have the smell of the same thing happening again
@entity296 : the crash experts say a famous story is true
at the market 's peak , tycoon @entity352 , patriarch of the @entity7 clan , hearing stock tips from a shoeshine man and selling stocks short , making a fortune
do you give out stock tips to anyone , like the famous shoeshine man of 1929 ? @entity364 , @entity365 : no , i do n't
no , i do n't
@entity296 : but he did shine the shoes of @entity7 's grandson , @entity367 says he is the last shoeshine man left on @entity250
i really had a bad year in the market , so i ca n't pay you right now , but i 'm -- no , i 'm going to pay you
@entity275 , @entity0 , @entity372
( @entity246 ) promo @entity27 : you 've probably noticed that @entity24 is off this week
but before he left , he broke out the video camera and talked to some of his co-workers about why they enjoy working at @entity0
you can check out their responses in the newest video on our @entity382 page
find it at @entity382 / cnnstudentnews
before we go @entity27 : before we go , @entity386 always brings out some interesting activities
like @entity389 's annual coffin race ! at least , that 's what these are supposed to be
they look more like man - powered go karts
either way , the event seems to be a crowd pleaser
basically , the boxes are put on wheels , and then contestants tear down a track that 's nearly two football fields long ! of course , the coffin race is part of a seasonal festival ... goodbye @entity27 : ... so it 's just about fun
there are no grave consequences
we hope to see you again tomorrow as we wrap up the week
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity25 .
