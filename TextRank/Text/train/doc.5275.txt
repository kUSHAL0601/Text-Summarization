-- through some highly successful crowdfunding and skillful negotiation , the last remaining laboratory of futurist inventor @entity4 is now in the hands of a nonprofit group that wants to preserve the site and make it a museum honoring " the father of the electric age
" the @entity12 announced that it 's completed the purchase of the building and land of @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , after trying for more than 18 years
the original asking price was $ 1.6 million , but the deal closed for $ 850,000
last year , the nonprofit made a plea on the internet for donors
@entity4 fan @entity25 , creator of the web cartoon " @entity25 , " started an @entity30 crowdfunding effort irreverently titled " @entity12
" fans of @entity4 's responded , raising more than $ 1 million in about a week before wrapping up with $ 1.37 million
the @entity16 was to be where @entity4 realized his dream of developing wireless communications and clean , free energy for the world
it was never completed , and the building was later used by a photo processing company , leaving the area tainted with chemicals
the money left over after the purchase will be used to clean up and renovate the property
the ultimate goal , an interactive science museum honoring @entity4 , will require much more cash
" now begin the next important steps in raising the money needed to restore the historic laboratory , " @entity49 , treasurer of the @entity12 , said in a statement
" we estimate that we will need to raise about $ 10 million to create a science learning center and museum worthy of @entity4 and his legacy
we invite everyone who believes in science education and in recognizing @entity4 for his many contributions to society to join in helping to make this dream a reality
" on his website , @entity64 thanked donors and said an event is planned this summer in @entity17 to help finance the science center
musical performances , lectures , interactive exhibits and tours -- with @entity64 as one of the guides -- are planned during the two - day event
@entity64 also plans a special @entity4 demonstration during the event
" i own a fully functional @entity4 coil cannon and i plan to bbq some sriracha - bacon sandwiches by shooting them with its 20,000 volt electric arc , so the event will be both scientific and delicious , " @entity64 wrote on his site
" again , we 're shooting for this summer but we have n't pinned down a date yet
" the @entity12 is also calling on volunteers to come out saturday to assist in the cleanup along the perimeter of the site
interested people can sign up using @entity90 , which is helping organize the event
largely forgotten for decades in the shadows of inventors like @entity94 , @entity4 has emerged in recent years as a sort of unsung hero among the science - minded
@entity4 foresaw the need for wireless transmissions in the late 1800s -- a hundred years before anyone picked up a cell phone
but @entity4 's work lost much of its financial backing after inventor @entity104 sent radio signals across the @entity106 , and the lab site was lost in 1915
now , the nonprofit group hopes to soon be welcoming visitors who can understand and appreciate all the accomplishments and ideas envisioned by the inventor
" this is a major milestone in our almost two - decade effort to save this historically and scientifically significant site
we have been pursuing this dream with confidence that we would eventually succeed , " said @entity119 , vice president of the @entity12
" we are very excited to be able to finally set foot on the grounds where @entity4 walked and worked
