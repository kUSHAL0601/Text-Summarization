-- @entity1 are backing a ground breaking new scheme to allow their supporters to buy affordable shares in the club and have a greater say over how it is run
the @entity10 club are supporting the " @entity16 " initiative , which offers the opportunity to purchase shares at a fraction of the normal market rate
buying one " fanshare " will allow a member to quiz @entity1 's directors on key decisions and cast their vote on the direction of the club , similar to how @entity25 champions @entity24 are set up
@entity26 ( @entity26 ) has set up the scheme to boost fan representation , and it has now been backed by all four of the north @entity31 outfit 's major shareholders
currently , one share in @entity1 costs over $ 15,000 but " fanshare " members can buy them for a hundredth of the price , beginning at a down payment of just $ 150
those who sign up can even pay in monthly installments , starting at just $ 15 , and their " fanshare " will grant them the rights of a shareholder , including entry to a ballot for a chance to attend the club 's annual general meeting
" the support @entity16 has from all of the club 's major shareholders should allow all talk of a takeover to be put to one side , " said @entity16 board member and @entity26 spokesman @entity48
" @entity16 has been established to increase supporter ownership and representation
" we urge all @entity1 fans to take this opportunity and get involved - by working together we can make @entity1 even stronger
" at present , 88 per cent of the club is spread between four majority shareholders : @entity63 sports tycoon @entity62 , @entity65 businessman @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity67
@entity62 has repeatedly upped his stake in @entity1 and now stands just ten shares short of 30 per cent - the figure that under @entity72 takeover law would mean he is compelled to make an offer for the remaining shares
@entity26 fights to prevent the club being bought by one wealthy individual and wants supporters to snap up " fanshares " that can then be bound together .
