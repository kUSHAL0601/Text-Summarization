i will talk us into getting the cash ...
i will work my magic ...

@entity16 is said to have responded , " i know
it 's all right there in front of us
pretty soon we 'll be having lunch in our oceanfront restaurant ...
" around january 2012 , after learning that @entity25 was considering using someone else to get the information , @entity14 allegedly sent this text to @entity82 : " i want to kill ( @entity25 ) ...
i hung my ass out the window n we got nothing ? ...
