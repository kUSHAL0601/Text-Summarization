-- @entity2 's prime minister friday slammed those engaged in human trafficking after an explosion aboard a boat carrying @entity8 refugees killed three people and injured more than 40 others near @entity11 , off @entity2 's northwest coast
" people smugglers are engaged in the world 's most evil trade and they should all rot in jail because they represent the absolute scum of the earth , " prime minister @entity16 told reporters
" we see this lowest form of human life at work in what we saw on the high seas yesterday
that 's why this government maintains its hardline , tough , targeted approach to maintaining border protection for @entity2
and that 's why we have dedicated more resources to combat people smuggling than any other government in @entity2 history
" the boat was carrying 49 refugees , officials said
in addition to the three killed , two others were missing
@entity16 would not comment on the cause of the explosion , citing the ongoing investigation
the prime minister acknowledged that human smuggling was an increasing problem exacerbated by " global factors " but defended his government 's border security policies
" our staff , our naval staff , our coast watch staff , our aerial surveillance staff and others , our police , are doing a first class job backed up by our intelligence officers as well , also in collaboration with partners across the region , " the prime minister said
" because it is a global phenomenon and we are finding push factors operating from around the world , our active partnership with international governments and international agencies like the @entity65 is equally critical
this is a fight on many fronts
it is a fight which we have been engaged in for some time and a fight which other governments around the world are equally engaged in with us
" @entity16 said the refugees ' requests for asylum " will be treated under the normal provisions of the law through the examination of each of their individual cases
