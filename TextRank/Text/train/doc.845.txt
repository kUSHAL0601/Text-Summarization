-- sailing the @entity3 on a perfect blue - sky day , @entity2 survivor @entity1 knew this would have been a beautiful moment to share with @entity7
she looked down from the deck of the 125 - foot @entity9 to see dozens of playful dolphins swimming alongside the tall - masted sailing ship as it cut through the waves off @entity14
as the 26 - year - old held a glass bottle filled with pictures and handwritten notes , @entity1 's eyes moved across the southeast horizon toward a painful spot she knew was about 25 miles away
she could n't help but picture what happened there aboard the @entity2 exactly a year ago tuesday
the leaking , aging ship sailed into what would become the largest hurricane in generations
as the category 1 storm churned about 100 miles off @entity33 , @entity30 's battering winds and towering waves flipped the 180 - foot ship sideways , spilling @entity1 and her shipmates into the water
the body of capt. @entity38 , 63 , was never found
@entity7 , a 42 - year - old rookie sailor , died after @entity40 rescuers were unable to revive her
their deaths and the sinking of perhaps the most famous tall ship in the world spurred an investigation that could still lead to new safety regulations and criminal charges
the story of the sinking : life & death on the bounty the bottle in @entity1 's hand contained notes from fellow survivors , past @entity2 crew and loved ones
her note to @entity61 read , " i 'm so sorry
" " even now , i ca n't really form any words other than those , " @entity1 said friday from aboard the @entity9
her voice trembling with emotion , @entity1 said @entity7 's death " was such a huge loss for a lot of people
she really , really trusted us
" ' a part of me sank with the boat ' drawn by the romance of a freewheeling , seafaring lifestyle , @entity61 hoped to learn the ins and outs of a complicated three - masted square - rigger
when they met , @entity7 told @entity1 she 'd always wanted to send off a message in a bottle , to take part in that universal time - honored tradition of the ocean
" we were going to do it sometime during the passage , " @entity1 remembered
now , so close to the site and after all that happened , a message bottle seemed even more appropriate
she thought back to the wailing wind , pelting rain and fear that she and her shipmates experienced in the early morning darkness of october 29 , 2012
the disaster set them on an emotional and psychological course that some of them still struggle to correct
in the minutes after the tipping ship tossed the crew into the water , @entity1 -- who was tethered to her boyfriend , @entity104 -- felt herself being pulled underwater by her tether line , which had snagged on sinking debris from the ship
@entity1 realized she was about to drown
that thought triggered a frenzy to fight and free herself from the tether
she verged on passing out and even inhaled seawater
wriggling out of the tether just in time , she finally broke the surface and sucked in precious gasps of air
fourteen of @entity2 's 16 - member crew survived the next grueling hours thanks to gps locator beacons , life rafts and @entity40 rescuers
the trauma left @entity1 feeling embarrassed , ashamed , angry and sad
since the rescue , @entity1 has been afraid to sail on open water in the high seas
it was quite the opposite while growing up
with roots in @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , @entity1 had always loved the vastness of the ocean , training for a seafaring career at the prestigious @entity137
what happened aboard the @entity2 , she said , has left her damaged : afraid to dive underwater near big ships , fearful of sleeping below deck , especially during rough seas
when the fear comes , her heart races
reminders of the disaster still come too often
" i felt like a part of me sank with the boat
a sort of innocence was just gone
" overhearing comments about the @entity2 crew being " reckless " or that they 're " loving the attention " made @entity1 mad
she said people often do n't understand the lingering emotional trauma brought on by disasters , like when she 's driving and suddenly the tears start welling up , forcing her to pull over
they " do n't see the side like when i had to interrupt my job conducting boat tours to go cry in a @entity162
" dealing with all this has been hard , @entity1 said
" i 've never been that sort of person before
" despite her own struggles , @entity1 also wants to somehow transform the tragedy into a force to help others
' use your brain and your gut ' one morning in early october on the campus of the @entity174 , @entity1 walked into @entity175
the lecture room was packed with about 150 students and faculty
" i was so nervous , " @entity1 said
" i had no idea what to say
" nonetheless , she stood at a small podium and shared her story , offering guidance on how others might save their own lives after abandoning ship
she joked about funny things that go through some people 's minds during desperate times
for some reason , she thought it was important to bring her car keys with her before the ship sank , and another crew member chose to bring his teddy bear
she also talked about how her " training clashed with what i was told " when the crew was instructed to put on their floating emergency immersion suits below deck instead of up top , where the storm raged
" what i took from that was , in situations like that , there are no rules except what you think will work best , " she said
" sometimes , you just have to use your brain and your gut
" the bottom line , she said , quoting a former instructor , is that " all you need is the will to survive
" for @entity1 , speaking to the students was " a chance to say thank you and to maybe help someone else
because other boats sink all the time , and you lose people at sea
" she has grown tired of some of the questions surrounding @entity38 's decision to sail while @entity30 churned
they ask , " what were you doing out there ? what was the captain thinking ? " " i tell them , ' i ca n't answer that for myself , and i ca n't answer that for you
' " " nobody intentionally puts themselves and their crew at risk , " said academy president @entity237
" but once you 've committed to a certain course of action , it 's often impossible to change your mind
it turned out to be the wrong choice
" the @entity40 and the @entity252 have spent the past year investigating the disaster for possible negligence and safety violations
the @entity40 report is under review and could be released at any time
it could lead to regulation changes -- and perhaps even a recommendation that criminal charges be forwarded to prosecutors
a $ 90 million civil lawsuit filed by @entity7 's parents against the @entity267 's owners is in settlement talks , a family attorney said
read more about the lawsuit a return to the high seas this past summer , @entity1 chose to fight to win back the person she was before
she needed to confront the high seas
" i really wanted to do an ocean passage and kind of conquer that fear , " she said
first , she " baby - stepped it " aboard ships that did n't venture too far out to sea
now , @entity1 works aboard the @entity9 as it sails from @entity279 to @entity280 , @entity131 , and then to its winter port in the @entity282 , her first real high - seas journey since the sinking
the past year has cast doubt on her dream of commanding a teaching vessel that toured young sailors around the world
" this was my passion , " she said
" i 've lost that , at least for the time being
" i can work on tugboats and other stuff , but it 's just not the same
" her desire to give back may lead to a new career path as a maritime instructor
in various ways , other @entity2 survivors , @entity1 says , are moving forward after the tragedy
she and fellow survivor @entity302 seek out books by other adventurers who 've overcome disaster
" it 's therapeutic to read other people 's struggles and not feel alone , " @entity1 said
most of @entity2 's survivors have returned to the water , gaining spots on other ships , said survivor @entity314
he 's between vessels after volunteering aboard a few tall ships in the @entity318 area
despite nearly drowning when the @entity2 sank , the 26 - year - old says , he has n't suffered any debilitating trauma
" i think about it a lot , " he said , " i might get a little sad , not angry - sad but sad
it just makes me want to go out again
" most of all , he misses sailing the high seas at night , the waves , a " good squall " and his favorite , climbing up the ship 's rigging
@entity267 life jackets found 400 miles from sinking site aboard the @entity9 -- not far from the site where the @entity2 went down last year -- @entity1 held the corked bottle filled with messages to capt. @entity38 and @entity7
the bottle , weighted with an iron shackle , is " the only way the message would get to them , " she said
symbolically , you might say the bottle also contained the crew 's countless painful struggles and disappointments during a difficult year
she let the bottle go
it tumbled into the water , beginning a secret journey to a final destination determined by currents and tides -- and life 's other infinite and random forces .
