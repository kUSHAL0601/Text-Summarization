-- convicted pedophile @entity1 could get his pension back , if @entity4 's pension board agrees with a recommendation to resume the almost $ 5,000 - per - month checks that he used to get
a state arbitrator made the recommendation friday after @entity1 appealed a ruling that he lost the right to his pension -- from working as an assistant football coach at @entity11 -- when he was convicted in 2012 of sexually assaulting 10 young boys
the arbitrator 's recommendation will probably go before the state board in the fall
both sides will first have a chance to respond to the recommendation
the arbitrator wrote in his opinion that @entity4 law did not allow for someone to lose a pension for @entity1 's crimes until 2004 , long after @entity1 's 1999 retirement from the university
before 2004 , people could lose their state pensions only if they 'd been convicted of financial crimes
since @entity1 was retired when the change was made , his lawyer appealed the ruling to stop his pension checks
it has no legal bearing that @entity1 was convicted of molesting several of the boys while he was employed by @entity11 , and on the campus where he worked
the recommendation has outraged some close to the case
" he should n't be receiving any benefits , especially benefits related to @entity11 , " said @entity43 , an advocate who has been working with @entity1 's victims
" i think it 's absolutely outrageous that he 's entitled to any benefits associated with the place where he offended upon so many young men
" attorney @entity53 , who has represented several of @entity1 's victims , called on lawmakers to change the law and make it retroactive
" i 'm disgusted by the fact that he 's going to continue to be paid by some form of taxpayers ' money , " @entity53 said
a jury found @entity1 guilty of 45 counts of child sex abuse in june 2012 , in a case in which the crimes were committed from the early 1990s through late 2009 .
