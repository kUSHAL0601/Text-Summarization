-- @entity2 's @entity1 returned to @entity3 on friday , completing an ambitious mission that notched up a series of breakthroughs for the country , including putting its first woman in orbit
@entity11 - 9 successfully carried out a manned space docking last week , making @entity2 the third country to complete such a feat after the @entity15 and @entity16
hanging from a parachute , the capsule floated back down to @entity3 on friday , bumping down on the arid terrain of @entity20 and rolling onto its side
support teams raced on foot and in vehicles to where the capsule lay to coordinate the three - person crew 's exit from the spacecraft
after an hour of preparation work in and around the capsule , the crew members emerged one by one , smiling and waving
they were helped into chairs , as their bodies were still adapting to the earth 's gravity after nearly two weeks of weightlessness
@entity36 came out first to applause from the ground staff
he was followed by @entity39
there was then a pause before the female crew member , @entity43 , made her way out
the three sat in a row in front of the capsule as @entity2 flags rippled in the wind behind them
still fully dressed in their spacesuits , they joined hands and were each handed a bouquet of flowers
@entity2 has made rapid , steady strides in developing its space program over the past decade , such as sending its first astronaut into space , completing its first spacewalk and launching two lunar orbiters
it has big aspirations for the program and hopes to build a space station and conduct a manned mission to the moon
@entity11 - 9 docked with the orbiting tiangong - 1 space laboratory last week
@entity68 , a prototype for a full - fledged space station , was launched into space in september
the crew of @entity1 followed that feat by executing a manual docking with @entity74 - 1 on sunday
mastering the technique of joining spacecraft together manually is considered an crucial step toward @entity2 's goal of building a space station in 2020
previously , the docking had been done by remote control from the ground
the endeavors have been a source of pride for @entity2 and coincided with the record - setting descent of a @entity2 manned submersible vehicle 7,020 meters into the @entity88 in the @entity89
they could help bolster support for the @entity92 as it undergoes a once - in - a - decade leadership transition later this year and deal with the fallout from the dramatic downfall of @entity97 , one of the country 's most prominent politicians
@entity0 's @entity100 and @entity101 contributed to this report .
