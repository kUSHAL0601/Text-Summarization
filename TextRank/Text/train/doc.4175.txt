-- a man accused of serial sex attacks in @entity4 was identified thursday , fours days after crashing his car into a light pole while fleeing the scene of one of his alleged assaults , authorities said
the suspect , @entity12 , 30 , was presented with charges related to seven sexual assaults even though he was in critical condition and unresponsive in a hospital since his car wreck sunday , @entity4 police chief @entity11 said thursday
@entity12 was identified as a suspect in the sex attacks after an analysis of a " tremendous amount of absolutely miraculous evidence collection and crime scene investigation , " @entity11 said
though the suspect had no criminal record in @entity4 , @entity11 said , he turned up in a @entity27 search of his name by police
it was a report of his car crash
the speeding car he was traveling in struck a light pole on an interstate early sunday morning about 10 minutes after one of his alleged sexual assaults , @entity11 said
@entity12 , who was not wearing a seat belt , suffered severe head injuries
" he has not been responsive at all , " @entity11 said
@entity12 was released from prison in late april after convictions in @entity40 for attempted robbery , attempted kidnapping and robbery , and robbery with a dangerous weapon , @entity11 said
he was imprisoned in 2007
the spate of sexual assaults and lack of clues had left residents on edge and looking out for anything unusual
" i hope this gives them some peace , " @entity11 said of the victims and community at large
authorities said the suspect typically broke into homes from the back , either through a window or door
he tended to be covered , and attacked when it was dark
victims provided diverse descriptions of the suspect , ranging from a light - skinned black or @entity69 man to a tan white man
there were eight cases of sexual assault in @entity4 in the last month and authorities linked them because of specific actions and statements the suspect made in the attacks
but police now say one of the eight assaults is still under investigation and may not be connected , @entity0 affiliate @entity81 reported
the victims were between 56 and 78 years old , except for one , who was 29
@entity12 's record includes arrests in 2002 for armed robbery , in 2005 for attempted assault on a woman , and in 2006 on a warrant for assault and battery , @entity81 reported
in 2006 , he was convicted for attempted battery
@entity11 said investigators were checking with police in @entity40 to see whether @entity12 was involved in additional crimes
no other arrests were expected in connection with the seven attacks , he said
@entity11 said prosecutors were preparing formal charges in the cases -- some of which involved alleged sexual battery , others alleged rapes
