@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the same day it ratcheted up its rhetoric against @entity5 , @entity1 on monday decided to put off an artillery drill on the island central to the latest conflagration between the two nations , state - run media reported
@entity1 military officials " delayed " the drill on @entity12 that had been scheduled for tuesday , according to the official @entity13
earlier , island residents had been told to move to bomb shelters for the drill
the announcement came as @entity5 stepped up its threats recently on its southern rival , as well as the @entity20 , if any military activities infringe on what the communist nation considers its territory
@entity1 earlier deployed more long - range artillery and rocket launchers to the border island in the @entity28 , which was struck by @entity30 shelling last week , according to military officials quoted by @entity13
also monday , @entity1 president @entity32 warned that @entity5 will face severe consequences if it launches another military attack across its southern border
" if the @entity38 commits any additional provocations against the @entity1 , we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail , " @entity32 said in a nationally televised address
" we are aware of the historic lesson that a disgraceful peace achieved through intimidation only brings about greater harm in the end
" @entity32 said monday that @entity1 " can not remain patient " in the face of continued hostility from @entity48
" fellow citizens , at this point , actions are more important than words , " @entity32 said in a televised address
" please have trust in the government and the military and support us
" the divided peninsula -- tense at the best of times -- has been near the boiling point since tuesday , when four people died in a @entity30 artillery barrage that targeted @entity12
@entity32 called the attack an " inhuman crime " that followed decades of attacks by @entity5 , including the sinking of the @entity1 warship @entity67 in march
@entity5 has consistently denied responsibility for the sinking of the @entity67 , which killed 46 @entity1 sailors
" it is difficult at this point to expect @entity5 to abandon its nuclear weapons or military adventurism , " @entity32 said
" we are now clearly aware that we can not stay patient and be generous
that will only give rise to bigger provocations
" @entity32 's address came a day after @entity1 and @entity20 forces started joint military exercises , prompting a furious response from @entity5
the aircraft carrier @entity84 joined @entity1 's forces near the coasts of @entity87 and @entity5 for the four - day drill , which the @entity89 called " no more than an attempt to find a pretext for aggression and ignite a war at any cost , " according to the official @entity95
@entity87 , @entity5 's closest ally , called sunday for an emergency meeting of the six major powers involved in talks about the @entity99
top diplomats from the six nations -- which also include @entity105 , the @entity20 and @entity106 -- need to meet soon to " maintain peace and stability on the peninsula and ease the tension " in the region , @entity101 's special representative for the region , @entity100 , said sunday
a top @entity87 envoy met with @entity32 on sunday , and a high - ranking @entity30 official will visit @entity101 on tuesday , @entity87 's @entity112 said
@entity1 said sunday that it did not think the time was right for a resumption of the six - party talks but said it would " bear in mind " the @entity87 proposal
in @entity84 , a @entity122 official said that the @entity20 is consulting with its allies but that resumed six - party talks " can not substitute for action by @entity5 to comply with its obligations
" " @entity130 steps by @entity5 are needed to demonstrate a change of behavior , " said the official , who was not authorized to speak for attribution
and @entity20 sen. @entity133 , @entity134 , said on @entity2 's " @entity135 " on sunday that the flare - up exposed the failure of " continued appeasement " of @entity5 by @entity140 and @entity141 administrations
he said the @entity20 has given @entity5 more than $ 1 billion in aid over the past 15 years with the goal of getting them to the negotiating table
" it seems the purpose of everything is to get the @entity30 to the table , " said @entity133 , the ranking @entity140 on the @entity146
" the @entity30 ' only claim to their position on the world stage is their nuclear capability
and they have a terrible , most repressive , oppressive regime in the world
they have hundreds of thousands of people in slave labor camps
and all of that seems to be sacrificed in the altar of , quote , ' negotiations
' " meanwhile , the @entity84 - based @entity163 called for " an end to the @entity20 - @entity1 provocations " and announced rallies in @entity167 and @entity168 and @entity169 , @entity170 , on monday
" the @entity20 and @entity1 governments have been pursuing a policy of deliberate provocation over the past several months , " targeting @entity5 and @entity87 , answer 's website states
" while hypocritically calling for ' calm ' in words , @entity84 is escalating the crisis by its actions , " it said , referring to the @entity20 - @entity1 military exercises and the @entity177 @entity84
in his monday speech , @entity1 's @entity32 said efforts to resolve the international standoff through negotiations and humanitarian assistance to the @entity89 were met with " nuclear development and the sinking of the @entity67
" he said the attack on @entity12 would have been unlawful even in wartime , adding , " i can not but be angered at their cruelty
" @entity5 said the @entity1 provoked the attack because shells from a @entity1 millitary drill landed in the @entity89 's waters
the @entity89 called reports of civilian casualties part of @entity1 's " propaganda campaign " and accused the " enemy " of creating " a human shield by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation
" the violence has sparked anger and political turmoil in @entity1
the country 's defense minister , @entity209 , resigned after the exchange of fire
veterans of the @entity1 military protested over the weekend on the streets of @entity0 , saying they were angry that their country 's government had not done enough to respond to the @entity38 's shelling
the tense maritime border between the two @entity220 has become the major military flashpoint on the @entity99 in recent years
the @entity12 attack was the first direct artillery assault on @entity1 since 1953 , when an armistice ended fighting
@entity89 are still technically at war
journalists @entity226 and @entity32 and @entity2 's @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .
