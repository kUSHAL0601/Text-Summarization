@entity0 -- a @entity3 magistrate is investigating @entity4 for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the mysterious 2009 crash of @entity8 into the southern @entity9 , according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman
judge @entity13 is presiding over the inquiry into the @entity4 - made plane , court spokeswoman @entity12 told @entity1 on thursday
the plane fell into the sea while traveling from @entity18 to @entity0 , killing all 228 people aboard
@entity21 , ceo of @entity4 , disagreed with the decision to commence the investigation , he said in a statement
" on behalf of @entity4 , i have noted the absence of facts supporting this step and stated our strong disagreement , " @entity21 said
" @entity4 maintains that the focus should be on finding the cause of this accident and making sure it can never happen again
@entity4 will continue to support the investigation , including the continued search for the flight recorders , which is the only sure way to know the truth , " @entity21 said
investigators have not yet established what caused the crash , and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found , despite an extensive search operation that included a @entity3 navy submarine
the plane went down in stormy weather , and most of the bodies were never recovered
studies of the debris and bodies that were found led @entity3 's air accident investigation agency , the @entity54 , to conclude the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact
oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the @entity54 revealed in a 2009 report
automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed , the investigators said , though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster
the area where the plane went down is far out in the @entity9 -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in @entity73 or @entity74 in @entity75
the rough underwater terrain includes mountains and valleys , the @entity54 said
@entity1 's @entity79 contributed from @entity80 .
