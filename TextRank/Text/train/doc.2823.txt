-- he 's just 15 and the world is seemingly already at his feet
last month , @entity4 became @entity6 's youngest international footballer in a friendly against the @entity8 , provoking huge media interest and the hungry attention of @entity12 's top clubs
such is the focus on the midfielder that 35 scouts from some of those teams -- including @entity18 and @entity19 of the @entity20 -- came to watch him at a recent under - 21 match
" in the beginning it was unreal and a little bit surreal that all these clubs wanted @entity4 , but it 's strange what you can get used to , " his father @entity22 tells @entity0
" almost every top @entity29 club has been in touch
" his international debut is not @entity4 's only record - breaking feat this year
in april he became the youngest player in the history of the @entity35 when he made his debut for @entity37 in a top - flight game against @entity39
he followed that up by scoring the fourth goal in a 4 - 1 win over @entity43 to become the youngest scorer in the @entity6 league
former @entity6 international @entity46 has described @entity4 's potential as " unbelievable , " while manager @entity48 -- who gave the teen his @entity37 debut before joining @entity51 club @entity50 -- says he can " become the best in the world
" @entity4 's father , a former footballer at @entity37 and @entity55 , recalls the moment when he realized his son might have what it takes to play professionally
" i saw from a very early age that ' he had the feeling , ' but i remember very well when i knew he 'd be quite good , " he said
" i was still playing and @entity4 must have been no more than eight
i was out on the pitch running some intervals
he was , as always , with me
when i was finished i wanted to go home , but we could n't before he had done 50 more shots ( at goal )
" then i understood he also had a talent for training and that is the most important talent you can have
" " quite good " probably does n't do @entity4 's myriad talents justice , given he has been compared to @entity76 or -- closer to @entity77 -- the legendary @entity79 international @entity78 , who played for @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82
" i 'm sure you can compare him with many , but i do n't like to do that , " reflects @entity22
" those players are and were so good and @entity4 is at the start of his career
" former @entity90 chief executive @entity89 , who is @entity6 and has watched @entity4 's progress over the last few months , is a fan
" he 's obviously still in the early stages of his development but his understanding of the game is very impressive , " says @entity89
" he plays in bursts , so you might not notice him for five minutes , but he has good movement and can take people on
" @entity100 , gifted and talented books such as @entity105 's " outliers , " @entity102 's " talent is overrated " and " @entity106 " by @entity107 all explore the idea that to become an expert you need to practice any skill for 10,000 hours
what 's clear from @entity4 's prodigious development is that his success has been helped by a specialized training regime and his thirst to learn and practice
" i have been a regional trainer for the best boys in this area , and i checked how much they trained with the team and by themselves , " says @entity22
" @entity4 is training more than double than these boys did -- at least 20 hours a week
" it 's not just how much he trains -- it 's also the type of training he has focused on by doing everything with the ball
" the boys loved it when i joked about other teams that warmed up with running instead of using the ball , " adds @entity22
" i always said that they should maybe do athletics
" @entity22 believes @entity4 has been able to cope with the demands of professional football and making his international debut at such an early age because of the work done to develop his first touch and " quick feet
" " it 's the pace of the game that makes the difference in adjusting to different levels , " says @entity22
" we 've used so many hours in working with his first and second touch to take off the pressure
" we have worked a lot on bringing the ball closely to his feet , so he can change direction quickly , so even if he 's physically weaker than the others he does n't get caught because he 's able to get away
" family fortunes now 40 , @entity22 admits that , as a player , he was " a runner with a big heart and scored some goals " -- so does @entity4 's talent come from his mother @entity153 ? " she played handball and sprinted , " says @entity22 , before joking : " she tells us she was fantastic , but none of us , or any others , has seen that
" while @entity22 's professional career has given him advantages in overseeing @entity4 's progression as a player , he admits it has given him difficulties as a father in his relationship with his son
" i was always afraid of favoring him
we were always changing captain , but he was never picked , " he says
" the expectations were high on him so it happened that i sometimes yelled at him and one day another parent came to me and said that i was too hard with @entity4
" then @entity4 and i agreed that he should always get the feedback when we were alone in the car after the game
that was a good solution
" we 've always -- and still do -- talked so much about football
his natural understanding for the game makes him a very smart player
since he was 10 i could discuss football with him as an adult
" stay or go ? @entity22 , who has so far avoided using agents to advise on his son 's career , concedes that " the level of the @entity6 league is n't as strong as many other @entity29 leagues
" so what 's next for the wunderkind from the port city of @entity193 who has already visited @entity18 as well as @entity196 clubs @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 ? @entity89 believes going to a country like the @entity201 would benefit the 15 - year - old
" if he went to some other countries they might take something out of his game , by telling him to get rid of the ball , " @entity89 says
" in @entity211 , they are not so concerned with the results
" whatever @entity4 does next , his father insists the decision will not be influenced by money
" in the end it 's all about development , " he says
i 'm allergic to boys who are satisfied getting into an academy or winning a first - team contract , because you have n't achieved nothing " it 's a danger when there 's so much attention to him from clubs and the media
i think he has handled it very well so far and he has his feet on the ground
" when we are talking with the clubs we have just talked about sport
we 're also in a position that it 's not obvious that he will go abroad now
" and amid all the hype and record breaking , @entity4 's father insists that his son 's education will not be forgotten
" he will still , of course , go to school
i do n't think it 's good for any young boy just to play football and @entity248
you need to work with your brain too and to develop as a person
