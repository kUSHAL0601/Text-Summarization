-- after years in the bronze age , when sun - kissed cheeks and gloss reigned supreme , fall 's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback
@entity10 outsold gloss by $ 76 million last year , and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever
we 'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly , along with the most flattering shades for day and night
for foolproof application , stick with sheer , subdued shades in the morning and save deep , bold colors ( which require more time and precision ) for night
condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen , like @entity27 with @entity28 20
" dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower , when your lips are still a little moist , " suggests @entity30 pro @entity29
the smoother your lips , the more perfect your lipstick will look
choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube
a hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color
blot , reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain , says @entity29
" the color looks more natural and lasts longer
" instead of tissues , use lint - free blotting papers , like @entity52 ( $ 10 )
exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy
@entity56 for @entity57 ( $ 10 ; at drugstores ) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches
create a base with a gel - based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly
one to try : @entity67 lip treatment ( $ 19 ; at drugstores )
define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding , says @entity74 , who gave @entity75 her deep fuchsia lip
to avoid an unnaturally dark outline , use a shade that 's lighter than your lipstick , like @entity82 lip liner in @entity83 ( $ 8 ; at drugstores )
brush on color for more control
try : @entity87 ( $ 35 ) with @entity89 lipstick in @entity90 ( $ 11 )
