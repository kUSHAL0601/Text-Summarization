-- @entity2 's victims , who were collectively swindled out of more than $ 50 billion , effectively recouped more than $ 2 million on saturday in an auction of the investment titan - turned - villain 's personal items
the @entity7 sold off nearly 500 pieces of personal property belonging to @entity2 and his wife @entity10 in @entity11 on saturday morning
the money raised through the auction goes the @entity15 @entity14 to compensate the victims of @entity2 's history - making fraud
" another chapter ( in the @entity2 saga ) ended here today , " deputy u.s. marshal @entity18 told @entity0 by e-mail
" all 489 lots of ill - gotten gains sold today and the proceeds will go toward something good for a change
" for months , @entity2 successfully avoided detention after his arrest for engineering a sprawling @entity29 , posting $ 10 million bail and cloistering himself with his wife in their $ 7 million @entity33 apartment
but he lost his freedom -- as well as access to his once vast wealth -- when he pleaded guilty in 2009 to 11 counts including money laundering and perjury
a judge , saying he had perpetrated " extraordinarily evil " crimes , later sentenced him to 150 years in prison
on saturday , some of @entity2 's riches taken from his homes in @entity11 and @entity48 , @entity49 , were on the auction block
several items went for significantly more money than had been expected in what the @entity7 's office deemed " a very successful day
" a 10.5 - carat diamond engagement ring fetched $ 550,000 at the auction -- appreciably more than the $ 350,000 auctioneers had hoped to get
a @entity59 grand piano , which had been expected to get $ 16,000 , went for $ 42,000 , while a pair of black velveteen slippers embroidered with the initials @entity63 in gold thread were sold for $ 6,100 , said @entity18
last year , the first auction of @entity2 's property brought in more than $ 900,000 , with most items selling for prices well beyond the highest pre-sale estimates
the 71 - year - old is now at the @entity71 , a medium - security prison in @entity73 , and scheduled to be released on nov. 14 , 2139
he masqueraded his investment firm as legitimate when it was nothing more than a front
he would use the funds from new investors to send payments to his more mature investors
he would falsely portray these payments as proceeds from investments , when they were actually stolen money
@entity0 's @entity86 contributed to this report .
