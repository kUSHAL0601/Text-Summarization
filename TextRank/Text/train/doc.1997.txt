audio recordings released on monday reveal confusion between air traffic controllers and the veteran crew of a @entity5 jet after they landed at the wrong airport in @entity7 in january
" i assume i 'm not at your airport , " one of the pilots radioed to controllers at @entity11 , the @entity13 's intended destination
" 4013 , um , have you landed ? " comes the response , according to the recordings released by the @entity18
" yea , " says the pilot , after a brief pause
then the controller calls to another air traffic facility for the area to inquire about the plane , and there is this exchange : " did you watch @entity5 land ? " " @entity30 , why ? " " did you see it come here ? they 're saying it landed at the wrong airport
" " are you kidding ? " " @entity30 , no , i 'm not
" the plane from @entity39 actually landed several miles away at a municipal airport in @entity41 , which does n't have a control tower
and that was n't all
the @entity41 airport 's runway is 3,738 feet , about half the length of the @entity11 runway , which is 7,140 feet
that forced pilots to act fast and brake hard when the aircraft with 129 passengers and crew touched down
no one was injured and the jet took off the next day
the pilots remain on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation , @entity5 said in a statement .
