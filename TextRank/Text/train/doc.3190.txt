@entity0 , @entity1 -- demonstrators stormed a hotel saturday where @entity6 leaders were to meet , forcing the indefinite postponement of the @entity9 summit
thousands of anti-government protesters block a busy intersection during rush hour in @entity0
participating @entity6 leaders were on their way out of the country , according to @entity1 prime minister @entity16
he declared a state of emergency in @entity19 province and the southern coastal city of @entity21 , where the summit was to be held , but rescinded the order hours afterward
thousands of " red shirt " protesters , named for the color of their attire , have rallied for days to demand @entity16 's resignation
the demonstrators flooded into the summit site after smashing through the hotel 's glass doors , but were otherwise nonviolent
hundreds of them streamed in , without police interference
protesters hugged the officers and shook their hands
the red shirts have given the prime minister repeated deadlines to resign , but those have come and gone
@entity42 secretary - general ban ki - moon he was disappointed by the summit 's delay
" i understand the circumstances that led the @entity1 government to take this difficult decision
while i had hoped to have exchanges with the leaders of @entity9 and its dialogue partners , i continue to look forward to engaging again with them in the near future , " @entity49 said
" i strongly value the long - standing relationship between @entity9 and the @entity42 , and their cooperation in various fields
i hope for an early restoration of normalcy in @entity1 and for the settlement of differences through dialogue and peaceful means , " he added
the protesters are loyal to former prime minister @entity66 , who was ousted in a 2006 coup
@entity66 now lives outside of @entity1
the protesters have said @entity16 's government was not democratically elected and want him to resign and schedule elections
@entity16 , who has held the position for four months , has rejected calls for him to step down
lawmakers named the 44 - year - old , @entity75 - educated @entity16 prime minister in december in the wake of months of demonstrations against @entity66 and his ruling party , @entity79
on tuesday , protesters rushed @entity16 's motorcade while it was struck in traffic
protesters opposed to @entity66 took to the streets last year wearing yellow shirts , occupied the @entity86 and blockaded @entity0 's major international airport , stranding throngs of tourists who provide much of the country 's revenue
the demonstrations ended in early december when a court ruled that the @entity79 was guilty of electoral fraud and threw @entity66 's brother - in - law out of the prime minister 's seat
the red shirt protesters said this week they would not take over the airports
