-- inside her @entity4 , @entity3 , kindergarten classroom , @entity1 has 24 cubbies , 24 tables and 24 seats
it 's a perfect fit for her 24 little students , no more
but come next fall , she expects that number will grow to 30
that 's when forced federal spending cuts , also known as the sequester , will kick in and start chipping away at education funding
" where will i put six more students ? " milders asked
" my young learners come to my classroom with little or no school experience
i not only need to meet their academic needs , but their social and emotional needs as well
" the government is set to cut $ 85 billion through the end of the fiscal year , september 30
of that money , $ 2.5 billion will be coming out of the @entity29 's $ 70 billion budget
uncertainties surround how these large cuts will affect schools , because the decisions will be made on the state and local levels
but with budget cuts looming , many teachers like @entity18 are wondering what 's left to cut
@entity1 , who has taught kindergarten for 17 years , worries that more cuts to education will not only affect her students ' ability to learn and grow , but also fears she will eventually be replaced by a younger and cheaper teacher , as she put it
" it happens often , " she said
the 42 - year - old teacher is certified to teach kindergarten through eighth grade , but she said because her pay is tied to students ' test results , it is difficult for her to move to higher grades
with the often short notice , it 's tough to be adequately prepared to prep her students for state tests
" many times teachers are not told what grade or building they will be teaching until as little as a day or two before classes begin , " she said
similarly , @entity63 , a newcomer to teaching from @entity65 , @entity66 , also said he feels left in the dark
the fifth grade teacher said it is hard for him to predict how forced spending cuts overall will affect him and his students
" in the past , my district has tried to keep budget cuts as far from the classroom as possible
in other words , they have -- and i 'm sure will continue to -- make every effort to meet their federal obligations while preserving as much personnel as possible
" but despite his district 's previous attempts to keep teachers and staff after budget cuts , the 33 - year - old is worried that schools will still be forced to cut vital resources for teaching
while he 's sure many professions have suffered from tightening budgets , he 's scared for his students
" i worry that technology which prepares students to compete globally will be seen as luxuries , not necessities , and thereby put our students behind the eight - ball , " he said
@entity63 's worry is justified
@entity101 students are lagging behind their international peers in other countries , ranking 25th among 34 countries in math and science , according to the @entity107
a study published in 2012 by @entity110 's @entity109 found that students in industrialized foreign countries were outpacing @entity101 students academically
countries like @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 were making education gains twice as fast as @entity101 students
@entity63 said he has seen how previous budget cuts affected his school when teachers ' aides were let go
to help curb spending , he tries to be more judicious with his limited school supplies
we 're not alone , " he said
" if i had time in the midst of all my other grading to grade @entity131 ' handling of this sequester , they would get an ' incomplete
' " but @entity131 is not the only player with something to lose in the budget cut battle ; president @entity136 is feeling the pressure , too
earlier this month , @entity136 's approval rating took a brief hit because of the budget sequester , dropping from 53 % to 49 % in the polls , according to @entity142
@entity63 is disappointed in @entity143 for letting the budget situation get this bad
" what i would like @entity131 to cut is the political theater that has in many ways led to this day , " he said
" i see the spending cuts as being symptomatic of a much deeper problem
" like @entity63 , @entity152 is more concerned with what forced spending cuts will mean for his students than his paycheck
he and his wife are both teachers in @entity159 , @entity160 , and for the past four years , he said , teachers in his area have endured 2 % to 3 % cuts to their salary
" so many of us are right on the edge financially that just 50 to $ 100 is enough to really hurt , " he said
in the past 30 years , teachers have seen their salaries shrink
on average , teachers make 14 % less than other professionals who work in jobs that require a similar level of education , according to the @entity176
even though the 48 - year - old science teacher is n't concerned about his own teaching salary , he fears budget cuts will start trickling into his classroom , where he teaches a handful of special education students
a loss in funding could mean he could lose his " collaborative teacher ; " the two work together so they can spend adequate time with each student individually
@entity190 also teaches special education students and said he is outraged after learning that forced spending cuts could potentially affect them
" i do n't think cutting special education works with any political ideology , " said the 26 - year - old teacher from @entity194 , @entity195
president @entity136 warned @entity131 that forced spending cuts would affect special education students and people with disabilities
special education programs could lose $ 840 million because of the cuts and 7,200 special education teachers , aides and staff members could lose their jobs
@entity190 has already seen the aftermath of previous budget cuts in his area ; he only works four days a week
that happened in 2011 after the district cut one special education position and a teaching position at his school in @entity216
as a result , the ratio of students to teachers at each grade level is approximately 25 to one , he said
in a two - hour reading block , @entity190 used to spend six minutes with each of his 20 students
but add five children to his classroom , and that gives him less than five minutes per child
" we all need more than that ; 4.8 minutes per kid is not a recipe for success , " he said
" i understand fiscal responsibility is important
but these are n't blind cuts , " he said
" i see them every day
and i think other people need to see them , too , " he said
@entity241 teacher @entity240 loves her job , but like @entity190 , she hates how education always seems to be on politicians ' chopping block
" it 's a bipolar world we 're living in , " she said
" on the one hand , lawmakers are mandating that we up our standards , while on the other they 're cutting funding
" in her area , the way teachers are evaluated is changing
more than 23 states are tying teachers ' salaries to students ' test scores
" bottom line is standards are changing , evaluations are changing -- and this is an even bigger deal when you consider we have n't seen salaries keep up with inflation -- while those who control our laws and our budgets are winning elections claiming they will get more accountability , more results out of us while shaving away dollars , " she said
as a high school journalism and film teacher , she worries that elective courses will be the first programs let go because of forced spending cuts
" add the federal cuts to state and local ( cuts ) and our future does n't look so bright , does it ? " but @entity1 , the kindergarten teacher from @entity3 , said the outlook for teachers does n't have to be so grim if the right cuts are made
she suggested @entity131 look into cutting school days from five to four
" longer days i know , but we could save on electric , water , food , fuel for buses , hourly employees
and let 's share administrators , " she said
when she was younger , @entity1 dreamed of being a teacher , but it 's a profession she is struggling to stick with as fears of more budget cuts threaten an already shrinking department
" those of us who became teachers to help children realize their full potential as learners are not just frustrated , we are heartbroken
