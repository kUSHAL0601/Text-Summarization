anti-riot police patrolled the @entity2 capital of @entity3 and elsewhere in the country tuesday as angry protesters took to the streets , damaging motor vehicles and burned used tires in a general strike , police and witnesses said
protesters from the country 's largest @entity14 party , @entity13 , clashed with police in @entity3 and other major cities , blocking roads and highways
the strike , taking effect all over the country , paralyzed daily life as road communications were heavily disrupted and schools and business establishments remained closed
the pickets also damaged a @entity29 embassy vehicle in the @entity31 area in @entity3 , leaving its driver and a police officer injured
" no diplomatic staff was inside the vehicle , which was going to the airport , " @entity31 police station chief @entity34 told journalists
@entity13 on its website claimed responsibility of the attack , but said it was " unexpected and unfortunate
" the @entity29 embassy in @entity3 in a media statement condemned the attack and said , " the ability to engage in peaceful protest is a fundamental democratic right ; there is no justification for the resort to violence
" " we call upon the perpetrators to be held accountable for this unprovoked attack on a diplomatic vehicle and its innocent occupants , " the statement said
in many areas , pickets clashed with police , who used teargas shells to disperse angry mobs
@entity13 called a strike on tuesday to protest the arrest and trial of its top leaders , who face charges of war crimes during the country 's war of independence in 1971
it was estimated that 3 million people were killed in the nine - month - long war that led to the breakup of @entity77 and the birth of @entity2
@entity13 opposed the breakup , sided with the @entity77 army and was later blamed for many killings .
