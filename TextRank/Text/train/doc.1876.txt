-- attorneys for a @entity3 detainee on a hunger strike say a @entity6 military nurse has refused to conduct forced feedings of inmates
@entity10 has been at the @entity12 base on @entity13 since august 2002 , attorney @entity9 told @entity0
@entity9 says @entity10 told her in a telephone call last week about the reported actions of the unnamed male nurse , believed to be a @entity12 medical officer
" initially , he did carry out his orders and participate in the tube feedings
but when he came , as soon as he saw what was happening , he started talking to the brothers , " meaning the inmates , @entity10 was quoted as saying
" he explained to us : ' before we came here , we were told a different story
the story we were told was completely the opposite of what i saw
' once he saw with his own eyes that what he was told was contrary to what was actually taking place here , he decided he could not do it anymore
" a @entity35 official late tuesday confirmed , " there was a recent instance of a medical provider not willing to carry - out the enteral feeding of a detainee
the matter is in the hands of the individual 's leadership
the service member has been temporarily assigned to alternate duties with no impact to medical support operations
" there are 147 personnel attached to the @entity51 , of which 83 are responsible for direct detainee care
details of the nurse 's refusal were first reported by the @entity56
the military refers to the controversial process as " enteral feeding , " which is designed to provide liquid nutrition and medicine via a tube inserted in the nose directly into the stomach
@entity0 was recently given a tour of the hospital at @entity3 , where the forced feeding procedures were demonstrated without the involvement of any inmate
@entity10 is part of a group of detainees who are participating in a hunger strike to protest their continued , open - end detention without charges being filed , said @entity9 , who works at the @entity77 - based legal defense group @entity76
@entity9 said it was believed to be the first time one of the @entity6 medical personnel has refused to carry out the feeding regimen
" this nurse showed incredible courage -- to see the basic humanity of the prisoners and to recognize that force - feeding is wrong is a historic stand , " @entity9 told @entity0
" it meant a great deal to my client and to the other cleared detainees who are hunger striking
" through his legal team , @entity10 has filed a federal lawsuit , protesting the forced - feeding policy
the @entity6 military has justified it as humane and necessary to keep the inmate alive
there are about 150 inmates currently at @entity3
supporters of @entity10 say he is among more than 40 men who at one time in the past few years were being forced fed. in their june 2013 lawsuit , @entity10 and three other men urged the court to intervene quickly
" petitioners request an expeditious hearing on this application because of the extreme nature of the human rights and medical ethics violations that result from petitioners ' force - feeding , " said the lawsuit , " and because of the imminent risk that it will deprive them of the ability to observe the @entity109 fast , " which typically happens in july
" petitioners do not trust the @entity3 doctors and nurses , because those staff have been ordered by their superior officers to subject petitioners to a force - feeding regimen they reject and which causes them humiliation and pain
" @entity10 , 43 , was captured in 2002 in @entity127
his supporters deny he is a terrorist and say the @entity129 had been operating a food import business in @entity131 , @entity132 before the 9/11 terror attacks
he has been cleared for release since 2009 , but @entity6 officials said they were reluctant to send him back to @entity129 because of that country 's ongoing civil war
his supporters say he could be sent to @entity138 , but there is no indication when any transfer would happen
a federal judge in may allowed @entity10 to be forced - fed to keep him alive , but strongly urged authorities to use other methods , criticizing the @entity35 's continued " refusal to compromise
" " the court is in no position to make the complex medical decisions necessary to keep mr. @entity10 alive , " said judge @entity146
" mr. @entity10 may well suffer unnecessary pain from certain enteral feeding practices and forcible cell extractions
however , the court simply can not let mr. @entity10 die
" @entity146 also ordered the @entity155 administration to release 34 video recordings of @entity10 being forced - fed , as well as the detainee 's medical records
the legal case is @entity155 ( 04 - 2215 )
lawsuit : end forced feedings before @entity109 judge allows forced feeding to resume on @entity3 detainee @entity0 senior @entity35 correspondent @entity164 contributed to this report .
