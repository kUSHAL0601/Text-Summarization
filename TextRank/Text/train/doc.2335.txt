-- @entity2 's main militant group has banned the @entity4 food agency and ordered its aid workers to leave the impoverished country
@entity7 released a statement to the media sunday , accusing the @entity10 of distributing expired food and undermining local farmers , said @entity13 , a @entity10 spokesman
@entity13 declined to comment on the accusations , but said the agency is committed to the failed nation in the @entity17
" @entity10 is determined to help the people of @entity2 in need of assistance , regardless of who controls the areas in which they live , as long as it is safe for our staff to do so , " @entity13 said
about half the population -- or nearly four million @entity2 -- is starving , according to the @entity4
the food aid agency suspended work in southern @entity2 in january , saying rising attacks and unacceptable demands from armed groups had made it impossible to work in the region
@entity13 declined to say whether the agency had resumed operations in the south
however , a statement on the @entity10 web site says it continues to deliver food to other parts of the country , including the volatile capital , @entity44
@entity7 , the @entity46 proxy in the country , controls much of southern @entity2
it has accused the food aid agency of having a political motive and supporting the @entity4 - backed transitional government
@entity10 has denied the allegations and said it is impartial and nonpolitical
@entity2 has not had a stable government since 1991 , and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine - ravaged country .
