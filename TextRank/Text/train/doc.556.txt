@entity0 , @entity1 -- prosecutors will recommend that a @entity1 court drop its investigation of six former officials in the administration of @entity9 @entity8 for alleged torture of prisoners at @entity12 , @entity1 's attorney general said thursday
investigating judge @entity14 has the final say on whether to proceed or shelve the case
the claim against the former officials , presented by a human rights group and provisionally accepted last month at the court -- pending an opinion from the prosecutors - threatens to turn the court " into a toy in the hands of people who are trying to do a political action , " attorney general @entity17 said at a meeting at a downtown @entity0 hotel
" we undoubtedly can not support that action , " @entity17 said
if alleged torture at @entity12 is going to be investigated at all , that should be done first in the @entity9 , so that the former @entity9 officials would have a chance to defend themselves there , @entity17 added , according to his press chief , @entity37
the prosecutors will inform the investigating judge , @entity14 , of their decision , and the judge would then have to decide whether to proceed or shelve the case , @entity37 said
former attorney general @entity43 and five other @entity45 administration officials are accused in the human rights group complaint of allegedly sanctioning torture at the @entity12 detention center
the complaint alleges the six former officials were the legal architects of a system that allowed torture of prisoners at @entity12 , in violation of international law
the case might still go forward at the court , despite the prosecution opposition , said @entity59 , a lawyer who filed the complaint for the human rights group
@entity59 told @entity2 that prosecutors earlier opposed the court 's human rights investigations of @entity66 dictator @entity65 and , separately , the former military regime in @entity68 , but that those cases went ahead anyway
" it 's up to the resolution of a court as it has always been , " @entity59 told @entity2
" @entity14 has to decide
this is a jurisdiction decision for a judge , not for the prosecution
" @entity59 predicted that once @entity14 officially receives notification of the prosecution opposition , it could take the judge a few weeks to decide whether to proceed with the case
@entity59 conceded that it makes the case harder without prosecution support
" it 's a shame the prosecutor is taking this position , but not a surprise , " @entity59 said
" they always obey political orders
they do n't want to be in a bad position in front of the @entity92 administration
" some analysts and bloggers have suggested in recent days that the case could damage relations between @entity1 's @entity98 government and president @entity92 's administration
but a @entity9 official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity2 on wednesday that a @entity104 court once had an investigation of then @entity9 defense secretary @entity106 , but that did not hurt @entity9 - @entity104 bilateral relations
@entity14 accepted the complaint from the human rights group because there were at least four @entity1 at @entity12 who allegedly suffered torture
@entity14 then sent the matter to prosecutors at @entity1 's anti-terrorism @entity116 , requesting their opinion on whether a crime had been committed
the 98 - page complaint , filed in march 2008 by @entity59 on behalf of the @entity121 , names @entity43 , who was @entity8 's legal counsel when the @entity12 detention center in @entity125 was established as part of the administration 's " war on terror
" @entity43 later became attorney general
the complaint also names five other top @entity8 administration officials : former assistant attorney general @entity135 ; former deputy assistant attorney general @entity136 ; former @entity138 general counsel @entity137 , former undersecretary of defense @entity130 and vice president @entity132 's former legal counsel , @entity131
@entity139 , a former top aide to @entity140 , who was secretary of state in the early years of the @entity8 administration , testified before a @entity143 subcommittee in june 2008 that the six officials " had a collusion " to develop a legal rationale for the administration 's interrogation policy of detainees
@entity136 , the author of a memo which critics say authorized torture , testified before the same subcommittee soon after in june 2008 , saying that his role in the administration had simply been to provide legal advice
" we were functioning as lawyers
we do n't make policy
policy choices in these matters were up to the @entity162 or the @entity163 or the @entity138 , " @entity136 testified , according to a @entity165 transcript
@entity131 proved difficult to pin down when he testified before the same subcommittee on the same day as @entity136 last june
@entity131 , who by then was @entity132 's chief of staff , delivered a flat " no " in response to a question from @entity170 @entity169 rep. @entity169 about whether @entity131 " contributed to the analysis or assisted in the drafting of the august 1 , 2002 interrogation memo
" but when @entity169 followed up with : " you had nothing to do with that ? " @entity131 replied , " no. i did n't say i had nothing to do with it
" @entity131 never seemed to clarify what , if any , role he had
@entity14 is @entity1 's best - known investigating magistrate who issued the precedent - setting arrest warrant for former @entity183 dictator @entity65 in 1998 while he was in a @entity185 hospital
@entity14 has investigated human rights abuses of former military governments in @entity183 and @entity188 , @entity193 terrorists operating in @entity1 , the armed @entity191 separatist group @entity190 , as well as major drug traffickers .
