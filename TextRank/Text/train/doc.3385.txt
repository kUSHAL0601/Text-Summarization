when the guests around your @entity2 table are busy stuffing their bellies today , here 's one way to break the lull in conversation : dazzle them with some tasty turkey trivia
here 's 9 to get you started
we bet you they 'll eat them up ! 1
a tradition is born : tv dinners have @entity2 to thank
in 1953 , someone at @entity17 misjudged the number of frozen turkeys it would sell that @entity2 -- by 26 @entity20 ! some industrious soul came up with a brilliant plan : why not slice up the meat and repackage with some trimmings on the side ? thus , the first tv dinner was born ! 2
going shopping ? : not if you 're a plumber
@entity29 is the busiest day of the year for them , according to @entity31 , the nation 's largest plumbing service
after all , someone has to clean up after household guests who " overwhelm the system
this land is my land : there are four places in the @entity41 named @entity42
@entity44 's @entity43 is the most populous , with a whopping 435 residents
there 's also @entity42 , @entity47 ; @entity42 , @entity48 ; and @entity43 , @entity49
oh , let 's not forget the two townships in @entity52 : the creatively named @entity53 and @entity54 ! 4
leaving a legacy : when @entity57 declared @entity2 a national holiday , it was thanks to the tireless efforts of a magazine editor named @entity62
her other claim to fame ? she also wrote the nursery rhyme , " @entity67
@entity68 , gobble ? : not so fast
only male turkeys , called toms , gobble
females , called hens , cackle
@entity74 's bird : if @entity76 had his way , the turkey would be our national bird
an eagle , he wrote in a letter to his daughter , had " bad moral character
" a turkey , on the other hand , was a " much more respectable bird
born in the @entity41 : @entity2 is not just an @entity41 holiday
except they do it the second monday in october
do n't blame the bird : you stuffed yourself , and now you 're feeling sleepy , very sleepy
but it ai n't the tryptophan in the turkey
in fact , chickens have more tryptophan
you 're groggy because you overate
and digesting all that grub takes a lot of energy
talking turkey : why is it called a turkey ? oh boy , this will take some explainin '
back in the day , the @entity108 took a liking to the guinea fowls imported to the continent
since the birds were imported by @entity115 merchants , the @entity112 called them turkeys
later , when the @entity118 came to @entity41 , they found a bird that tasted like those guinea fowls
when they were sent to @entity108 , the @entity112 called these birds " turkeys " as well .
