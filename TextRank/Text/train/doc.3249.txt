-- baseball legend @entity1 is scheduled to be sentenced friday for his obstruction of justice conviction
the hearing at 11 a.m. ( 2 p.m. et ) will take place in a @entity6 federal courtroom less than two miles from the ballpark where @entity1 broke @entity10 's major league home run record in august 2007
federal prosecutors want @entity1 , 47 , to serve 15 months in prison , according to a sentencing memo filed in court earlier this month
defense lawyers argued in their filing that the judge should accept the probation office 's recommendation that @entity1 be sentenced to two years ' probation , fined $ 4,000 and ordered to perform 250 hours of community service
jurors who found @entity1 guilty in april said he was " evasive " in his testimony to the federal grand jury investigating illegal steroids use by pro athletes
" because @entity32 's efforts were a corrupt , intentional effort to interfere with that mission , a sentence of 15 months imprisonment is appropriate , " the prosecution said in its memo to @entity30 district judge @entity29
but jurors , who were deadlocked on three perjury counts , said that it was not proven that @entity1 lied when he testified that he had not knowingly used steroids
prosecutors decided not to pursue a retrial
prosecutors still argued in the sentencing memo that @entity1 ' denial that he was " taking steroids and human growth hormone were patently false
" @entity32 ' testimony in december 2003 was part of the investigation that targeted @entity1 ' personal trainer @entity51 and employees of the @entity54 drug testing laboratory known as the @entity55 ( @entity55 )
the testimony that led to @entity1 ' conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked @entity1 if @entity51 ever gave him " anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with
" @entity1 told the grand jury that only his personal doctors " ever touch me , " and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with @entity67
defense lawyers argued that @entity1 thought the creams and ointments @entity51 was giving him were made of flax seed oils
sentences for other athletes convicted in connection with the @entity55 investigation have not included prison time
@entity0 's @entity77 and @entity78 contributed to this report .
