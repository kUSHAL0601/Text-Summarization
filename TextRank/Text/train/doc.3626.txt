-- when @entity2 and @entity3 announced that they were partnering to integrate @entity3 and @entity4 for social network - powered search , it confirmed something i thought monday : @entity9 is the real @entity3 phone
i do n't know whether @entity3 has a secret team working on a phone where they control the os. but the company do n't need one
it 's already deeply integrated into @entity17 and @entity18
now with the @entity2 partnership , it 's tied to the most socially optimized smartphone ever brought to the market
" this is , i think , one of the most exciting partnerships we 've done on the platform so far , " @entity3 ceo @entity23 said at the @entity4 announcement wednesday
" our view is that over the next five years we expect that almost every industry is going to be disrupted by someone building a great product that 's deep in whatever area that industry is , plus is extremely socially integrated
" the first @entity9 handsets are due in stores november
the os is @entity2 's complete do - over on mobile , after its predecessor @entity40 tanked in popularity and market share in the wake of more consumer - savvy handsets such as @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity49 's @entity17 - powered smartphones
every aspect of @entity9 is geared to social networks : phone , contacts , gaming , photos , even @entity56
focusing the phone around @entity58 does n't just mean that local client apps and cloud apps are grouped next to each other
it means that the local client and cloud work together
@entity2 tried to explicitly build a social networking phone featuring @entity3 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 with the @entity69
the @entity69 failed and was killed by @entity2 , mostly because it was n't a full - featured smartphone ( it was a fork of @entity9 ) , but required a smartphone 's data plan
the @entity69 's cloud - backed social and sharing components lived on in @entity9
only now , @entity67 and @entity68 are nowhere to be found
even before the @entity4 announcement , @entity3 was a conspicuous part of the @entity80 presentation
@entity2 's @entity81 outlined a scenario where users could take a photo on their phone that 's then uploaded to @entity3 automatically , without even opening the @entity3 app. in the press release for @entity80 , @entity2 notes that " the customizable @entity89 screen with @entity90 provides real - time updates so you can keep tabs on the latest weather forecast , your favorite band , a friend 's facebook page and more , all with just one glimpse " [ emphasis added ]
that was n't an accident
the @entity3 - @entity4 partnership was already happening
it 's the exact strategy that @entity23 outlined in his interview with @entity105 , where he explained why @entity3 was n't building its own phone
@entity23 only made an offhand reference to @entity80 in that interview : " if @entity9 takes off , then i 'm sure we 'll put resources on that
" but he added , with reference to their efforts with the @entity46 and @entity17 , " the question is , what could we do if we also started hacking at a deeper level , and that is a lot of the stuff that we 're thinking about
" in order to do that , @entity23 explained , you need to find a company that was willing to incorporate social networking from the operating system up -- not just adding a layer on top of it was already doing , but making that the focus of the device and its services
at least one of those companies is @entity2
" we started thinking what would social search look like , and we started looking around for partners , " @entity23 said
" @entity2 really is the underdog here and they really are incentivized to try new things
" he was talking about search , but he may as well have been talking about phones
@entity2 may be the underdog in search and phones , but it 's actually been ahead of the curve in terms of incorporating social layers into its products
the @entity149 had song and photo sharing between devices over @entity153 before the @entity46 was even announced
but that was a closed network , limited to just @entity149 - to - @entity149 , and later @entity149 - to - @entity155
in order to get outside of itself , @entity2 partnered with @entity3 early on -- it still owns part of the company -- and @entity3 helped shape @entity2 's social strategy
@entity2 has been quietly building a social network without anyone actually noticing
@entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 are all social networks where users work , share files and talk about media together
you use the same identity across all of those services on every @entity2 device
@entity3 is already embedded in all of them : it 's built into @entity176 , and it 's what powers part of the social dimension of @entity165
and @entity4 is already embedded in @entity3 , in the form of maps and search results
now @entity3 's information is embedded in @entity4
and search is one of just three buttons on every @entity80 phone
consequently , @entity3 's partnership with @entity4 is n't just about @entity49 > it is n't just about " like " results showing up when you search in a web browser on your pc
it 's about incorporating a social layer into media on every device in your household , from your phone to your set - top box
it 's about making those devices smarter in how they communicate with each other and from one platform to another
that 's what stood out to me most at the @entity9 launch event
the @entity56 people demonstrated how to use @entity163 to stream a powerpoint presentation from a @entity212 to a @entity213 the @entity155 people were showing how to chat about a @entity216 movie with your @entity3 friends on @entity165
the hardware people were showing off a wide - angle hd webcam that will let families chat with families from their living rooms
deep integration of devices , media and services -- using the cloud to power person - to - person interaction through voice , images and text
if we think about @entity47 's attempt with @entity236 to bring a social layer to @entity238 ( which has been criticized , in part , because @entity47 did n't partner up with @entity3 ) , @entity242 's idea of a multitasking television set or @entity66 's plays to get on the television screen with @entity246 , it 's clear that that 's where we 're heading
the only places where @entity2 and @entity3 are " underdogs " are search and smartphones
when it comes to social networking and smart partnering with other companies -- including each other -- the two giants are way ahead of the field
