@entity3 drowned face down in a tub of " extremely hot water " about 12 inches deep , the final autopsy report on the singer 's death said
the @entity7 coroner ruled that @entity3 's february 11 death was an accidental drowning with the " effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use " as contributing factors
the coroner 's report stopped short of detailing what happened to @entity3 , but @entity18 's dr. @entity17 , an addiction medicine specialist , examined the autopsy report for @entity21 and suggested she might have suffered a seizure brought on by the use of cocaine possibly combined with a withdrawal from alcohol and a prescription sedative
an empty bottle of the @entity29 was found in her room , but the level of the sedative found in her blood was low , he said
empty beer bottles were also found , but alcohol was not detected in her body , he said
" to me , a sudden drop off in the @entity29 level , a drop off in your alcohol consumption , add cocaine , that 's a recipe for a seizure , " @entity17 said
" somebody who 's now upside down in a bathtub could easily seize and drown
" however , @entity49 , a toxicologist and director of the @entity51 , said the level of @entity29 found in @entity3 's blood was not low enough to trigger a seizure
those who abuse @entity29 can take up to 20 pills a day , he said , and the level found in @entity3 's body would indicate she took four to six pills several hours before she died
since the drug was found in her blood , a seizure brought on by withdrawal is unlikely , he said
the coroner 's report notes that @entity3 suffered several small scald burns on her face at the time of her death
a 60 % narrowing of her arteries found in the autopsy is " very mild heart disease , " @entity17 said , which should not have caused a problem
@entity49 said that based on his experience with cocaine abusers , two things may have happened -- either @entity3 had a seizure and fell into the tub , or had a cardiac arrhythmia
an arrhythmia occurs when the heart stops beating properly and fails to pump for a period of time , depriving the brain of oxygen and causing a loss of consciousness
" if you look at cocaine deaths , more deaths are from arrhythmias than seizures , " @entity49 said
" based on what is the report , it seems more likely that she had a vasospasm ( which shuts off blood flow to the heart ) or a fatal arrhythmia
" toxicology testing measured .58 micrograms of cocaine per milliliter of blood drawn from a vein in her leg during the autopsy , which @entity17 called a moderate level
@entity49 said for that level of cocaine to be in @entity3 's body , " we 're talking about approximately half a gram of cocaine having been possibly ingested within 30 minutes to 90 minutes before her death
for someone who has been abusing cocaine , this may be their routine amount , but ( for ) someone who does n't regularly use cocaine and therefore does n't have a tolerance for the drug , this would be a high level
" @entity3 's cocaine use appeared to have occurred " in the time period just immediately prior to her collapse in the bathtub at the hotel , " chief coroner @entity124 told reporters when he released the preliminary report last month
investigators found " a small spoon with a white crystal like substance in it and a rolled up piece of white paper " in the bathroom where @entity3 drowned , coroner 's investigator @entity133 wrote
" remnants of a white powdery substance " were found on a bathroom counter , @entity133 wrote
" i also collected remnants of a white powdery substance from out of a drawer and from the bottom of a mirror in the same drawer in the bathroom counter , " she wrote
detectives found a " plethora of medications bottles " in the hotel room , although the coroner concluded the prescription drugs " did not contribute to the death
" along with cocaine , the toxicology tests found other drugs in her body , including marijuana , the anti-anxiety drug @entity29 , the muscle relaxant @entity168 and the allergy medicine @entity170 , the report said
@entity3 was last seen alive by her personal assistant in her @entity175 hotel room at about 3 p.m. that saturday , the report said
the assistant left to run errands after telling @entity3 to take a bath in preparation for a @entity182 party at the hotel that night , it said
when the assistant returned to the locked room at 3:35 p.m. , she found @entity3 " lying face down in the bathtub filled with water , unresponsive
" " the assistant called for her bodyguard , and together they pulled the decedent out of the bathtub , " the report said
when paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later they moved @entity3 to the living room floor
it was at 3:55 p.m. , 20 minutes after she was found by the assistant , that paramedics concluded she was dead , the report said
@entity3 won six @entity199 and sold 170 million albums , singles and videos over her career
in recent years , the singer 's accomplishments were overtaken by her struggles with drug addiction .
