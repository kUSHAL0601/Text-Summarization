-- seven - time world champion @entity1 is hoping to repay his @entity3 fans with a win in @entity5 next weekend -- despite admitting he 's " never had much luck " at the @entity8 circuit
the 43 - year - old driver has had a disappointing start to the year despite his @entity13 team 's promising pace in qualifying and pre-race practice sessions
he was forced to pull out of the season - opening @entity17 @entity16 in march after suffering a gearbox failure , then finished 10th in @entity19
the @entity20 , who has struggled since coming back from retirement in 2010 , finished eighth in @entity3 last year
" as for the race itself , i 've never had much luck in @entity5 , apart from my win in 2006 , " he told reporters in @entity5
" in the first two races of 2012 we did n't manage to maintain our qualifying pace in race conditions
we 've been working intensively on this , so that we can offer our fans a strong performance in @entity3
" the former @entity35 star is now determined to secure a win in front of his huge following in @entity39
" when i think about the @entity41 , the fans are the first thing that comes to mind
for many years now , i 've had a big and loyal fan base there , and it 's still very touching to see the lengths they go to in supporting me
" team principal @entity48 said @entity13 had learned its lessons from the start of the year
" on track , we hope that the weekend will prove more successful than the first two races of the season where our race results did not match expectations after a positive start to both weekends , " he said
" a lot of hard work and analysis has taken place back at the factory since our return and i hope to see these efforts pay dividends next sunday in @entity5
