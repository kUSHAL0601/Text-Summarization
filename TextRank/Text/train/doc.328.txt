@entity0 poured into the streets thursday to celebrate the death of @entity3
after months of intense fighting , rebel fighters finally overran @entity3 's last stronghold in his hometown of @entity8 , marking the end of his 42 - year rule
although @entity3 's rule effectively ended two months ago when he fled @entity13 , his death provides closure and a sense of relief to many in the country who had opposed his tyrannical rule
it also greatly reduces the likelihood of a prolonged insurgency by @entity3 loyalists and allows the transitional government to move forward with the hard work of building a new political system
the challenges ahead are great : since the @entity3 regime so effectively monopolized the public sphere , @entity0 has no real civil society or effective political institutions
after decades of tyranny , there is a deep distrust of government
there is also fear of revenge killings by those who suffered under @entity3 's brutality
tensions are already evident between @entity43 and secularists , and between technocrats returning from abroad and those who stayed and opposed the regime at enormous personal expense
well - armed militias have yet to be formally disbanded or integrated into a national army ; large caches of arms , including some sophisticated missiles , are not accounted for and could end up in the hands of extremists
nevertheless , of all the @entity56 states that have been convulsed by revolts this year , @entity0 has by far the strongest economic prospects
its relatively small population of 6.5 million and vast oil wealth give it the best chance of meeting the economic aspirations of its citizens
just recently , the transitional government announced that it had discovered an additional $ 23 billion in the @entity67 , enough to cover the costs of government for at least six months
it has an additional $ 160 billion in foreign assets , which are frozen overseas but will eventually be released
@entity0 also has a relatively well - educated population
public education was free and compulsory through secondary school under @entity3 , and the country enjoys a literacy rate of nearly 90 %
in the 2007 - 2008 school year , women enrolled in universities outnumbered men significantly
according to the @entity83 constitution , legislative and presidential elections to form a new government must be held within a year of liberation
the constitution also stipulates that no member of the council can participate in this newly elected government , a provision meant to limit the influence of the interim body
so far , transitional leaders seem willing to abide by that provision , but jockeying for power has only just begun
interim prime minister @entity94 , @entity95 educated and unabashedly secular , announced recently that he would step down at the close of the fighting , but it is not clear if he will follow through on his promise , or if he does , who will succeed him
@entity94 and @entity101 , the acting finance and oil minister who was teaching economics in the @entity95 before joining the rebellion , have been criticized for being outsiders , too secular and too connected to remnants of the former regime
some are pointing to @entity110 , the @entity83 commander of the militia in @entity13 , as a major player in the future political field
@entity110 was arrested in 2004 by the @entity114 and rendered to @entity0 , where he was held and tortured in the infamous @entity115
the warrant for his arrest accused him of ties to @entity119 , which he has denied
@entity110 has also disavowed extremism and pledged tolerance
islamists will undoubtedly play an influential role in @entity0 's new government , and outward signs of @entity43 piety , suppressed under @entity3 , are now on the rise across the country
but leaders across the political spectrum continue to insist on moderation and tolerance
@entity134 , chairman of the transitional council , has called for a @entity0 state founded on @entity137 that is also inclusive of women and minorities
@entity95 and @entity141 support for the rebels over the past seven months generated positive feelings among @entity0 for @entity145 countries , which points to a possible @entity147 - aligned @entity0 government that is nonetheless markedly @entity43 in character
@entity3 's death marks an important moment of transition for @entity0
reconciliation and integration will be imperative at this point , especially as the dust of war clears and evidence emerges of brutality committed by both rebel forces and @entity3 loyalists
as demonstrated painfully in @entity162 , lasting stability requires opportunities for @entity3 supporters to participate in the new order , but with war wounds still fresh , this will require remarkable leadership and forbearance on the part of transitional leaders
a stable , prosperous @entity0 undergoing a process of democratization will enhance the chance of successful transitions in neighboring @entity175 and @entity176
this helps explain the sense of jubilation across the region that erupted on the news of @entity3 's death
the era of tyrants seems to be coming to an end
protesters in @entity186 and @entity187 held out signs asking their leaders if they want to go the same violent way .
