-- on her way to pick up her @entity5 bib number friday , longtime @entity2 @entity1 was having second thoughts of running in the iconic race
just four days after @entity8 hit her city , she was wracked by a knot in her stomach as she got closer to the convention center serving as the hub for race participants
" walking past ... generators heating up tents for people to eat pasta tomorrow night when there are people who have n't eaten a hot meal in five days " left her with the feeling : " this is so inappropriate and this is so wrong , " she said
those feelings of outrage echoed across the city and nationwide since wednesday , when mayor @entity29 said the race would go on as scheduled
the announcement sparked a chorus of criticism from local authorities and residents , inspired a boycott effort on @entity37 , and became a trending topic on @entity39 as users called for the race 's postponement
and after the public outcry grew close to deafening friday , city and race officials announced they would cancel the race for the first time in its 42 - year history
" while holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort , it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division , " a statement from the mayor said
@entity5 ' was going to be divisive , ' says deputy mayor of cancellation first held in 1970 , the @entity5 attracts about 47,000 runners and 12,000 volunteers
an estimated 2.5 million spectators typically line the course , which winds through all five city boroughs
but it was the starting line in @entity67 -- one of the areas hardest hit by @entity8 -- that drew much of the criticism
at least 20 people on the island were killed in the storm , which left homes in shards and large portions of neighborhoods under water
residents on @entity67 pleaded wednesday for gas , food , and clothes
one woman said she had eaten one slice of pizza in the past two days
@entity88 rep. @entity87 , who represents @entity67 and @entity89 , said before friday 's announcement that the city had its priorities wrong
" we 're still pulling bodies out of the water and the mayor is worried about marathon runners and returning to life as normal , " @entity87 said in a statement
" the @entity100 should be used for getting fuel and food in to @entity67 , not getting runners out
" a series of photos of the island 's devastation went viral friday
the post by @entity109 ended with the line : " the @entity5 is still scheduled to run on sunday
" meanwhile , a group of runners scheduled to participate in the race started a boycott page on @entity37 , vowing to wear their bib numbers while they volunteered in recovery efforts on @entity67
and friday 's cover of the @entity118 also weighed in on the controversy
a simple , but powerful , headline over a photo of two generators read : " abuse of power : these massive generators are providing electricity to the marathon 's tent in @entity128 while @entity129 suffer ! " the response to the cancellation announcement was immediate : " canceling the @entity5 was 100 % the right decision , " @entity132 tweeted
@entity134 was set to run in the race and said that while he was " disappointed " with the decision , he admitted " nobody really was in the mood
" crippled @entity2 subways spark infrastructure , climate questions @entity143 - based runner @entity142 also said canceling the race " was the right thing to do
" " i 'm going to stick around and help out
now is a time to lend a hand , not run , " he tweeted
the " boycott the 2012 @entity5 " @entity37 group echoed @entity142 ' comments , saying the volunteer effort in @entity67 will go forward sunday in the wake of the cancellation
other @entity39 users began sharing a link to @entity156 , which is encouraging runners to donate their hotel rooms to displaced residents
but some runners , especially those who traveled from outside the @entity88 to participate in the race , were frustrated by the last - minute cancellation of an event in which not everyone is guaranteed a bib
to guarantee a spot in the race , runners must pledge to do the event for charity or qualify with a fast marathon or half - marathon time
for the majority of the race participants , they 're in by being one of the lucky ones chosen in a random drawing
" it 's a huge frustration , " said @entity177 , who traveled from @entity178
" it really is an effort to come here and participate
" @entity182 flew in from @entity183 on thursday , planning to run the race to raise money for cancer research
now he 'll be spending the next week in @entity2
" i tried my best
i came across , but unfortunately ... @entity8 has put an end to my dream , " he said
" but such is life
i 'll try again next year , maybe
" wednesday , in announcing his decision to move forward with the race , @entity29 said " an awful lot of small businesses " depend on the annual event
powerless in @entity197 on thursday , the mayor brushed aside concerns that the marathon would direct crucial resources away from recovery efforts , saying electricity would be restored by race day , thus freeing up police currently manning intersections where the traffic signals and electricity have gone out
" to host the @entity5 in the middle of what is complete devastation and a crisis in parts of this city is just wrong , " said city councilman @entity209 , whose south @entity89 district includes @entity211 and other areas that suffered heavy damage
@entity220 continued his fight for the marathon early friday , recalling another time when city officials were forced to make a tough decision during a sensitive time
" as @entity226 said to me this morning , he said , ' you know , right after 9/11 people said exactly the same thing
' " @entity29 said , adding , " you have to keep going and doing things and you can grieve , you can cry and you can laugh all at the same time
that 's what human beings are good at
" city and race officials met throughout the week , up until friday afternoon , weighing their options including considering whether to postpone the race or shorten the course
in the end though , " it was clear that this was not going to be a celebration of @entity2 , " said deputy mayor @entity243
" it was going to be a divisive , difficult day instead of a day of celebration
" shortly after 5 p.m. , the cancellation announcement was made
@entity250 , a @entity2 who was set to run the race , said he was looking forward to the opportunity to " use this as a way to build some energy and kind of remind myself why @entity2 is awesome
" now , he said , five months of training is " for nothing
" @entity2 after @entity8 : a tale of two cities others expressed concern for the economic implications of canceling such a huge revenue - generating event
@entity267 marathoner and former @entity5 champion @entity266 said on @entity39 that the city needs " the solidarity , the lift , and the economic boost that @entity273 brings to @entity2
" @entity274 , a running coach with the @entity128 @entity275 , said thursday that the consequences of canceling " would be very severe and possibly hurt the city even more , and certainly hurt economically
" the marathon is also an important fund - raiser for hundreds of charities who recruit runners to raise funds , and they stand to lose their pledged donations , said @entity286 , president of @entity287 , a running gear retailer that works with many of those charities every year
more than $ 34 million was raised in 2011 by runners doing the race for charity , according to the marathon website
@entity294 , which puts on the marathon every year , said it is donating $ 1 million to the @entity295 and encouraged others to donate as well
after getting over the shock of the race 's cancellation , @entity250 said he and his team will put away their running shoes sunday and put on their work gloves as they join the volunteer effort
@entity1 , for her part , ended up leaving the race expo before hearing the news that the event had been canceled , having already made up her mind that she would not run this year
" it 's a wonderful experience
i 've done it many times
it 's not the right time , " she said
opinion : @entity315 , i 'll miss you @entity0 's @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 contributed to this report .
