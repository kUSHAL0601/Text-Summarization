and you , and you and you
with the help of an automated tool , @entity1 has created short , personalized video highlights for " hundreds of millions " of its users
the 62 - second clip notes the year you joined @entity1 , then shows a handful of your most - liked posts and a seemingly random selection of your photos -- all set to instrumental music
to see yours , go to @entity1 / lookback and admire , or cringe
@entity1 posted the clips , titled " a look back , " without fanfare tuesday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the social network , which was founded by @entity24 and four classmates at @entity26 on february 4 , 2004
" people often ask if i always knew that @entity1 would become what it is today
no way , " wrote @entity24 , the company 's ceo , in a @entity1 post tuesday
" i remember getting pizza with my friends one night in college shortly after opening @entity1
i told them i was excited to help connect our school community , but one day someone needed to connect the whole world
" 10 years of @entity1 in one graphic the videos are available to everyone who uses @entity1 in @entity44 , @entity52 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 @entity45 , a @entity1 spokesperson told @entity54
depending on how much content you have shared and how long you have been on @entity1 , you will either see the personalized video , a collection of photos or a simple thank - you card , the spokesperson said
@entity1 said users will be able to share the video on their pages after 12 noon et on tuesday
the videos will only be available for about a month unless you share them on your timeline
only you will be able to view your video if you do n't share it
if the clip contains posts you 'd prefer to keep private , you can edit them via an " @entity73 " button , the spokesperson said
" it 's been amazing to see how all of you have used our tools to build a real community
you 've shared the happy moments and the painful ones , " @entity24 said
@entity1 has created personalized slideshows for users , but this project marks the first time the company has made customized videos
a small team at @entity1 spent the last few months crafting the videos and ensuring the company had the resources to render them for most of the network 's 1.2 billion users
