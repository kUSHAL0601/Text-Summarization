cosmetic companies and animal rights groups have welcomed a proposal by @entity3 to allow sales of some cosmetics without requiring them to be tested on animals
animal testing would no longer be mandatory for " non-specialized cosmetics " , including shampoo , soaps and certain skin products manufactured in @entity3 from june next year , according to a document posted on the website of the @entity15 earlier this month
beauty companies have long faced an ugly dilemma in @entity3
local laws and regulations require animal testing for cosmetic products sold in the country , which has made the lucrative market a tricky area for brands that want to sell in @entity3 without alienating consumers in other places that frown upon animal testing
" non-specialized cosmetics produced in @entity3 could avoid toxicological testing after going through risk and safety checks , " the @entity15 said
imported cosmetics are not covered in the proposal
but the document indicated that @entity3 would gradually ease regulations on animal testing , which would allow more international firms opposed to animal testing to enter @entity3 's 134 billion yuan ( $ 22 billion ) cosmetics market
current regulations require all cosmetics to go through a lengthy approval process known as " toxicological testing " which involves testing on animals like rabbits and guinea pigs
" @entity52 welcomes the signals that the @entity3 authorities are adopting a new approach to cosmetic testing , " spokeswoman @entity49 said in emailed comments from @entity51
" we have campaigned against animal testing for over 20 years and we look forward to selling our products in @entity3 one day
" cosmetic brand @entity60 last year abandoned plans to sell its products in @entity3 in response to pressure from consumers and campaign groups , according to @entity67
@entity68 , animal welfare director at campaign group @entity69 , told @entity70 the planned changes had come quicker than expected given that local campaigns against animal testing have only been going for two years
" that 's a very significant development because it took many years for @entity76 to allow these products to be sold ( without being tested on animals )
" earlier this year , a complete ban on the sale of cosmetics developed through animal testing took effect in the @entity76
but @entity68 added that this proposal would not mark the end of animal testing in @entity3
" as far as i 'm aware , products can still be tested on animals
it just opens the opportunity for non-animal products to be sold , " he said .
