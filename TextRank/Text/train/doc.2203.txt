@entity0 -- in a further sign that @entity3 is edging ahead as the world 's dominant space power , @entity6 -- the second @entity3 woman in space -- gave a physics lesson to school children from zero gravity
speaking through a video link from the @entity14 - 10 manned spacecraft to a class of middle school students in @entity17 , @entity6 demonstrated the effects of zero gravity on water and a pendulum
the blue - clad astronaut also showed how she could push a fellow astronaut into the wall of the module with touch of her finger and gulped down the drop of water as it floated in mid-air
mass audience more than 60 million students across @entity3 watched the lecture on @entity3 's state broadcaster cctv as @entity6 demonstrated @entity36 's second law of motion ( force equals mass times acceleration ) and the surface tension of water
@entity6 fielded questions from students that ranged from whether the team had seen any space junk or even @entity46 , to the efficacy of weight scales in space
the demonstration drew a spirited response on social media in @entity3 , with comments on @entity54 -- @entity3 's equivalent of @entity56 -- ranging from enthusiastic support for the country 's space program , to questioning the cost of the @entity61
" the @entity62 used to be proud of their space class , ( but ) now we 've made it , too ! " one user posted
" we should be proud of this
what others have , we have it too
" experimental space station @entity3 launched three astronauts into space on board the @entity14 - 10 craft last week to dock with @entity77 , an experimental space station used to test orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities
it is @entity3 's fifth manned mission to space in a decade
while the space station only has a two - year operational lifespan , the development of a permanent space station is part of @entity17 's ambitious multi-billion dollar space plan , which is being hailed by the @entity89 as a symbol of @entity3 's growing technical expertise
@entity3 first sent a human into space in 2003 but is already planning to complete its space station by 2020 , and sometime afterwards land a man on the moon
despite the ambitious space program , @entity3 still lags @entity97 and the @entity62 and is still attempting to reach milestones achieved by the two superpowers decades ago
playing catch - up despite these limitations , @entity3 's @entity77 space station is half the size of the first space station , @entity105 1 , that the @entity106 sent up in 1971 -- analysts say that @entity3 is able to take advantage of advances in spaceflight technology
" what we have seen more than anything else is a truly long - term commitment to space that dates back at least 25 years , and a sustained interest during those 25 years , " @entity111 of the @entity112 , a policy research group in @entity113 , told the @entity114
he said @entity122 's human spaceflight program has struggled under changing budgets and governments while the @entity3 space program had seen ordered and incremental progress since the 1990s
" so as long as the money holds out and political stability reigns , they might well get to some place like @entity131 or establish a lunar presence , precisely because they are persistent and willing to spend the money and make the effort , " he said
@entity1 's @entity136 in @entity17 contributed to this report .
