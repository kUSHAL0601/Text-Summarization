-- turns out , i am mentally ill. aspects of my current brain chemistry resemble that of a person with obsessive - compulsive disorder
i have n't started turning the light switches on and off or urgently avoiding sidewalk cracks
but i have been shopping for beauty products and underwear in a fever
i spend an embarrassing amount of time looking at myself naked
my classic symptoms -- involuntary preoccupation , mood swings , emotional sensitivity , enhanced sensual awareness -- are what tip the diagnosis
in the throes of limerence
it is both a psychological and physiological state
it is also the state i wish to call home
@entity29 terms for limerence : romantic love , crazy love , lovesick , mad love , amour fort
you see a theme in the words crazy , sick , and mad
in this condition , one 's body drugs itself mightily with hormones that create a feeling of joy
the rapture is balanced with the panic and dread that it could end
@entity48 has a shelf life
by some estimates , you 're lucky to get 18 months
i 've had it for a year
when i think of becoming nonlimerent in six months , i suffer stomach pains , headaches , and jitters
" you wo n't have withdrawal symptoms , " says @entity59 , @entity60 , author of the groundbreaking 1979 book " @entity62 and @entity48 " and the woman who originated the term
" and 18 months sounds short to me
if the limerence is requited , it can last up to three years
but you wo n't wake up nonlimerent on your anniversary
it 's a gradual decline
" @entity0 : how to make romance last @entity74 , @entity60 , the author of " @entity75 , " gives it two years
" two , maybe three
during this stage , what i call infatuation , you experience increases of norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain and of testosterone , too , since lust is involved , " she says
" when you move into the attachment stage , where you see an increase of vasopressin and oxytocin , the other hormones return to normal
most couples in attached relationships have less sex than those in the infatuation stage
" the phrase addicted to love applies to women and men who crave the excitement ( and sex ) of infatuation , floating from one intense affair to the next , leaving a pile of heartbroken , attachment - seeking partners in their wake
once you 've transitioned out of infatuation , hormone levels dropping , you either attach or you do the opposite
" i do n't use the word detach in my research , " @entity74 says , " but that 's what happens
when you 're heartbroken , hormones change again
you get another dopamine boost
that makes you have no interest in food at the beginning and end of a passionate relationship
" @entity74 is wary of presenting a relationship time line by stages
" you can flow from infatuation to attachment and back again , " she says
" some relationships start with attachment -- a loving friendship -- and then shift to infatuation and lust
" the classic scenario , the only one i 've known , is to fall madly in love at the start and eventually settle into a pleasant commitment or suffer a devastating breakup
a comfortable marriage -- been there -- is swell
attachment is a relief , a safe haven
for most people , the ultimate reward
but i 'd rather not contemplate attachment or detachment when the stage i 'm in is , as @entity154 puts it , " the greatest joy , the height of euphoria , walking on air
" in my twenties i was always looking ahead , insisting that relationships move forward to be satisfying
my goal then was to progress to marriage
now , in my late thirties , i try to live in the present
my current goal : milk the glorious status quo
six to 12 months of it left
is there no way to stretch this out ? get more than the allotted couple of years ? @entity0 : how to find love and make it last " you know , limerence can be unending , " @entity59 says
" i 've interviewed subjects who 've nursed a fixation on their limerence objects -- @entity175 -- for decades
" what 's the trick ? " their feelings were unrequited , " she reports
" their @entity181 gave them mixed signals , like ignoring them for months and then calling
@entity185 , confusion , and uncertainty kept it going
the phenomenon is defined , in part , by feeling a loss of control
the limerent person ca n't stop thinking about the @entity194 : what did he mean by that ? how can i interpret his tone of voice ? how is he responding to me ? a prolonged fixation on someone who does n't love you back is considered , by some psychologists , a pathology called erotomania
" but that 's not me
" if the @entity194 is responsive , " @entity59 says , " like your boyfriend , he does n't send mixed signals , you do n't experience uncertainty , the love is mutual , and limerence declines
unless you want to start pretending you do n't have feelings for him , or playing hard to get , the end will come
and then some hope : " barriers and hurdles in the relationship lengthen infatuation , " @entity74 says
" for example , suppose one of you is married
or one lives in a different city
you say your boyfriend travels a lot for work ? that 's good
the pain of his leaving and the happiness of his return can prolong the stage
" that could buy me another six months
i explored other adversity options
i 've always been skilled at picking fights
" a fight can intensify the feeling , making you work harder to put things right , " @entity74 says
but beware : part of infatuation is the joy of discovery
as you learn about the object of your affection , the insights propel you to the next stage
if you love her more for who she really is , enter attachment
conversely , if she turns out to be a raving , provoking lunatic , detachment would be the wise choice
effect : subtract six months of infatuation either way
all pain , no gain
other factors that subtract from bliss time : chronic irritation , dissimilar interests and goals , sexual dysfunction , antipathy for each other 's friends and family , fear of loss of personal freedom and identity , surfacing of past relationship disappointments , inability to argue productively
that 's the shortlist ( and no wonder the prospect of moving beyond rapture is daunting -- there are so many bubble - puncturing issues )
the factor at the top of this list , @entity74 says , is " boredom , lack of novelty
you have to continually have adventures , do new things together
they do n't have to be grand or expensive
if you can keep introducing fresh experiences into the relationship , you can lengthen the duration of romantic love or , even better , have a burst of that old feeling within the attachment stage
" @entity0 : what to do when every little thing he does drives you crazy my boyfriend and i have loads of good , solid ideas for new things to do together
for instance , he wants to teach me about opera and classical music
every time we set out to listen , we wind up ignoring the plans and doing the same things we usually do , in the same place , every single night
" okay , let 's talk about sex , " @entity74 says
" i want to distinguish lust from infatuation
having lust does n't mean you 're in love
many couples start out with lust and then move into infatuation
you can certainly fall in love without sex
but falling in love triggers your sex drive
suddenly , everything your boyfriend does is sexually attractive
" you have high levels of dopamine in your brain , and you want it constantly
that may be what you 're most afraid of losing , why you want to arrest the infatuation stage
" i admit to nothing
" you do n't have to lose the desire
there are an enormous number of ways you can experiment sexually , and we live in a world where there is a wealth of easily accessible information on how to do that
" so internet porn might net me another few months of testosterone infusion ? naturally , i 'm willing to try anything
@entity74 also advocates prolonging infatuation by making improvements in your physical appearance
perhaps losing ten pounds and washing out my gray hairs will win me another year
combine that with my boyfriend 's frequent flying and our future novel adventures , and i 'm ratcheting up my limerence potential to a grand total of five years
the doctors did n't respond favorably to my math. " you know , some people are never limerent , " @entity59 says
" we do n't know why , but they ca n't or wo n't experience the feeling of being madly in love
" and for the majority of limerent subjects , the feeling is unrequited
they have a horrible time
" " leaving one stage is not an end , " @entity74 says
it 's a new beginning ? " my point is that relationships can be fluid
you can flow from one stage to another if you 're able to put energy and attention into the relationship , " she says
of course , you ca n't flow from detachment back to anything
i suppose you could break up and get back together , but then the love would n't have the same blissful optimism
and , @entity74 warns , putting too much effort into maintaining the status quo could cause problems ( and not the good " romantic struggle " kind )
@entity74 says that i should let the infatuation run its course and enjoy the hell out of it
who knows ? maybe when it ends , i 'll have had enough of it
i 'll report back , four years from now
