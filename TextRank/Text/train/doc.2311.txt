@entity0 -- the new @entity3 report " @entity14 " documents in excruciating detail the use of torture in government detention facilities in @entity9 , including how , where , when and under whose command this torture was carried out
documenting human rights violations in @entity9 is anything but easy , so how did we do it ? since the beginning of anti-government demonstrations in march 2011 , @entity9 has been doing whatever it can to keep independent observers from finding out what exactly is going on
for many months , it refused to issue visas for such work , and widespread violations were committed with few independent witnesses
some journalists from outside @entity9 bravely crossed the border without official permission , to provide valuable first - hand accounts of attacks and violations
but crossing the border illegally can be dangerous
several journalists have been arrested and others killed on these assignments , making @entity9 one of the deadliest countries for journalists at the moment
news : report describes brutal torture in @entity9 in april of this year , @entity9 finally agreed to the deployment of 300 @entity47 observers and to grant visas to some journalists , but those who got into @entity9 have faced difficulties on the ground
when members from the @entity47 observer mission , accompanied by several journalists , tried to investigate claims of a massacre in the small village of @entity59 on june 7 , @entity9 government forces initially prevented them from entering the village
when the observers finally entered the village one day later , they saw clear evidence that something terrible had happened
journalists on the scene reported that " the smell of burnt flesh still hung heavy in the air " and that " blood was in pools " in a house
but somebody had removed the bodies
it is hard to not draw the conclusion that government forces held up the @entity47 observers while somebody tried to clean up the crime scene
news : in @entity9 , a massacre feels eerily familiar on june 16 , the @entity47 observer mission suspended its patrols in @entity9 because of increased fighting
the observer mission had also come under attack on several occasions
further complicating the work of impartial observers is the increasing amount of propaganda from both sides
we have long since stopped trusting any information coming from the government , but we can not always trust information from opposition activists either
some are reluctant , for example , to admit that a victim was an opposition fighter , instead presenting the person as a civilian
so how does @entity3 overcome these challenges ? we get the best evidence when we are able to examine the crime scenes ourselves
despite significant risks , we have entered @entity9 without official permission on several occasions to investigate alleged violations
the last time , in april , we visited five towns that had just been attacked in the northern province of @entity112
we photographed bullet marks and blood traces on walls where people had been executed during the army 's attack
we interviewed neighbors who had found the bodies , and in one case , we even spoke with a wounded person who had survived an execution attempt
but rights - abusing governments can not count on hiding the truth even if they manage to keep observers out
@entity9 are still leaving the country in large numbers
by comparing information from multiple , separate , detailed witness accounts , we are wresting out the truth despite the best attempts of @entity9 's intelligence agencies
" @entity14 " is based on more than 200 long and detailed interviews
we asked former inmates of government detention centers not only about the torture , but also about the layout of buildings , the location of the interrogation rooms and torture chambers , and the names of guards and fellow inmates
we documented scars and studied photographs
we asked former detainees to draw the layout of the detention floor , and we asked them to point out on satellite imagery the exact building where they were detained and tortured
we posed the same questions to defectors from the army and intelligence facilities who visited or worked in these facilities , many of whom gave us names and ranks of their superiors overseeing these detention facilities
what we found is that @entity9 authorities are running a network of underground detention facilities
we have identified the locations , names of commanders , and torture methods of many of these
while the actual number is probably higher , the 27 detention facilities listed in our report are those for which multiple witnesses have indicated the same building and described in detail the torture methods being used there
by publishing this information , we are putting @entity9 authorities on notice that their crimes will not stay secret
it can take time -- it has taken us several months to map these detention facilities -- but with enough perseverance , the truth will come out about the violations taking place in @entity9
the question then becomes : who will hold those responsible to account ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .
