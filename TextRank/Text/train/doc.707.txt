curbing @entity1 's appetite for wild game is just the beginning of the war against illegal poaching , say conservationists
last week , the @entity7 of the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) clarified the country 's laws on the illegal wildlife trade
anyone who eats endangered species , or buys them for other purposes , is punishable by up to 10 years in jail , state - run news agency @entity12 reported
@entity17 , a spokesperson for the @entity18 who is based in @entity20 , told @entity21 she is " very happy " that the announcement comes with a long list of protected species
" the law has always been there , but the interpretation has cleared up the ambiguity
now it is clear that consumers have to bear responsibility
but we still have to watch if they will actually enforce and execute on the legislation , " she said
@entity1 has 420 animals on a list of officially protected endangered species
it includes the giant panda and golden monkey
many species on the list are illegally traded for their meat , organs or body fluids , considered delicacies and prized for their supposed medicinal properties
@entity51 to @entity1 , the endangered pangolin can be found on restaurant menus selling for as much as rmb 2,000 ( $ 324 ) a dish
the cuora trifasciata , more commonly known as " golden coin turtle , " is traditionally used in making a medicinal jelly
nowadays , both wild and farmed turtles are very expensive and less commonly used in mass - marketed medicinal turtle jellies
the high cost involved in feasting on endangered species means the meals are a status symbol
now , those hungry for a taste of the wild will have to think twice before taking a bite
@entity68 horn more valuable than gold in a 2013 report , the @entity70 found that the illegal wildlife trade ranks fourth in the world as the most lucrative criminal activity internationally , behind narcotics , counterfeiting and human trafficking
and prices for animal items continue to rise
@entity80 costs up to $ 1,000 per pound , while rhino horn is more valuable than gold or platinum , according to the report
" we have lobbied against the selling of shark fin in @entity20 for a long time with no results , " said @entity92 " last year , mainland @entity1 announced a ban on sharks fin at official banquets and @entity20 also banned shark fin , bluefin tuna and black moss ( at official functions )
" then @entity1 decided to destroy confiscated ivory and @entity20 will follow next month
so i do see a trend of stepping up efforts to protect species in the region
" @entity20 will burn 28 tonnes of seized ivory on may 15 , the largest stockpile to ever be destroyed
but @entity105 points out that consumers and retailers on the black market are only one part of the puzzle
" we need to see a lot of effort from many different angles in order to protect endangered species and recover the dwindling populations
" population decline can be due to threats to their habitat through urban encroachment , conflicts with agricultural producers , climate change , as well as poaching , " says the activist .
