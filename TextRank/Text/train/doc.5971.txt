-- @entity1 appears on the verge of a tour comeback , but it apparently wo n't be launched in @entity5 as had been planned
the country star 's promoter confirmed tuesday it was canceling " the @entity12 " in @entity13 because the city council there would only approve three concerts -- not the five that @entity1 wanted
" no concerts will take place , " a statement from @entity15 said
" the ticket return process will be outlined tomorrow
" the promoter said 400,000 tickets had been sold
@entity1 ' name was on a statement given to the @entity24 media insisting he would do " five shows or none at all
" " to choose which shows to do and which shows not to do , would be like asking to choose one child over another , " the statement said
@entity1 was the biggest selling solo recording act ever when he left the road and studio behind to concentrate on raising his three daughters 13 years ago
fans have only seen him perform since then at a few benefit concerts and a weekend residency in @entity39
@entity1 works weekends in @entity39 his youngest daughter @entity41 graduated high school in may , relieving @entity1 of his paternal duty to drive his kids from his farm in @entity46 , @entity47 , to school each morning and be there for every soccer match
@entity1 revealed last december in a " @entity52 " interview that wife @entity53 and his daughters had given him approval to launch a world tour in 2014
he has scheduled a news conference on thursday for what is expected to be a tour announcement
the @entity13 shows had been planned for @entity61 , a football arena that can hold more than 90,000 fans , on five consecutive nights during the last week of july
the city council approved friday , saturday and sunday shows , but rejected licenses for monday and tuesday night concerts
the city noted the stadium was " in a heavily populated residential area " and five nights of @entity1 would be " an over intensification of use of the stadium
" the traffic , noise and " potential antisocial behaviour " by @entity1 fans could add up to " an unacceptable level of disruption " for @entity13 residents , the council said
the city promised residents it would limit the number of special events to three each year when the stadium was renovated several years ago
it already hosted three concerts in may , the council 's statement said
the promoter surrendered tuesday , saying it had " exhausted all avenues regarding the staging of this event
" several dozen angry fans gathered outside the stadium tuesday to protest with chants and signs , demanding the shows be allowed
