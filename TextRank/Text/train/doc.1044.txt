visiting the @entity0 in @entity1 never gets old to me
not only is it architecturally stunning , but the quotes on the four panels surrounding the sculpture of our third president stir a profound sense of patriotism and spiritual clarity inside me
" we hold these truths to be self - evident : that all men are created equal
" " @entity15 hath created the mind free
" " @entity15 who gave us life gave us liberty
" and then there 's my favorite : " i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions , but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind
" that quote goes on to talk about the importance of having a fluid @entity32 , one that reflects the society of the time as opposed to " the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
" it 's really quite profound when you think about it : a founding father granting future generations permission to make changes to a document with the ink barely dry on the original
and we have taken @entity48 up on his suggestion , such as granting women the right to vote
but that tends to be the nature of most of the biggest changes that have been made to the @entity32 : affecting the rights and behavior of citizens as opposed to the structure of the government itself
today , given how money , special interest groups and technology , including electronic media , have diseased the entire political process , i believe it 's time we considered some sweeping changes
and i believe those changes should start at the very top -- the president
there are three ways @entity72 can make the presidency better equipped to respond to the 21st century world
the first would recognize that the functioning of the federal government is impeded by a president 's bid to run for re-election
so how can we change that ? we start by eliminating second terms
president @entity85 's open mic comment , telling @entity87 president @entity86 that he would have " more flexibility " to discuss missile defense after the november election , was n't as much an appalling gaffe as it was an accurate assessment of the inherent flaw of a two - term system for presidents
in an election year , each time the president goes to @entity96 with a new initiative it 's inevitably going to be met with partisan grandstanding and resistance
and that 's just one negative byproduct of having two terms for a president
when you think about it , the first year is spent operating under the previous administration 's budget , and part of the third and all of the fourth are spent running for re-election
essentially we give a new president about 18 months to focus on creating meaningful policies
a good chunk of the rest of the term is spent fundraising
but what if we were to amend the @entity32 so that each president gets only one six - year term ? he or she spends five years focused on governing without handwringing over a bid for re-election
the second change : a requirement that no person could be elected president without prior military experience
i 'm ok with @entity133 candidates questioning @entity85 's foreign policy
i 'm not ok with all of this tough talk about @entity136 , with the risk of starting another war , by @entity139 and @entity140 , who chose not to serve during the @entity141
military experience does not necessarily mean serving in wartime , and clearly military experience alone does n't guarantee a sharp strategic mind ( insert president @entity147 joke here )
but it just seems logical that if you 're going to be called commander in chief , there should something tangible on your resume to suggest that title has been earned and not handed to you by a super pac
it was our 34th president , @entity159 , who said , " i hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can
" when i hear @entity139 , @entity166 and @entity167 speak about @entity136 , their words are not spoken through the filter of @entity159 's insight , but rather shouted arrogantly out of a megaphone at some people who hate @entity85
it 's so twisted that the views of the only candidate with military experience , rep. @entity176 , are routinely dismissed as being naive by a handful of warmongers who do n't look as if they 've ever thrown a punch in their lives
while i agree with the overall tone @entity85 has taken in the @entity184 , i believe he too would have been better served with military experience
it certainly would have added credibility to his push to overturn the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy as well as his decision on the @entity192 surge
the third change i would like to see may seem small , but it 's a long overdue amendment : raise the age of eligibility to run for president from 35 to 45 -- and cap it at 70
i know , i know , president @entity198 was great -- for some -- but we do n't need to be wondering if the person we elect is going to die while in the @entity201
and since 35 is the new 25 , we definitely do n't need an inexperienced youngster with his or her finger on the button either
we 're living longer and getting married later , so it would only stand to reason that we alter the age window to reflect those changes
and in this same vein , it would also make sense to establish term limits on members of @entity96 , and cap the amount of money one can spend on elections
if we all take a look around , we 'll see a good chunk of our political process has been kidnapped by career politicians and lobbyists , working to serve each other more than the @entity72 people
in order to rescue this process we must do what @entity48 encouraged us to do -- adapt
and i believe such changes should -- no , need to -- start at the top .
