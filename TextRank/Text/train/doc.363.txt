-- @entity1 released an update wednesday that makes it easier to keep up with conversations on the social network
now , @entity1 and @entity1 's mobile apps show conversations in chronological order
tweets in a conversation are connected using a vertical line
see also : 25 @entity1 accounts to make you laugh up to three tweets in a sequence are shown connected on your home timeline , so you can catch up on a whole conversation at a glance
if three tweets are n't enough , you can tap on any single tweet to see all of the replies , including any responses from people you do n't currently follow
whole conversations can be shared with friends via e-mail from @entity1 , or as individual tweets from the @entity29 and @entity31 apps
wednesday 's update also expands on @entity1 's abuse button
already available for @entity29 , now you can report individual tweets for abuse or spam from the @entity31 app and @entity1
check out this video for a quick look at how the new conversation feature works
