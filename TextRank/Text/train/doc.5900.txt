@entity0 , @entity1 -- dressed in fancy clothes , she applies eye liner , dabs her nose with a powder puff and the director shouts , " silence , rolling ! " @entity10 , who plays child bride @entity11 in the popular but controversial show
on cue , the star of the show delivers her lines
@entity11 , the main character of " @entity17 , " an @entity1 television serial
twelve - year - old @entity11 is a child bride who was married off at the age of eight
she now lives with her husband and in - laws , bound by customs and traditions in their home
the daily soap is just over a year old and already one of @entity1 's most highly rated tv shows
an estimated 74 million people watched it in july
the ceo of colors , the channel the show airs on , says viewers love it because it 's based on reality
@entity37 said : " there is enough research on child marriage , the evils of child marriage
we 've based our storyline on that
" @entity37 added the concept the show was based on is very much real and most of the incidents depicted in the program still happen in parts of @entity1
even though the @entity1 legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys , the law is often ignored
since it 's an illegal act , it 's very hard to find a record of how many child marriages take place -- but according to @entity63 , 40 percent of all child marriages in the world take place in @entity1
critics of " @entity17 " say the premise -- that child marriage takes place in @entity1 -- is the only real aspect of the show
the driving force behind child marriage is poverty , says @entity72 , of the children 's charity @entity75
she says child brides are often illiterate , malnourished , considered a burden on their parents -- and their lives bear no resemblance to the glossy images seen on tv
according to @entity72 , the serial glorifies child marriage
" to show it as harmless , is a problem
" " poverty is not pretty so the child is not going to be wearing party frocks and looking pretty , contented and happy because that 's not what really happens
what really happens is the child is forced into adult responsibilities too early
whether it 's the responsibility of motherhood or whether it 's linked to abuse , as is the case many times
" that , according to @entity72 , is the reality of child marriage
the people behind the show say its goal is not to glamorize child marriage -- but to highlight its dark side
@entity37 said : " have we depicted it in a way that is entertaining ? yes
is the evil of child marriage highlighted ? yes
are the evils associated with it highlighted ? absolutely
" in between takes on the set of the show just outside @entity0 , @entity10 , who plays @entity11 , does her part to educate the audience
" i feel very bad about what 's happening to @entity119
child marriage is very , very , very , very , very , very , very bad
" some @entity1 lawmakers argued the show violated the @entity123 and demanded the show be banned
the government looked into it and gave it a clean chit , so the cameras continue to roll on the sets , and the show goes on .
