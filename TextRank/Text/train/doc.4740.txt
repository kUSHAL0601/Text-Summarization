-- @entity1 could have no more fitting symbol of its tumultuous history than its national flag
emblazoned with a green cedar tree against a white background , framed between two red bands , an official account states the white represents peace , the red , the blood that has been spilled in the name of liberation and the tree , survival
situated on the eastern-most lip of the @entity19 basin -- in a region once known as the @entity21 -- @entity1 stands at the gateway between @entity23 and the @entity25 @entity24 and @entity26
throughout its history it has been the scene of bitter struggles
as far back as @entity30 , @entity31 -- realizing its importance as a strategic gateway to the @entity19 -- led a seven - month siege at @entity36 , modern @entity1 's fourth largest city
originally an island city , @entity31 spared no effort in taking the @entity41 city state , constructing a 1km - long causeway to connect the island with the mainland as part of his invasion plan
part of the @entity48 from the early 16th century , @entity1 became a @entity50 mandate after @entity51 and achieved independence in 1943
in the 20th century , it suffered violent shifts in its fortunes
once known as the " @entity56 " because of its cosmopolitan nature , @entity55 proudly boasted that it was the only city in the world where you could swim in the @entity19 in the morning and then drive to the mountains to go skiing in the afternoon
others compared it with @entity65 as its reputation grew as a financial center in the 1960s
until the mid- 1970s the country prospered , but conflict between the @entity73 and @entity74 communities , the influx of @entity77 refugees , and repeated wars in the region destabilized the country
civil war erupted in 1975 and did not end until 1990
the first general elections in 20 years were held in 1992
the civil war broadly pitted @entity77 and @entity74 militias against @entity1 's @entity73 militias , devastating the country in the process
an estimated 150,000 people were killed and thousands fled the country
the @entity1 diaspora is thought to be around 14 million , according to the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , with the majority in @entity92 and the @entity93
the country had an estimated 4,125,247 people in july 2010 , according to figures from the @entity96 , although no official census has been taken since 1932 because of the sensitive political balance between @entity1 's various religious groups
the country is known to have a " confessional democracy " and refers to a system of government whereby political and institutional power is distributed proportionally among religious communities
the presidency is reserved for a @entity106 , the prime minister is a @entity108 and the speaker of parliament a @entity111
according to the @entity90 , @entity1 is home to 18 separate religious sects and several different ethnic groups
key to understanding @entity1 is its fractious and often bloody relationship with its neighbors , @entity116 and @entity117
with the formation of @entity116 in 1948 , thousands of @entity77 refugees flooded into @entity1 altering the country 's finely balanced demographic
according to the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) , the international body set up to ensure the welfare of @entity77 refugees , there are about 400,000 officially registered @entity77 refugees in @entity1 , or approximately 10 % of the population
just under half of the refugees continue to live in camps
in 1982 , @entity116 launched a full - scale invasion of @entity1 to counter the @entity132 ( @entity132 )
that year the @entity133 militia group @entity133 was formed with the purpose of ridding @entity1 of @entity116 influence
most @entity116 troops were withdrawn by 1985 , although @entity116 remained in the south until 2000 when it dismantled a 12 - mile security buffer zone it had maintained inside @entity1 territory since 1978
@entity1 's eastern neighbor @entity117 has also been influential in the country 's affairs and internal politics
@entity117 troops arrived in 1976 shortly after the civil war started and did not leave until 2005
their withdrawal was precipitated by the assassination of former prime minister @entity148
many @entity150 elements within @entity1 blamed the assassination on the @entity117 government and the @entity133 , claims they denied
even with ongoing political tensions and spasms of violence , since 2005 , @entity1 has worked hard to emerge from this bitter legacy , reinventing itself as trendy tourist destination
thanks to the rejuvenation of war - torn central @entity55 , one of the largest and most ambitious urban redevelopment projects in the region , @entity55 is once more laying claim to its as title of the " @entity56
" but even as the nightspots and cafes begin to repopulate a battered @entity55 , the country remains a hostage to its geopolitical position
according to the @entity172 refugee agency , as of august this year , @entity1 had received more than 30,000 refugees from @entity117 as conflict there rages , once again testing the resilience of its people
