-- a federal appeals court has ordered a judge to rethink a ruling that would have led to the execution of a @entity6 inmate
the @entity8 ruling , released late monday night , says a @entity10 @entity9 must now set a hearing to determine the fate of death row inmate @entity13
the ruling may delay @entity13 's execution that was scheduled for thursday
@entity13 was sentenced to death in 1982 for raping and murdering a high school student
his execution would be the first in @entity6 since 2006 , when legal challenges arose and prompted the state to revise its lethal injection procedure
the federal appeals court said a @entity10 @entity9 made a mistake when it recently said that @entity13 should choose between a one - drug or a three - drug option for his lethal injection
" the district court 's decision to provide @entity13 the choice of a one drug option is not consistent with @entity6 state law and procedures , " the court ruling said
" @entity6 law does not provide the condemned a choice between a three - drug protocol or a one - drug option
" the ruling was not meant to decide @entity13 's guilt or innocence , but only was considering the " narrow issue of the manner and timing of @entity13 's execution in a fashion that comports with the @entity48 's protection against cruel and unusual punishment , " the federal appeals court said
the ruling could also delay @entity13 's execution for some time because @entity6 is running low on one of the drugs that is used in lethal injection
the state 's supply of sodium thiopental is set to expire on october 1 and will not be avaliable until early next year , the appeals court said
@entity13 was sentenced to death in 1982 for the rape and murder of @entity61 , who was walking to @entity62 in @entity63 when @entity13 pulled her into an orange grove , according to court documents
he raped and strangled her with her own shoelace and took her school identification cards and books
later that evening , @entity13 looked up her family in the phone book and called their home , the documents state
" @entity76 , mrs. @entity61 , @entity77 is n't home from school yet , is she ? " court documents quoted him as saying
" you will never see your daughter again
you can find her body on the corner of @entity85 and @entity86
" he also placed a call to police directing them to her body
during the investigation , three witnesses identified @entity13 as being near the scene of the crime
police also found @entity61 's school books and newspaper articles about her death in @entity13 's home , and clothing with semen stains in @entity13 's work locker
during the penalty phase of @entity13 's trial , his lawyer claimed his client was remorseful and presented psychiatric evidence suggesting that @entity13 had emotional problems , including sexual maladjustment and dysfunction
the jury deliberated for three hours before returning a death verdict , according to an opinion issued september 19 by the @entity8
@entity6 's last execution was on january 17 , 2006 , when @entity116 was put to death for three counts of first - degree murder with special circumstances
from behind bars , he had helped orchestrate a deadly armed robbery at a convenience store
@entity0 's @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this report .
