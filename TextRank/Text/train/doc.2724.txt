@entity0 -- a federal appeals court ruled against @entity4 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage tuesday , arguing the ban unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination
in a split decision , a three - judge panel of the 9th @entity11 found the state 's @entity16 " works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians " by denying their right to civil marriage in violation of the 14th amendment
" very soon , @entity16 will be gone forever , " said @entity23 , one of two women who challenged the ban in federal courts along with a male same - sex couple
" today marks the culmination of what has been a transformational year
" @entity31 : what does ruling mean ? supporters of @entity16 , which passed with 52 % of the vote in 2008 , said they were willing to take the issue all the way to the @entity39 @entity38
and a stay halting same - sex marriages remains in place as the appeals continue
lea este @entity44 / read this article in @entity47 the @entity48 , a conservative @entity50 legal foundation that backed @entity16 , said it was not surprised that " this @entity53 - orchestrated attack on marriage -- tried in @entity0 -- turned out this way
" but it said it was confident the @entity38 would uphold " the expressed will of the @entity39 people
" " no court should undercut the democratic process by taking the power to preserve marriage out of the hands of the people , " it said
nevertheless , supporters of same - sex marriages cheered the decision when it was announced in @entity0 on tuesday morning
" for me , it 's a beautiful day , " same - sex marriage activist @entity69 said
" but it 's a great day for the @entity73
" @entity74 and her partner , @entity75 , are raising twin boys who will be ready to attend college next year
one of the boys , @entity74 , said he lived " in a home with a lot of love , " but added , " @entity16 has done a really , really good job of trying to tear that love apart
" " we can see a light at the end of the tunnel , " @entity74 added
tuesday 's ruling affirms a 2010 decision by a @entity39 district judge in @entity0
in the majority opinion , circuit judges @entity92 and @entity94 noted that they were speaking only to @entity16 , and that other states would have to decide the issue of marriage themselves
" for now , it suffices to conclude that the people of @entity4 may not , consistent with the federal constitution , add to their state constitution a provision that has no more practical effect than to strip gays and lesbians of the right to use the official designation that the state and society give to committed relationships , thereby adversely affecting the status and dignity of the members of a disfavored class , " the opinion states
in a part - concurring , part - dissenting opinion , circuit judge n. @entity117 said he was n't sure @entity16 " lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests " in terms of raising children
previous rulings show an argument for " extreme judicial restraint " in such cases , he wrote
@entity4 's @entity38 ruled same - sex marriages were legal in @entity4 in 2008 , before proposition 8 went before voters
its passage put an end to the practice
the @entity134 , which came under fire for its strong support of the referendum , said through a spokesman that it " regrets " the ruling
" @entity4 voters have twice determined in a general election that marriage should be recognized as only between a man and a woman
we have always had that view , " @entity146 , a spokesman for @entity149 - based @entity148 church , said in a written statement
but @entity146 added that the church wants " people on all sides of this issue to act in a spirit of mutual respect and civility toward those with a different opinion
" opponents of same - sex marriage point out that they have won votes in every state where the issue has been on the ballot
but a @entity1 / @entity167 found that public opinion has shifted nationwide since 2009 , with 53 % now saying same - sex marriages should be recognized as valid and 46 % opposed
@entity1 legal analyst @entity31 said tuesday 's decision appears to be tailored narrowly to @entity4
that might be an advantage when the @entity38 considers any appeal , since the justices might decide against taking a case that has no impact beyond the state
" this might well be the last word on the case , " @entity31 said
@entity4 lt. gov. @entity181 , who had allowed same - sex marriages when he was mayor of @entity0 in 2004 , called it " a historic milestone towards equality for all @entity39
" " this is the biggest step that the @entity39 judicial system has taken to end the grievous discrimination against men and women in same - sex relationships and should be highly praised , " @entity181 said in a written statement
six states grant same - sex marriage licenses : @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200
five additional states recognize civil unions , providing state - level spousal rights to same - sex couples
they are @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211
tuesday 's decision also rejected arguments by supporters of the ban that now - retired federal judge @entity216 should have stepped aside and let another judge hear the case
@entity216 found @entity16 unconstitutional in 2010 , and disclosed after his retirement that he is gay and in a long - term relationship , leading @entity16 advocates to argue he should not have heard the case
@entity1 's @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .
