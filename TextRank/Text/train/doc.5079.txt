-- experts said thursday that the alleged child sexual abuse scandals at @entity3 and another at @entity4 in @entity5 underscore the frailty and inconsistency of the legal system intended to protect children , while some lawmakers called for changes in reporting such crimes
" as parents , as members of the community , as leaders of organizations , we need to ask ourselves what we can do to prevent the next @entity3 , " said stop it now ! , a group that seeks to end child sexual abuse , in a commentary on its website
" because , unfortunately , it will happen again , unless something fundamental changes
" in the @entity4 case , a former cadet - turned - camp counselor faces a series of charges , including three counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and three counts of lewd act on a minor , according to @entity36 , @entity5 , police
the school 's president said this week that the university is " profoundly sorry " for not reporting allegations against the counselor in 2007
in the @entity3 case , @entity44 's attorney general has charged a former @entity3 football coach , @entity46 , with 40 counts in what authorities allege was the sexual abuse of eight boys
in addition , two @entity3 officials are charged with failing to inform police of the allegations , and questions have been raised about the university 's response
child - welfare advocates are not alone in their calls for reform
the senior @entity62 on the @entity63 asked thursday that the chairman call a hearing to determine whether federal laws intended to protect children and students should be changed
" potential weaknesses in specific laws designed to keep children safe have come to light in the wake of the alleged sexual crimes committed on the campuses of the @entity3 and the @entity4 , " wrote rep. @entity69 , @entity70 in his letter to chairman @entity72 , @entity73
" our inquiry should not seek to parallel , replicate , or interfere with those efforts ; rather , we must examine the ongoing operation of the underlying federal laws to identify any vulnerabilities and better ensure against future risks to children
" @entity69 cited two federal laws : the @entity90 requires higher educational institutions to collect information about and report on crimes that occur on campus
the @entity95 requires states to develop laws mandating that child abuse be reported
in a statement , @entity63 communications director @entity99 said , " the committee is monitoring the situation at @entity3 carefully and will assess the need for congressional action after the @entity105 concludes its investigation into the matter
" one state has already moved to tighten reporting requirements
@entity111 gov. @entity110 on thursday issued an executive order requiring " all public or vocational school , community college , college or university professors , administrators , coaches and other school employees to report child abuse or neglect within 24 hours of observing an incident of child abuse or neglect
" the report must be made to child welfare authorities and police
changes should include tightening requirements among the states about who must report suspicions that a child is being sexually abused , said @entity134 , a lecturer at @entity135 at the @entity136 and author of " @entity95 and @entity138 -- working with @entity139
" for example , @entity44 has an unusually narrow category of mandated reporters
the @entity144 ' website says that , in @entity44 , professionals " required to report include , but are not limited to : licensed physicians , osteopaths , medical examiners , coroners , funeral directors , dentists , optometrists , chiropractors , podiatrists , interns , nurses , or hospital personnel , @entity158 practitioners or members of the clergy ; school administrators , teachers , school nurses , social services workers , daycare center workers , or any other child care or foster care workers ; mental health professionals ; peace officers or law enforcement officials
" " it does n't include many people who have regular contact with children , such as school bus drivers , children 's barbers , athletic coaches , " said @entity134 , who has a doctorate in psychology
under " reporting by other persons , " the law appears to leave it up to the individual : " any person who has reason to suspect that a child is abused or neglected may report , " it says
and the requirements of professionals are limited to what they learn on the job , and do not apply to cases where a professional learns about suspected child abuse outside of his or her work , @entity134 told @entity0 in a telephone interview
some states , like @entity200 , are stricter
professionals required to report include " any staff member of a medical or other public or private institution , school , facility , or agency
" and the onus in @entity200 also falls on non-professionals
" any person who has reason to believe that a child is a victim of abuse or neglect must report , " the law says
such variation " makes no sense to me , " said @entity134
" mandatory reporting is not the be all , end all of preventing child abuse , but it certainly is an important part of making authorities aware of children at risk , " she said
variation also extends to laws covering other behaviors , such as age of consent , which ranges from 16 to 18 in the @entity227 , with some states having age - gap provisions under which sexual relations are legal as long as both parties are within a certain age range
children from poor families tend to be particularly vulnerable to child predators , said @entity134 , who noted that the alleged victims were from @entity237 , a program founded by @entity46 for at - risk youths
poor families tend to have fewer options for after - school care ; poor communities tend to lack public libraries and safe parks ; and their schools are less likely to be staffed with adequate guidance counselors and school psychologists who might notice if a child 's behavior has changed , @entity134 said
in addition , children from poor families may be more vulnerable to offers of gifts , as @entity46 is alleged to have made , she said
in the @entity3 case , the grand jury report led to the firing last week of head football coach @entity256 and president @entity257
assistant coach @entity258 -- who , according to the grand jury report , witnessed @entity46 raping a child in 2002 -- has been placed on administrative leave
@entity262 , who was the university 's senior vice president for finance and business at the time of the alleged assault , and former @entity3 athletic director @entity268 are charged with lying to the grand jury and failing to alert police
@entity268 requested and was granted administrative leave , while @entity273 -- whose responsibilities also included oversight of @entity3 campus police -- has retired
@entity46 told @entity277 's @entity276 on monday that he has been falsely accused , saying that he only " horsed around " with kids in the shower after workouts
@entity46 denied being sexually attracted to boys , and his lawyer , @entity282 , told @entity0 monday night that showering with children does not equate automatically to sexual assault
in the @entity277 interview , @entity46 denied one of the charges in the grand jury report , i.e. , that @entity258 had walked in on him in the school 's locker room raping a boy about 10 years of age
@entity46 was arrested on november 5 after the release of the grand jury report detailing crimes that he allegedly committed between 1994 and 2009
he is free on $ 100,000 bail
authorities have said they are checking into more than a dozen calls from people who have said they were victimized by @entity46
several other alleged victims are considering coming forward after seeing @entity46 's monday interview , two @entity301 attorneys told the @entity304 , @entity44 , @entity305
" i spent about half the day in kitchens and living rooms , speaking with victims of @entity46 's molestation and processing with them the effects of @entity46 being on television and @entity46 denying wrongdoing , " attorney @entity311 told the newspaper
" and what i found was that these folks are being re-traumatized
" he said many of the alleged victims were n't sure whether they would contact police , as some cases may be too old to prosecute
one case dates back to the 1970s , the newspaper reported
lawyer @entity324 told @entity0 he is representing one alleged victim and has received calls from more than 10 other people who said they , too , were victimized
" in every instance , @entity46 used his position of trust and power and his caring ways as a coach and mentor to groom the families and the children , " @entity324 said
" and after he did , he would in some way act out on them -- either at the schools , at the events , on trips , at a variety of locations
and in some instances , he raped or assaulted them
" he added , " this is about an institutional failure by many over decades to heed the warning signs and to protect the kids and , instead of protecting the kids , many , many adults chose to protect the reputation
" attorney @entity353 , who represents one of @entity46 's alleged victims , said in a statement issued after @entity46 's television interview that his client " fully intends to testify that he was severely sexually assaulted by mr. @entity46
" the lawyer said more information would be forthcoming
@entity364 civil rights law firm @entity362 , @entity365 and @entity366 issued a statement thursday saying it is working with @entity311 and @entity369 , a law professor , to formulate a civil case against @entity3
earlier this week , @entity46 's attorney told @entity0 he was expecting other people hoping to take advantage of the situation to come forward with claims
during an investigation into the allegations , authorities found that @entity237 records , including travel and expense reports , were missing from about 2000 to about 2003 , the @entity376 reported thursday , citing two sources with knowledge of the case
the records were supposed to be stored at an off - site facility , it said
records from one of the years were later found after apparently having been misfiled , the @entity376 said
" it could be that they were just lost , but under the circumstances it is suspicious , " one law enforcement official told the newspaper
the alleged rape witnessed by @entity258 , who was then a graduate assistant , was detailed in the grand jury report
according to the report , @entity258 told @entity256 ; @entity256 then alerted his boss , @entity268
the grand jury report also indicates that @entity258 talked to @entity273 and that @entity273 never presented the information to university police
preliminary hearings for @entity268 and @entity273 were set for december 6 in @entity405
@entity0 's @entity406 , @entity407 and @entity408 contributed from @entity301
@entity0 's @entity409 reported from @entity410 .
