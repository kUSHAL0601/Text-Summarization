-- a simple goal brought @entity2 to attend medical school at the @entity4 15 years ago
" just helping people , " she says
" and i know that sounds so trite , and that 's what everybody says , but that 's really why i wanted to be a doctor ... to help people
" @entity2 says she loved the movie " @entity13 " with @entity14 , in which a doctor is sentenced to work in a small - town hospital
" i was like , ' that 's what i want to do
' so i was all ready to move out into a small town and take care of everybody and be the town doctor
and then during my first few months of med school , things shifted quite a bit ( when ) i was diagnosed with cancer
" @entity2 says learning about the different types of cancer and the latest research inspired her to study oncology
but it was meeting the other cancer patients in the waiting room that cemented her career path
i found ' life 's calling ' after paralyzing injury " getting to know them and their stories ... i just decided that that 's what i wanted to do
" @entity2 's cancer diagnosis was actually the result of an anatomy lesson three months into medical school
her class was discussing an esophageal cancer patient who had a lymph node in his neck
" i was assigned to evaluate the lymphatics of the thorax and so this was my assignment for this one case
and i did it , i gave a presentation , all of that
" the next week , she felt a lump in the same place the patient had it
" of course , as a hypochondriac medical student , ( i thought ) i had esophageal cancer and i was going to die
" it took a month before @entity2 knew what exactly what she was dealing with
the diagnosis : @entity72 lymphoma , a cancer of the lymph tissue found in the lymph nodes , spleen , liver , bone marrow and other sites , according to the @entity80
@entity2 says she knew her prognosis was good and was determined to continue medical school while undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments
she went on to start a fellowship at one of the premier cancer centers in the world , the @entity85 in @entity86 , and she 's never left
she now heads the oncology department at @entity86 's @entity92
having been a cancer patient has influenced how she interacts with patients , she says
chopper crash survivor helps others heal with art " i understand how they feel with the nausea
i understand how they feel when they do n't want to eat and their family is pressuring them to eat , " @entity2 says
" some people i tell that i had cancer , and some people i do n't
it just depends on if it 's going to help them in the situation
" @entity2 admits her personal experience makes her treatment style a little different
" i cry with my patients
i laugh ... i feel like i 'm more emotionally connected with the patients
i 'm a hugger , i 'm a crier , and everybody knows it
and they 're all used to it
and i think the patients like it
