-- when @entity2 approached journalists last week at @entity5 's @entity4 , she did more than accuse @entity7 's men of rape
she also became the face of the @entity11 movement
since the highly publicized incident , which ended with a hysterical @entity15 being whisked away by government minders , the 29 - year - old lawyer from @entity13 has been celebrated as a symbol of @entity19 defiance
" many @entity19 i know online on social media are holding up @entity2 as a hero , " said @entity20 , an @entity21 - born journalist who writes columns on @entity24 and @entity25 issues
" and many people across the region -- @entity21 , @entity30 -- ( are ) demanding to know where she is and fearing for her life
" a day after @entity36 was taken into custody , a spokesman for the @entity19 government said she had been released
he also said her report -- that she was kidnapped and gang - raped by 15 of @entity7 's men -- would be investigated
but nobody close to @entity36 , including her family , has heard from her since her reported release
even if she is soon confirmed to be safe and sound , one could say the damage has already been done to @entity7 's regime
@entity47 's capture and detention added fuel to the @entity19 opposition by garnering global sympathy for its cause
@entity54 pages and @entity55 feeds from around the world have continually paid tribute to @entity15 and made her a rallying cry for revolution
" everyone can see the expression , almost in real time , of the face of this woman being yanked by @entity7 's security and alleging rape , which is very powerful , " said @entity61 , vice president of @entity62 and @entity63 for the @entity64
" and they can relate to how brave she was to ... put her story forward
" @entity75 might be the latest symbol of @entity24 unrest , but she is far from the first
iconic figures have also emerged in other countries : -- in @entity21 , @entity82 helped mobilize @entity21 's youth and force out president @entity84 , who had led the country since 1981
@entity82 , a 30 - year - old @entity86 executive , played a key role in organizing the anti-government protests in january
he was detained for 10 days by the government , but when he was released he became even more vocal , sitting down for media interviews and addressing thousands of demonstrators at @entity93 's @entity92
-- before @entity82 in @entity21 , there was fruit vendor @entity95 in @entity97
@entity95 , 26 , kick - started the entire @entity24 upheaval after he lit himself on fire , protesting his humiliating treatment at the hands of the local government
less than two weeks after his death , @entity97 president @entity104 @entity103 had resigned in the wake of massive public protests
" everyone tells me when i go there , ' if there were no @entity113 , none of this would have happened , ' " @entity61 said
-- and even before the recent wave of unrest , there were the 2009 protests of the @entity119 election
@entity120 , 26 , became the rallying point of the protesters ' struggle when she was fatally shot during the government 's crackdown
her death was captured on video and aired worldwide
" when we look back , we tend to associate specific causes and struggles with individuals and particular moments , " said @entity128 , an assistant professor at the @entity129 at the @entity130
" in the case of @entity21 , for example , @entity136 represents ... the core of the @entity21 democratic revolution that toppled @entity84
when we think of him , details are not required
his name tells the story of an entire people and political cause
" the importance of having a ' face ' the mass media and new technologies have played a tremendous role in creating these icons , @entity61 said , and their influence can not be overstated
" if this would have happened 20 years ago , when we did not have satellite tv , when we did not have @entity54 , when we did not have @entity55 -- when we were dependent on the government - controlled media to report on the story -- then @entity95 would have died in vain and hardly anyone would have heard about him , " he said
@entity61 said that when he first started working in journalism , there were fewer than 100 satellite television stations in the @entity24 world
" now there are 750 , " he said
" three years ago , there were 400
so the governments ... they 've lost control [ of the message ] pretty much all over the @entity62
" the exception to that might be in countries that heavily restrict foreign media , such as @entity119 and @entity30
the death of @entity120 was n't caught on television cameras -- it was captured by a cell phone
and despite the impact of her death in inspiring protest , the @entity119 government was eventually able to quell the dissent
@entity183 , an assistant professor of history at the @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187 , said " having someone as a face of a revolution is nothing new
" he pointed to historic figures such as @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity195 in @entity196 and @entity197 in @entity198
" but the importance of having an immediate face for the revolution seems to be increasing in an age of 24 - 7 internet and television media coverage , " he said
it also helps mobilize the public quickly and efficiently , @entity128 said
" successful revolutions require some form of mass mobilization to challenge established power , " he said
" these stories and individuals can inspire millions of people to sacrifice themselves and to take the necessary risks that are needed to push forward a political cause
" authoritarian regimes remain in power due to fear and political apathy
if this can be overcome , change becomes possible
" the power of one story can not be underestimated , said @entity224 , a professor of @entity62 history at @entity226
he experienced it himself when he was a student protesting the @entity228
" i remember that one of the things that got us even more loudly into the streets was what we really saw as the martyrdom for @entity236 students who were shot down in 1970 , " @entity224 said
" i remember so many of us walking around just infuriated and determined to work even harder to oppose ( president ) @entity237
... in our minds , ( these protesters ) became sort of symbols for us of the need to be willing , if need be , to sacrifice yourself for a greater cause
" @entity224 has been paying close attention to the " @entity247 , " discussing the latest developments on his blog and analyzing the politics in play
with civil unrest festering in countries such as @entity254 , @entity30 and @entity255 , he expects more new faces to come to the forefront
" it 's going to be a very , very different era about to open up , " he said
" and there may be , as part of that , new heroes who are going to be emerging
" people need heroes , and people often seize upon very unlikely heroes like @entity95
you never know who it 's going to be next
