@entity0 , @entity1 -- if every scientist hopes to make at least one important discovery in her career , then @entity7 professor @entity6 and her colleagues may have hit the jackpot
scientists have bred a new strain of flood - tolerant rice that could help feed millions
@entity16 's team works with rice , a grain most @entity19 take for granted , but which is a matter of life and death to much of the world
thanks to their efforts to breed a new , hardier variety of rice , millions of people may not go hungry
about half the world 's population eats rice as a staple
two - thirds of the diet of subsistence farmers in @entity35 and @entity36 is made up entirely of rice
if rice crops suffer , it can mean starvation for millions
" people [ in the @entity19 ] think , well , if i do n't have enough rice , i 'll go to the store , " said @entity16 , a professor of plant pathology at @entity7
" that 's not the situation in these villages
they 're mostly subsistence farmers
they do n't have cars
" as sea levels rise and world weather patterns worsen , flooding has become a major cause of rice crop loss
scientists estimate 4 million tons of rice are lost every year because of flooding
that 's enough rice to feed 30 million people
@entity61 is grown in flooded fields , usually to kill weeds
but rice plants do not like it when they are submerged in water for long periods , @entity16 said
" they do n't get enough carbon dioxide , they do n't get enough light and their entire metabolic processes are thrown off
the rice plant tries to grow out of the flood , but when it does , it depletes its sugar reserves
it starts to break down its chlorophyll , important for photosynthesis
it grows really quickly , and then when the flood recedes , it just dies
it 's out of gas
" normal rice dies after three days of complete flooding
researchers know of at least one rice variety that can tolerate flooding for longer periods , but conventional breeding failed to create a strain that was acceptable to farmers
so @entity16 and her colleagues -- @entity93 , senior scientist at the @entity94 in the @entity95 and @entity96 , professor of genetics at the @entity98 -- spent the last decade working to find a rice strain that could survive flooding for longer periods
@entity93 identified a flood - resistant gene 13 years ago in a low - yielding traditional @entity35 rice variety
he passed along the information to @entity16 , who isolated the gene , called @entity105 , and introduced it into normal rice varieties , generating rice that could withstand being submerged in water for 17 days
the team relied on something called precision breeding , the ability to introduce very specific genes into plants without the associated baggage of other genes that might tag along in conventional breeding
" this can be a problem for farmers , " @entity16 said
" the varieties that were developed from conventional breeding were rejected by farmers because they did n't yield well or taste good
" using precision breeding , scientists introduced the @entity105 gene three years ago into test fields in @entity36 and @entity35
the subsequent rice harvests were a resounding success
" the results were really terrific , " said @entity16
" the farmers found three - to five-fold increases in yield due to flood tolerance
they can plant the normal way
they can harvest the normal way and it tastes the same
farmers had more food for their families and they also had additional rice they could sell to bring a little bit of money into the household
" " the potential for impact is huge , " agreed @entity93 in a statement on the @entity94 web site
" in @entity36 , for example , 20 percent of the rice land is flood prone and the country typically suffers several major floods each year
submergence - tolerant varieties could make major inroads into @entity36 's annual rice shortfall
" the researchers anticipate that the flood - tolerant rice plants will be available to farmers in @entity36 and @entity35 within two years
because the plants are the product of precision breeding , rather than genetic modification , they are not subject to the same regulatory testing that can delay release of genetically modified crops
the @entity19 @entity168 conferred one of its highest research awards last december on @entity16 , @entity93 and @entity96 for their work on submergence - tolerant rice
but @entity16 has no plans to rest on her laurels
" i feel a great sense of gratitude that i was able to contribute in this way , " she said
" but the farmers have asked us , ' can you develop varieties that are drought tolerant , salt tolerant ? can you develop varieties that are insect resistant ? ' there are always more things to work on
" @entity2 's @entity188 contributed to this story .
