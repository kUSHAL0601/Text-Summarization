a grand jury has indicted officer @entity1 of the @entity2 on a charge of voluntary manslaughter in the september 14 shooting death of @entity6 , according to a statement from state attorney general @entity8
the grand jury heard evidence from the @entity11 and the police department
" with the strength of the evidence in this case , we 're not surprised , " @entity13 , an attorney for @entity6 's family , said about monday 's indictment
" we 're all pleased and happy that the process is beginning now and that there 's an end in sight , " he said
" it is the first step towards justice
" @entity6 's mother , @entity28 , told @entity29 that she is prepared to wait as long as it takes for the case to wind its way through the justice system
" i just feel like @entity34 's will will be done , " she said
the @entity36 , @entity37 , officer faced a second grand jury proceeding for the fatal shooting of @entity6 , an ex-college football player who was reportedly seeking assistance after a car accident
attorneys for @entity1 had denounced the prosecution 's move to resubmit the case as unlawful and filed a motion to block it , but @entity29 affiliate @entity47 reported the grand jury convened monday morning
a grand jury last week declined to indict @entity1
prosecutors said afterward the grand jury was composed of less than a full panel and vowed to send the case back
according to a handwritten statement filed with the court , the first grand jury requested that the prosecutor submit a " bill of indictment to a lesser - included or related offense , " but the state attorney general said he would resubmit the voluntary manslaughter charge
@entity64 , another attorney for @entity6 's family , described relatives as " shocked and devastated " by the first grand jury 's ruling and said they were concerned a " miscarriage of justice is imminent
" @entity1 's attorneys , however , filed a motion friday saying that any miscarriage was on the prosecution 's part
@entity37 law states that a grand jury can be made up of 12 to 18 members , the defense attorneys said
thus , the prosecution 's claim that it could go back to the grand jury because fewer than 18 members initially heard @entity1 's case was spurious , the motion said
there was " nothing irregular or improper " about the grand jury that heard last week 's case , the attorneys said in a statement
the motion further alleged that @entity8 's statement to the media -- that " this is not over " -- and his announcement that he would resubmit the case was a " wholly improper and blatant attempt to influence the ( second ) grand jury
" the defense reiterated its claim that the shooting , " while tragic , was justified under the circumstances presented to @entity104 at the time , " according to its statement
" we have seen news clips and interviews stating the community should be ' outraged ' at the return of a @entity112 , " the statement continued
" those outraged have simply not heard all of the facts and hasten to a position
the true outrage of this community should be at the attorney general 's complete disregard of the original findings of our first grand jury
" @entity6 's family disagreed and issued a statement saying , " it appears that this motion was filed solely because @entity1 's attorneys feel their client will be indicted once the full @entity129 properly considers the evidence in this case when it convenes on monday
" attorneys for @entity6 's family on january 13 filed a civil lawsuit connected to his death
it targets the city of @entity36 , @entity137 , @entity36 - @entity137 police chief @entity138 and @entity1
@entity1 shot an unarmed @entity6 , a 24 - year - old @entity139 football player , after a woman -- home alone with her 1 - year - old child -- called 911 and reported someone was trying to break down her front door
it was 2:35 a.m. , and according to the lawsuit , the woman " does not understand that @entity146 may be injured and is in need of assistance and becomes frightened by his presence on her doorstep at such a late hour
she quickly closes the door , calls 911 for assistance and activates her home security system
" the woman told police @entity6 was " yelling for her to turn her alarm off " but never reported that @entity6 harmed her , made threatening statements , brandished a weapon or stole or vandalized her property , the lawsuit further alleges
police were dispatched , and @entity6 walked down the street to seek assistance elsewhere , according to the lawsuit
@entity1 and two other officers arrived on the scene about 11 minutes after the 911 call , but @entity1 did n't speak with the woman , the lawsuit says
he instead tracked down @entity6 , who " never engages in any conduct which can be objectively reasonably interpreted as aggravated active aggression , " according to the lawsuit
" @entity177 , in direct violation of written police department regulations , fires 12 high - velocity bullets at @entity146 , striking him 10 times in the chest and arms , " the lawsuit continues
the @entity2 has called the shooting unlawful
" the evidence revealed that mr. @entity6 did advance on @entity104 and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of mr. @entity6 was excessive , " police said in a statement on september 14 , the day of the shooting
" our investigation has shown that officer @entity1 did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter
" @entity1 is free on $ 50,000 bond
his attorneys said in their statement friday , " the citizens of @entity137 by and through its grand jury have spoken
we pray that if this case is reheard by a second @entity129 , the same conclusion will be reached -- that there is no probable cause to sustain an indictment for voluntary manslaughter against @entity104
" @entity208 recused himself from case
