-- reputed mob boss @entity1 , visibly annoyed , muttered under his breath " you 're a f --- ing liar " thursday as a disgraced former @entity6 supervisor testified that there was " no question " the @entity10 gangster doubled as an informant for @entity6 @entity12
prosecutor @entity13 requested that the judge in @entity1 's federal trial advise @entity1 to " keep his little remarks to himself , " which judge @entity18 advised shortly after
both sets of attorneys have spent a remarkable amount of time during the trial of the notorious @entity1 , charged with 19 murders and in court after living in hiding for 16 years , trying to prove whether @entity1 was an informant during a 15 - year period
even judge @entity27 is beginning to question the importance of the issue
during post-court discussion over motions , as the defense was attempting to further it 's argument that @entity1 's informant records were forged by his @entity6 handler , judge @entity27 questioned , " how does that address that your client is not guilty of crimes here ? " @entity1 's attorney @entity39 danced around the question and responded , " @entity1 was not providing information as an informant , he was providing money so that he 'd get tipped off about wire taps and search warrants
" @entity1 's attorneys have been quick to admit to acts of extortion and racketeering -- charges @entity1 is also facing -- to defend their client 's position that he was not another " rat " from @entity12
" why ca n't both be true ? " judge @entity27 inquired
" the defendant 's position is ( that ) only one is true
" why would @entity56 be paying all this money to all these people if the government 's theory is he got all this protection because he was providing information
why would he keep paying everybody ? " former @entity6 supervisor @entity64 , an addition to the government 's long list of cooperating witnesses , testified thursday that he took bribes from @entity1 in the amount of $ 7,000 , along with a silver - plated champagne bucket and two cases of imported wine
@entity64 said he asked @entity1 if he could " spring " for a plane ticket for his secretary girlfriend to visit him during @entity6 training in @entity77 , and @entity1 obliged
@entity64 admitted to his acts of corruption in 1997 in exchange for immunity
a sheepish , red - faced @entity64 , though less than six feet away from @entity1 , avoided eye contact with the defendant , who glared steadily at his old confidant throughout his testimony
this is the first time the two have seen each other since they cut ties in 1991 after @entity64 leaked @entity1 's informant status to the @entity91
@entity64 said he first met @entity1 at a dinner he hosted his @entity95 , @entity94 , home in 1978 along with @entity1 's @entity6 handler @entity96 , whom he characterized as his " best friend
" @entity64 said he met @entity1 and later his associate @entity99 " @entity98 eight to 10 times in various places , including @entity64 ' home , @entity64 ' girlfriend 's apartment , a hotel , @entity1 's home and even in @entity109 's mother 's house for dinner
the defense has previously argued that @entity1 was not treated like an informant , and thus did not believe that he was
@entity64 testified that @entity96 preferred to meet @entity1 in " pleasant surroundings , not the type of surroundings you would meet a normal informant , " like in a hotel or car
" he wanted mr. @entity1 to be comfortable , " @entity64 said
@entity64 was supervisor to rogue @entity6 agent @entity96 , who is currently serving a 40 - year sentence on second - degree murder charges for leaking the identities of witnesses cooperating against @entity1 's @entity126
@entity109 , serving a life sentence , is set to testify against @entity1 later in this trial after agreeing to cooperate with the government to evade the death penalty in 1997
all that @entity1 and @entity109 wanted from their handlers in exchange for information was " a head start , " as @entity64 described -- to be tipped off if they were going to be indicted or charged so they could flee
the pair , according to @entity64 , knew they were " fair game " and acknowledged that they were engaging in criminal activity and at some point they might get charged
if that happened , they did n't want their identity as informants disclosed and would rather " take the risk " @entity64 said
@entity64 admitted to tipping his informants off to wire taps , and keeping their names out of a 1975 horse race indictment
he testified that the @entity154 , or @entity155 , was the main priority of the @entity6 in @entity12 and that @entity1 and his partner @entity109 were instrumental in the take - down of those mobsters
the two provided the agents with a drawing of mafia headquarters , and that was used to take down the @entity154 in a 1983 sting
after being tipped off to an indictment , @entity1 went on the run for 16 years and landed himself on the @entity6 's top 10 most wanted list before being arrested in his @entity169
@entity170 , home with his girlfriend in 2011
@entity64 said that he signed off on reports @entity1 provided to the @entity6 that he knew were false lies to protect himself from being implicated as the person to who leaked sensitive information that may have tipped @entity1 off to witnesses that were cooperating against him
those potential witnesses were eventually murdered , @entity64 said , and @entity1 has been charged in their killings
while the defense had little time to cross-examine @entity64 , who will be back on the stand friday , defense attorney @entity182 painted @entity64 to be a liar , an adulterer , and a fraud
he was able to fire off a question that is likely to resound with the jury
" you were corrupt , were n't you mr. @entity64 ? " @entity182 queried
" yes , " @entity64 exhaled after a long pause and a deep breath .
