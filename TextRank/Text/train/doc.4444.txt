@entity0 , @entity1 -- many high - school - age students are hooked on their phones and computers
instead of fighting the kids , some schools like the @entity7 in @entity0 , @entity1 , are jumping right in and embracing the technology
" we meet kids where they live , " new tech principal @entity10 said
where they live is increasingly online , on instant messenger and @entity18
the school encourages students to bring in their own computers and to embrace tools like @entity23 and @entity24 in school and as part of their lessons
@entity29 , founded in 1997 , is the oldest member of the @entity31 , a national nonprofit organization that schools hire to implement project - based learning and embed the use of technology with teachers and students
the @entity31 has gone on to work with 120 schools of varying grades and budgets , but the @entity0 high school is a unique look at how the next generation of schools might work with modern technology , not against it
responsibility online giving high school students unrestricted access to technology presents its own challenges
the decision to trust students online and even encourage them to build up a public presence is the opposite of what 's happening these days in many schools , where strict social - media policies , internet filters and constantly evolving rules are meant to rein kids in
that 's the better battle to choose , " @entity64 said
all students at @entity31 are trained in digital citizenry and responsibility , with teachers constantly emphasizing awareness of how things posted online will never go away
these lessons come at a key time , educators there say : early enough to prevent students from sharing the irresponsible photos or posts that seem to be a rite of passage for the internet generation
the teachers are also active on @entity18 , bantering with students and using the social network as a teaching tool in their lessons
any errors of judgment the students may make along the way are treated as teaching moments
after one student tweeted something negative about a basketball player , one of his teachers publicly replied on @entity18 , respectfully asking whether that was the best choice of words
new @entity31 junior @entity97 , 16 , has a public @entity18 account that she uses to communicate with teachers and other @entity31 students and teachers
she is very careful about what she says because she knows she is representing her school
" i know that people from all around the country are following my @entity18 , " @entity97 said
" i also have my personal @entity18 , which is blocked , so i have those separate lives
" social media is just one of the ways students and teachers connect outside of the classroom
most high school students do n't do much e-mailing , according to @entity64
the classroom goes online at the heart of the school 's modern take on technology is a web - based program called @entity120 , which ties into @entity121 so students and teachers can use @entity124 e-mail , docs , chat and calendar accounts
they are on gchat constantly and can use it to talk to teachers or other students in and out of school
" it is the biggest part of @entity31 ; i 'm on @entity120 every day , " @entity97 said
teachers use the system to upload all the teaching materials for their classes and to track grades for projects
students use it to track their progress in the seven categories that make up their grades : written communication , tech literacy , curricular literacy , oral communication , work ethics and professionalism and critical thinking
teachers can upload powerpoint presentations , project guidelines , resources like links to websites and other relevant content to guide students though projects
because classes are primarily project - based , the students use the tool 's online discussion boards to work on group assignments
" using it as a tool for instruction saves so much time ; that 's time i can focus on teaching , " said economics and political government teacher @entity168
instead of making teachers overly dependent on technology , the tool seems to free them up to be more creative with their classroom time
when a new big project is introduced , teachers create " entry events " : splashy presentations that grab the students ' attention and get them excited about the work ahead
in the past , a teacher staged a " csi " - style crime scene , taking on the role of corpse and asking the students to investigate the murder
a biology class had local winery and vineyard owners come in and lead the students through examining soil samples in order to determine what type of grape should be planted in each
having an online mirror of everything taught in the classroom is useful for students with different learning styles
some might soak in information better listening to a teacher speak , while others prefer to read the materials for themselves
" i think it 's empowering for the students , " @entity168 said
it 's also helpful for their parents , who have full access to their kids ' pages and can see transcripts , grades and assignments
there 's no more waiting until a bad report card arrives in the mail ; parents have the power to track their child 's progress in real time
" my mom checked in my freshman year
i was n't really sure @entity31 was right for me , " @entity97 said
" she would definitely check in very often , keeping me on task
" bring your own computer because most of the tools are now based in the cloud , students are n't stuck using school - issued computers
instead , they are embracing the bring - your - own - device trend
@entity242 in businesses , the approach has taken off in schools only very recently
three years ago , @entity31 took on a $ 30,000 three - year lease for 120 @entity246 netbooks
with 320 students at the time , all the laptops were constantly in use
this year , the student population has grown and includes a larger percentage of students from low - income families , yet only 60 of the school netbooks are in use
most people bring in their own laptops
some use @entity260 , while others take advantage of the low - cost netbooks found in stores like @entity265
ipads and other tablets are the least popular choice for students
@entity64 says that when they do see the devices , they 're mostly being use for play , not work
this still being high school , the kids who do use the clunky school laptops feel conspicuous , according to @entity64
while she has n't seen any students being teased for using the school laptops , she said she has seen evidence of the kids judging themselves
ready for the real world all the training at @entity31 is focused on preparing students to transition into the real world
in addition to the group work that mimics companies ( students can fire someone on a team if they are n't pulling their weight ) , seniors at the school wrap up their final year with a required project : a web page they build themselves with their @entity296 Â© s , letters of recommendation and links to work they 've done at school .
