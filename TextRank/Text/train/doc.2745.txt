-- passengers were asked to help pay for fuel on a @entity6 - bound @entity5 flight that had to be diverted to @entity7 this week , the airline said
in the end , passengers did not have to go into their pockets to help fuel the plane , the airline said
" @entity5 confirms that it asked passengers if they had cash , as payments for fuel can only be made in cash in @entity18 , " an @entity5 statement said
" ultimately , @entity5 could pay the full amount itself , and passengers did not have to advance any cash
" the incident occurred wednesday on a flight from @entity24 to @entity6
because of security concerns in @entity6 , the plane was scheduled to divert to @entity27
the plane could not secure a flight path to @entity30 , so instead , the crew decided to land in @entity18 , @entity5 said
it was during the two - hour stopover in the @entity7 capital that passengers were asked for gas money
after @entity5 figured out the issue , the passengers were flown to @entity38 and then taken to @entity6 on thursday
" @entity5 apologizes to its customers for the inconvenience , " the airline said .
