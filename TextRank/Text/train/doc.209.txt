-- if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , then fast food giant @entity1 is paying its longtime industry rival a royal compliment
in a new television commercial , @entity1 's mascot , a slightly sinister king with an outsized , motionless plastic head , breaks into the headquarters of @entity12 and steals the recipe to their @entity14 with egg and cheese
the advertisement is a parody of super agent derring - do , with high - tech gadgets and a swift getaway
but it 's also a sly wink at @entity1 's new @entity27 's undeniable resemblance to the classic @entity14
but are @entity29 's executives upset with this campaign ? have lawyers been rallied and accusatory calls been made ? " we have n't received any direct feedback from competitors , " said @entity33 , @entity1 's vice president of marketing impact
@entity33 further defends his company 's choice to be up - front about the similarities between the @entity27 and the @entity41 , saying , " we are not above taking a product that we know customers like and delivering it to our guests at a great price
" in fact , many others in the fast food arena are n't averse to this , either
for instance , both the @entity27 and the @entity41 are part of special breakfast " dollar menus
" but , as @entity33 points out , " we were the first to launch a national breakfast value menu , and now you see that becoming an industry norm
" but it 's a " norm " that is rarely acknowledged
when asked about @entity1 's campaign admitting to " stealing " the @entity14 , a @entity29 's representative said , " we remain focused on our business and serving our business
" the proof , however , is on the record
even if @entity1 had n't publicly admitted " burglarizing " @entity29 's , the @entity14 arrived to market first
the original @entity41 was conceived in 1972
fortunately for competitors , @entity29 's does n't own the rights to eggs , sausage , cheese or @entity71 muffins
just the powerful brand - name " @entity14
" but even " the @entity76 " is n't above finding inspiration in the products of other fast food innovators
in 2008 , @entity29 's faced criticism for launching its @entity79 - @entity78 , which featured a fried chicken cutlet on a buttered bun with two pickles
to fast food connoisseurs , it appeared nearly identical to the chicken sandwich that made @entity87 - based @entity86 famous
these allegations were disputed by @entity12
and this is n't the first time @entity1 has created a product that mirrored its longtime rival
the @entity93 is @entity29 's signature burger : two all - beef patties , special sauce , lettuce , cheese , pickles , onions , served on a sesame seed bun
but in 1997 , @entity1 released the @entity102 , which was two all - beef patties , special sauce , lettuce , cheese , pickles , onions , served on a sesame seed bun
the difference between the @entity93 and the @entity102 ? it was n't the " special sauce , " a variation on @entity112
it was the beef patties : @entity1 " flame - broils , " but @entity29 's " grill fries
" the @entity93 king was discontinued in 2003 .
