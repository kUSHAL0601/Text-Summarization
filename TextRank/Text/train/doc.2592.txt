-- it 's almost that time : the once - a - decade - moment when the @entity2 tries to determine the population
counting more than 300 million residents is a complex and costly operation ( an estimated $ 14 billion ) , but the results yield the basis for how we apportion @entity9 , distribute more than $ 400 billion in federal funds and understand basic changes to the number and geographic distribution of @entity15 residents
the largest challenge that the @entity2 faces is ensuring everyone is counted , regardless of where they live , who they live with and perhaps most controversially , regardless of whether they are authorized to live in the @entity15
most households will receive a census form by mail in mid-march to be filled out as of @entity26 , april 1
first results of state counts for redistricting purposes must be delivered by december 31
the rest of the results will be released over a period of time that ends in 2013
filling out a census form is mandatory by law
the @entity36 will have 10 basic questions for each household member , but it is viewed as a burdensome task by some because they see the questions as too personal or the process too intrusive
others distrust what the government will do with the information or fear that it may be used against them
some are hampered by language barriers
still others have more than one residence
every decade , the @entity2 works hard to make sure everyone is counted once and only once
and it makes an extra effort to count those who have traditionally been hard to count : racial and ethnic minorities , immigrants and the poor
this coming census -- the largest count of the @entity15 population with more immigrants and minorities than ever -- will be complicated further by the economic downturn and foreclosure crisis because many people are " doubling up " or otherwise living in temporary quarters
the census questionnaire asks for a count of all people who live and sleep in the household " most of the time , " as of april 1 , but not those who are living away at college or in the military or those who are living in a nursing home or who are in a jail , prison or detention facility
( they are counted separately from households
) " home " may have changed recently for those whose hardship leaves them little choice but to live with relatives or friends , however temporary that may be
" home " for displaced residents of the @entity100 may be miles away from where they lived before the devastation that @entity94 and @entity95 wrought in their communities
" home " for some immigrants is in @entity15 communities even though they are not legally residing in the @entity15
and " home " may be in a prison or detention center in a state far away from the inmate 's hometown residence
these are the very residents that @entity36 will try hardest to enumerate this spring
abutting the challenges of where to call home are the public debates surrounding them : -- civil rights leaders , recognizing the unique context of the @entity100 region , are working hard to ensure an accurate local @entity36
at the same time , other regional leaders would like to see displaced @entity100 residents counted where they lived before the storms
-- a coalition of @entity124 leaders is lobbying for inmates to be counted in their place of residence before imprisonment
-- a tug - of - war has ensued between @entity131 leaders on one side who are working to get an accurate count of the population regardless of legal status and those on the other side who are advocating a census boycott by immigrants as a way to put pressure on @entity9 to move forward with federal immigration reform
-- a recent amendment introduced in the @entity143 would have delayed the implementation and hiked up the cost of the census , had it passed
in an attempt to exclude the unauthorized population from the official count for congressional apportionment purposes , it would have required questions on citizenship and immigration status for each respondent
that data is not collected to encourage participation in the census
the senators missed the deadline by two years to make a change of that order of magnitude
given the demands and challenges , it is vital that we bear in mind the importance of achieving an accurate count and the economic , political and policy implications if we fail
understanding our changing population : state and local data on age , race and ethnicity , household size and composition help communities with projections for school enrollment , housing , transportation and health care
businesses use census data for decisions about where to locate and for marketing purposes
information from the census is used to prepare for emergency services , research changes and advocate for various causes
distributing federal dollars geographically : more than $ 400 billion a year is at stake , federal funds that go to states and localities to build schools , hospitals , highways and fund programs such as @entity204
apportioning @entity9 : the redistricting and apportionment of congressional seats is contingent on census results
this is the primary purpose of the census as written into the @entity15 @entity211
states and localities also use the data to redistrict ; therefore it is in every state 's interest to be accurately represented based on their residents
one debate that has been resolved : @entity36 2010 will not use statistical sampling as many @entity222 leaders have feared
sampling has been proposed as one way to mitigate the undercount of minority populations , the majority of whom are assumed to vote @entity229
the @entity15 @entity2 does use sampling in its annual @entity231 that collects more detailed data including social , economic , and demographic characteristics
the political and equity arguments will continue to surface as we head into @entity36 2010
public officials , advocacy groups , and community organizations will need to work together with census officials to get the most out of what will be a difficult enumeration , but one that sets the stage for the next decade
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .
