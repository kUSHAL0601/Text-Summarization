-- @entity1 said a senior @entity3 operative tied to several attacks in @entity5 was killed monday in a @entity7 strike in southern @entity1
@entity8 , pictured on the @entity10 's web site , reportedly was tied to @entity3 's @entity5 operations
intelligence sources have confirmed to the @entity1 government that @entity8 was killed , information minister @entity12 said tuesday
" we welcome that attack because those people targeted were murderers , and they are unwanted and unwelcome in @entity1 , " @entity12 said
@entity8 's death will have " a major impact " on @entity3 's operations in the @entity22 , according to one regional analyst
@entity7 special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on a car monday in southern @entity1 , killing several people , including one they believed was @entity8 , @entity7 officials told @entity0 earlier
@entity8 , 30 , was born in @entity28 and had been tied to attacks that included the 1998 bombings of the @entity7 embassies in @entity28 and @entity32 , according to the sources
more than 200 were killed , and 4,000 wounded in those attacks , most of them @entity28
the @entity7 targeted @entity8 in an airstrike in southern @entity1 near the @entity28 border in march 2008 , @entity7 officials said at the time
in february 2006 , the @entity10 announced that @entity8 was wanted for questioning in connection with the 2002 suicide bombing of an @entity40 - owned hotel and the unsuccessful attack on an @entity40 charter jet in @entity43 , @entity28
ten @entity28 and three @entity40 -- including two children -- were killed when three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside @entity43 's @entity47 in november 2002
the bombing took place within minutes of an unsuccessful missile attack on an @entity40 charter jet , which was taking off with 261 passengers and 10 crew members
president @entity55 signed off on monday 's operation , a senior @entity7 official said
the @entity7 had been monitoring the situation for days and had intelligence that @entity8 was in the area , the @entity7 officials said
the officials who talked to @entity0 are familiar with the latest information on monday 's strike but did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media
the @entity7 helicopter flew from a @entity65 warship offshore , while the ship kept watch on the operation , one of the sources said
the warship was ready to rescue the @entity7 troops if they got into trouble
farmers in the southeastern town of @entity75 , @entity1 , said they witnessed the assault
they said helicopters attacked a car and its occupants and that at least two people died
the witnesses said some helicopters landed and that some of the injured or dead were pulled into at least one helicopter
a @entity7 official said the troops landed to take away the body believed to be that of @entity8 for positive identification
@entity8 is believed to be an associate of @entity3 member @entity91 , who was indicted in the 1998 bombings of the @entity7 embassies
the @entity7 military has long sought @entity8 because he is believed to be deeply involved in @entity3 's @entity5 operations , a senior @entity7 official said last year
" he was certainly one of the leading @entity3 figures in @entity5 , " said @entity97 , a @entity1 analyst for the @entity98 , an independent advisory and analysis organization
@entity8 " has been living in the shadows " in @entity1 and not much is known about his recent activity , @entity97 said
" the fact that he is now out of the picture will have a bigger impact on @entity3 than on @entity110 , " he said , referring to the @entity105 militia in @entity1 that has ties to @entity3
" he is a man with an important organizational memory , and if a key figure like him is killed , it always has a major impact
" @entity110 is waging a bloody battle against @entity1 's transitional government and is on the @entity7 list of terrorist organizations because of its @entity3 ties
there are growing concerns that @entity1 could be the next base for @entity3 as @entity7 forces pound their positions in @entity125 and @entity126
cia director @entity127 recently said the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing @entity3 operatives
journalist @entity133 and @entity0 's @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .
