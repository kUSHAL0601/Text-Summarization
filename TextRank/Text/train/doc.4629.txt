@entity0 -- maybe you 've decided to show your partner love with a new @entity4
but how about 99 of them ? in @entity8 , the number 9 sounds like " forever , " so on sunday a man proposed marriage to his partner in @entity12 , @entity13 by lining up 99 brand new @entity4 6s into the shape of a heart
the phones cost him around two years worth of savings to buy , but it 's unclear whether she said yes
november 11 is @entity13 's @entity21 ( it 's the date with the most 1s )
as a bit of inspiration to those who have yet to leap into happily ever after , here 's a quick list of some of @entity13 's most creative and entertaining marriage proposals in recent years
the hot and spicy @entity32 's romance must be sizzling hot , because on august 29 , he proposed to his girlfriend using two massive hearts made of 99,999 red chili peppers
now there 's one guy who knows how to spice up a relationship
( @entity40 ) a frank proposal here 's one that 'll make you hungry for love -- or maybe just hungry
28 - year - old @entity46 met his girlfriend in a hot dog store while both were vacationing in @entity49 and soon fell in love
on august 20 , 1,001 days after their sausage link - up , he asked her to be his wife by presenting her with 1,001 hot dogs spelling out the words " i love you
" she said yes -- with relish
( @entity59 ) more than meets the eye you have to see this one to believe it
in december 2013 , a young man proposed marriage by building an 8 - meter tall replica of @entity66 from the movie @entity68 , weighing a solid ton
no word on how his girlfriend responded , but we can only imagine she transformed into his wife
( @entity73 ) a heroic gesture two years ago , in @entity77 province , a young man made a superhuman effort to win his partner 's hand in marriage -- by dressing up as @entity82 , then using a crane to hoist himself 19 stories into the air while holding 9,999 balloons
as his girlfriend walked by , people shouted for her to look up at the sky
he then gracefully descended from the sky , ring in hand
( 19lou ) coming up roses on @entity93 2012 , @entity92 wanted to impress his girlfriend -- a lover of clothing -- with more than just a bouquet of two dozen roses
see where this is going ? yes ; this smooth operator created a beautiful dress for his beautiful girlfriend using exactly 9,999 roses , which she proudly donned while he asked for her hand in marriage
( @entity108 ) a romance worthy of the big screen one of @entity112 's shopping centers , named @entity113 , features a jaw - droppingly massive led - screen " sky
" it 's one of the largest in the world
in 2007 , one @entity8 man surprised his girlfriend by taking her on an innocent trip to the mall , then suddenly dropping to one knee , as photos of the happy couple flashed across the 250 - meter long display
( @entity127 ) proposal goes swimmingly this man won major style points in 2011
after secretly practicing for months , he rode a dolphin across a pool to his girlfriend as she stood unsuspecting on the other side , before proposing in front of a cheering crowd
the woman was shocked -- but remember , he did it on porpoise
( @entity140 ) an address in a dress finally , one to reverse the gender norms
last month , a college - aged woman named @entity146 from @entity147 surprised her boyfriend by delivering a tearjerking speech while wearing a white wedding dress
" others all think i am a little too impatient , whether it is too early for us , " she cried to her partner
" i want to say , when we meet the right person , no matter how early it is , it is still too late
do you want to marry me ? " he said yes
