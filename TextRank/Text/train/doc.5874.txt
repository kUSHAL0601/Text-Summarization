it started in 1996 as a crazy idea to ring in the new year , but police nearly shut it down
" they said , ' we have an idea : let 's do a shoe drop
... we made this shoe for you , ' " recalled @entity11 , the star of a weekly drag queen review in @entity13
" ' you 've got to sit in it for @entity15 , ' and i said ' ok , ' and that is how it started
" so , on @entity15 , @entity11 took center stage inside a massive high - heeled red shoe made out of chicken wire , paper mache and plywood , dangling off the roof of the @entity25 along @entity13 's main street
just like the spectacular ball in @entity30 's @entity29 , the shoe would be lowered with each final minute of the year until the clock struck midnight
crowds started to gather , attracting the attention of police , who tried to shut down the event because the pub owner did n't have a permit
" ( the police ) came upstairs to the balcony and told me to get out of the shoe , " @entity11 said
" the owner called the mayor and the mayor was like , ' leave sushi alone , close down the street
' " today , @entity13 's annual " shoe drop " still stars @entity11 as sushi -- in a better - constructed shoe -- and now attracts attention from around the world
your best moments of 2012 the @entity25 festivities were once the place for the gay community to ring in the new year
today , the crowd is a mixture of tourists and locals from every walk of life
" you 'll have older gay men next to a family with kids , next to guys in leather , next to a bunch of rowdy bachelorettes , " @entity11 said
" each year , @entity11 makes a special dress for the show , which he wears only once
his outfit is a tightly kept secret until he takes the stage as sushi on @entity15
" they sneak her in the back and it 's a big deal , " said fellow drag queen @entity77
" no one really sees the dress until she 's right in the shoe
" @entity11 said he spends months looking through fashion magazines and watching couture fashion shows , getting inspiration from famous designers
" i try to make it really elaborate , one of a kind , something you have n't seen before , " he said
he said his dress this year will be fluorescent green , " like a palm tree exploded -- very tropical
" after ringing in 2013 , @entity11 will put the dress in storage along with the 15 others from new years past
" she gives her all to the dress and to the public that night , " @entity77 said
" she puts her best face forward and foot forward for this event
" it takes @entity11 two hours to transform into sushi : an hour applying makeup , a half - hour getting into the dress and another half - hour preparing his wig
" once you get your face on , your lashes , your lips and your dress , you 're creating somebody different , " @entity11 said
the street in front of @entity25 is closed to traffic to accommodate the crowds
while they wait for @entity11 as @entity123 , a live musical dance and impersonation show is performed on a stage in front of the bar
" at 11 o'clock , @entity123 arrives , and we lower the shoe and put her in it , then raise her up , " said pub owner @entity130
over the next hour , @entity11 as @entity123 is lowered 20 feet down inside the fire - engine red shoe made of fiberglass and stainless steel
the shoe is a size 8 -- feet , that is -- with a 4 - foot - high heel
" it is very stable and secure , " @entity141 said
that has n't always been the case
" it rained the second year , and my foot went through the bottom of it and i was like , ' you guys have to make me a new shoe , ' " @entity11 recalled
" ' ( otherwise ) i 'm not going to sit in it
' " @entity11 said the months of preparation for the hourlong show , and the potential danger of being dangled in midair , is all worth it because it allows him to represent the gay community and the city of @entity13
" every year she says , ' this is my last year , ' " @entity141 said , " and i say , ' @entity164 , you are going to be the old lady in the shoe
