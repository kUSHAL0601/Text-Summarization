@entity0 , @entity1 of @entity5 in the violence - riddled eastern region of the @entity4 on sunday evening , according to eyewitnesses , threatening to take the strategic capital of the region
heavy fighting has been reported in recent days as rebel groups battled the @entity4 army and @entity15 soldiers
a relative calm on sunday morning in @entity5 was broken by fighting close to the town and airport
" some government officials and diplomats have fled to @entity23 ( in eastern @entity24 ) and across the border to @entity26 , " said a journalist in @entity5 who did not want to be named for his own security
@entity27 in the region of @entity29 said that they deployed attack helicopters and ground troops to respond to the @entity33 advances on @entity5
the eastern part of @entity24 has been embroiled in violence since 1994 , when @entity37 forces crossed the border fearing reprisals following the genocide in neighboring @entity26
in 1998 the vast nation -- previously known as @entity4 -- became a battleground for eight @entity43 countries
more than 5 million people died in the war and its aftermath , making it the deadliest conflict since @entity49 despite the signing of peace accords in 2003 , fighting continues in the eastern part of @entity24 between various rebel groups and the @entity4 army , which is back by @entity15 peacekeepers
early on saturday , rebel soldiers launched attacks on several key towns north of @entity5 using heavy weapons , said the @entity24 mission in a press release
the @entity63 held an emergency session on saturday , condemning the latest attacks by the @entity33 rebel group
" the members of the @entity63 strongly condemn the resumption of attacks by the @entity33 and demand their immediate cessation , " said ambassador @entity67 of @entity68 , which holds the @entity63 's rotating presidency
soldiers from the @entity76 had been part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009
they broke away from the @entity4 army in april of this year , complaining about a lack of pay and poor conditions
one of their commanders , @entity86 , is wanted by the @entity87 for war crimes , including recruiting child soldiers
the @entity15 and some donor countries have accused neighboring @entity26 of backing the @entity33 rebel group by providing it arms , support and even soldiers
it is a allegation that @entity95 , @entity26 's president , has repeatedly denied
but security analysts say the rebellion in eastern @entity24 has dangerous regional implications , and the international community has expressed alarm at the latest @entity33 advancement
" i call on the @entity33 to immediately stop the military offensive against the city of @entity5
any support to the @entity33 in violation of the sanctions ... and the arms embargo must stop , " said @entity105 , the @entity106 foreign affairs chief
residents of @entity5 were close to panic on sunday , but no one had fled across the border to @entity26 yet
" but who knows what will happen overnight , " said one resident .
