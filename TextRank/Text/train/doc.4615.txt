-- newly - promoted @entity1 moved up to sixth in the @entity4 @entity3 table after a surprise 1 - 0 victory away at high - flying @entity7
@entity8 scored what proved to be the only goal of the game with a header from @entity14 's cross after six minutes
@entity15 dominated the remainder of the match , but could not break down the compact @entity1 defense
and the home side 's frustration boiled over 10 minutes from time when @entity22 was sent off for a professional foul on @entity24
' @entity25 ' on verge of history a victory for @entity7 would have taken them above @entity30 into second in the table
@entity33 - based @entity1 are competing in the @entity3 for the first time since 2002 , when they were relegated after only winning four games all season
league leaders @entity38 are looking for a seventh win of the season in a top - of - the - table clash at home against fourth - placed @entity43 on saturday
defending champions @entity44 travel to @entity30 on sunday .
