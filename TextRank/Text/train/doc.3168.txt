it 's the latest action in a months - long military campaign designed to push @entity15 fighters out of the @entity2 capital

the capture thursday of @entity26 , a militant outpost in western @entity9 , opens one of the city 's main arteries to the famed @entity11 , the @entity1 said in statement released friday
the market is the city 's commercial hub and the site where one of two @entity36 blackhawk helicopters were downed by militants in 1993
raging street battles in the capital since february have pitted government troops , backed by the @entity1 , against the jihadist movement @entity15 , which controls much of southern @entity2
@entity15 is waging a war against @entity2 's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of @entity46 law , or sharia
@entity2 has not had a stable government since 1991 , and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine - ravaged country the peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in @entity9 , including the port , airport and presidential palace
it is the de facto military force of the weak , transitional @entity2 government
