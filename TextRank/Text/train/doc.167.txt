defense minister gen. @entity9 said @entity1 was keeping its agreements to the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes
however , @entity9 underscored the " freedom of navigation and overflight " in the @entity8
@entity1 military has been accused of harassment in the waters recently
the area rich in oil deposits is rife with territorial disputes with claims by @entity1 , the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26
it 's considered to be one of @entity30 's more dangerous potential flashpoints
@entity9 said @entity1 is no threat to world peace , noting its military policy is purely defensive
" to judge whether a country is a threat to world peace , " he said , " the key is not to look at how strong its economy or military is , but the policy it pursues
" he sought to relieve concerns about @entity1 's modernization of its powerful military , saying " no matter how developed it may be , @entity1 will never seek hegemony or military expansion
" @entity23 defense minister , gen. @entity47 , reiterated calls for the conclusion of a code of conduct between the regional organization @entity52 and @entity1 to help restrain disputes in the @entity8
