-- @entity1 and @entity2 may still be the players to beat on the women 's circuit while @entity6 has enjoyed a recent renaissance on the men 's tour but strip away this illustrious trio and there are real fears for the future of @entity15 tennis
@entity6 remains the only @entity15 male in the top 10 of the @entity19 rankings , with @entity20 and @entity22 solid performers in the 20s
on the @entity24 , @entity1 and @entity2 are at no. 1 and @entity25 but then there is a gap to promising teenager @entity28 at 36 , with three other women occupying spots in the lower reaches of the top 100
for a nation with the tennis pedigree of the @entity15 , and with its three standard bearers in their late 20s , it is a worrying trend which @entity6 says is a product of the talent pool in the @entity15 being diluted
are @entity41 's rivals pretenders to the throne ? " i think our best athletes probably get spread out across 10 or 12 different sports , " he told @entity0 in an exclusive interview
" where in @entity47 -- with the success of @entity49 ( @entity50 ) and the other girls on tour and guy players too
it 's kind of become the sport there
" their best athletes -- have been funneled into tennis
in the @entity15 -- i feel like it 's funneled into football , baseball , and basketball
there are so many different options that it might water down the talent pool for a given sport , " he added
@entity69 , whose famous tennis academy has produced the likes of @entity72 and @entity73 , agrees with @entity6
" look you have cheerleading , you have basketball , you have lacrosse , you have basketball , football , you have everything , " he told @entity0
" you have marathons , running , we have a variety of things
i believe you have to go for one sport and dedicate your life to it and also have some talent
" @entity69 also believes the worldwide growth of tennis with many more countries now producing top - ranked players is responsible for the relative decline in @entity15 standards
" let 's go back to the 80 's and 90 's
basically there were six countries playing and we certainly we were right up on top and if you look at the world today you have @entity103 -- unbelievable ladies and @entity105 , you have @entity106 , the @entity107 , you have @entity47 , you have everybody playing , " he said
@entity69 also questions the failure of @entity15 tennis to discover talent at grassroots level from working class backgrounds
" how many of the kids playing today come from poor families ? how many have come from the inner city where there is a possibility they can be somebody ? it is very difficult today in @entity15 to get players to commit , " he added
in response to the problem , the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) has charged @entity127 with developing its elite young players , combining this role with captaining their @entity131 team
@entity127 , whose brother @entity132 topped the world rankings in the 1980s , agrees with @entity6 about the attractions of other sports , but is not going to make it an excuse for failure
" we 've got to do a better job , " he told @entity0
" we need to find those players and train them more systematically
" he says he has been given sufficient funding and resources by the @entity124 , but says no amount of money can develop a grand slam winner if the talent is not there
" i 'm not sure you could create a champion
i 'm not sure that 's possible , but i think you can create an environment where you will get a lot of really good players , hopefully if you do that , you will get the @entity1 , the @entity156
@entity157 , the last @entity15 man to top the world rankings , has no doubt the @entity124 made the right choice in selecting @entity127 to his role two years ago
" @entity127 is a good friend , a great @entity131 captain and a solid ambassador for the sport of tennis
i wish him nothing but the best and will help in any way i can , " he told the @entity124 official web site
despite the support for @entity127 , the flow of young @entity15 talent onto the professional circuit remains a trickle rather than the hoped for flood
current hopes are the @entity178 , 17 - year - old @entity179 and his younger brother @entity180 , who are both at the @entity181
@entity179 became the third - youngest player to win an @entity19 match at 15 and @entity69 believes he has the talent to make it to the top from his current ranking in the mid 200s
" he certainly has the ingredients and that is what this academy does
it provides the basis and then it is up to you and how you want to compete and if you can deal with competition , " he added
despite the talent of the likes of the @entity178 and more established young players such as @entity28 and @entity20 , @entity69 does not believe that future success is guaranteed
" @entity201 has got a tough job , not impossible but he is the one who is going to have to go out , get all the good coaches , support them and get the good players with the good players and work with the colleges
" but you are still going to have to seek out the hungry athletes , " he added
in the meantime , @entity6 , who scored a superb victory in the @entity211 100 tournament recently , is hoping that @entity20 and @entity22 can step up to the plate to give him some support in the upper echelons of the world game
" i 've been real excited that @entity22 and @entity132 have been playing well
i 'm certainly always welcome to have some home company in the top ten or so , " he said .
