-- president @entity2 is seriously considering withdrawing all @entity4 troops from @entity5 in 2014 , a senior administration official told @entity0
the official 's comments came after the @entity8 reported the administration was looking at speeding up the troop withdrawal to the " zero option , " leaving no @entity4 troops in @entity5
until now , @entity4 and @entity5 officials had been discussing plans to keep a small force behind to fight insurgents and to train @entity5 security personnel
but @entity2 has , in recent months , grown increasingly frustrated in dealing with @entity5 president @entity18
their relationship soured further last month after the @entity4 and the @entity21 planned peace talks
in response , @entity18 cut off negotiations with the @entity4 on the residual troop presence post- 2014
a " zero option " has always been among the scenarios the @entity4 envisioned
but the new revelation means that it could be a very possible one now
@entity30 spokesman @entity29 said tuesday that @entity2 has not made a decision on @entity4 troop levels in @entity5 beyond 2014
" we are continuing discussions " with @entity5 about carrying out post-combat missions , @entity29 said
" we continue to work through issues , " he said , adding , " we believe we can work through them
" if the @entity4 pulls out all its troops , it will be a situation similar to that in @entity41
the refusal by the @entity41 government to extend legal protections for @entity4 troops after the end of the war in @entity41 was a major reason the @entity4 left the country with no residual military training force
@entity18 has said he would like for @entity4 troops to remain after the end of the @entity53 mission
but he also has been highly critical of the troops over the years , following incidents in which @entity4 forces have killed civilians
@entity0 's @entity58 contributed to this report .
