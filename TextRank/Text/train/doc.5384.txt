-- with a chance of winning an @entity2 on sunday , the director of " @entity4 " says she hopes her documentary will shed light on the often over-looked issue of polio eradication
the more doses of the vaccination a child receives , the better protected the child is from contracting polio
" i felt like i was looking at something that no one in the world talks about , " @entity15 , who also helped produce the film , said in a recent interview
filming the short documentary was an " eye - opening experience , " she said , particularly for one of her co-producers who had to wear a bulletproof vest during filming in @entity26
" @entity4 " is a testament of the health workers around the world laboring to make polio the second globally eliminated disease behind small pox , @entity27 said
the 37 - minute film , which is scheduled to air on @entity35 on april 1 , has been nominated for an @entity2 in the best documentary short subject category
the awards ceremony is sunday night
the film focuses on " the final stages of a 20 year initiative " to eradicate polio around the world , @entity27 said
polio is a highly infectious disease which lingers in the poor water systems of @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity26
the more doses of the vaccination a child receives , the better protected the child is from contracting polio
" @entity4 " focuses on the polio vaccine efforts in @entity45 and @entity46
@entity27 said she hoped to include @entity26 , but that became impossible because of the threat of violence and social barriers
producer @entity57 had to wear a bulletproof vest while filming in the war - torn country
he was unable to capture compelling footage because of familial protocol that forbids a man from entering a home full of women while no husband is present
thus , @entity57 was often denied access , @entity27 said
in many countries , people are hesitant to vaccinate their children against polio because of a distrust of the government
some civilians believe the vaccination to be " something more sinister like a sterilizing drug " produced to curtail their population , @entity27 explained
she said she often ran into " the skepticism that some communities have against our government in cooperation with their own government
" " it never occurred to me that @entity89 foreign policies could affect young children living in the most densely populated areas , " she said
although it has been 50 years since the @entity89 developed a vaccination for polio , millions of children abroad remain unprotected
" ordinary @entity89 people have forgotten polio , " @entity27 said
and , although the number of polio cases have been reduced by 99 percent , the highly infectious disease is still very real
" it really limits the opportunities a child might have as an adult , " said @entity100 , a spokesman for the @entity102 's @entity101
as part of the @entity101 , 20 million volunteers deliver vaccinations to schools , bus stops and rail stations across the world on a daily basis
only four countries had recorded cases of polio in 2008 , down from 125 countries 10 years ago , according to the @entity101
this year , there have been 26 recorded cases of polio around the world , compared with 46 people who were infected with polio last year
" but we 're only in mid-february
that does n't say much , " @entity100 said
he said that he is most concerned that a child suffering from polio will have a difficult time integrating into society , building friendships and finding a job
" so it 's much more than just the fact that this child will be physically disabled for the rest of his or her life , " he added
" it is the opportunity that is lost from the life they might have led
" @entity0 and @entity35 are both part of @entity143 .
