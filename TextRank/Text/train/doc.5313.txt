from fighting terrorism to processing payments in the blink of an eye , facial recognition is set to change our ideas on privacy
a number of exciting developments in the field could even push its toughest critics to reconsider
" the more people get out of it , the more they 'll surrender to it , " says @entity12 , senior vice president of digital for @entity13 believes that people will only embrace a technology if the benefits outweigh privacy concerns
facial recognition is a computer - based system that automatically identifies a person based on a digital image or video source -- which is then matched to information stored in a database
often used in fictional tv - series such as @entity29 : @entity29 , it is soon set to become a real - life tool for fighting crime
in 2014 , the @entity33 will roll the technology out across the @entity35 after pilot testing is completed in some states
facial recognition is a key part of the agency 's ambitious $ 1 billion @entity40 ( @entity42 ) -- a state - of - the - art biometric identification system that also includes iris scans , dna analysis and voice identification
the mission is to reduce terrorist and criminal activity by improving and expanding biometric identification as well as criminal history information services
@entity53 - based dr. @entity52 is an advocate for the technology too
a professor at the @entity56 , @entity52 has created an " electronic sketch artist " system that has changed how @entity53 police identify criminals
his method is currently used by 90 % of @entity53 police and in more than 30 countries
he explains : " the key advantage here is that it allows people to respond to faces they see rather than having to break it down into component parts
" credited with helping to solve hundreds of crimes , his facial composite software identifies suspected criminals in a new way
the system , @entity75 , allows victims and witnesses to select the best and worst matches from a group of computer - generated faces
based on their responses , the computer eventually " learns " what type of face they are after and displays options accordingly
but facial recognition technology is n't always so straightforward
identifying faces from closed - circuit - television ( @entity92 ) footage can be challenging -- as demonstrated after the @entity94 bombings earlier this year
@entity95 , director of the @entity96 , told @entity98 's @entity97 that low resolution can be especially challenging
" when you look at images collected from standard @entity92 footage , the faces are way too small , " he said in may
@entity95 explained that it is especially difficult matching off - angle images to frontal facial photographs
the solution @entity107 's team has created is a system that transforms flat photos into @entity110
he argues the ability to recreate a suspect from all angles will improve the reliability of facial recognition and also help police track down suspects faster
the luxury retail sector appears to see potential in facial recognition too
according to the @entity124 , dozens of stores and hotels are testing the technology in the @entity35 , the @entity53 , and the @entity126
@entity53 - based company @entity127 , which also specializes in identification of terrorists and criminals , has created a system that analyzes the faces of potential customers as they enter shops
the system then checks this information against a database with celebrities and valued customers -- to help stores identify potential big spenders
once a match is made , the software alerts staff via computer , tablet or smartphone
it can even provide details such as clothing size and shopping history
@entity12 believes that consumers are likely to volunteer information about themselves online if it enhances their shopping experience and helps provide recommendations that " make sense
" a @entity158 company , meanwhile , aims to streamline sales by using facial recognition technology for payments
@entity163 - based @entity162 has patented a system allowing payments to be made without wallets or smartphones
" i 've always been fascinated with how people purchase things and started thinking about the ideal way to pay as you walk into a store , " says @entity167 , the inventor of the idea
anticipating potential customer concerns , @entity167 says that he is n't too concerned the technology could be marred by security risks
" we 've been thinking about this from day one
facial recognition is secure by nature and is fundamentally a biometric technology since you need to be in the store to use the technology
" but not everyone has embraced facial recognition with open arms
in 2011 , @entity188 introduced a controversial feature which automatically identifies faces in uploaded photos by comparing them to other tagged pictures
it was rolled out without warning -- a move that backfired in the @entity197 as regulators and privacy campaigners forced the social networking site to turn off the functionality
in spite of this , @entity188 recently announced plans to extend facial recognition to profile photos in other parts of the world
" our goal is to facilitate tagging so that people know when there are photos of them on our service , " @entity188 chief privacy officer @entity209 told @entity210
@entity217 , the director of the domestic surveillance project at the @entity219 in @entity220 argues that @entity188 has the largest biometric database in the world , which could eventually compromise its users
in an interview with @entity226 , @entity224 said : " no matter how much a company attempts to protect your privacy , if they 're collecting information about you , that information is vulnerable to government search
