-- more than seven months after the death of a luger practicing for the @entity5 , the @entity1 of @entity2 has ruled @entity7 's death an accident caused by multiple blunt force injuries
@entity7 , a 21 - year - old from the republic of @entity11 , died when his body went airborne and slammed into a metal post at about 90 mph ( 144 kph ) during a training run shortly before the @entity15 officially opened
the coroner 's report , written by @entity18 , said @entity7 's injuries " proved immediately fatal
" there had been concerns from athletes about the speed of the record - setting track at the @entity25 , according to a @entity11 official
" there were some questions asked by other athletes even before this tragic accident , " @entity27 , @entity11 's deputy minister for culture and sports , said in february
@entity27 added that there had been several crashes in the same area
when the official luge competition started , male and female racers started from lower points on the luge track , which led to slower speeds
@entity18 's report acknowledges concerns about the design of the track
" following mr. @entity7 's fatal incident , questions arose regarding athlete safety at the @entity25 track and more specifically , the design of the track and the unprecedented high speeds attained at this venue , such as the record speed of 153.98 km / h [ about 95.68 mph ]
" given the high speeds at the track , the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) asked the sliding center for more training days prior to the @entity15 and required athletes to make numerous practice runs from various , lower parts of the course before graduating to the top of the course
" a number of crashes were observed ( 68 crashes in 2,482 runs ) , but the @entity69 also noted in his report that nobody was badly hurt , " during a training week in @entity25 , the coroner 's report states
@entity18 's report states that an @entity54 official sent a letter to the track designer expressing surprise over the speeds and said the designer 's calculations of top speeds were incorrect
@entity7 completed required training runs , the report states
but @entity18 added , " the relative lack of experience mr. @entity7 had on this challenging track set a backdrop for the incident and it was a significant disadvantage , as far as safety was concerned , for the athlete entering the high pressure environment of the @entity15
" the coroner 's report recommends the two international federations over sliding sports -- which include bobsledding and luging -- conduct reviews about their involvement into track design and construction
@entity18 said " further and greater scrutiny of safety issues at the track is advisable
" " it may be that risk can never be fully eliminated from the realm of sliding sports , " the report added
journalist @entity110 contributed to this report .
