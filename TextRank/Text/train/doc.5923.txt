-- the aircraft that capt. @entity2 heroically landed in @entity4 's @entity3 began its long ride saturday to an aviation museum in @entity7 , @entity8
the @entity12 , sans its wings and tail section , left a warehouse in @entity14 , @entity15 , for the journey south , according to @entity17 , president of the @entity18
" it 's very hard to miss , " @entity17 said of the fuselage
" it 's not covered
" the museum has invited the 155 crew members and passengers from the " @entity27 " incident for a june 11 arrival reception , at which @entity2 is the scheduled keynote speaker , @entity17 told @entity0
on january 15 , 2009 , @entity27 left @entity28 and ran into a flock of geese that damaged both engines , forcing the crew to make an emergency landing in the frigid @entity3
rescuers quickly reached the aircraft and found passengers standing on its wings
@entity40 , who retired in march 2010 , and other crew members became instant celebrities
@entity43 in @entity15 has donated the considerable cost of transporting the aircraft , @entity17 said
about 40 vehicles are in the entourage , which reached @entity48 later saturday
because the rig 's height wo n't allow the plane to go under older interstate bridges , some of the move will be on other highways , where wires and some stoplights will have to be temporarily moved , @entity17 said
the plane will be shown off at the @entity7 museum 's main hangar
" it will be on display almost as soon as it arrives , " @entity17 said
@entity63 and @entity12 mechanics will reassemble the aircraft , including its wings and tail section
much of that work will be completed by the fall
@entity2 's uniform , passenger belongings and other artifacts will be part of the display , he said
the cabin will look much as it did during the flight , @entity17 added
between 30,000 and 35,000 visitors visit the museum annually
@entity17 expects that number will triple within 18 months of the exhibit 's opening
most of the flight 's passengers still live in the @entity7 area , he added
the incident represents the height of technical achievements in safety and human heroism , the museum president said
@entity17 recalled taking the next flight after @entity27 and seeing the plane in the @entity3
" i was thinking , ' that could have been me , ' " he said .
