-- @entity2 , accused of killing her 2 - year - old daughter @entity2 in 2008 , was determined competent to proceed with her capital murder trial after she was examined by three psychologists over the weekend , the judge said monday
the psychologists ' reports will be sealed , said @entity8 chief judge @entity7 outside the presence of the jury
" based on privileged communications between @entity16 and her counsel , counsel reasonably believes that ms. @entity16 is not competent to aid and assist in her own defense and is incompetent to proceed , " said the motion , filed by defense attorneys saturday under seal and made public monday
" as a result of this well - founded concern , counsel requests a full competency determination before the continuation of trial proceedings
" it was implied -- but not expressly stated -- that the motion was the reason for the abrupt recess @entity7 called on saturday morning
@entity27 , 25 , is charged with seven counts , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading police , in her daughter 's death
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against her
@entity27 's defense team is trying to discredit the prosecution theory that the @entity41 woman rendered @entity2 unconscious with chloroform , duct - taped her mouth and nose , and stored the body in her car trunk for a few days before dumping it in the woods
the defense says @entity2 accidentally drowned in the family pool and that @entity27 and her father , @entity51 , panicked and covered it up
@entity27 has denied that theory
@entity27 's defense attorneys also filed a motion monday asking @entity7 to reconsider an earlier decision and declare @entity58 's death penalty law unconstitutional
the motion cites a june 20 decision by @entity61 district judge @entity60 , which found the method used to reach a death sentence in @entity58 is improper " because it does not require a jury to make the findings of fact necessary to impose a death sentence
" @entity27 's attorneys had previously filed a motion asking for the statute to be declared unconstitutional , and @entity7 denied it
after the @entity60 decision , they are asking him to reconsider
" because @entity58 's death penalty procedure is unconstitutional , the death penalty should be precluded as a potential sentence , " according to the motion
in the case @entity60 ruled on , @entity78 v. @entity79 , the jury recommended a sentence of death on a 9 - 3 vote but did not say on which aggravating factors it based the decision
a motion to alter or amend has been filed in the case -- basically a motion asking @entity60 to reconsider
jurors heard monday from two men who worked for @entity2 's parents , @entity51 and @entity2 , after @entity2 's disappearance on june 16 , 2008
private investigators @entity92 and @entity94 both said they provided security services at the @entity27 home from " protesters " who would show up
@entity92 said he was working as a citizen although he is a licensed private investigator
the two said they spent two days in november 2008 searching a wooded area for @entity2 's body
the search site was near where the remains were found a month later
a videotape of that search was played for jurors
@entity94 told defense attorney @entity109 the search was prompted by a phone tip he received from a psychic
both defense attorney @entity112 and prosecutor @entity113 accused @entity92 of attempting to cash in on his association with the case by trying to sell the tape of the search , but he denied that , saying he actually thought he had taped over the search and only discovered later he had not
he did say he at one point was going to sell some photographs of the search and give the money to @entity94 and the @entity121
" i did n't need it , " he said
jurors also heard from @entity124 , a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at @entity126 and director emeritus of the university 's @entity128
@entity124 testified that he studies chemicals emitted by both live and dead people
chloroform can be given off in small amounts by a decomposing body
one prosecution expert , @entity135 of @entity137 's @entity136 , described the levels of the substance in the trunk of @entity27 's white @entity141 as " shockingly high
" several witnesses also testified for the state about odors that they said smelled like the unmistakable scent of human decomposition
@entity124 said there are alternative explanations for the chloroform found in the trunk , noting the compound is found in a number of household items , particularly bleach
on his cross-examination , prosecutor @entity155 held up the black spare tire cover from @entity27 's trunk
@entity124 acknowledged that if bleach had been poured directly on the carpet , the cover would have showed some evidence of that
also , @entity124 said , the chemical reactions that produce chloroform also produce other substances
testing was not done to determine whether any of those substances were present , he said -- either by him or by the @entity136 laboratory
@entity124 said there is no instrumentation that can record with scientific validity the presence or absence of human decomposition , and said his studies suggest there are chemical compounds unique to human decomposition that were not present in @entity135 ' analysis of the air samples from the trunk
on cross-examination , however , he acknowledged that a decomposing human body would explain the presence of the compounds that @entity135 found , but @entity124 said a bag of garbage that was left in the trunk for weeks could have contributed
before a lunch break , @entity124 testified that the @entity136 laboratory should have done a quantitative analysis to determine how much chloroform was present in the trunk in order to state its importance
@entity197 detective @entity196 , the lead investigator in the case , was also recalled to the stand monday
@entity112 questioned @entity196 in an effort to cast doubt on the thoroughness of the investigation
under questioning , @entity196 acknowledged that he did not subpoena @entity27 's cell tower records , showing where he was when calls were made or received
asked whether that might have helped investigators , @entity196 said it would have , " if i had had a reason to believe it would play a part in this case , which at the time i did not
" he said he also did not seize a computer belonging to @entity216 , the meter reader who discovered @entity2 's remains in a wooded area near the @entity27 home on december 11 , 2008
@entity196 testified he had no reason to do so
@entity196 also said that cadaver dogs were not deployed on @entity51 and @entity2 's cars , only on @entity2 's
on cross-examination , @entity113 asked @entity196 whether anyone ever reported that either of those cars smelled like a dead body , and he said they did not
monday marks the beginning of the sixth week of testimony in the trial , which began with opening statements on may 24
@entity7 originally told jurors , who are being housed in an @entity41 hotel shielded from media coverage of the trial , that the trial could last six to eight weeks
on friday -- before saturday 's delay -- @entity112 said he expected the defense to rest on wednesday or possibly thursday
that would leave room for a rebuttal case from the prosecution and closing statements before the @entity246 holiday
saturday was planned as a full day in the trial , and it was unclear how the day 's delay would affect those plans
testimony on monday lasted until after 7 p.m. @entity2 was not reported missing to police until july 15 , 2008 , when @entity2 , tracked down her daughter @entity94 and demanded answers regarding @entity2 's whereabouts
prosecution witnesses described @entity2 's behavior in the month after @entity2 was last seen as nonchalant , testifying that she spent time with her boyfriend , went shopping and to nightclubs -- but told no one her daughter was missing
they testified they noticed no change in her demeanor
@entity112 said in his opening statement that @entity27 behaved as she did because years of sexual abuse by her father had conditioned her to conceal the truth and hide her pain
@entity27 has denied the claims that he abused his daughter or helped conceal his granddaughter 's death
in @entity277 's @entity276 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 contributed to this report
watch @entity279 monday through sunday starting at 8 p.m. et on @entity280
