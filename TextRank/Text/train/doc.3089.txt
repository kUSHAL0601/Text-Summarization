" i happened to hit the sexual revolution on the head , and the result was that , without really intending it , i became the founder of the first singles bar
" the first friday 's featured @entity199 , sawdust on the floor , and distinctive red and white striped awnings
first year revenues at the original friday 's were $ 1 million
a second location opened in @entity205 in 1970 , and within 10 years , eight other @entity183 's had opened
