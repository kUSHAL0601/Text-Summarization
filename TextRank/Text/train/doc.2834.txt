-- @entity1 ? or nature over nurture ? what is it that separates @entity7 legends like @entity9 sprinter @entity8 and @entity11 swimmer @entity10 from the millions of enthusiastic amateurs around the world ? can training , dedication and the right mindset turn any sporting hopeful into a world - class athlete ? @entity19 , author of " bounce " and a former @entity7 table tennis player , believes that an individual 's ability is secondary to the level of coaching they receive and the facilities to which they have access
" i think the idea of talent is misleading and in many ways overrated , " @entity19 told @entity0 's aiming for @entity33 show
" when i became @entity35 no. 1 , i thought i must be super talented
but the top players in the country at that time , 80 % of them did n't just come from the same town or the same suburb , but from the very same street
@entity7 goal : a swimmer 's story " there had n't been a genetic mutation -- we happened to have the best coach who gave us access to the only 24 - hour club
" so we practiced before school , after school , at weekends , on holidays
over many years , we transformed ourselves from perfectly ordinary players into world - class players
" so does practice in itself make the world 's top athletes perfect ? not necessarily , according to mental performance coach @entity59
" practice does n't make perfect , " he says
" you only have to think of your handwriting for instance , how as you get older the more you write the worse you get
" only perfect practice will make perfect
to improve you have to be very specific about what you are aiming to do and target it
" it is a view supported by @entity19 , who suggests that the willingness of top athletes to push themselves further and further in practice pays dividends when it comes to high - pressure competition
" it 's interesting , for example , that world - class ice dancers fall over more often in practice than intermediate ice dancers , which sounds paradoxical , " he said
" the reason is they are always pushing themselves , they are attempting jumps that are at the outer limits of their capabilities
it 's a branch of science called ' epigenetics ' -- the brain is re-wired as we practice
" once athletes have meticulously honed their skills , they should , in theory , have all the tools at their disposal to achieve success
but in high - pressure situations , even the greatest can crumble
what causes a footballer to crack under the nail - biting strain of a penalty shootout ? or a tennis star to fall apart at match point ? " the problem when you 're under pressure is you 're so nervous you start thinking consciously about the shot you are playing , " @entity19 says
" you are intruding upon your subconscious competence , and that is what triggers the choking response
" so how can @entity114 preparing for @entity115 ensure they are mentally ready to challenge for gold ? @entity59 suggested that imagining the crowning moment is almost as important as physically training for it
" the thing about when we mentally rehearse something vividly , it actually fires up the same neurology in the brain as if we were really experiencing it
so on a certain level the mind can not differentiate between a vividly - imagined experience and reality
" what we need to do is to create our own realities in our heads so you can imagine yourself in that @entity7 final , for instance , performing how you want to perform
" the more you actually do that , the more your body and mind get used to it , so when you come to the real thing , you 're more prepared
" so the next time you find yourself daydreaming of sprinting to 100 meters gold , do n't dismiss it -- it might just be vital preparation for your future @entity7 success .
