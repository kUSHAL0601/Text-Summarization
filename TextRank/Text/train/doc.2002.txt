-- the superintendent of the @entity3 , @entity4 , school district on thursday defended a plan to shutter nearly half the district 's schools
" no one likes closing schools
it 's tough on families , and it 's certainly tough on our community , " superintendent @entity11 said thursday
" closing schools and making the remaining schools much stronger academically is unquestionably the right thing to do
we were operating far too many schools , " he said
he said the district was only using about 60 percent of the seats in its elementary schools , 40 percent in its middle schools and an even smaller percentage in its high schools
after weeks of contentious debate and years of dwindling enrollment , a divided @entity30 voted wednesday night to approve what @entity11 calls the " right - size " plan
the plan will close 29 education facilities , including 26 schools , according to the district
" i have an 8 - year - old and a 6 - year - old that will be going to school with 12th graders
i find that very inappropriate
i do n't feel my children will be safe , " @entity47 told @entity0 affiliate @entity48
" i feel like i have nothing , i have no high school legacy
i feel like i have nothing , nothing to go back to , " said prince @entity52 , a senior , who will be part of the final graduating class at @entity55
@entity11 proposed the plan arguing that the financial future of the entire school district was at stake
the plan also cuts 700 jobs and saves $ 50 million to help reduce a burgeoning deficit
school districts across @entity64 , hit hard by budget cuts , have been struggling to make ends meet
they have had to make tough choices between closures , program cuts , bus route cancellations and layoffs of teachers and staff
schools in at least 17 states have opted for four - day weeks
are your schools having trouble ? share your story @entity11 said the closures were the first phase of " right - sizing " a district where enrollments have plummeted from more than 35,000 in the 1999 - 2000 school year to about 17,000 in 2009 - 10
" closing schools is hard , and it is tough on the community , " @entity11 said recently in remarks posted on the superintendent 's web site
" closing schools and making the remaining schools much stronger academically is unquestionably the right thing to do for kids , " he said
" keeping all of the schools open with too few children in them is draining the resources we need to improve the education of all students
" but four of the nine board members disagreed with @entity11
" i deserve the right to make a rational decision based on facts , and we were never given facts about student achievement , " @entity103 , who voted against the closings , told @entity48
some members of the public showed up wednesday to air their last - minute appeals
" what i 'm asking you today to do is to give our children justice , " said @entity113 , a community activist
others worried that school closures would lead to deterioration of communities and drive residents out of the district
" the blighting of the urban core is scandalous and shameful , " said @entity124
@entity11 is slated to discuss the school closings at a news conference thursday morning .
