-- as outrage flares and more questions are raised over the killing of @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , president @entity1 increasingly finds himself drawn to the center of the discussion
@entity1 has spoken publicly twice about the august 9 shooting of the unarmed @entity13 - @entity12 teen by a white police officer in the @entity16 suburb , as well as the resulting clashes between protesters and law enforcement
he also released a written statement shortly after @entity5 was killed
but he 's so far been cautious about wading too deeply into the controversy that is the subject of a local criminal investigation and a separate civil rights probe led by the @entity24
concerns about prosecutor in @entity5 case he has spoken with elected and other leaders , and his public statements have been measured
no presidential visits to @entity7 are planned for now although attorney general @entity31 is due in @entity6 on wednesday
" i have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed
because , although these are , you know , issues of local jurisdiction -- you know , the @entity24 works for me , " @entity1 told reporters on monday
" and then when they 're conducting an investigation , i 've got to make sure that i do n't look like i 'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other
" should @entity1 be more forceful ? but some believe @entity1 should be more forceful , especially following community and political criticism of the initial police response to street protests as excessive , and with those demonstrations becoming more violent
" this president knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the police department , " @entity58 professor @entity57 said sunday on @entity60 's " @entity59
" " it is not enough for him to come on national television and pretend there is a false moral equivalency between police people who are armed and black people who are vulnerable constantly to this
he needs to use his bully pulpit to step up and articulate this as a vision , " @entity57 said
@entity0 political commentator and @entity73 african - american studies professor @entity71 wrote in an op - ed for @entity0 that @entity1 has " placed the highest priority " on people remaining calm
" while this may seem reasonable on its face , particularly against the backdrop of rioting and looting , his words failed to acknowledge the legitimacy of black anger , " @entity71 said
the @entity84 argues a big speech from @entity1 on race relations would be difficult right now
" pouring gasoline on a fire and lighting the match ? " one senior @entity84 official said
administration officials said in their discussions with mayors , civil rights leaders and the @entity95 , that they 've been told @entity1 is doing the right thing
@entity1 talked to governor in his statement on monday , @entity1 noted that he has been in touch with @entity7 gov. @entity100 , and the state 's two senators , @entity103 and @entity104
the @entity84 emphasized supportive statements it has received from both @entity103 , a @entity106 , and more notably , @entity104 , a @entity107
" i explained to the president that i 've been pleased with my conversations with the attorney general and civil rights division regarding their helpful understanding that they are n't taking over this investigation , but are conducting a parallel review of the events that led to @entity5 's death , " @entity104 said in a statement on monday
" i continue to believe that this is the best possible way to arrive at a transparent explanation that would be largely acceptable to all of those who have been impacted in the community by this tragedy
" will @entity1 visit @entity6 ? @entity1 also has skirted the question of whether he plans to travel to @entity6
a senior @entity84 official said such a visit is not in the cards now , but it has not been ruled out
a visit by the president would tax law enforcement resources necessary for his protection instead of devoting those resources to calming the situation , the @entity84 official said
the @entity24 's community policing program director , @entity137 , will be on the ground to advise law enforcement on how to deal with the protests peacefully , this official said
the @entity84 also views what is happening in @entity6 as partly a policing issue
better policing practices in working with the community and organizing the response to the protests could calm things down , the official said
calls for @entity1 to visit @entity6 are n't likely to ebb soon
on tuesday , rapper and business mogul @entity150 released a video on @entity154 calling for such a step
" @entity1 , for real , get on a plane
it 's serious , " he said
