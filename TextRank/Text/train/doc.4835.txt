@entity1 's military - backed government resigned monday , adding new uncertainty to the nation 's three years of upheaval
the government headed by prime minister @entity7 turned in its resignation to president @entity9 , state - run @entity5 reported
@entity9 accepted the resignations and thanked the prime minister and his cabinet for their service
" the presidency greatly values the tireless efforts of dr. @entity7 and members of the government at a pivotal moment in the nation 's history , " @entity9 said in a statement
state media reported that @entity9 is expected to appoint a transitional prime minister in the coming days who will be tasked with putting together a new @entity12 to manage state affairs until presidential elections in april
the resignations come as disorganized strikes ripple through the work force
in recent weeks , doctors , low - ranking police officers , postal workers , transport workers and textile workers have all gone on strike for short periods of time
analysts expect army chief @entity39 , who served as defense minister , to run for president
the @entity42 has said it would support an @entity39 candidacy
if he does run , @entity39 would need to give up his post
but with no clear contender , his chances of winning the presidency are high
if elected , he will become the sixth military leader to rule @entity1 since its independence
@entity1 's government has been unsettled since a popular revolt toppled the 29 - year rule of former strongman @entity53 in 2011
@entity54 , the former head of the @entity56 's political arm , was elected president in 2012
shortly after he winning , he resigned from the @entity56 and its @entity58 in an effort to show that he would represent all @entity1
but he was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule , with opponents accusing him of pursuing an @entity65 agenda and excluding other factions from the government
@entity54 and other @entity56 leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts , including organizing attacks on @entity1 troops in the @entity73 and fueling " sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in @entity1
" supporters say the military - backed government that replaced @entity54 has returned to the authoritarian practices of @entity53 .
