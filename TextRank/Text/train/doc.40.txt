-- following widespread criticism , @entity2 's health ministry has scrapped an online campaign called " i 'm happy being a prostitute
" prostitution is legal in @entity2 and is expected to spike as the nation gears up for the @entity9 in 2014 and the @entity10 in 2016
the campaign aimed to promote safe sex and reduce the stigma against sex workers
other posters in the campaign carried slogans such as " i can not be seen without a condom , my love
" but tuesday , health minister @entity21 dropped the campaign , telling reporters he did n't think it was a message his office should be sending
" the role of the ministry is to have specific content to encourage prevention among sex workers , who are a very vulnerable group , " he said
as the nation prepares for the sports world stage , sex workers are getting ready as well
in the city of @entity37 , prostitutes are lining up for free @entity39 classes to enable them to communicate with clients .
