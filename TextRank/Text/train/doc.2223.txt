@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government convened a meeting on monday of nearly all of the country 's political parties , in an effort to consolidate broad national support for its military operation to crush @entity11 militants in @entity1 's northwestern @entity12
@entity1 civilians flee to camps for the internally displaced in @entity15 on may 15 , 2009
the leaders of 42 political parties were expected to attend the @entity18 in @entity0 , the capital
meanwhile , fierce fighting continued in @entity12 on monday -- 27 @entity11 fighters were killed , including three commanders , along with three @entity1 soldiers , said maj. gen. @entity23 , a spokesman for the @entity1 military
in a separate move to pressure the @entity11 , hundreds of @entity26 clerics gathered in @entity0 on sunday to issue a unanimous declaration that denounced the militants ' violent tactics
" suicide attacks and beheading is haram , " the resolution said
" @entity34 " means forbidden according to @entity26
national consensus is critical for the military offensive to succeed , said a senior foreign diplomat stationed in @entity0
speaking on condition of anonymity , the diplomat singled out @entity41 , leader of the @entity43 party and the most powerful political rival to @entity1 president @entity45 , as saying that without @entity41 's support , the @entity47 campaign would be doomed
@entity41 was at monday 's @entity18
the @entity1 military mounted its first assault on @entity51 and its @entity11 allies in tribal areas along @entity1 's mountainous border with @entity55 in 2004
there have since been a number of military offensives against the @entity11 , with questionable results
the attacks have displaced hundreds of thousands of @entity1 and done considerable damage to homes and infrastructure
the @entity11 has extended its area of control from the border all the way to the district of @entity69 , just 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) from the @entity1 capital
the military attacked @entity11 fighters in @entity69 late last month
as of sunday , troops were still battling to dislodge insurgents from parts of @entity69 , according to @entity1 military spokesmen
the top @entity78 military commander told the @entity79 last week that it was too early to pass judgment on @entity1 's most recent military offensive
" my biggest question about these operations is their ability to sustain them over time , " said adm. @entity82 , chairman of the @entity83
" historically , they have n't done that
" the @entity90 says the fighting has forced more than 1 million @entity1 to flee their homes in the northwest of the country since may 2
prime minister @entity95 , addressing the @entity18 on monday , said , " the army will remain in these areas until the displaced people can return to their homes , and until peace is established
