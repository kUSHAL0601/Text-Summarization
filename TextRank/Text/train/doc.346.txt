-- which late night tv personality co-wrote " it 's @entity2 " ? who came up with the @entity5 jingle before hitting the big time ? and who was the kid lit superstar who penned @entity11 's " @entity10 " ? here are the surprising names behind 10 famous creations
" @entity14 " ( @entity15 ) you have to respect @entity18 's pipes , but she did n't pen her signature song
crooner @entity15 wrote the tune as a bluesy plea to a woman for his third record , 1965 's soulful @entity23
@entity15 released the song as a single , and it even reached the top five on @entity28 's r&b chart and number 35 on the @entity30
while @entity15 's version is pretty great , the song did n't achieve immortality until @entity34 recorded her chart - topping 1967 cover
the first time @entity15 heard @entity34 's cover , he simply said , " she done took my song
" @entity0 : 10 unexpected @entity41 duties 2
" like a good neighbor , @entity5 is there ! " ( @entity44 ) before @entity44 became a star , he put his @entity47 education to use by writing advertising jingles
in addition to the enduring @entity5 jingle , he also cranked out " i 'm stuck on @entity51 , ' cuz @entity51 's stuck on me ! " @entity0 : how to tweet yourself out of a job 3
" @entity10 " ( @entity54 ) @entity11 's beloved tune came from a surprising source : poet @entity54
although @entity54 is best remembered for his children 's poetry , he also penned songs for stars like @entity61 , wrote plays and was a mainstay at the @entity64

dirty dancing : @entity68 ( @entity69 ) did you watch " @entity67 's " futile attempts at putting @entity72 in a corner and think , " this film feels incomplete
what we need is a prequel
not just any prequel , though
one set in @entity79 ! " ? apparently someone did
when producers decided to film a sequel for a 2004 release , they did n't just crank out a fresh story , though
instead , they reworked a screenplay that @entity87 's @entity69 , the host of " wait , wait ... @entity89 ! " had written in the early 1990s
@entity69 's original screenplay dealt with the true story of a young @entity93 girl who witnessed the @entity95 revolution , but the version that made it to the screen sucked out all of the politics and replaced them with dancing
as you might have guessed , the film was a flop , but even though not a single line of @entity69 's dialogue made it to the screen , he got a story credit
" it 's raining men " ( @entity112 ) believe it or not , the @entity114 did n't write all their own material
stalwart songwriter @entity116 and @entity118 's bandleader , @entity112 , actually co-wrote the number - one dance hit
in a 2009 interview with @entity121 , @entity112 quipped , " you 've got to be a really straight man to write a song like ' it 's @entity2
' " @entity0 : @entity125 and @entity126 ( as @entity127 ! ) 6
the @entity128 ( @entity129 ) @entity129 wrote the @entity128 while working as secretary of state under @entity131 in 1823
the concept that any further acts of colonization or meddling by @entity137 powers in the @entity138 would be viewed as acts of aggression against the @entity93 helped shape @entity93 foreign policy through the @entity142 , but few people remember @entity129 ' contribution
since @entity131 introduced the doctrine during one of his @entity149 addresses , it bears his name
" @entity152 " ( @entity153 ) it 's a good thing @entity153 has hip - hop street cred to burn , because he co-wrote @entity157 's 1998 dance single " @entity158
" @entity157 's track may not make anyone forget @entity153 ' @entity162 album , but it did spend two weeks atop the billboard charts
" @entity164 " ( @entity165 ) this @entity167 track , a cut from their 1969 album 20/20 , would probably have been doomed to obscurity if not for its backstory
in 1968 @entity167 drummer @entity173 was pals with an eccentric struggling singer - songwriter named @entity165
@entity165 gave @entity173 a song called " @entity164 , " and @entity173 retooled the lyrics and the melody to create " @entity164
" @entity180 " ( @entity179 ) @entity182 's signature song was actually the result of another great songwriter 's struggles
in the mid- 1960s , @entity179 was desperately trying to make it as a songwriter , but he was stuck working as a helicopter pilot for oil rigs in the @entity190
he banged out a tune about how liberating it felt to have nothing left to lose , and his star began to rise
country singer @entity194 and folk rocker @entity195 both scored minor hits with the song , but it did n't become a smash until @entity182 recorded her own cover , which was part of her posthumously released @entity202 ( 1971 )

" @entity205 " ( @entity206 ) this chart - topping duet for @entity208 and @entity209 came from the minds of disco icons
the @entity206 originally wrote the song as an @entity214 track -- various rumors postulate that it was written with either @entity216 or @entity217 in mind -- but handed it over to @entity208 instead
smart move : the song topped the country and pop charts , went double platinum , and was the best - selling single of 1983
