-- @entity1 talked very fast about the dangers of thyroid gland radiation poisoning as his business line rang incessantly in the background
" look , i really have to go , " @entity1 said as he abruptly ended the telephone interview to fill another order
@entity1 is president of @entity8 , one of only two @entity12 - approved @entity11 manufacturers of potassium iodide , a medication that can block the thyroid glands of human beings and animals from absorbing excessive amounts of radiation from a nuclear accident
experts believe that many of the dangers posed by overexposure to nuclear fallout , including cancer , can be diminished by blocking thyroid absorption of radiation
on friday , a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered what is being called @entity32 's worst nuclear emergency since @entity33 since , @entity1 said his @entity35 , @entity36 - based company has received hundreds , if not thousands , of calls from potential buyers in @entity40 as well as repeat @entity11 customers suddenly seeking to replenish their stockpiles of the drug
so , too , has @entity44 in @entity45 , which , according to the @entity12 , is the only @entity11 manufacturer of the anti-radiation medication in liquid form
@entity48 is the only company in the @entity11 that manufactures the tablet form of potassium iodide , according to the @entity12
@entity53 's owner , @entity52 , said her is currently getting inundated by more calls than her 85 employees can handle
she and company president @entity56 said they are looking to add temporary employees to help handle the flood of calls
they also said they 've added a second shift and are considering staying open around the clock until the current crisis is over
officials for both companies said the deluge of requests stemming from @entity32 's nuclear crisis comes as state and local governments , hospitals , schools and other institutions in the @entity11 have expressed renewed interest in replenishing their supplies
that 's partly because the threat of nuclear fallout in @entity32 appears to have heightened demand in this country , they said
it is also because some of those stockpiled medications are close to expiring
that includes the 6 million doses of liquid potassium iodide provided to the @entity11 government in 2006 by @entity44
the expiration dates for those medications begin in april , @entity52 said
the @entity92 has said that although weather conditions in @entity32 have moved " small releases " of radiation from damaged reactors in the @entity102 out to sea , the @entity11 was " not expected to experience any harmful levels of radioactivity " given the thousands of miles that separate the two countries
the federal government , @entity52 said , is n't currently planning to purchase more potassium iodide for national stockpile
the @entity107 is a repository of vaccines , antibiotics , antidotes and other drugs and supplies for use in natural disaster , pandemic or bioterrorism attack
@entity52 said she began alerting customers that their potassium iodide supplies were starting to expire two weeks ago
that prompted an uptick in orders , including one from @entity122 for " hundreds of thousands of bottles , " she said
" we do n't have enough to meet the current demand , " she said
@entity52 said eyedroppers for the medication are particularly in short supply
@entity56 said the @entity11 government should consider tapping into the @entity107 for @entity32 earthquake victims threatened by nuclear fallout from the @entity133 plant
" help @entity32 now , " @entity56 said
" in the meantime , we would be definitely working towards filling those quantities that are being ordered now
" @entity56 said he made that request monday to @entity11 rep. @entity137 , @entity138 , senior member of the @entity139
@entity137 has warned that @entity32 's nuclear accident highlights the vulnerabilities of reactors in the @entity11
on monday , he called on the @entity144 administration to fully implement a provision in the @entity146 of 2002 to make potassium iodide available for anyone who lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant
the federal government has never purchased enough to meet that standard
there is currently only enough of the medication available for populations living within 10 miles of nuclear reactors in the @entity11 , according to @entity11 officials
that 's not nearly enough , @entity1 said
he cited the april 1986 incident at the @entity159 in @entity160 , considered the worst nuclear reactor accident ever
death tolls resulting from the accident have varied widely according to various studies , with totals ranging from the thousands to more than a million
several studies have found that the accident led to a rise in thyroid cancer cases in children as far away as @entity171
" even taking the most conservative numbers , it all says there is something wrong with this picture when we know there is n't more potassium iodide out there , " @entity1 said as he talked on his personal telephone line
in the background , the other phone was ringing .
