the pathologist hired by @entity3 's family to conduct an autopsy on the @entity5 , @entity6 , teenager will testify thursday before the grand jury that is deciding whether to indict a police officer in @entity3 's killing , according to family attorney @entity10
dr. @entity11 , the former medical examiner for the city of @entity13 , conducted a second autopsy on the 18 - year - old 's body after a local medical examiner performed one
though the grand jury has until january to make a decision , the prosecutor 's office has said that an announcement on whether it will indict @entity5 officer @entity24 could come as early as mid-november
residents nervous ahead of announcement there 's intense nervousness in the @entity30 suburb as many residents fear that a repeat of the chaos and violence , and clashes between protesters and police , could happen again when the grand jury 's decision is announced
in the days after @entity3 's killing , protesters marched in the streets , enraged because they felt the fatal shooting was the result of an excessive use of force by police
witnesses to the shooting say that @entity3 , an unarmed @entity47 , had his hands in the air as if he was surrendering when he was shot by @entity24 , a white officer
authorities have said that @entity3 tussled with @entity24 and tried to take the officer 's weapon
there was also anger when autopsy results from a first procedure were not released , many felt , in a timely fashion
@entity3 was shot at least six times , independent autopsy shows legal opinions differ @entity62 's legal experts are offering differing opinions about allowing an expert hired by a party in a case to address a grand jury
@entity62 senior legal analyst @entity68 said it 's not an unusual move
" grand juries often hear a variety of evidence from many different sources , " he said
" calling this expert is consistent with the prosecutor 's promise to present all the available evidence to the grand jury
" @entity62 legal expert and longtime @entity13 attorney @entity80 , who has presented cases to hundreds of grand juries , said it is highly unusual
" when a prosecutor says he 's going to present all evidence available , the implication is that he or she is presenting all sorts of objective evidence of non-interested bystanders , " @entity80 said
the @entity3 family pathologist " is someone hired by the family and presumably to support a civil lawsuit for money damages later , " @entity80 said
it 's not illegal to call someone hired by an interested party , he added , but the police officer 's side may perceive it as unfair
" what would stop the cop 's attorney from asking , ' why ca n't we do our own autopsy now ? ' " @entity11 is a high - profile pathologist , having testified in the murder trials of @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110
he was also chairman of the committee of pathologists that investigated the assassinations of president @entity114 and the rev. @entity115 opinion : what @entity3 's autopsy tells us the grand jury process grand jurors ' work is done in secret
only a prosecutor and the jurors are present ; the defense attorney is not privy to the proceedings
the jurors can ask a prosecutor to see anything -- including , for example , an autopsy conducted by an outside expert , @entity80 said
but -- if it 's legal -- it 's at the prosecutor 's discretion whether to give it to them , the attorney explained
everything between the prosecutor and jurors is on the record which is made available later to the public
" in a case like this which is so controversial , ( the prosecutor ) knows everything is going to be scrutinized , " @entity80 said , adding that he suspects the prosecutor is giving a " complete presentation " of all material to the jury and informing jurors plainly of the law
both @entity80 and @entity150 , a criminal defense attorney and @entity62 legal analyst , said it 's crucial to balance providing the jury with too much or too little information
a prosecutor has to " be careful " @entity150 said on @entity62 wednesday
a grand jury should hear information that is explanatory rather than persuasive , he stressed
