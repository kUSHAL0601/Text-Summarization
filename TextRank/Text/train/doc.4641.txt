@entity0 -- diplomacy has n't worked
relations between @entity5 and the @entity6 are , at best , chilly
so why not try music ? on saturday night , for the first time , @entity5 were the headline performers at @entity0 's famed @entity10
a father and son from @entity5 led @entity6 musicians in a hybrid session of traditional @entity5 and classical western music
thirty - year - old @entity16 told @entity1 he was pleased to present " another dimension of @entity5 and @entity5 culture to the @entity20 people
" @entity16 , who now lives in the @entity6 , said , " we hear mostly about the other side -- bloodshed , chaos -- and i wanted to be able to present the reality of our culture , which is about peace and love and unity
" nearly 3,000 people , many of them @entity30 , flocked to @entity10 for the concert
one patron said , " the message was completely obvious : love all the way
peace ! " the @entity36 said it was an honor to be onstage at the historic music center
the younger @entity16 said his music might be able to bridge cultural divides between @entity5 and the @entity6
his father , @entity41 , still lives in @entity5
speaking in @entity42 , the man known as the @entity5 @entity44 talked about the demonstrations that followed june 's disputed @entity5 presidential election
the tenor said some of the people in the streets are " requesting something , and i think it 's important to answer to their requests
the government should answer to their requests and they have to see what their people want
" the @entity58 are two of the few @entity5 musicians allowed to freely travel and perform in @entity5
western - style popular music is banned in @entity5
with just a few musicians , they form a rare group , blending @entity42 traditional themes with @entity20 classical style
it 's very simple in presentation : a cello , percussion and an improvised setar -- a @entity42 instrument like a lute -- played by @entity16
the @entity58 ' music is based on the 13th - century @entity42 poet and philosopher @entity74
" the idea of the music is to bring unity and to be able to create a music that is not just for @entity5 , it 's for people from all over the world , " the younger @entity16 said
@entity82 , director of cultural programs and performing arts at the @entity85 , said , " you 're seeing the @entity5 culture and the @entity20 culture in something that 's a kind of hybrid , that i think represents the times that we live in
" the @entity58 receive cultural support from the nonprofit @entity0 - based @entity85 , @entity93 told @entity1
" we 've been going through this time period where we 've been thinking about the @entity98 coming down , and throughout that period of the @entity100 , cultural relations were always a really important component
so i think that cultural relations -- music in particular -- are a really important part of how we know each other as human beings , " @entity93 said
the @entity58 have performed in cities across the @entity6 in recent years .
