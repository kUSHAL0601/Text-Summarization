-- it 's the kind of thing that seems to happen every day to innocent grandmas , teens and toddlers when they pass through the airport : @entity7 , a 16 - year - old type 1 diabetic , uses an insulin pump that can malfunction when exposed to technology used in airport screenings
when she passed through the @entity13 airport for a flight home to @entity15 in may , she asked for a pat - down , but @entity18 workers directed her to pass through a scanner
her parents were n't there -- she was on a school trip -- but she trusted @entity18 agents to guide her
but the pump makers could no longer guarantee that @entity25 was receiving the correct amount of insulin after it passed through the scanner , and it had to be replaced
@entity25 's story became another milestone in travelers ' collective loathing , annoyance and exasperation with the 50,000 - person agency charged with protecting the nation 's transportation systems
travel industry watchers say the mood toward the @entity18 is n't at its worst right now , but it 's at risk of getting there
ten years since the agency 's creation -- and nearly 11 since the last major act of terrorism aboard a @entity48 plane -- travelers still detest the @entity18
while the @entity18 does n't count grumbles as fliers remove their shoes or leave behind oversized shampoo bottles , the number of complaints received by phone or e-mail has decreased , according to @entity18 data
the numbers this year are lower than in recent years past : 1,294 complaints total in march , the most recent month for which data are available
that 's down from a peak of 4,027 in may 2004 , the highest number since the @entity18 began to track and release complaint data eight years ago
perhaps the most maligned parts of @entity18 security often get the lowest number of complaints
screening procedures drew 1,960 complaints since january 2010 , and security checkpoint processing time got 2,484 complaints since then
travelers ' stuff , it turns out , is the source of most complaints
since the start of 2010 , the highest number of complaints -- 18,196 -- related to damage claims for checked bags , problems for which airlines and the @entity18 share liability
( it 's also the area that experienced the biggest decreases in recent complaint tallies
) in second place , at 10,187 , were complaints about treatment of personal property at security checkpoints
the mood toward the @entity18 is n't good , but it was worse in late 2010 , when the @entity18 began to deploy full - body scanners and pat - downs in airports , said @entity103 's ombudsman and consumer advocate , @entity105
back then , some declared " we wo n't fly " or rallied behind the idea of @entity108 , which called for passengers to request pat - downs instead of going through the scanners on the busiest travel day of the year
( in the end , @entity108 did n't disturb lines
) that november , a @entity116 / @entity115 poll found that 57 % of adult fliers were bothered or angered by security pat - downs , while 42 % felt that way about full - body scans
the outrage spawned a social media - fed genre of viral videos and stories about poorly handled @entity18 scans -- like @entity7 's -- and grope - y pat - downs
fliers were n't happy then , @entity105 said , and he thinks the tension is bubbling again
" people trust them until something happens , until they get a screener that makes them take their pants off or frisks them in a way they think is too invasive , " he said
the @entity18 is " under pressure from @entity138 to do more with less
there are questions about the safety of the body scanners
there have been numerous misunderstandings between passengers and the ( screeners )
all those things add up
" air rage : passengers ' quicker to snap ' unofficial complaints about the @entity18 go way beyond frustration over wrapped holiday gifts and suspicious baked goods
critics say it 's ineffective , inconsistent and unconstitutional ; that it 's not actually making travelers safer and creates a false sense of security ; that its officers are poorly trained , its equipment unsafe and its methods embarrassing
in may , an inspector general 's report said the @entity18 was n't adequately tracking or fixing airport security breaches
new this week , some complain it costs fliers too much
after 10 years with a security fee of $ 2.50 for passengers , the @entity18 wants to offset rising costs by boosting it to $ 5 for each leg of a trip
@entity18 officials said they 're trying to help their relationship with travelers by clearing up security do 's and don'ts in a mobile app and allowing some direct contact through " @entity184
the agency wants to shorten waits and reduce invasive security checks by expanding @entity188 , a program that puts passengers who share more personal information on a fast - track through security screenings ; it will be in 35 of the country 's largest airports by the end of the year
for now , users are mostly frequent fliers invited to join , but the @entity18 said @entity188 will open up to military personnel , kids and people ages 75 and older
airline squeeze : it 's not you , ' it 's the seat ' but does the @entity18 need to win any government agency popularity contests ? does it make a difference if its customers do n't like it or if they trust it at all ? a difficult relationship with travelers might mean the @entity18 misses out on useful observations that could be shared by roughly 50 million passengers who pass through airport checkpoints every month
@entity215 law enforcement has successfully relied on people 's observations and ingrained the idea in the public through the @entity221 's now - familiar slogan , " if you see something , say something
" the @entity225 launched its own ad campaign with the slogan last year , although it was n't aimed specifically at customers who come into contact with the @entity18
" the @entity18 had never really gotten the kind of traction we needed with our customers , " former @entity18 administrator @entity230 wrote in his book , " permanent emergency : inside the @entity18 and the @entity237 , " published in april
" gaining the willful participation and support of the public would give us access to the largest and most dynamic network out there
" security technologist @entity244 said he 's not aware of data that link security to the relationship between the agency and its customers -- but it 's a good question
" i believe the @entity18 is having a credibility problem , " he said
" if you hate something , you 're going to have a worse time doing it
if people do n't trust something and hate it , then it goes less well
" a study published in @entity258 last year found that passengers in the @entity260 had a higher opinion of whole - body scanners after they were presented with unbiased information about them , including risks and sample images
they found them fast and less intrusive than pat - downs
not informing passengers about scanners can open the door to misinformation and critics , the study 's authors said , and hurt the long - term acceptance and legitimacy of airport security
what will make customers happy , though , depends on their complaints
@entity244 said he 'd be happier if the @entity18 ran airport security that looked more like it did before september 11 , 2001 , before liquid bans , body scanners and shoe removal
he calls the @entity18 's best - known processes " security theater " but said there 's no political will to eliminate it
" everyone complains about the @entity18 , but nobody really wants to be on the hook for getting it wrong , " he said
the golden days of air travel : how glorious were they ? @entity105 , the consumer advocate and author of " scammed : how to @entity302 in a @entity303 , " said he 'd feel better about the @entity18 if it eliminated its @entity297 , or @entity297 , teams at train stations and @entity300 games and instead stuck to airport security
when he 's in line to fly , he wants better explanations about @entity18 procedures and to know that more money is steered toward intelligence instead of " unconstitutional " scans and pat - downs
" it 's a matter of using billions of dollars in a smarter way , " he said
" there 's always going to be people that say , ' if you take a step back , you 're going to create the next 9/11
' those are paranoid voices , and they 're always going to be there
i have to listen to the rational voices that say we 've gone too far
" the @entity324 family in @entity15 wants @entity18 agents trained so everyone with a medical device or condition can make it through security checkpoints safely , said @entity331 , whose daughter 's insulin pump was replaced after its ill - fated trip through @entity13 's airport
@entity324 said they respect that @entity18 officers are highly trained and low - paid and " have an important job to do
" she can even understand why security officers wanted to send @entity25 through the scanner : it was busy , scanners are quick , and the public usually is n't thrilled about security agents patting down teenage girls
but the @entity324 family is n't flying again until they 're confident their kids -- both of whom have type 1 diabetes -- will have pumps that work beyond the checkpoint
insulin pumps can cost $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 , @entity324 said , and it can be hard for pump users to switch back to injections
the family will be driving to their summer vacation destinations this year
the agency said last month that it would respond directly to the @entity324 family and that it regularly works with disability and medical condition advocacy groups to adapt screening procedures
indeed , @entity324 said , they spoke with @entity18 officials on a conference call this week and are reviewing a proposal they hope will make flying easier for diabetics
so far , @entity324 said , the @entity18 has been slow but responsive
" we could be their best advocate
this could be a total turnaround and nice pr for them , " @entity324 said
" right now , our relationship is really amicable , and we 'd like to keep it that way
