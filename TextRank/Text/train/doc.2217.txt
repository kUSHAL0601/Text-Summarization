@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 lawmakers voted to approve a new round of tough budget - cutting measures thursday , despite a second day of angry protests in which one demonstrator died
tens of thousands rallied outside the parliament building as lawmakers debated the unpopular measures , aimed at bringing down the country 's huge national debt
after a peaceful start , violent clashes broke out between anarchist rioters and the police , and between the anarchists and some union demonstrators who wanted to keep the protest calm
tear gas was fired into the crowd , while rocks and fire bombs were thrown
the protester who died was a member of the @entity28 , lawmaker @entity26 told parliament
hospital officials told @entity2 he was a 53 - year - old man who suffered cardiac arrest
the @entity0 minister for health said the demonstrator had been taken to an @entity1 hospital without a pulse and could not be revived , but he had no injuries
earlier reports suggested he had been injured
lawmakers approved the austerity measures by 154 in favor to 144 against , despite nationwide protests and a two - day strike that has gripped the country
the new bill is expected to lead to around 30,000 job losses and further cuts to wages and pensions for workers in the public sector
" we have no hope
the only hope we have is the strength of the people , " said protester @entity53 , a civil engineer , before the vote
he said @entity59 's leaders were trying " to save the banks but they do n't think about the people
" and he warned @entity62 and @entity63 , which are also facing debt crises : " look at us
this is where you will be in two to three years
" organizers had urged protesters from all over the country to come to @entity1 thursday , suggesting the crowd could be larger than the 70,000 - plus police estimated wednesday
organizers estimated the turnout wednesday at 120,000 , which would make it one of the biggest protests in the country in years
police said there were about 40,000 people on the streets thursday morning -- fewer than at the same time a day earlier -- and about 3,000 police officers
the mood early in the day was good - natured , but when violence erupted later it was unusual for the fighting that broke out between different groups of protesters , as well as confrontations with police
on wednesday , clashes between protesters and police in front of the @entity0 parliament building left at least six protesters and 15 police officers injured , authorities said
at least 15 people were arrested
some marchers thursday accused the government of planting troublemakers in the crowd to spark violence
" they have never been caught , " said teacher @entity105
" why not ? " protesters aimed to shut down wide sectors of the country during the two - day national strike
" do n't bow your head , it 's time for resistance and struggle , " marchers chanted in the capital wednesday as they gathered for the union - backed demonstration
" i 'm here for my children and everyone else 's children
those punks in there have destroyed everyone 's lives , " said former railway worker @entity123 , 62 , pointing at parliament
greeks are angry at yet another round of planned austerity measures as @entity0 tries to bring down its stratospheric debt
lawmakers are trying to cut government costs to reassure international backers it is doing enough to earn the bailout funds they have promised to pour into the country
@entity140 leaders are scrambling to minimize the effect of @entity0 's debt on their common currency , the euro
over the weekend , finance ministers from the world 's largest economies pledged their commitment to take " all necessary actions " to stabilize markets
they aim to keep banks well capitalized so they can weather the effects of any defaults by @entity0 or other indebted countries , such as @entity155 , @entity63 , @entity156 or @entity62
but there appears to be a split between @entity159 and @entity160 -- @entity59 's two largest economies -- on how to do it
@entity160 has stressed that individual @entity59 states should inject capital into domestic banks that lack sufficient buffers
but analysts say @entity159 is opposed to this idea because it could jeopardize the nation 's top - tier credit rating
@entity59 leaders are expected to hear concrete details about how the plan might work at a @entity174 meeting sunday
@entity140 heads of state are widely expected to finalize the plan in early november at a meeting of the @entity179 economic powers
@entity2 's @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .
