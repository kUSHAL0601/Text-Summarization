-- @entity1 has long been the poster boy @entity3 explorer who found fame and fortune by sailing from the @entity8 to the @entity9
crossing the great unknown waters between @entity11 and the @entity12 in 1492 , he became one of the most renowned -- and pivotal -- @entity14 to set foot in @entity16
but more than five centuries later , a @entity18 adventurer plans to show that the @entity19 could have been reached by another seafaring nation 2,000 years before @entity1
former @entity22 officer @entity21 hopes to sail a replica @entity24 boat 10,000 kilometers across the @entity25 in an ambitious voyage that could challenge maritime history
by completing the journey , @entity21 aims to demonstrate that the @entity29 -- the ancient @entity31 civilization that prospered from @entity32 to @entity33 -- had the capability to sail to the @entity35 ; a theory disputed by historians
" it is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it [ before @entity1 ] , it was the @entity29 , " said @entity21
" of all the ancient civilizations they were the greatest seafarers -- @entity48 had cedar trees perfect for building strong boats , they were the first to use iron nails , and they had knowledge of astronomy and currents
" the prospect of sailing a 50 - ton wooden vessel identical to those built 2,600 years ago across the @entity25 might appear foolhardy , had @entity21 not already challenged maritime history two years ago
@entity21 sailed the replica boat -- aptly named the @entity29 -- around @entity61 in 2010 , in a bid to demonstrate the ancient civilization had the capability to circumnavigate the continent 2,000 years before the first recorded @entity14 ; @entity66 , in 1488
setting sail from @entity68 in 2008 , the @entity29 covered 32,000 kilometers over two years , battling everything from six - meter waves off the @entity71 to @entity73 pirates
" we had run the gauntlet of pirate - infested waters , overcome numerous technical problems and traveled deep into the @entity81 and @entity25 , " @entity21 says in a new book on the incredible voyage ; ' @entity76
' " i had proved she was an ocean - going vessel and when she was coasting along the waves , her sail billowing in the wind ; to captain her had been an unforgettable experience
" @entity21 based his ambitious quest on a quote by @entity93 historian @entity92 , who claimed the @entity29 circumnavigated @entity61 in @entity94
along with their sophisticated seafaring skills , the @entity29 were renowned as an intellectual and industrious civilization who helped develop the alphabet we still use today
highly skilled in metalwork , ivory carving and glass - making , the name @entity29 derives from the iconic purple color they used to dye their superior textiles
dr @entity107 , maritime archaeologist at the @entity108 , added that a @entity24 voyage around @entity61 was " quite a plausible undertaking , based on the capabilities of the vessel of the period and historical material stating it took place
" the boat was modeled on an ancient 19 - meter @entity24 shipwreck excavated off the coast of @entity120
using locally - sourced materials , shipbuilders stayed true to the original down to the exact thickness of the planks and position of the mast
the crew of volunteers ranged from six to 15 people at any time , with 53 sailors from 14 different countries taking part over the entire journey
" we did n't have any mechanical winches and the anchor had to be pulled up and down by hand -- it was back - breaking work , " @entity21 said
" there was just one traditional toilet which dropped straight into the ocean , so you literally had to step out on the side of the boat to use it
when you had big waves coming at you in the middle of the night it could be quite scary
but at least there was no cleaning
" the final leg of the journey took them wide out across the @entity25 and a mere 965 kilometers off the coast of @entity156
it was here @entity21 got his inspiration for the journey to the @entity35 " archeologists have found @entity162 mummies with traces of tobacco and cocaine which could only have come from the @entity19 , " @entity21 said
" it indicates there was something going on across the @entity25
" dr @entity169 , professor of geology at @entity171 , also points to evidence of @entity24 coins bearing maps of the @entity8 and @entity19
he said copper coins with @entity24 iconography have also also been discovered in @entity16
" the available evidence suggests that the @entity178 ( the western tribe of the @entity29 ) had the ability to cross the @entity25 at will , " he said
many historians however , remain doubtful
" if the @entity29 got to @entity182 -- which we think they did -- i would n't be surprised if the boat could get to @entity16 physically
but whether they could have done it without running out of food is a different matter , " maritime historian @entity186 said
" if you 're circumnavigating @entity61 you can always stop along the way
but you ca n't when you 're going to @entity16 -- it 's a massive stretch of sea and that 's the difference
" setting off from @entity198 , the modern - day @entity24 vessel is expected to take two to three months to reach @entity16 -- granted @entity21 can raise Â £ 100,000 ( $ 156,000 ) for the expedition
@entity201 's @entity200 has already invited him to display the boat as part of their upcoming exhibition on the @entity29 , opening in september 2014
" the conventional wisdom is that @entity1 discovered @entity16
but anyone who looks a little closer will see the @entity208 were there around @entity210
they 've found @entity214 settlements in @entity215 , it 's undisputed , " @entity21 said
" so @entity1 was definitely second -- at best
i put forward the theory that the @entity29 could have been first and i hope to prove that was the case
