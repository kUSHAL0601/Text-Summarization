-- the growing refugee crisis in northwestern @entity3 is fueling the danger of spreading the polio virus among the displaced population , the @entity1 warned on wednesday
more than 450,000 @entity3 have fled their homes in the past two weeks as the military tries to root out militants in the @entity10 near the border with @entity12
but " this number could reach 600,000 as the military operation continues , " federal minister for states and frontier regions , retired lt. gen. @entity13 , said during a news conference on @entity15 tv wednesday
that could mean an even bigger danger of spreading the disease as the number of refugees increases
rising polio risk polio rates are higher than average in @entity10 due to a ban on anti-polio campaigns imposed by the @entity3 @entity31 two years ago in response to @entity34 drone strikes
in june 2012 , @entity31 commander @entity35 released a statement that said vaccines " would be banned in @entity10 until the drones strikes are stopped
" he added that drone strikes " are worse than polio
" polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children
it can lead to paralysis and death
the virus is easily preventable through immunization , but there 's no cure once it is contracted
" the highest number of polio cases have been witnessed in @entity10 , " @entity3 @entity1 spokesperson dr. @entity51 told reporters in @entity53
" the mass migration of people from the vulnerable area has increased the risk of the polio virus spreading further

hundreds of thousands of people have fled @entity10 since the launch of a government offensive on june 15 against the @entity3 @entity31 in the tribal areas bordering @entity12

one government - run camp has been set up with enough room for 200,000 people , but so far only around 20 families have moved there
" the facilities in the camp are n't yet up to the standard that we 'd like them to be
also , for cultural reasons people do n't want to live in tents , " said @entity93 , the @entity70 's humanitarian coordinator for @entity3
" the people who come from @entity10 are very conservative , very traditional
there are restrictions on men and women staying together
they have families ; they want to stay together , " he said
