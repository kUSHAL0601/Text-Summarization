@entity0 , @entity1 -- the government of de facto @entity1 president @entity4 is not ready to sign a proposed agreement to end the country 's ongoing political crisis , @entity10 foreign minister @entity9 said in @entity1
interim president @entity4 is reaching out to @entity12 president @entity11 for a solution
his remarks came on tuesday at the conclusion of a two - day visit by a delegation of the @entity18
" although the commission concludes that progress was made during its visit , it must recognize that there still no disposition toward full acceptance of the @entity26 on the part of mr. @entity4 or his supporters , " @entity9 said
the proposed @entity26 aims to resolve nearly two months of political turmoil that @entity1 has faced following the june 28 coup that ousted president @entity31
the delegation , which consisted of seven foreign ministers and included the participation of @entity18 secretary - general @entity36 , met with representatives of all branches of government , presidential candidates , the military , clergy , businessmen and representatives of various sectors of @entity1 society
" the majority of the actors expressed their conformity with the foundations of the @entity26 , although many of them expressed concerns about the same , " @entity9 said
the biggest obstacles were two points in the proposed agreement : one calling for @entity31 's return to power , and another calling for a temporary political amnesty for both sides
the delegation also spoke with @entity31 supporters , including his wife , who said that the ousted president was willing to accept the @entity26 and abide by it immediately
originally , @entity31 's negotiators had walked away from the proposal , offered by @entity10 president @entity11 , citing the intransigence of @entity4 's team
in support of the @entity18 delegation , the @entity72 announced tuesday that many visas for @entity1 would be suspended
the @entity76 and the @entity77 have condemned the coup and have refused to recognize the provisional government led by former congressional leader @entity4
@entity4 has insisted that @entity31 was not overthrown but instead was replaced through constitutional means
the @entity1 political crisis stems from @entity31 's desire to hold a referendum that could have led to extending term limits by changing the constitution , even though the country 's congress had outlawed the vote and the @entity89 had ruled it illegal .
