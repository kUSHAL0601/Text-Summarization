-- @entity2 shop owners are launching a nationwide boycott of @entity5 products over a territorial dispute between the two countries
the president of the @entity9 , @entity8 , claims most of the alliance 's 7.2 million members will ultimately participate in the effort
they are pledging not to sell popular @entity5 products like @entity16 cigarettes , @entity18 beer and @entity20 electronics
some car mechanics are also saying they will refuse to repair cars from @entity5 brands like @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26
" we will continue this boycott until we get a sincere apology from the @entity5 government , " @entity8 says
his group is angry over @entity5 's continuing claim to a series of islands that lie between the two countries
@entity37 calls the islands @entity38 , @entity36 calls them @entity38
both countries claim them , but they are currently under @entity2 control
the dispute is the latest in a series of competing national claims to islands in the @entity48 and @entity49 seas , where ownership can give exclusive rights to fishing , oil production and other commercial activities in surrounding waters
large @entity5 exporters like @entity24 and @entity57 suffered declining sales in @entity49 last fall when a separate island dispute between those two countries escalated into a major product boycott
protests turned violent in september after the @entity5 government purchased the island chain -- known as @entity63 in @entity49 and @entity63 in @entity5 -- from private @entity5 owners
this is the first such boycott to be launched over the recent flare - up in tensions between @entity5 and @entity2
police say over 200 people participated in a protest today in @entity37 to launch the boycott , chanting " we will not sell or buy @entity5 products
" they threw eggs at a sign featuring @entity5 brand logos , waved @entity2 flags and held signs reading " @entity38 is our territory " and the " @entity5 government must apologize
" many of the women attending dressed in the traditional @entity2 garb known as the hanbok
the protests marched from @entity82 to @entity83
@entity8 says they handed out 50,000 flyers about the boycott
march 1 is a public holiday in @entity2 which celebrates the launch of the independence movement from @entity5 in 1919
@entity90 , owner of @entity16 , @entity92 and @entity93 , and @entity94 declined to comment on the boycott
@entity0 's @entity96 in @entity36 contributed to this report .
