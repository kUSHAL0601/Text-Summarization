-- a popular female @entity2 singer who defied the @entity4 's decree against singing and dancing was shot and killed in northwest @entity2 monday night , police and hospital officials told @entity0
authorities described the singer 's ex-husband as a suspect in the case , and said early indications were that the @entity4 were not involved , according to police official @entity15
@entity16 , who recorded scores of songs in her native @entity20 language and became a household name among young , progressive ethnic @entity22 in northwest @entity2 , had just left a beauty salon and was driving home with her father when gunmen on a motorcycle raced towards their car and sprayed it with bullets , @entity15 said
@entity31 was hit with six bullets and pronounced dead at a hospital in @entity34 , the capital of @entity2 's @entity36 province , according to hospital official @entity37
@entity31 's father also was killed , police said
in recent years the rise of the @entity2 @entity4 in the region and the group 's ban against singing and dancing made it difficult for @entity31 and other musical artists to perform and record songs in @entity2
@entity31 recorded and taped many of her latest songs and music videos in nearby @entity52
last year @entity31 made headlines when she asked for a divorce from her husband after she reportedly found out that he had at least one other wife
it was a rare decision in a deeply conservative and male - dominated society where many view a woman 's demand for a divorce as a dishonor to the husband
shortly after monday night 's shooting police released a statement saying @entity31 's sister had accused her ex-husband and two of his acquaintances investigators said a search was underway for the three men
the woman who defied @entity76 's driving ban and put it on @entity77 journalist @entity78 contributed to this report .
