-- a group of women in a violence - plagued area of the @entity5 came up with their own weapon to end the fighting -- a sex strike
the women withheld sex from their husbands until they promised to quit fighting
their stand helped end clashes in july between villages in rural @entity16 , a recently released @entity18 report says
@entity20 refugee @entity18 report a separatist rebellion has been underway on the @entity5 island of @entity16 since the 1970s
families of @entity25 had been displaced because of it since 2008 and are working to rebuild their community with the help of the @entity20 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity18 ) and other aid organizations
women of the village came up with the idea of a sex strike as a way to help rebuild their village and to bring peace during a @entity18 sponsored sewing cooperative
many of the women were fed up with not being able to deliver their products due to the violence that closed down a main road between two villages
@entity45 for @entity46 , @entity47 , said she witnessed the women quietly implement the solution to withhold sex from their husbands until the fighting stopped -- and it worked
" i told them , if you do n't agree with me , you will get no salary from me , " says @entity52 of the @entity25 sewing cooperative in a @entity18 video report
within weeks of the strike starting , the @entity18 reports that the main village road re-opened and the fighting stopped
the women of the sewing cooperative along with other villagers were able to deliver their goods and start to rebuild the economy
" women wanted their husbands to not fight anymore and by using their feminine wiles they were able to enforce their wish , " said @entity47
the idea of withholding sex for a cause is not a new one -- the ancient @entity75 play @entity76 tells the story of women who organized a sex strike to end a war between @entity82 and @entity83
more recently , a strike was launched in 2006 in the @entity86 city of @entity87 , known for its drug trafficking and violent crimes
the strike was implemented by wives and girlfriends of gang members to get them to change their lifestyle and hand over their guns
a similar campaign was carried out by women in @entity98 in 2009 to protest the growing divide in @entity98 's coalition government
sporadic fighting is still present in @entity16 near @entity25 , but it is very localized , @entity47 said
the sex strike is just one of the ways the people in @entity16 are using to implement change
" i was really touched by how people did n't want handouts , " she says , " they were all really happy and eager to help themselves
