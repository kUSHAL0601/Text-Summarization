@entity0 -- president @entity2 made a surprise appearance at tuesday 's kids ' " state dinner " at the @entity6 , an event thrown by the the first lady to welcome the winners of the second annual @entity10
" usually , at a state dinner , i get invited , so i do n't know what happened on this one , " the president joked
" i hear the food is pretty good
" @entity2 went around to each table to congratulate the kids before leaving to get back to official business
" this is what it 's like to be a part of an official state dinner , " @entity17 told the children and their parents gathered in the @entity20
" we mirrored it exactly to what people experience when we host world leaders here
" the kids , ranging in age from 8 to 12 , even got to experience an arrival ceremony in which they were officially announced as they made their way through the booksellers ' entrance of the @entity6
the @entity10 is a recipe contest for kids across the country , launched in 2012 by @entity39 -- a website about food -- to promote healthy eating for children in the @entity44
it is part of first lady @entity17 's @entity47 initiative , a program developed to " solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation , " according to the program 's website
last week , the @entity39 , and the departments of @entity55 announced 54 winners from more than 1,300 entries
one winner was chosen from each of the 50 states , plus three territories and the @entity0
each recipe had to meet the @entity64 's healthy meal criteria and had to represent each of the five food groups
fruits and vegetables were required to be part of at least half of the recipe
" we have seen that when kids like all of you get involved in creating your own healthy meals , the results can really be amazing and delicious and fun , " @entity17 told the young chefs
" you 'll come up with ideas that none of us grownups ever thought of
" winning recipes included @entity85 , made by 8 - year - old @entity86 from @entity87 , @entity88 , and bring it on , @entity89 ! by 9 - year - old @entity90 from @entity91 , @entity92
tuesday 's event featured some of the winning recipes , many of which are considered finger food
" using your fingers is completely fine here
... the first lady has said that it is ok ! " @entity17 exclaimed
the president took mock offense at his wife 's comment
" @entity17 never said to me i can just pick up something with my fingers at a state dinner
that 's not fair ! " he joked
@entity110 traveled to the @entity6 from @entity111 , @entity0 , for the special event
the 10 - year - old won for her @entity115 recipe and got to sit next to @entity17 during lunch
@entity110 explained the big secret to her winning recipe : " instead of putting in the noodles , you put in really thinly sliced zucchini
some people told me that you can barely tell
" @entity110 's mother , @entity126 , was " thrilled " about her daughter 's win and the visit to the @entity6
" she 's kind of been dedicating herself to healthy cooking for a while now , and this is the big crescendo at the end , " she said
after lunch , recipe winners were treated to a performance by 15 - year - old singer @entity136 before getting a tour of the @entity6 kitchen garden
