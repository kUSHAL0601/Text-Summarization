the @entity1 state senator whose filibuster of an abortion bill became a national phenomenon has a long history of persisting against tough odds
@entity7 -- the 50 - year - old @entity8 who stood and spoke for 13 hours tuesday at the @entity9 -- went from being a teen mom to graduating from @entity11
she began working after school at age 14 to help support her single mother and three siblings , according to her campaign website
" by 19 , @entity7 was a single mother herself , working two jobs to make ends meet in hopes of creating a better life for her young daughter
" she pursued community college , then transferred to @entity25
with the help of scholarships and loans , she graduated first in her class
she went on to graduate with honors from @entity11 at the age of 33
she also had a second daughter
while standing during the filibuster , @entity33 wore pink running shoes
it was unclear whether the color was chosen because anti-abortion @entity39 feminists have been referred to as " pink elephants
" in 2010 , former @entity42 gov. @entity41 spoke of a " stampede of pink elephants , " promising a movement of @entity39 women against abortion
@entity33 entered public life in 2008 , defeating a longtime @entity39 incumbent to enter the @entity50
her district covers parts of @entity53 and its suburbs
this week 's was not her first filibuster
filibuster rivets online she previously took on gov. @entity58 and the @entity39 majority , " staging a filibuster and forcing a special session in her attempt to stop $ 5 billion in crippling cuts to @entity1 public schools , " her website says
when she was running for the @entity68 last fall , a @entity67 editorial described her as " a successful attorney with a powerful personal narrative , " but it pointed out she has legal clients that are public entities , such as @entity73 and the @entity74
@entity33 pledged to abstain on voting on some legislation that at least one client -- the tollway authority -- was expected to advance
the newspaper endorsed her candidacy last fall , calling her " a tough fighter , a conscientious public servant and an able leader
" her politics , however , apparently inspired some critics to violence
last year , firebombs were thrown at @entity33 ' office
she was not present at the time , and no one was injured
" thank you all for your expressions of support and concern , " @entity33 said on @entity90 at the time
" my team and i are concentrating on moving forward and staying focused
" with tens of thousands of new followers wednesday as a result of her filibuster , @entity33 tweeted , " thanks to the powerful voices of thousands of @entity103 , # @entity96 is dead
an incredible victory for @entity1 women and those who love them
