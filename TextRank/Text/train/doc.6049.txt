@entity0 is mourning the loss of @entity2 , a four - century - old architectural wonder that had dramatically stood on a ridge at the confluence of two rivers before it burned to the ground over the weekend
a gateway to eastern @entity0 , the dzong was built in 1638 by the nation 's founder , @entity10 , and was among several fortress - monasteries constructed to help gain control of -- and unify -- the country
" the entire society has solidarity for the loss of one of the most important and oldest fortresses in our country , " said home minister @entity15 , who has been on the site for the last three days , in a telephone call
king @entity25 and the queen have been there since the fire " trying to morally support the people , " he added
" it 's not just a @entity0 architectural loss but for the whole @entity38 region , " @entity32 , president of the @entity34 - based @entity33 , said by telephone on tuesday before visiting the site
" something could not have been built like that anywhere else , " he said
the fire started sunday afternoon and burned through the night , consuming the dzong , which not only housed temples but served as the seat of administration for the district
@entity0 's moving gold : how water is powering the country as news of the fire broke out , the king and queen rushed to the scene to oversee the firefighting effort
most of the dzong 's sacred relics -- hundreds of them -- were saved , many of them dating back to the 6th and 7th centuries , thanks to the @entity0 armed forces , said the home minister
some of the relics were carried out , while others were thrown in iron boxes from three - to four - story heights into the cactus below , he said , adding that some of the relics received minor but not severe damage
although an investigation is still under way , a short circuit in the wiring is believed to have caused the fire , according to the minister , adding that the dzong was 95 % built of timber
dzongs have had a history of fires , he explained , noting that butter lamps had been the culprit in the past
" today , it 's modern facilities
we have electrified nearly all the dzongs , and short - circuits could come from poor quality of wiring
that 's where we have our problems
" by tuesday , only stones , which comprised the stairs before the dzong 's entrance , remained of the dzong , according to the @entity0 newspaper , @entity103 , which reported that numerous administrative documents were lost
@entity0 had only just submitted @entity2 for @entity106 consideration in march
no one was killed in the blaze , and all people have been accounted for , the home minister said , noting that sunday had been a holiday , and that monks ' residences were constructed outside the dzong
in a message to fellow citizens published on @entity103 's website on tuesday , prime minister @entity115 said that @entity119 will be rebuilt just as the @entity120 , nicknamed the @entity120 , was after its own devastating fire in 1998
the @entity128 , he wrote , " is in fact more cherished and revered today because the fire awakened all of us to the fragility and vulnerability of this most precious heritage
" finding happiness in mystical @entity0 with its contours built into the ridge 1,350 meters ( 4,430 feet ) above sea level , @entity2 is inaccessible on three sides save for a narrow path in the front , @entity32 of the @entity33 pointed out
its hilltop location overlooking the @entity138 and @entity139 rivers offered a military advantage -- and the same inaccessibility that was intended to ward off enemy attacks on sunday hampered efforts by firefighters to put the blaze out
@entity15 said there was no financial estimate for the destruction of @entity2 , which has been immortalized in art as well as in a @entity0 ballad composed in the late 19th century
" @entity151 are priceless , " he said
" it is a big loss
@entity0 is a very small , tiny country
to reconstruct the same old structure at this point is going to be very difficult for our internal revenues to support
" only @entity157 and @entity158 , both completed in 1631 and also by @entity10 , are older
@entity162 's dzong has itself weathered numerous fires , quakes and floods over the centuries and has been rebuilt many times
this week 's fire will prompt @entity0 to shift its policy to protect its centuries - old dzongs , the home minister said
such policies would include ensuring a high quality in the electrification of the dzongs , adequate fire - extinguishing equipment , alternatives to timber which comprise most dzong construction -- and multiple exits
" in fortified fortresses , there is only one exit
we need to have multiple exits so that lives are not lost , " he said
to observe a national day of tragedy , the home ministry declared all offices and schools across the country closed on monday
" it was one of the most magnificent sites of @entity0 -- that dzong , " said @entity32
" for me it was always an uplifting experience to come to view it
it was always a great esthetic experience to sit quietly at the point where you could see that dzong
" he hoped the king would rebuild the fortress , " which will inspire future generations ... in the same way that the founder of @entity0 did , " he added
' endangered historic places ' list includes @entity208 's gym , @entity209
