-- @entity1 is a crazy place
in recent years we 've discovered some of the strangest things on the @entity1 : ice spiders , swiss cheese terrain , and perfectly spiral - shaped lava tubes
and the more we explore our near planetary neighbor , the weirder the things we find get
@entity12 's @entity11 , which has been circling @entity1 since 2006 , provides the clearest and highest - resolution images of the planet 's surface
looking through the image archive of its @entity18 camera , which can resolve things about a meter wide on the ground , reveals a vast supply of strange and wonderful things
here we share some of the orbiter 's most recent weird sightings from the last few months
the images provide incredible scientific insights into @entity1
but , perhaps just as important , they are beautiful , fascinating , and reflective of the alien world that sits not too far from our own
just a note on the colors in these images : @entity18 has cameras that see in slightly different wavelengths than our own eyes
many of the photos it produces are in " false color , " meaning the different wavelengths have been assigned colors for purposes of clarity or to highlight an important feature
there are no actual turquoise dunes on @entity1
but the false color pictures do allow scientists to differentiate various textures and materials on @entity1
