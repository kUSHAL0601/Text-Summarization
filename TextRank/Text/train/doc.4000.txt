-- in another time , @entity1 , which was barreling across the @entity2 early wednesday , would have been called @entity3
that 's because the @entity5 uses a roster of names it repeats every six years
however , once a large storm ravages a coast and causes too much death and destruction , its name is retired out of sensitivity to the victims and for historical purposes
this year 's list has a few changes because the 2005 hurricane season was particularly severe
among the names retired in the 2005 @entity2 season is @entity3 , which was replaced with @entity1
here is an explainer on how storm names are chosen :
how did the idea of names come about ? the @entity27 started off by naming storms using a latitude / longitude designation of their origin
the names were hard to remember and convey to the public , so meteorologists started naming storms after their wives and girlfriends during @entity38 the naming method -- which started in the @entity41 -- was so easy to remember , meteorologists adopted it for the @entity2 storms
when did this change ? in 1950 , meteorologists began the use of phonetic alphabets such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 for the @entity2 storms , according to the @entity51
how did storms end up with female names ? in 1953 , the @entity51 changed its naming convention again
it kept the alphabetical order but used female names
in 1979 , forecasters began throwing in male names into the mix. they now alternate male and female names in alphabetical order
. are the names random ? no. at the beginning of each @entity2 storm season , the hurricane center publishes 21 storm names , which are recycled every six years
the names are in alphabetical order
for example , the predecessor to @entity1 was @entity71
before @entity71 , there was @entity73
what happens if there are more than 21 storms ? if the @entity2 sees more than 21 named storms in a season , it resorts to using the @entity81 alphabet : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and so on
does the rest of the world have the same naming convention ? since 1978 , the @entity90 ' @entity89 has a predetermined list for each basin of the world
not all basins follow the same rules
for example , the @entity41 basin mostly uses names of flowers , animals and trees
. what makes a good storm name ? short , distinctive names work best , according to the @entity51
. why do some of the names sound unfamiliar ?
not all names are derived from @entity107
@entity109 and @entity110 names are used as well , since those are the other major languages for countries bordering the @entity2
. what other storm names have been retired ? the 2005 hurricane season was especially busy , and ravaged the @entity114 , and the @entity2 and @entity116 coasts
five storm names were retired a year later , including @entity118 , @entity3 , @entity119 and @entity120 .
