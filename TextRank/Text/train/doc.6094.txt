-- pass the stuffing , and the popcorn
over @entity4 weekend , movie theaters sold an estimated $ 295 million worth of tickets , breaking the record of $ 273 million set in 2009
knowing that there were going to be several hot movies in theaters and that people love to take pictures of their ticket stubs , we asked readers to tag their @entity16 photos of ticket stubs # stubreview and share a brief review
sure enough , the posts came
we saw dozens of tagged images representing about a dozen movies and from several countries
most attendees showed us first - run films , but some went to see older movies
ticket prices ranged from about $ 2 for a matinee to $ 13 for a full @entity31 experience
the posts corresponded with the top five movies in the @entity4 weekend box office results , so we compiled a list of movies to feature based on those two sources
we also got reviews about a few others that were n't in that top tier , and we included a few of those right after the list
did you see any of these ?
