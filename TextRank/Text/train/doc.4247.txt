@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a deserted playground a few hundred miles south of @entity5 , 13 - year - old @entity3 fiddles with a broken rusted slide
she is waiting listlessly for a lesson with her math tutor
the bright - eyed teenager lives in a sepia - toned village in the province of @entity0 , a place of rural poverty and neglect
but she has big dreams about education
she wants to open a school one day
" at my school , we 'll learn , " she says , brushing her hands longingly over the slide
" teachers will show up and we 'll be allowed to ask questions
we 'll be allowed to draw with color
" such aspirations , however , amount to fantasy for most youth in a country still struggling to land on its feet after being turned completely upside down
two and a half years after the country 's uprising began , @entity1 's fledgling democracy is stillborn , stubbornly stuck between its past and future
and as the government struggles to wade through the country 's protracted political problems , @entity1 's festering education system is orphaned -- even though , with a growing youth population , it 's key to the country 's future
in the @entity45 's latest report on global competitiveness , @entity1 ranked near the bottom -- 131st out of 144 countries -- for quality of primary education
@entity1 's literacy rate is 66 % , according to a 2011 @entity53 report
meanwhile , a report by @entity55 think tank @entity56 says just $ 129 a year is spent on each @entity58 student ; the @entity60 , for example , spends 40 times as much
the situation is worst in regions far from the capital , and in @entity1 , where more than half the population is under 29
many schools look more like rank penitentiaries rather than hubs of learning
students and teachers seem to be on the verge of exhaustion rather than bursting with inspiration
desks and a stable electricity supply are luxuries
" we did n't have enough desks last year , " recalls @entity3 's 12 - year - old neighbor , @entity80
" so most of us just sat on the floor
we only get a little paper , but my mom found this , " she said , holding up a small , faded " @entity85 " notebook
the @entity90 reference is lost on her
to make up for the gaps in education , millions of middle - class @entity58 families spend a large part of their income -- sometimes as much as 25 % -- on private tutoring
it 's impossible to know how much money is spent in all , but some estimates put the total at $ 1 billion a year
public school teachers rarely make more than $ 300 a month
more than a few of them say they teach the bare minimum in class so that they can earn more from the same students in private tutoring sessions
" there are too many issues to deal with , " said one 32 - year - old teacher in @entity3 's village
" i have kids of my own i 'm struggling to take care for
" he says he gives three hours of private tutoring in the evening and does mechanical work on the side
for parents with any hope that their children will be better off , investing in education is essential
@entity1 's final secondary school exams are a rite of passage for students
their scores chart their future
if they do n't do well , they wo n't get a place in college
the status quo is even more somber for @entity1 's women
according to a recent @entity138 report , the illiteracy rate for young people in @entity1 is 17 % , higher than the national average of 11 % , and the illiteracy rates for females is 24 % , almost twice that of males
also , 70 % of young women in @entity1 are jobless
more : interactive -- impossible odds , unstoppable girls politicians , whether they 're from the ruling @entity149 or the opposition , agree that educational reform is needed
but they quickly fall silent when pushed to articulate plans
one politician said the country simply has " bigger fish to fry , " with a controversial new constitution and still no full , functioning parliament
but with unemployment at staggering rates -- 33 % for men age 20 - 24 and 53 % for women in the same age -- @entity1 has a highly combustible pool of frustrated and disenfranchised youth in danger of becoming a lost generation
" this is a generation that desperately needs to learn how to critically think , to learn how to be in the 21st century , " said @entity167 , director of the @entity168 at the @entity169
" @entity172 's regime trained students to be loyal citizens
and now , despite a revolution for dignity ... there is none
" it sounds like an almost hopeless picture
however , as @entity1 's public education system founders , a few innovative ideas have emerged
this year , a few @entity58 entrepreneurs have launched @entity184 , a web - based startup that features crowd - sourced educational videos
@entity184 , which means " we understand " in @entity188 , hopes to provide an alternative -- a virtual classroom -- for struggling @entity58 families
it divides the @entity58 public school curriculum into lessons that can be explained in 5 - to 15 - minute videos , covering all lessons mandated by the government curriculum
since the website went live in october , @entity184 's staff of teachers created around 4,900 videos , while 1,000 videos were crowd - sourced -- reviewed and approved by the staff
by late may , @entity184 's @entity205 channel had more than 1 million views
for the 65 % of @entity58 who do n't have internet access -- those who stand to gain the most from the service -- @entity210 says it hopes to form group viewings in some villages
it is also in talks with some companies to offer @entity217 with internet access to groups throughout the countryside
another innovative initiative is @entity222 , a start - up created by @entity224 , a 24 - year - old @entity58 who 's a graduate student at @entity226 in @entity227
based on the @entity230 model , @entity228 plans to recruit ambitious college graduates -- most from within the @entity58 community and diaspora -- to commit to a two - year service in which they are trained extensively and placed in underprivileged schools
@entity228 says she 's running into problems , however , while trying to implement her idea
the bureaucracy in @entity1 leaves little room for productivity , let alone creativity and innovation
still , she continues to push on
" we could all stand around and protest that the government is failing us , or we could go out and offer the solutions , " she said
" so , that 's what we 're trying to do
" but until those solutions are offered , @entity3 -- and a whole generation in waiting -- will continue to linger near broken slides , daydreaming about the future
