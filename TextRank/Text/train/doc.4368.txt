-- @entity1 held his nerve amid a late charge from @entity4 to take the @entity5 -- his first @entity7 title for eight years
the @entity8 finished on eight - under - par , one shot better than @entity4 who recorded a final - round 64 on sunday , the lowest score of the week at @entity11 in @entity12
the @entity13 was six shots off the pace prior to sunday 's finale and double bogeyed the first hole but went on to make nine birdies
but @entity1 held held firm , despite a dropped shot on the 18th , to take his second title on the @entity7 , and his first since the 2004 @entity22
" i 'm so happy
this means a lot to me , " @entity1 told the @entity7 's official website after picking up a check for $ 640,000
" first , after eight years it does n't matter what kind of tournament you won ; it 's huge , because you 've got the confidence again
" every time i 've played consistent golf this year , and there were so many times up there , i could n't make it
stupid things happened the whole time
" it means so much to me to win after that long stretch
it 's all about winning in the end and it puts so much pressure every time you do n't win and people start talking , you will never win again and stuff like that , so it 's very important for me
" i love this golf course
i always loved it and i love it even more or even better now
" @entity4 hit just 29 shots on his closing nine holes and despite missing out on the title , he was delighted with his form
" it 's been just an unbelievable day really , " he said
" i had a really bad start , but two years ago when i finished second here , i doubled the first on the last day
" from then on , it was just great golf
i had a couple of good breaks and finally a lot of putts going in the hole
" i was in the moment , in the zone and i was n't really counting the birdies
the game has been feeling well all week and everything was coming out perfect
" world no. 3 @entity75 shot a closing round of 70 to finish 40th a day after an injury scare nearly forced him out of the tournament
" the leg is fine - it was n't a problem today , " he said , after fears he may have to miss the year 's third major , the @entity81 at @entity82 and @entity83 starting on thursday week
meanwhile , the @entity87 @entity86 saw a sixth first - time winner this season when rookie @entity90 claimed the @entity92 title after a playoff on sunday
the 28 - year - old beat fellow @entity94 @entity94 with a four - foot birdie putt at the third extra hole to earn a place at the @entity81 , the @entity99 playoffs and next year 's masters
he also earned a two - year tour exemption plus the financial security of a $ 1,098,000 windfall as first prize , having shot a second successive six - under 64 to join @entity94 on -16 at the end of 72 holes
" it was just a big relief , " said the left - hander , who had missed five successive haflway cuts before the @entity110 tournament
" all the struggles the last few weeks , knowing that now i 've got a couple years to try to improve on my game and win some more tournaments
" @entity117 champion @entity116 had led after three rounds , and held a one - shot advantage going into the final nine holes as he did at the @entity122 course last year , but he faded to a tie for seventh on -11 after three successive bogeys derailed his challenge .
