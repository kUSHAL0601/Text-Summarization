@entity0 -- @entity0 's top police official announced wednesday he was quitting , the second acting superintendent to step down in as many weeks
in a letter to embattled gov. @entity5 , @entity6 denied his resignation was connected to the ethics scandals embroiling @entity9
" my retirement is not premised on the current investigation by the attorney general [ @entity14 ] , as i know my decisions were honest and rightly motivated , " @entity6 said in the letter , which the @entity11 released
@entity6 's resignation takes effect friday and ends his 28 - year career as a police officer , his letter said
his predecessor , @entity21 , quit march 2 , less than a week after the abrupt resignation of @entity23 as @entity0 's deputy secretary for public safety
@entity23 said @entity21 had misled her about state police involvement in a scandal involving a top aide to the governor
the @entity31 governor has been mired in controversy since news reports emerged alleging an aide was involved in a domestic violence incident with a woman and that state police later allegedly pressured the woman to keep quiet
the aide , @entity39 , has been suspended without pay
@entity21 has said he did not dispute @entity23 's account of what he told her but said , " the conclusions she appeared to draw from these statements were incorrect
" separately , the @entity46 on march 3 accused @entity5 of an ethics violation for allegedly accepting free tickets to the first game of last year 's @entity50
the commission also said @entity5 lied under oath about intending to pay for the tickets
@entity5 's spokesman , @entity53 , resigned the next day , saying he could not keep doing his job " in good conscience
" the governor 's office said it was reviewing the commission 's findings
" gov. @entity5 maintains his innocence and intends to challenge the findings of the commission both with respect to the law and the facts , " the office said
the governor could face up to an $ 80,000 fine for violating the state 's gift ban for public officials , and up to $ 10,000 if he is found to have used his official position to secure unwarranted privileges
the commission has asked @entity14 , the state 's attorney general , and the @entity78 district attorney to investigate
@entity14 is a possible @entity31 contender for the governor 's office in 2010
@entity5 , a former @entity0 lieutenant governor who stepped into the governor 's mansion when @entity82 resigned in 2008 over a prostitution scandal , has abandoned his campaign for election to a full term , saying it was not the " latest distraction but an accumulation " of obstacles behind his decision
@entity1 's @entity92 contributed to this report .
