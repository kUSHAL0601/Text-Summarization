and separated plutonium from the @entity8 nation
the fissile material will be transported from the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) at the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) in @entity1 to a " secure facility " in the @entity2 , according to a statement released by the @entity14 , and " fully converted into less sensitive forms
" " this pledge complements the significant role that both @entity1 and the @entity2 are playing in finding new ways to continue improving global nuclear security ... @entity1 has demonstrated its leadership by resolving to remove all special nuclear material from the @entity10
" our two countries encourage others to consider what they can do to further heu and plutonium minimization
" @entity28 's long - term goal the @entity2 has a longstanding goal of reducing -- and safeguarding -- the world 's stockpile of fissile material , in an effort to reduce access by terrorist groups , criminals and " unauthorized actors
" the deal comes at a time when the @entity2 hopes to persuade @entity40 to halt their enrichment program , and tensions on the @entity44 are hightened by @entity46 's nuclear weapons program
@entity1 prime minister @entity47 and @entity2 president @entity28 announced the deal this week at the @entity49 in the @entity50
it allows for over 700 lb ( 315 kg ) of weapons - grade nuclear material to be transported and " downblended " into safer material in the @entity2
the fuel , which was purchased from the @entity2 in the 1960s , has been used by the @entity11 for research purposes
the agreed - upon amount which will head to the @entity2 is a fraction of @entity1 's overall plutonium holdings
@entity1 shows " leadership " " this is the biggest commitment to remove fissile materials in the history of the summit process that president @entity28 launched , " @entity61 of the @entity62 told the @entity63
" it is a demonstration of @entity1 's shared leadership on nonproliferation
" previously in favor of refinement of fuel for use it its own domestic nuclear power grid , the agreement comes at a time when many @entity1 nuclear power facilities have been mothballed , following the 2011 reactor meltdown in @entity81
the accident , which occurred when a powerful tsunami damaged the facility , was the worst nuclear disaster since @entity86 in 1986
@entity87 has previously criticized @entity89 's stockpiling of nuclear material -- suggesting that it had the capability to produce nuclear weapons relatively quickly
however , as history 's only victim of atomic warfare , @entity1 's post-war constitution forbids the pursuance of nuclear weapons , with public opinion also overwhelmingly against the policy
@entity1 senior nationals security adviser @entity101 told the @entity102 that " @entity1 shares a vision of a world without nuclear weapons
" the @entity2 hopes to convince more nations to use reprocessing and enrichment facilities in existing nuclear states in an effort to minimize proliferation risks .
