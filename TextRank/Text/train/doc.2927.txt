in our @entity3 series , @entity1 correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events
@entity1 's @entity9 reports on a refugee camp in @entity11 , @entity12
children at the camp are in danger of dehydration , says a doctor who visited the refugees with @entity1
@entity11 , @entity12 ( @entity1 ) -- they are not war refugees , not displaced by violence ; rather they believe they 're here because they are @entity23
a mother of two sobs as she tells us , " i have no money
no money for books or uniforms to send my children to school
" it 's around 110 degrees fahrenheit in this squalid camp in downtown @entity11 , where 2,000 @entity23 have settled , literally in the @entity36
the @entity23 population of @entity12 is only 5 percent of the overall population
overwhelmed by a @entity40 majority , at times they face violent attacks
other times , they believe they 're expelled from their lands -- faced with a distant and dark future
this group has ended up living in tents for the past 3 months
they say the government kicked them off their land without warning : only because they are @entity23
the government tells a different story , saying that they were given plenty of warning
further than that , they say they will take care of this problem , a problem they are well aware of
the minister of minority affairs , @entity67 , says , " we are constitutionally bound to protect the life and property of the minorities and to look after the interests of the minorities in this country
because they played a role in the founding , they are equal citizens of the country
yes , there is a problem , but we are trying to solve those problems
" the truth is , regardless of any religious strife , people are dying of poverty in this camp
two have died since the group settled here , and children lay in the sun , totally exposed to the sun , suffering slowly
we brought a doctor to the camp ; he seemed stunned , both at its location and the conditions
" i think there 's a danger here , especially with some of the younger children , that they could just die from dehydration or from all kinds of infections , " says dr. @entity99
" i am very surprised , really because this is the center of @entity11 , just right in the center
and every facility is not but 10 minutes from here
" the water the camp is using to survive on is a broken pipe that runs underneath the road and out one side
at the camp , the water is used for drinking and washing
it happens to run over a pile of trash and directly down into the makeshift toilets , which are two holes in the ground
@entity99 tells us the obvious : @entity125 will come to this camp -- the conditions are ripe
other countries of course deal with religious strife ; minorities all over the world face an uphill struggle
but here , with the addition of poverty , in the oppressive heat -- in an over-crowed camp on the side of the road in downtown @entity11 -- it seems that much worse
a little girl stares into our camera and rhythmically says , " @entity144 , hallelujah , hallelujah
" her religion teaches her that " the poor " will inherit " the kingdom of heaven
" @entity147 seems a long way off .
