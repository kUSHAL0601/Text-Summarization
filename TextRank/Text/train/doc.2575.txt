the parents who pulled their cancer - stricken son from a @entity5 hospital and spurred an international search for the boy have been ordered to appear monday in a court in @entity9 , where they were arrested , police said
@entity11 and @entity12 took their 5 - year - old son , @entity13 , who has brain cancer , to @entity15 and then @entity9 late last week , authorities said
hotel staff members in @entity17 , @entity9 , recognized @entity13 and his family from media coverage and contacted police
authorities did not confirm what charges the couple will face , but say that " cruelty " could be one of them as suggested by @entity5 law
@entity5 police have arrived in @entity9 to question the parents , @entity17 police told @entity31
the @entity32 will be working on extradition efforts
the court appearance is part of a @entity37 arrest order that was issued by @entity5 against the couple
their arrests came hours after @entity41 publicly asserted that he and his wife are not kidnappers and are not neglecting their son
" we were most disturbed today to find that his face is all over the @entity49 and newspapers , and we 've been labeled as kidnappers , putting his life at risk , neglect , " @entity12 said in a @entity46 video posted saturday
" we 're very happy with his progress , " the father said in the video
" we 're not neglecting him
" the father is seen sitting on a bed with his son leaning against him
he points to a machine on the nightstand next to him
" we 've got loads of these feeds here
we 've got iron supplements and we 've got @entity65 , " an over-the - counter medication , @entity12 said
" as you can see , there 's nothing wrong with him
he 's very happy , actually
since we took him out of hospital , he 's been smiling a lot more
he 's been very much interacting with us
" @entity41 defended his actions in the video made shortly before his arrest
he accuses two doctors at the hospital for not allowing him to seek proton beam treatment outside of @entity5 , even though he said he was ready to pay for the treatment himself
" we pleaded with them for proton beam treatment
they looked at me straight in the face and said with his cancer , which is called medulloblastoma , it would have no benefit whatsoever
" @entity12 said he then looked on the @entity49 and found sites in the @entity88 , @entity15 and @entity89 on proton beam treatment that " said the opposite that it would be beneficial for him
" the @entity92 in @entity93 issued a statement saying they are working with doctors in @entity17 to ensure @entity13 's welfare and " are delighted that he has been found
" " we are aware of the comments made online by his father , " the statement said
" throughout @entity13 's admission we have had conversations about the treatment options available to him and we had offered the family access to a second opinion , as well as assistance with organizing treatment abroad
" after @entity13 was taken from the hospital without authorization thursday , the family -- including @entity13 's six siblings -- boarded a ferry and headed to @entity115 , @entity15 , that night , police in @entity5 said
@entity116 issued an international missing person notice to the agency 's 190 member countries to help find @entity13
while authorities were searching for the boy , detective superintendent @entity120 said @entity13 is not mobile on his own , can not communicate verbally and is supposed to be receiving constant medical care because of recent surgery and " ongoing medical issues
" " without this specialist 24 - hour care , @entity13 is at risk of additional health complications which place him at substantial risk , " @entity120 said friday
after the parents ' arrest saturday night , authorities acknowledged they could face criticism
" all of our efforts resulted from explicit medical advice that @entity13 's life was in danger , " said assistant chief constable @entity134 of @entity5 's @entity135
" i am very aware that there are comments about the rights and wrongs of our approach , but when we are told by experts that any child 's life is at risk we will make no apologies for being as proactive as possible
" @entity153 police said @entity13 was taken to @entity154 in @entity9 and that the facility was communicating with @entity156 , where the boy had been removed by his parents
it was not immediately clear what happened to the @entity162 ' other children
in the @entity88 only a handful of hospitals offer proton - beam therapy after surgery , including @entity167 , where the late @entity88 sen. @entity168 was treated for brain cancer in 2008
he died just a year after his surgery for malignant glioma
that surgery was followed by six weeks of radiation
@entity168 wrote in a @entity176 article at the time that he underwent proton - beam therapy
the theory behind proton therapy is that its high - energy particles zone in specifically on the tumor and so do not harm the surrounding healthy tissue as much as the x-ray photons in conventional therapy , said dr. @entity186 , associate professor of neurosurgery at the @entity188 .
