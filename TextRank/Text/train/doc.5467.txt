-- a fledgling force of @entity3 military deserters said it struck an important government security complex on the outskirts of the capital overnight , a bold strike reflecting the resolve and confidence of the regime 's opposition
the assault came ahead of an @entity14 meeting wednesday to reaffirm a decision to suspend @entity3 's membership , a move the group made over the weekend after president @entity20 's government failed to abide by a proposal to end a brutal crackdown on protesters
also wednesday , @entity25 recalled its ambassador to @entity3 , the @entity24 said
the move followed attacks on @entity25 missions in @entity3
the defector group , called the @entity30 , said it attacked an air intelligence base in @entity32 and planted " powerful explosions inside and around the compound that shook its foundations
" @entity36 , an expert on @entity3 at the @entity37 , said air intelligence has been deeply involved in the eight - month - long crackdown by the @entity3 government against protesters , a grinding civil conflict that the @entity43 says has left more than 3,500 people dead
@entity36 said the strike reflects the growing sophistication of the @entity30 , which has brigades across the country and has been in existence since the summer
" it opens up a new era of the conflict , " he said , adding that the development represents " a bad direction " for the country
" until now , most of the protests have been peaceful
" the @entity30 said it " carried out special operations in various areas in @entity60 in order to spoil the plan that the regime is preparing against our people and our homeland
" the regime should " take note " that the deserter force " is capable of striking them in any place and at any time we want , " the group said
activists said the deserter army used rocket - propelled grenades and the intelligence complex was damaged
activists also reported damage at the complex in @entity32 , an eastern suburb of the capital , @entity60
free @entity30 lt. @entity84 , speaking to @entity0 in @entity82 , @entity83 , called the late - night operation brief
he said 20 defectors armed with rocket - propelled grenades and kalashnikov rifles participated and that it involved people from inside as well as outside the security branch
he did n't know whether security forces suffered casualties but he said no rebels were hurt
he called air intelligence " one of the most terrifying secret service departments in @entity3 " and said such security entities will be targeted by defectors
" this branch is responsible for many of the crimes against @entity3 people and political prisoners , " @entity84 said
" we will announce the whole story to the world in the correct time
" it was one of five actions reported by the opposition force , which has recently emerged as an important factor in the opposition movement as more and more soldiers have left the @entity3 army
the opposition force also reported clashes with personnel loyal to @entity20 in several areas
they include @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity60 neighborhoods , and @entity124 , a suburb
there was also fierce fighting in @entity128 , a city in the @entity3 countryside
" a clash between the @entity30 and @entity20 's criminal gangs and his mobsters ( the shabiha ) in @entity128 , our free @entity3 military caused the @entity20 's gangs a lesson that they will never forget and heavy losses at the roundabout in the @entity140 , " the army said
the shabiha are pro-government militias
@entity36 said the @entity30 consists of soldiers who 've left their posts instead of obeying orders to fire on protesters
they 've also had active operations in and around @entity147 , @entity148 and other areas recently , he said
opposition groups like the @entity30 have been calling on the international community to help protect protesters
they have urged the @entity43 to impose a no - fly zone , as it did in the @entity156 conflict , and a naval blockade
@entity30 leaders have said such policies could allow them to establish a base of operations to launch a campaign to bring down @entity20 's regime
the group surfaced when seven military officers , believed to be original members of the @entity30 , announced their defection in a video posted on @entity169 in july
the group 's leaders , who had been exiled to @entity83 , say they 're directing a guerrilla war effort against the @entity20 regime , which acknowledges an increasing number of deadly attacks on its soldiers , including a bombing of a @entity3 army tank near @entity180 recently
col. @entity181 , a 30 - year veteran of the @entity3 air force , claims to lead a force in @entity3 cities of some 10,000 mainly low - ranking soldiers , a number impossible to verify
but the opposition fighters are believed to have little firepower -- planting bombs and carrying out hit and run attacks -- and they 're a small force in comparison with @entity3 's military , which numbers in the hundreds of thousands
the group has a @entity198 page , which calls on other soldiers to join it
the @entity14 , meeting in @entity202 , @entity203 , said @entity20 did n't stick by his pledge to release detainees , withdraw armed elements from populated areas , and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and @entity14 monitors
the league has also called for unspecified sanctions against @entity3 and called on member states to withdraw their ambassadors from @entity60 , a decision that will be up to each nation
the @entity217 , a state - run outlet , quoted a government source as saying that " @entity3 decided not to participate " in @entity202 , where there was a ministerial meeting of the @entity14 council and an @entity223 - @entity83 cooperation meeting
@entity83 foreign minister @entity224 told the @entity223 - @entity83 group that the @entity14 's move to suspend @entity3 's membership was " a responsible and well - timed step that put forth the gravity of the situation
" he said @entity3 had n't fulfilled commitments to the league and the @entity83 to rein in the instability
a former ally of @entity3 , @entity83 has threatened to cut off power supplies if @entity3 does not change course
@entity83 's @entity236 said it has suspended negotiations with @entity3 over joint oil exploration
" the @entity3 administration should read the message of the @entity14 correctly , and by ending the violence it is inflicting on its people open up the way for the inevitable process of democratic transformation
it is not possible for any administration to win a struggle against its own people
it is not possible for an administration based on collective punishment and everyday killing people on the streets to be successful , " @entity224 said
" the @entity3 administration must know that public opinion in neither the @entity223 world nor the world at large can bear these heart - wrenching images forever
@entity260 is working against the @entity3 regime
all of the credit and the helping hands that have been extended to the @entity3 regime to date have been wasted , " he added
the final communique tuesday from the @entity223 - @entity83 forum " emphasized the necessity of halting the bloodshed and violence against @entity3 citizens , and the importance of taking urgent measures to assure the safety of civilians
the ministers stressed the importance of the stability and unity of @entity3 and the need for the resolution of the crisis without any foreign intervention
" the @entity223 ministers also " expressed their appreciation to @entity83 for providing temporary protection on its territories for @entity3 citizens who fled to @entity83
" @entity288 , @entity203 's ambassador to @entity3 , told @entity0 a demonstration occurred in front of his country 's embassy in @entity60 on wednesday
" there was some improper behavior in front of the embassy
the protesters threw tomatoes and rocks at the embassy and they brought down the @entity203 flag and raised the @entity3 flag instead , " @entity288 said
" i asked them to send in a delegation so i can listen to their demands and what they were protesting against
i explained to them @entity203 's stance in the @entity14 and then they left
the demonstration is over now
no one was physically attacked or injured
" @entity203 's @entity24 condemned the attacks on its embassy , the country 's official news agency reported
the @entity317 denounced an attack on its embassy
a @entity320 diplomat in @entity60 told @entity0 in an e-mail that windows were broken there
" the @entity3 government will shoulder the responsibility on maintaining the security of its diplomatic mission and the respect and safety of its staff , " said foreign affairs undersecretary @entity323
" it is clear that there was negligence on the part of the @entity3 government in providing the necessary measures to ensure the protection of the @entity317 diplomatic mission in @entity60 , and the protection of its staff
" on saturday , pro-government protesters attacked @entity223 and @entity83 entities in @entity60 , @entity341 and @entity342
the @entity83 have demanded compensation for damage to their buildings and they have evacuated families of diplomats and some nonessential personnel
on monday , @entity3 's state news agency reported that @entity3 's foreign minister publicly apologized for the embassy attacks
and @entity353 's @entity352 said this week that a person in @entity20 's position would step down , a statement observers interpreted as a call for the @entity3 president to do just that
for its part , the @entity3 government freed 1,180 detainees tuesday as part of the @entity14 peace plan
but opposition groups said the gesture was too little , too late
the death toll keeps mounting , they said , with at least 81 killed in clashes monday -- making it one of the deadliest days of the uprising
the number of civilians killed wednesday was 20 -- 11 in @entity147 , 7 in @entity148 , and 1 in each @entity180 and @entity60 suburbs -- said the @entity373 of @entity3 , a coalition of activists
@entity0 is not able to independently verify claims of fighting and casualties because the @entity3 government has restricted international media access to the country .
