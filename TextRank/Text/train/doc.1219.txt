-- @entity1 is admittedly a big guy , but more than a few super-fit cyclists in @entity3 have been left wondering how that dude just went flying by
@entity1 calls his electric bike a " hill eraser " because he can ride it to work without breaking a sweat
and then his wife , @entity8 , comes motoring past
" they stare , like how can a girl go past me , " she says , laughing
it takes the other riders a few seconds but then they figure it out
the @entity17 , who live in @entity18 , @entity3 , used to drive everywhere , except when they used their bikes for recreation
that changed when they got their new e-bikes , made by a company called @entity24
now , they ride to go shopping and to go to breakfast -- but mostly they ride to work
@entity1 says the couple has cut 50 percent of their car - use since they started electric biking
and there are other benefits
@entity1 dropped 30 pounds and his blood pressure fell 10 points in the first six months he owned the bike , he says
the @entity17 do n't exactly classify themselves as " environmentalists , " although @entity8 said it is important to have a positive effect on the planet
" i learned that the worst amount of smog that you put out [ in an automobile ] is in the first mile , so if we can make even some of those shorter trips on our bicycles , it makes a big difference , " she says
who wants one ? @entity51 , director of sales for @entity52 , says electric bikes attract different types of buyers
many are looking to make a green imprint
some are " active adults " who have ridden bicycles for years who -- as they get older -- are unable to do the same kind of riding they did when they were young
other buyers want to ride their bikes to work quickly -- and avoid a sweaty entrance into the office
oddly -- or perhaps not -- @entity52 sees its strongest sales when the price of oil skyrockets , says @entity51
two wheels , a motor and 100 million riders electric bikes are still somewhat of a novelty in the @entity79 , but in @entity80 they 're everywhere
in fact , @entity80 electric bikes number more than 100 million -- which is about four times the number of @entity80 private cars , according to @entity85
the bikes are popular in @entity87 as well
sales figures for the @entity79 are hard to pinpoint
in the @entity79 , about 200,000 electric bicycles were sold last year , said @entity90 of the @entity91 -- about twice the number sold in 2005
but the industry has hit a bump in the road from the recession , as sales were down about 10 percent in 2009 , he said
e-bikes are mostly made by specialty companies , but the growing sales trend has been noticed by the big boys
@entity102 , a worldwide leader in bike sales , has been making electric bikes for three years , but only introduced them in the @entity79 in the past year
other well - known companies like @entity107 and @entity108 are increasing their presence in the e-bike field
at @entity112 , the biggest bicycle industry convention in the @entity79 , there were more than 20 companies displaying e-bikes this year
@entity51 said only a few years ago , it was about five
prices range from a few hundred dollars -- the @entity119 costs $ 398 at @entity120 -- to more than $ 13,000 for @entity122 's top - end model
prices increase as battery technology and components get better
@entity126 of @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity3 , said most buyers he sees do n't balk at the price , which can be as much as a good road or mountain bike
they are mostly concerned with how far they can go on a battery charge and how fast
what 's an ' e-bike ' ? by law , electric bikes must have no more than 1 horsepower and go no faster than 20 mph ( on motor power alone )
basically they are much like traditional bicycles with small motors that power the bike or assist a rider with pedaling
many have gears like a regular bike
" it 's just adding the throttle aspect , other than that it handles like a regular bicycle , " @entity1 said
he says he uses the throttle all the time , choosing one of two modes -- eco [ half power ] or fast [ full power ]
he says he once tried a regular bike for his 4 Â½ - mile ride to one of his music studios where he teaches jazz improvisation
but the hills nearly got him
he calls his electric bike a " hill eraser
" it also makes the ride to his farthest studio -- 22 miles away -- seem much closer
he says he gets about 35 miles on his primary battery and has an additional one for long rides
shifting views but as they tout the virtues of electric bikes , advocates also realize that there will have to be a shift in the way @entity79 view them before they become as popular as they are in @entity87 or @entity80
" there are two possible sides to the equation , " @entity126 said
" one would be a change in the way people view transportation
there are still a lot of suvs out there
... people still have a hard time thinking about riding a bicycle unless they are 10 years old , it seems
so there needs to be a little shift in mentality
" " but having said that , i think there is a growing awareness about health and transportation and environmental issues so it could be that we are just reaching a juncture where things will change [ for e-bikes ]
" @entity51 says people also have a preconceived notion about electric bikes
some view them as expensive or poor quality or uncomfortable
and @entity51 admits , e-bikes are not for everybody
as @entity126 says , people who live in @entity220 will probably always prefer a really good road bike and hard - core city cyclists may well stick to their fixed - gear bikes
@entity51 says @entity224 , which sells its bike for $ 2,700 , is n't for those kinds of people
" that 's not our customer , " he says
" our customer is someone who wants some form of electric transportation , green transportation , that can get them from @entity235 to point b comfortably
" the @entity17 say taking a test drive will change a skeptic 's attitude
" if you ride one , it will blow your mind , " @entity1 says
" when you get on one it 's like being in a flying dream you 've had
it 's like everything you 've dreamed your bicycle should do in your wildest dreams -- it 's doing it
