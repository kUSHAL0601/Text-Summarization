among those detained were @entity12 leaders and operatives , the military said
" we are determined to bring them home and bring the perpetrators of their abduction to justice , " said lt. col. @entity14 , a spokesman for the @entity15
" people have just dropped off the face of the earth and the three boys , who are our main concern , are the focus of our efforts , " @entity14 told @entity1
" @entity12 are behind that , and we are doing everything we can to shake them up as soon as possible in order to bring the boys home
" the teens went missing in @entity35 settlements in the @entity36 late last week
@entity4 prime minister @entity37 spoke monday with @entity39 president @entity38 and told him to " assist in returning the abducted youths and in apprehending the kidnappers , " according to @entity37 's office
he blamed @entity12 for the kidnapping
" those who perpetrated the abduction of our youths were members of @entity12 -- the same @entity12 that @entity38 made a unity government with , " he said sunday
@entity38 is another name for @entity38 , whose government now includes @entity12 , which controls @entity51
" the consequences of the partnership with @entity12 must be understood : it is bad for @entity4 , bad for the @entity6 and bad for the region , " @entity37 said
@entity4 newspaper @entity56 reported that in a statement released by his office , @entity38 condemned the kidnappings and called on all sides to refrain from violence
one of the three boys is a dual @entity4 - @entity64 citizen , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity65 , which attributed the information to a source at @entity37 's office
@entity4 and @entity64 officials have not publicly confirmed the report
@entity64 secretary of state @entity71 called sunday for the immediate release of the boys
" we are still seeking details on the parties responsible for this despicable terrorist act , although many indications point to @entity12 ' involvement , " @entity71 said in a written statement that offered support to the @entity4 government
" as we gather this information , we reiterate our position that @entity12 is a terrorist organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has used kidnapping in the past
" @entity37 : @entity4 forces can use ' all measures ' to free teens ' we 'll hug them soon ' @entity94 , 16 ; @entity95 , 16 ; and @entity96 , 19 , have been missing since late thursday or friday and were last seen around @entity97 , according to the @entity15
the three " were just on their way home , " @entity95 's mother , @entity98 , told reporters sunday
" we trust " that they " will be with us here , and we 'll hug them soon ... and @entity104 willing , we 'll all be able to celebrate their return safely , " she said

" we feel waves and waves of prayers and support and positive energy in this direction
" @entity37 has given security forces the ok to use " all measures " at their disposal to find the teenagers
the @entity6 @entity121 said in a written statement that the arrests come under " flimsy pretexts " as a " continuation of the aggression " on @entity6
" the ministry also asserts that the @entity4 military campaign has been on going for decades , during which ( @entity4 ) kidnapped the entire @entity6 people , " it said
@entity12 responds a @entity12 spokesman in @entity51 told @entity1 that @entity37 's comments attributing blame were " stupid and baseless
" " the arrest campaign made by the @entity4 occupation in the @entity36 is targeted to break the backbone of @entity12 and bring it down , but the @entity4 will not succeed in achieving their goal , " @entity135 said
but @entity4 deputy foreign minister @entity140 said the kidnappings are a reminder of @entity12 ' tactics
" when the @entity148 - @entity12 government was formed last month , the international community quickly recognized and welcomed it , " he wrote in a @entity145 post
" suddenly , @entity12 ' cruel acts of terrorism were forgotten , their never - ending attempts to harm innocent civilians , along with the @entity153 , which calls for the total destruction of the state of @entity4
" now , he wrote , " the international community has been given a second chance to correct its moral , diplomatic and strategic mistakes
@entity160 to wall condemnations of the kidnapping are called for , as well as placing responsibility on the @entity6 government , including the threat of taking physical , economic and diplomatic steps against it
" but , he wrote , the international community is " keeping silent , and by doing so , not only are the @entity6 receiving a false , lenient message , but @entity4 also understands again that she has no one to count on but herself , something that will not encourage further compromises on her part in the near future
" ' # @entity177 ' the abduction of the three teens inspired social media users to use the hashtag # @entity177 , a reference to the # @entity184 campaign for more than 200 @entity186 school girls who were kidnapped by militants
the thread quickly became contentious , with @entity190 users alleging many @entity6 children have been kidnapped by @entity4 soldiers and imprisoned
