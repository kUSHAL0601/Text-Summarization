@entity18 , the @entity12 police chief , said the arrest took place about two weeks ago and that @entity13 confessed to the crime
read a behind - the - scenes with @entity14 then and now " the file of @entity13 was completed by police and submitted to the attorney general 's office in @entity12 province , " he said
' @entity14 ' and ' @entity13 ' are both honorifics -- ' @entity14 ' meaning ' lady , ' and ' @entity13 ' a term of respect for someone who has performed the pilgrimage to @entity34 that is required of all able - bodied @entity35

" it felt like there was cold water in my nose
i opened my eyes , and i could n't even see because of all the blood
" @entity14 said her mutilation was an act of @entity50 justice for the crime of shaming her husband 's family
at 16 , she was handed over to her husband 's father and 10 brothers , whom she claims were all members of the @entity50 in @entity12
" i spent two years with them and became a prisoner , " she said
she eventually ran away but was caught by police in @entity61
and although running away is not a crime , in places throughout @entity2 , it is treated as such if one is a woman
eventually her father - in - law found her and took her back to her abusive home
she was taken to a @entity50 court for dishonoring her husband 's family
the court ruled that her nose and ears must be cut off , an act carried out by the six men in the mountains of @entity12 , where they left her to die
she was brought to the @entity76 where she received reconstructive surgery and a new life
@entity0 's @entity79 contributed to this report
