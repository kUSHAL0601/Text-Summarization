-- @entity2 leader @entity1 called @entity4 's recent offensive in @entity5 a " holocaust , " according to a purported message from him posted on an @entity8 web site
@entity1 , in an undated photo , apparently taped a message calling @entity4 's @entity5 offensive a holocaust
" the holocaust of @entity5 in the midst of this long siege is an important and historic event and an articulate tragedy which affirms the need for detachment of the @entity21 from the hypocrites
it is not right that our condition after what happened in @entity5 be like our condition prior to it , " the message said
@entity2 says it wants to liberate the mosque from @entity4 control
the message -- an audiotape played over a still image -- is called " @entity34 " and it is dated march 2009 , according to terrorism analyst @entity33
the more than 33 minutes - long tape includes @entity38 subtitles , and @entity38 and @entity40 transcripts were released by @entity41 , @entity2 's media production center , @entity35 said
the authenticity of the tape could not be verified
the message says it 's " clear " some @entity46 leaders have " conspired " with what it calls the " zionist - crusader alliance " against the @entity50 in @entity5
" they are the ones that @entity52 describes as the moderate leaders in our world , " the message says
the speaker urged @entity21 to help insurgents " liberate " @entity58
" for those honest in their desire to deliver @entity59 , they should back the @entity66 in @entity58 with everything they need in order to liberate @entity70 , " the message said , alluding to the @entity60 mosque regarded as the third holiest place in @entity62
" and with that they will have defeated the @entity73 ' biggest ally , " referring to the @entity52
then , the fighters should move on to @entity75 to " liberate all of @entity76 from the sea to the river " from @entity4
when talking about @entity76 , the speaker is referring to the region between the @entity81 and the @entity82 that includes the jewish state of @entity4 and the @entity50 lands of the @entity85 and @entity5
in his last purported audio message in january , @entity1 called for a jihad , or holy war , to stop @entity4 's military campaign in @entity5 .
