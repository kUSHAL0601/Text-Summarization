@entity0 , @entity1 -- hundreds of militants stormed military checkpoints in northwest @entity1 early tuesday , killing at least eight soldiers and injuring 10 others , military and government officials said -- the latest in a string of attacks against security forces
twenty - five militants died in the clash , according to the officials
the predawn attack took place over several hours in @entity17 , one of seven mostly ungoverned districts in @entity1 's tribal region along the @entity22 border
the district has seen a sharp increase in militant activity with insurgents who have fled military operations in neighboring @entity28 and @entity29
@entity17 has become the front line in the fight between @entity1 militants and security forces
the @entity1 army has launched several operations in @entity17 to flush out militants , but parts of the district remain strongholds of the @entity1 @entity40
last week , six soldiers and 10 militants died in another battle in the same area
more than 3,000 @entity1 soldiers have been in killed in the fight against @entity49 militants over the past decade , the @entity45 says
the number of soldiers killed this month -- more than 50 -- is very high , but does n't approach figures in 2009 and 2010 , when up to 150 troops at a time were killed in one month at the height of military operations in @entity1 's tribal region , a senior @entity1 military official said
journalists @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 contributed to this report
