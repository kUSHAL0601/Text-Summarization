@entity0 -- @entity4 missed her flight back home from a @entity8 vacation , but she will be back in @entity0 in time for an important court appearance wednesday , her spokesman said tuesday
@entity0 county judge @entity10 ordered @entity4 to appear in court so she can determine whether the actress is keeping up with her probation provisions , including the requirement that she work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue
" @entity4 was delayed in @entity17 due to a travel - related issue , " @entity4 spokesman @entity16 said
" she will be heading back this evening in time to appear in court tomorrow
" the missed flight , however , forced the cancellation of @entity4 's interview with talk show host @entity23 , which was set to be taped tuesday
" @entity4 offered to tape ' @entity23 ' tomorrow , but the show was unable to shift things around , and tomorrow is their last day of taping for the season , " @entity26 said
the " @entity23 " interview was to be @entity4 's only planned appearance to promote her just - published @entity35 photo spread
there is no indication that @entity4 , 25 , will have any difficulty in court wednesday , compared with many of her numerous appearances in the past two years
@entity10 sentenced @entity4 to 30 days in jail last month after she admitted that she violated her probation on a necklace theft conviction , but the sheriff sent her home after a few hours because of jail overcrowding
the judge also ordered the actress to work at least 12 days a month at the @entity0 morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court - ordered community service
she must also attend 18 psychotherapy sessions
if the actress stays on track , her probation would be eased march 29 , @entity10 said
if she does n't keep up with the requirements , she will serve the additional 270 days behind bars , the judge said
" this is what we really call putting the keys to the jail in the defendant 's hands , " @entity10 told @entity4
when @entity10 sentenced @entity4 to 120 days in jail in may , she ended up serving 35 days of home confinement instead , because of jail overcrowding and state rules that give prisoners credit for good behavior
prosecutors said @entity4 missed 12 of 20 scheduled workdays at a downtown @entity0 women 's center , part of the court - ordered community service imposed in may when she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace from a @entity81 , @entity82 , jewelry store
@entity4 , 25 , was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007
she also canceled 14 of 19 scheduled appointments for court - ordered psychotherapy , they said
" from what i see of you , you need a structure , " @entity10 told @entity4 last month , instructing her to return to court each month , starting december 14 , to show she is complying with the schedule
@entity4 's legal woes , which began four years ago with two drunken driving arrests , have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes , and alcohol and drug test failures
her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless @entity4 breaks any laws before then
it has been extended several times because of violations , including the failed alcohol and drug tests
