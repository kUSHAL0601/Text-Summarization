-- criminal investigators from the @entity4 and the @entity5 were at a @entity7 pharmaceutical company on tuesday with a search warrant , a company spokesman said
federal officials say that more issues have been reported with drugs from the @entity12 , or @entity13 , which has been linked to a deadly multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity16 confirmed that criminal investigators were on site , but declined to answer questions regarding a warrant
@entity21 attorney @entity20 similarly said that personnel from her office and law enforcement partners were investigating allegations concerning the company
she added that it was " entirely premature " to suggest what the results of that investigation may be
nineteen people have died from the noncontagious meningitis associated with injections of a contaminated steroid produced by the @entity13
are my drugs coming from a compounding center ? @entity38 , an attorney for the @entity13 , said of the investigation tuesday , " it is difficult to understand the purpose of this search , since we have been clear that @entity12 would provide , and has provided , anything requested
we 've been clear that warrants were n't needed ; asking would have produced the same result
nevertheless , we continue to offer our cooperation
" as part of the ongoing investigation into the center , a patient with possible meningitis has been identified who received an injection of another @entity13 product , triamcinolone acetonide , the @entity5 said monday
also , a fungal infection from @entity58 was reported in a transplant patient who received cardioplegic solution from @entity13 , the @entity5 said
cardioplegic solution is used to induce paralysis of the heart during open - heart surgery
" an investigation of this patient is ongoing ; and there may be other explanations for their @entity58 infection , " the @entity5 said
the health care facility initially reported two transplant patients having infections from @entity58 , the @entity5 said
@entity5 urges patients to be ' vigilant ' the heart transplant patient received the cardioplegic solution in august , and the patient who received the triamcinolone injection was treated on september 19 -- both before @entity13 recalled its products , according to an official at the federal @entity79 , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject
the @entity13 announced a recall of all its products october 6
the @entity5 said " the sterility of any injectable drugs ... produced by @entity13 ( is ) of significant concern , and out of an abundance of caution , patients who received these products should be alerted to the potential risk of infection
" the @entity79 reported wednesday the number of meningitis cases increased from 233 to 245 , spread across 15 states
there are two cases of a " peripheral joint infection " that specifically affects a joint such as a knee , hip , shoulder or elbow , officials said
the cases have been linked to injections of a contaminated steroid , methylprednisolone acetate , produced by the @entity13
some 14,000 people may have received the injections , the @entity79 estimated last week
a @entity113 woman , @entity112 , filed a lawsuit thursday -- which may be the first from the outbreak -- against tthe @entity13
in it , she alleges she was injected in september with a tainted batch of steroids from the @entity13
meanwhile , members of @entity119 expanded an investigation into the outbreak
in a letter to the director of the @entity125 in @entity126 , leaders of the @entity122 noted the @entity5 sent the @entity13 a warning letter in 2006 " detailing significant violations witnessed " by investigators the previous year
woman sues over outbreak @entity7 gov. @entity132 also accused the @entity13 last week of misleading regulators and operating outside its license by shipping large batches of drugs nationwide
plus , the state 's pharmacy board mandated that all @entity7 compounding pharmacies sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients
meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord
it is usually caused by an infection , frequently with bacteria or a virus , but it can also be caused by less common pathogens , such as fungi in this case , according to the @entity79
steroid injections common for back pain sufferers fungal meningitis is very rare and , unlike viral and bacterial meningitis , is not contagious
dr. @entity161 , chairman of the @entity162 at @entity163 , said fungal infections are not usually mild
he said when a fungus invades small blood vessels , it can cause them to clot or bleed , which can lead to symptoms of small strokes
in addition to typical meningitis symptoms such as headache , fever , nausea and stiffness of the neck , people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion , dizziness and discomfort from bright lights
patients might just have one or two of these symptoms , the @entity79 says
@entity79 : tests may not detect meningitis fungus @entity0 's @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .
