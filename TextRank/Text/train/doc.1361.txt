a @entity1 student who says she was raped in front of onlookers at a " wildly out of control " campus fraternity party has filed a lawsuit against @entity6 of @entity7 , 11 of its members and the alleged assailant , according to court documents
@entity12 , then a freshman , said she was raped by another student last may at the @entity15 of @entity7 fraternity house in @entity17 , @entity18 , at a pledge " strip show , " says the suit , which was filed tuesday in a @entity18 federal court
@entity23 does not usually identify victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because the woman wanted to make her name public
" i 'm proceeding in this case with my real name instead of ' @entity33 ' because as the victim of a heinous violent crime i 've done nothing wrong and have nothing to be ashamed of , " @entity12 said in a statement provided by her lawyer
" i ca n't even describe the pain of being raped , or how much it alters a life , and no other person should ever be forced to have that experience
i hope my experience and lawsuit will create changes that protect others
" at the party , the lawsuit says , many " underage and extremely intoxicated " young people danced with naked pledges and " spilled alcohol throughout the area
" @entity12 , who has taken a leave from her studies , said she became extremely uncomfortable , put on her jacket and attempted to leave when a male student picked her up from behind and raped her in the presence of " numerous others , " according to the lawsuit
@entity1 public safety officers then took her to a nearby hospital , where a diagnosis of sexual assault was documented , the lawsuit says
" @entity62 takes all reports of risk management violations , especially those with regard to sexual assault , very seriously , " @entity61 , executive director of @entity62 , said on the fraternity 's website
" we are currently investigating the incident and gathering further information
" after an internal investigation , the university expelled the alleged perpetrator and imposed " sanctions against the fraternity and members , " according to a statement by @entity1 president @entity77
the student named in the lawsuit , who has not been charged criminally , did not return calls seeking comment
@entity17 police confirmed that they responded to a sexual assault complaint from the @entity88 on may 4 , 2013 , spokeswoman lt. @entity85 said
the investigation is ongoing , and no charges have been filed , she said
@entity91 said police were having difficulty finding witnesses and urged anyone who attended the party from may 3 into may 4 and may have witnessed anything to call police
the lawsuit says the fraternity contractually demands self - governance from @entity1 , relinquishing the public safety and housing services the university generally provides to students
the fraternity allegedly failed to adequately provide its own security , and the defendants failed to train themselves in safety and risk management issues , including sexual abuse prevention , hazing and the misuse of alcohol , according to the lawsuit
@entity12 's lawyer , @entity113 , said that because the fraternity sets itself apart from the university , officers from the university 's @entity115 can enter the fraternity only in " exigent circumstances " or when specifically asked to come in
" this lawsuit seeks to hold this fraternity responsible for its gross mismanagement which it does under the guise of self - management , " @entity113 told @entity23
" @entity62 self - management has historically proven itself to be flawed and dangerous
women have been raped because of this mismanagement
people have died because of this mismanagement
and this victim will hold the fraternity responsible for its tradition of dangerous mismanagement
" @entity1 would not comment on the fraternity 's arrangement with the @entity115 , but @entity77 's statement acknowledged that the university 's fraternities have " some autonomy
" " all have seen increased scrutiny over the past few years , " @entity77 said of fraternities
" we intend to focus our attention on improving the safety of these spaces
" @entity1 was not named in the lawsuit
" on behalf of the university community , i want to express our horror at this shameful assault , " @entity77 said in the statement
" sexual violence will never be tolerated on our campus
sexual violence on college campuses is a national problem , and it 's important to raise awareness about this issue
at @entity1 we are committed to caring for survivors , vigorously pursuing perpetrators , and creating a positive campus climate in which sexual violence and misconduct have no place
" @entity165 has taken a leave of absence from the university since the attack and is receiving " intensive counseling , trying to pull her life together , " her lawyer said
@entity165 is seeking $ 10 million in damages , the lawsuit says
in 2012 , a @entity1 student sued the university and another fraternity , which @entity1 no longer recognizes as a student organization , after she said she was raped in its frat house two years before
the fraternity had garnered the on - campus reputation as the " @entity183 , " according to the lawsuit
her assailant pleaded guilty to assault and unlawful restraint , court papers said
the case was settled in court - ordered mediation in august 2013
