no one knows exactly how long the 2 - year - old pit bull had been left to die alone in the @entity3 mountains
a photo taken by @entity5 , the hiker who found him , shows the dog half standing , half collapsed , his head pressing against a rock
@entity5 had walked about a half mile uphill last friday , october 18 , along a deserted trail in @entity13 when she found the black and white dog , suffering from bullet wounds , said @entity18 spokeswoman @entity17 in an e-mail
she hesitated for a moment before approaching the pit bull , @entity20 said
but when he lifted his head as she reached for her water bottle , @entity5 put her apprehension aside , gave him a drink and then lifted the 47 - pound dog into her arms , @entity20 said
then , she began walking
" it will be ok , " @entity5 kept telling the dog as she slowly picked her way down the path
every so often she would stop , give him another drink , then stand up again and keep going
" at first she was shaking because she was scared , " @entity20 said
" then she was shaking because of the weight of him
" eventually the dog stopped moving
@entity5 was overwhelmed by the media attention and did not want to talk , but gave @entity20 the permission to do so
" when my mom found our new dog on the mountain , my heart broke at the first sight of him , " said @entity5 's daughter @entity39 , 10 , in a letter to @entity20 and the @entity18
" he was torn up
" described as a " very fit person , " it took @entity5 an hour to complete the journey , her arms aching , @entity20 said
@entity5 's husband and daughter met her at the bottom and they took the dog to the @entity18 , where veterinarians examined him
" i thought i would never see him again , " @entity39 said
" i knew he was in good hands , but i still felt very sad
" doctors found an open abdominal wound , bullet fragments near his spinal cord and a bullet in the middle of his neck , @entity20 said
the @entity5 family named him @entity69
" i was so , so happy when we got to see him , " @entity39 wrote
@entity20 said @entity69 responded to @entity39 as if " they had been best friends their whole lives
" @entity69 is now adjusting to his new foster home , where he is getting to know the other @entity5 dogs
" @entity76 has a dog , dad has a dog , i have a dog , " @entity39 told @entity20
" @entity69 is the family dog
" as for @entity5 , her arms still ache even though it 's been a week since the rescue
@entity20 said it 's unlikely any investigation will be conducted to find the person who injured @entity69 since there is n't a clear timetable and no witnesses have come forward
" after all you have done for us , " @entity39 said in her letter
" i want to help animals too
thank you so much for making our lives better
