@entity0 -- @entity2 is making some changes to its most well - known product : search
the tweaks , updates and beta projects are all part of @entity2 's attempt to make searches faster and more relevant
for starters , @entity2 is bringing its siri-esque voice search feature to the @entity14 and @entity15
the company expects to roll out an update to its free @entity19 app later this week with the new feature , which uses speech - recognition technology to understand spoken , natural language search requests
though it has not yet been approved , @entity2 said it is working with @entity23 to get the app out
depending on how you phrase your question or request , the app will bring up text answers and images or play @entity32 videos
the app also can give answers specific to your location , such as movie times or weather
for example , " play the sleepy kitten video " should automatically bring up and start playing a video of said exhausted feline , and " what 's the weather here next week ? " will show a weather report for that exact period
the version of this search - by - voice feature was already available for @entity49 4.1 users , and @entity2 says it will be available for older versions of @entity49 at some point in the future
there also are some subtle changes coming to @entity56 versions of the search engine around the world , starting thursday
auto - predict , the sometimes amusing feature that shows popular search terms that start with the words you are typing , will be joined by smarter , more relevant suggestions
the feature works by tapping the company 's knowledge graph , which is a database of more than 500 million " objects
" an object can be anything in the real world , such as a location , public figure , movie , sports team or company
for example , a search for " @entity78 " will suggest the @entity81 casino , the city and the original @entity84 temple in search field
another new feature is the knowledge carousel -- a collection of frequently mentioned results for certain search terms that will appear as a row of thumbnail images at the top of the screen
a search for famous astronauts will bring up images of relevant people , along with dates of birth and death
clicking on one of these links updates the page 's search results to show links about that person
it also works for other things such as locations , museums , animals or albums
the final feature announced wednesday is a beta project that loops your @entity117 account into the search results
when the feature is on , @entity2 will search the @entity121 as well as all the e-mails in your account and include a list of relevant e-mails or contacts on the side of your screen
for some common queries , @entity2 will parse the e-mails to isolate key bits of information , much like travel app @entity133
a search for " my flights " will pull flight information for upcoming trips you may have booked , and present it along with data from the @entity121 , like an updated flight status
the feature has been tested by several thousand @entity2 employees , and now the company is opening up the trial to a test group of a million
anyone can sign up to try the feature at g.co / searchtrial , although it will only work on the main @entity19 site in @entity56
these tweaks are the survivors of a huge number of experiments @entity2 has done for search
in 2011 , the search team conducted 58,000 experiments on search and made 530 tweaks to how search works
@entity2 says it has found more than 30 trillion unique urls on the @entity121 , crawls 20 billion sites a day and processes 100 billion searches every month
@entity165 , @entity2 's senior vice president of engineering , said the changes bring @entity2 one step closer to his dream of being like capt. @entity169 on " @entity170 " and using the starship computer to find out anything he needed to know
" the destiny of search is to become that ' @entity170 ' computer , " he said .
