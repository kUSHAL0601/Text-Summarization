@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity1 president @entity3 says he is open to the idea of meeting with @entity6 president - elect @entity5
former @entity1 president @entity3 has largely been out of the political scene since falling ill in 2006
" with @entity5 , one can talk whenever he wants , because we 're not preachers of violence or war , " the communist leader wrote in an essay published thursday on a state - run web site
" he must be reminded that the carrot - and - stick theory can not be applied in our country
" friday 's missive marked the second time in recent weeks that a @entity1 leader has said he is open to meeting with @entity5
in the latest issue of @entity22 , actor @entity20 writes of his recent conversation in @entity0 with @entity24 , who took over as president this year from his ailing brother
according to @entity20 , @entity24 told him , " perhaps we could meet at @entity28
we must meet and begin to solve our problems , and at the end of the meeting , we could give the president a gift
... we could send him home with the @entity6 flag that waves over @entity36
" @entity5 has called for the @entity6 detention facility at the @entity38 on the island of @entity1 to be closed
despite the indications that the @entity1 leadership is open to warmer relations with its neighbor to the north after 47 years of a @entity6 - imposed trade embargo , some in @entity0 expressed skepticism that the impending change in leadership in the @entity6 will translate in to a changed @entity1 policy
" @entity5 is a product of the @entity6 empire , " @entity52 said
but @entity55 , a high school student , said she 's hopeful
" we 've got to wait and see
