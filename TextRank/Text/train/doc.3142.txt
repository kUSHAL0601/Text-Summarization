-- @entity1 is releasing the third smartphone to take advantage of its faster fourth - generation data network on thursday
like the others , the revolution from @entity6 runs @entity8 and has a large 4.3 - inch touch screen
it also has a pair of cameras and a mobile hot spot feature , allowing users to share the fast data connection with eight devices connected via @entity17
@entity18 will cost $ 250
that 's the same price as @entity21 's @entity20 , which was the first @entity23 phone on @entity1 , and $ 50 less than the @entity24 from @entity25 , which also came out this month
for a conference in february , a prototype version of the new @entity6 phone was picked to demonstrate an internet calling service from @entity1 that is expected to debut next year
last week , @entity1 added nine new towns to its 4g map and expanded coverage in @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37
the network , which offers faster download speeds , is available in 55 metropolitan areas , the company said
@entity1 began rolling out the service in december
@entity43 named launch cities for its upcoming @entity45 on wednesday
the new @entity23 network , not to be confused with the old 4g network that 's basically a faster version of @entity48 , will debut in the summer , @entity43 said
traditionally , several months separate the commercial launch of new cell network infrastructure and the release of phones that use it
but @entity43 said in january that @entity45 phones would launch sometime in the second half of the year
in the meantime , @entity1 will continue to take advantage of its lead
also in january , @entity1 pledged to launch four 4g phones by midyear , but it may miss that target
@entity62 has said it will delay the release of the @entity64 until the summer in order to add features .
