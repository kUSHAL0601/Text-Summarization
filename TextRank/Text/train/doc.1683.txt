@entity0 -- new questions were being asked wednesday after a video surfaced showing what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of @entity6 in years
did @entity8 intelligence officials even know the meeting was taking place ? " i ca n't imagine that they knew about this meeting
after all , there have been seven drone attacks in @entity14 this year
there was one on april 1 , so it 's not like the drone program is being suspended , " @entity15 , @entity1 national security analyst , told " @entity20 with @entity21
" " it seems to me we do n't know for a fact if they did or did not know about this meeting , but common sense would suggest that they missed it , " he said
@entity8 officials are n't commenting on that , but every frame of the video is now being analyzed as a potential piece of intelligence
analysts are looking at a flashy white truck that appears , leading a convoy
they are even analyzing the fruit juice being served as a possible clue
in the middle of the clip , the man known as @entity6 's crown prince , @entity42 , appears brazenly out in the open , greeting followers in @entity14
@entity46 is the no. 2 leader of @entity6 globally and the head of @entity48
in a speech to the group , @entity42 makes it clear that he 's going after the @entity8 , saying " we must eliminate the cross
... the bearer of the cross is @entity8 ! " the video started appearing on jihadist websites recently , drawing the attention of @entity8 officials and global terrorism experts
@entity8 officials say they believe it 's authentic
they believe the highly produced video is recent
with some fighters ' faces blurred , there is worry it signals a new round of plotting
asked by @entity69 would release such a video , @entity15 speculated that the group did it for propaganda purposes
" to show we 're here
we 're still in operation , " he said
" this group is still potentially a pretty virulent threat , unfortunately
" @entity48 , also known as @entity48 , is considered the most dangerous @entity6 affiliate
the @entity80 and the @entity81 have killed multiple @entity48 leaders with drone strikes
but the group is now emboldened
retired gen. @entity85 said smaller @entity6 affiliates are coalescing into a more organized base
" sooner or later , if they continue to get better , stronger and more organized , " he said , " they will be a direct threat to the @entity8
" it 's unlikely the @entity8 was n't aware of the meeting shown in the video , @entity85 told " @entity94
" " the question is n't why did n't we know , " he said
" the question is : what are we going to do about it ? " @entity1 's @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report .
