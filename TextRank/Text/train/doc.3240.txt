-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 outlined sunday a $ 4 billion economic development plan for the @entity4 that he hopes will help encourage peace in the region
details were scant on the proposal , which he announced in @entity9 during a meeting of the @entity11
" the fact is that we are looking to mobilize some $ 4 billion of investment , " @entity1 said
a team is looking at opportunities in tourism , construction , energy and agriculture , among other industries , and will make recommendations to the @entity23 , he added
experts believe the plan could increase the @entity23 gdp by as much s 50 % over three years and cut unemployment to 8 % from 21 % , @entity1 said
the initiative is supported by both @entity30 prime minister @entity29 and @entity23 president @entity31
" now , is this fantasy ? i do n't think so , because there are already great examples of investment and entrepreneurship that are working in the @entity4 , " @entity1 told the crowd , which included @entity31 and @entity30 president @entity35
" so we know it can be done , but we 've never experienced the kind of concentrated effort that this group is talking about bringing to the table
