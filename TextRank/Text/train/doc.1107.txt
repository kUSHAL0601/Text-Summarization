-- it 's an unforgiving place , 45,000 feet above the @entity2
it 's brutally cold up there , as low as 59 degrees below zero , and there 's so little air to breathe , it takes just seconds to pass out
it 's at least 10,000 feet above the typical cruising altitude for a passenger jet , a full 3 miles above the peak of @entity12 , and a staggering 6 miles higher than your typical skydiving altitude
this is where @entity16 disintegrated friday , high above the @entity19 desert
pilot @entity20 survived the crash
why one died and the other lived is unknown , said @entity0 aviation consultant @entity25
" there 's a million things , " he said
" what 's amazing is that @entity20 is alive , " he said
" there must be an amazing story of either luck or sheer will that he 's living
" whatever happened , it 's a sure bet the pilots thought about and trained for failures similar to the one that caused the experimental craft to break up , he said
" everything about test flying is , ' what 's going to go wrong now , ' " @entity25 said
test pilots , by definition , work in extreme environments
they 're always chasing some superlative -- higher , faster , never done -- usually in unproven aircraft fresh off the design board
and they often do it with a minimum of survival gear , which adds complication and weight to airframes under testing , @entity25 said
like the space shuttle and other spacecraft before that , @entity16 did n't have ejection seats , @entity25 said
to escape a disintegrating , spinning craft , its pilots might have to claw their way along a rope mesh to escape
and while they wore helmets with oxygen , they were n't dressed in full - pressure suits -- not that it would have probably meant much in this case , @entity25 said
after all , @entity20 survived without one
still , the thin air makes quick reactions crucial
at 45,000 feet , pilots who lose their masks or oxygen canisters can expect to have nine to 15 seconds of effective performance time before the lack of oxygen takes hold , according to the @entity81
and while some on the ground are looking up , questioning the value of expending human life on commercial spaceflight , the test pilots themselves have a different perspective , as @entity91 owner @entity90 told @entity0 's @entity92 on monday
" yes , the risk is worth it , " @entity90 said
" and as i say , @entity95 would have been the first to say that
i 'm sure his parents and his wife and his sisters would not say that , but test pilots would say that because they know the risk they 're taking
that they know the importance of what they 're doing
" @entity25 , who has been critical of the ease with which @entity90 and others have portrayed future space travel , agreed
" these guys go into it completely with their eyes wide open , " he said
" there 's always going to be people who want to do that
" @entity0 's @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 contributed to this report .
