-- the @entity1 is looking for new ways to regain its strength , to shake off the recession blues and fortify its position of international leadership
but @entity9 is missing the obvious , neglecting its closest neighbors
with @entity14 's @entity13 partners struggling , with @entity16 's economy powering ahead , and the @entity17 simmering with uncertainty , @entity9 has decided to " pivot " from its decade - long post- 9/11 wars and look to @entity21 and the @entity22
but the @entity1 is overlooking the most logical , natural place to build strong friendships , partnerships and alliances : @entity14
in recent years , attention focused on two places
first , the perennial center of global turmoil , the greater @entity17 shook under armed conflict and ideological clashes , with major wars in @entity34 and @entity35 happening simultaneously with an escalating confrontation between @entity37 and the @entity38 over @entity40 's nuclear program
at the same time , nervous attention turned to @entity16 , whose dazzling growth propelled a once - minor economy into the world 's second largest in a few short years , making it clear that the @entity16 - @entity1 rivalry will become one of the dominant features of this century
but while @entity9 paid little attention , something rather spectacular happened to the south , in @entity14
a region that had become a caricature of itself -- the place that gave us words such as junta and banana republic -- attained a new level of political and economic maturity
most countries found a workable economic formula , addressing poverty without repelling investors
in most nations , democracy grew strong roots
not everybody ignored the @entity14 miracle
@entity16 and @entity37 , the two countries the @entity38 most worries about , have been busy developing diplomatic relations and increasing economic ties
during years when the @entity1 paid little mind to relations with @entity14 , home to 600 million people with economies worth $ 5 trillion , @entity79 and @entity40 set their sights on the @entity14 hemisphere
@entity79 engaged in an aggressive economic push , becoming a top customer for @entity14 natural resources , loaning billions , developing infrastructure and building trade ties
and @entity37 found in @entity14 a way to dodge @entity89 economic sanctions and break its diplomatic isolation
in the last few years , @entity40 has opened new embassies in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97
in addition , it is opening @entity37 cultural centers in 17 countries in the region
political and economic ties are blossoming , while @entity9 pays little attention
and this is happening just as @entity14 has developed in a direction that could make it easier to build ties with the @entity1
most people in the continent live in democracies , having strongly rejected the right of the military to seize power and rule by force
most latin countries now have free market economies that seek , with some success , to raise the bottom for the millions who still live in poverty
@entity14 and the @entity1 have much in common
with the exception of @entity123 , @entity124 , and two or three @entity124 acolytes , the hemisphere , including the @entity1 , is made up of countries that share easily compatible ideologies
with 50 million people of @entity132 heritage living in the @entity1 , personal ties also help create a steady foundation for a more powerful hemispheric alliance
to be sure , not every country has seen stronger democratic and economic growth in recent years
@entity124 has seen its economy falter and its president , @entity139 , has amassed a dramatic concentration of power
that model , in which the president grows so powerful that it undermines democratic institutions , has been imitated to different degrees in @entity95 , @entity97 and @entity96
but the model embraced with the greatest enthusiasm is unabashedly democratic , market - friendly , with a social conscience , as seen in @entity151
the results have been spectacular
@entity16 wows the world with double - digit economic growth , but @entity151 has suddenly become the world 's seventh largest economy , on its way to displace the @entity158 as the sixth
@entity151 's @entity160 grew 7.5 % last year
@entity161 's soared 9.2 %
others expanded just as fast
@entity163 's gdp climbed a stunning 15 % and @entity94 's more than 8 %
much of that came from trade with @entity16
and if @entity16 's economy falls into recession , @entity14 will hurt
but @entity14 economies are pulling tens of millions out of poverty and into the middle class
that means they are becoming consumers who could keep the economy moving even if trade falters
in a region where the @entity1 has long been the unrivaled principal trading partner , trade with @entity16 is exploding , totaling $ 180 billion last year , up 160 % since 2006
suddenly , @entity16 has become @entity151 's main commercial partner , topping the @entity1
just when it most urgently needs to regain its footing , the @entity1 is ceding ground through neglect , missing out on the chance to expand markets in a way that could benefit the @entity1 and @entity14 , and losing diplomatic and political ground when it can least afford it
@entity9 will inevitably continue to focus on the @entity17
and @entity21 will surely garner growing attention
but neglecting @entity14 is simply foolish
the @entity1 is overlooking a natural alliance
a respectful partnership , not one where one country dictates to others , could help the @entity1 build a stronger diplomatic presence on the global arena , help it shake the blues and get ready for the tough challenges the young century has already thrown in its path
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .
