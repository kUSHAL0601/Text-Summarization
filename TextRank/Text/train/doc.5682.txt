-- i 'm looking forward to thursday night 's installment of @entity0 's " the @entity3 " with some trepidation
true , it 's another excellent installment in the series
capturing the highlights and essence of a decade , especially one as turbulent and historically significant as the ' 60s , is not easy
given the controversial nature of many of the events -- at the time and even today -- and given how much influence some of those movements and events still exert , the task of putting together even a multipart series is daunting
thursday 's episode will cover the 1968 assassinations of the rev. @entity20 , on april 4 , and of @entity21 , on june 5
other episodes will cover the beginnings of the gay rights movement -- the @entity26 riots -- and the emergence of the women 's rights movement
those events changed my life , immediately
those movements changed the way i saw the world , eventually
i was born on december 15 , 1959 -- the cusp of the ' 60s
as the baby boomers came of age , or at least entered their teens , i went from infancy , to being a toddler , to childhood
i have no direct memories of the @entity42 , @entity44 's assassination , the @entity45 coming to @entity46 , or the buildup of the @entity48
" @entity53 " was my dream -- it still is , of course -- but i learned the words in reruns
but i was old enough to be affected directly by the events in this episode
as i wrote in " @entity56 , " i grew up on april 4 , 1968 , when @entity20 was shot
i 'd been active in neighborhood politics even before , but that night , at 9 years old , i joined the civil rights movement
when @entity21 was assassinated two months later , we prayed
i remember my anger , my fear , my determination
i remember talking to everyone i trusted , everyone i thought wise
the times indeed were changing , but nobody knew what they were changing into
our challenge was channeling anger into action , transforming despair into determination , using defeat to become more disciplined
i learned early it 's a lifetime challenge
while the civil rights movement was woven into my childhood , it took a bit longer for me to become aware of what was then called the women 's liberation movement
of course , the fight for equality goes back into the 19th century , even to founders like @entity87
but it was in 1968 that " women 's lib " became an official part of the societal shift , the tide of change toward economic , social and legal equality
( the name " women 's liberation " came from a nationally circulated newsletter that came out of @entity98
) it was a time of consciousness - raising , and women refused to be left out
in 1968 , 100 women protested the @entity104 beauty pageant
in 1972 , @entity105 published the first issue of @entity107 , but the seeds had been sown earlier
women like @entity105 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 -- they showed a young girl just entering her teens that being a woman was n't a political handicap , but an asset
the gay rights movement also started in the late ' 60s , but it had the farthest to go
like the push for women 's equality , it actually started earlier
it just found its voice , following the footsteps of the civil rights and women 's rights movements
the impetus was the @entity26 riots
when police raided the @entity134 in @entity135 on june 28 , 1969 , it sent shock waves through the gay and lesbian community
police lost control of the situation , people rioted , and more protests occurred the next night , and again on other nights
village residents began organizing , trying to establish places where gays and lesbians could be open without harassment or arrest
gaining acceptance by other activist groups was slow
getting respect and equal treatment before the law was slow
but where we are today began then
and if we want to have an honest discussion about where we are , and where we can and should go , we need to understand the ' 60s a lot better than we do
i hope you 'll tune in .
