-- @entity1 became the first team in @entity4 history to win its opening 10 games of the season after a 1 - 0 victory over bottom feeder @entity9 , a result that also restored the @entity13 's five - point advantage at the top of the table over @entity16 and @entity17
@entity1 bossed possession -- amassing 65 % overall -- but when the hour mark passed and the match remained scoreless it appeared as if @entity9 would engineer an upset and take a point in the @entity22
club legend @entity23 could n't bail out @entity1 , since he was out injured
@entity24 , however , struck in the 67th minute with a header to put an end to @entity9 's resistance
@entity24 's effort was one of 18 shots for @entity31 's @entity1 , while @entity9 only mustered two
@entity1 ground out a 1 - 0 win at @entity33 on sunday to make it nine in a row and match the feat of @entity16 during the 2005/06 season
@entity16 was later stripped of its title that campaign as part of a match - fixing scandal
@entity41 keeps pace days after pledging his international future to @entity45 instead of @entity46 -- the country of his birth -- @entity49 scored again as @entity41 beat @entity50 2 - 1 to keep the pressure on @entity52 in @entity53
@entity49 moved ahead of @entity54 in the scoring charts on 12 goals when he converted a penalty in the first half and ex @entity52 front man @entity60 also found the back of the net from the spot in the second half
@entity50 pulled a goal back in injury time after @entity41 's @entity69 was sent off in the 89th minute for a second yellow but @entity41 hung on for a vital victory despite not playing at its best
" what really makes me happy is the effort made by the players , " @entity41 manager @entity72 told the club website
" it 's not easy to win , win , win and keep winning
" @entity41 improved to 30 points , one behind the @entity80 , after improving to 10 wins and a defeat
despite @entity84 's month - long scoring slump in the league , @entity52 beat city rival @entity86 3 - 0 away on tuesday to temporarily move four points ahead
@entity88 completes the top three
in a hole following a @entity92 defeat to @entity52 on saturday , @entity54 bagged a hat - trick and @entity94 scored his first goals at the @entity96 in a 7 - 3 thrashing of @entity98 on wednesday
impasse continues in @entity100 a strike by clubs from @entity103 and @entity104 moved ever closer after @entity100 president @entity105 refused to budge on plans to hit high earners with a hefty 75 % tax rate for two years
a meeting with club owners did little to change @entity105 's mind thursday , meaning the teams look certain to sit out games between november 29 and december 2
the scheme , which could be implemented next year , was initiated to help reduce @entity100 's budget deficit although the clubs argue they 're unfair targets since many of them are struggling financially
" @entity123 representatives have not been heard despite several constructive proposals , " the @entity119 said in a statement on its website
" this tax , which was initially meant for the richest , will in our case impact companies in debt
" those who earn more than 1 million euros ( $ 1.38 million ) a year would have to pay the 75 % rate
but it 's the clubs , not the players , who would have to cough up the funds .
