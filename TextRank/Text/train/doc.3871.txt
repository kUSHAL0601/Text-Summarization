-- $ 640 million dollars
we all know that number
it 's the amount of last week 's record @entity6 jackpot
the media coverage reached a fever pitch as the prize rose to an awe - inspiring amount of money
i have n't bought a lottery ticket in more than ten years but even i was sucked in hoping that i could win , despite knowing that i had a better chance of dating @entity15 and @entity16 -- at the same time
but i felt luck was on my side since i had recently received e-mails informing me that i had won the national lottery of @entity21 despite my never having ever purchased a ticket
in any event , for a few days , the lottery joined us all in a collective moment of dreaming " what if ... " if you simply chose six numbers correctly , your next stop would be a mansion and being able to finally tell your boss what you truly thought of him or her
the media bombarded us with stories examining the lottery from every angle : the odds , the ways to increase your chances , how people would spend their new fortune if they won , etc. issues like the presidential election , the economy and the @entity43 controversy faded to the back burner
in a way , the lottery had morphed into our own version of " @entity53
" it became our national obsession
for those who have n't read " @entity53 , " it 's a popular book series which is now the no. 1 film in @entity58
in the story , the nation is obsessed with the " @entity61 " -- an annual event in which contestants are chosen to battle each other in the ultimate reality tv show
the rules of the game are simple : the winner is the one person who stays alive
our lottery , along with the " @entity61 , " share similarities with another game of chance : the gladiator games of ancient @entity75
despite the stakes being obviously different in each of these three types of games , all are state - sponsored forms of entertainment
and all three not only amused the citizenry , but lead the public to ignore -- however briefly -- the more pressing issues of the day
but our lottery is far more dangerous than either the " @entity61 " or the gladiator matches
the lottery is not just a distraction -- it 's an opiate for our masses
the lottery can numb people into believing that since you have a chance to become a millionaire by simply spending a dollar on a ticket , then you can achieve the @entity58 dream without putting in the real work
this mentality can dissuade people from battling the true barriers to economic mobility that threatens our society , such as the inability of many to afford a college education due to soaring costs , the gender wage gap that allow men to earn more than women for the same job , and the income stagnation that has plagued the middle class
despite the astronomical odds of winning the lottery , it is sold to us by the states as a realistic way of attaining dreams of a better life
indeed , the states play on these very aspirations with their lottery slogans , like @entity129 's " what kind of mega millionaire would you be ? , " @entity130 's " if you do n't buy a ticket , how is lady luck going to find you ? , " or @entity132 's " whose world could you change ? " @entity133 at one time even used a class - conscious slogan in its lottery commercials : " the @entity136
" this tag line took into account the reality that the ones buying lottery tickets are not " the rich
" you 're never going to see @entity145 , @entity146 or even @entity147 in line at a deli to buy lottery tickets
in fact , at least 20 % of @entity58 play the lottery on a regular basis
those who have lower incomes buy a higher percentage of tickets
and when unemployment goes up , lottery sales generally increase as people hang their hopes on this game of chance
the 43 states that sell lottery tickets happily take money from their residents knowing full well the income levels of those who are buying the tickets and the grotesquely miniscule odds of winning
i 'm not saying that we should ban the lottery , but states should not just tout the pipe dream of winning the jackpot
they should also encourage their citizens to use their hard - earned money in a way that can make them into true " winners " -- by saving for an education or investing their salaries in things that can actually provide a return
the lottery is more dangerous than the fictional " @entity61 " or historical gladiator games
in those events , only a handful of people suffered
in contrast , the lottery hurts millions of @entity58
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .
