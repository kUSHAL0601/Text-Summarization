as thousands - strong @entity2 rallies make headlines in @entity4 following the @entity6 attack , one of the rallies ' organizers has resigned as leader of a right - wing group after a newspaper published a months - old selfie of him posing as @entity14
the photo shows @entity16 , leader of @entity17 , which translates in @entity18 to @entity19 of the @entity20
it appeared wednesday on the cover of @entity4 tabloid @entity23
@entity16 resigned as chairman of the group following the backlash to the @entity14 photo , as well as another image @entity16 posted of a man in a @entity33 robe with the caption , " @entity24 's a day keeps the minorities away
" " i apologize to everybody who has felt attacked by my online postings
they were comments made without serious reflection , which i would no longer express today
i am sorry that i thereby damaged the interests of our movement , and draw the appropriate conclusion , " @entity16 said in @entity39
the selfie was an act of satire , his spokeswoman @entity44 said on @entity48
while every citizen has the right to engage in satire , she wrote , insulting foreigners is not satirical
though @entity16 apparently has deleted his own @entity48 account , screen grabs published by numerous media outlets suggest @entity16 posted the @entity14 photo in september , while the @entity33 image is from 2012
@entity16 told @entity23 , " i took the photo at the hairdressers , for the publication of the audiobook of the satire ' he 's back
' ... you need to be able to joke about things now and then
" " he 's back , " or " @entity64 " in @entity4 , is a 2012 best - selling satire based on @entity14 waking up in modern - day @entity66 with no knowledge of what happened following @entity70 the audiobook was released long before september , as january 2013 news reports indicate 75,000 copies had already been sold
it appears the images gained traction not because of timeliness but because @entity17 has successfully organized weekly @entity78 demonstrations in @entity39
police estimated that 18,000 people attended a january 5 rally , while about 25,000 people showed up at a january 12 rally
monday 's scheduled protest in @entity39 was canceled after police persuaded @entity17 to call it off following an @entity88 fatwa targeting @entity17 's organizers , the group wrote on the @entity48 page for its @entity92 branch
" the police has canceled the rally in agreement with @entity17 because they ca n't guarantee the security and safety of participants after information of planned attacks by islamistic groups , " the @entity48 post said
in response to monday 's cancellation , @entity105 , the city of @entity108 's offshoot of @entity17 , said it was organizing a rally expected to draw between 30,000 and 60,000 demonstrators , according to @entity4 media
as many as 4,000 police officers had been recruited from around the country in preparation for the event , one news outlet reported
on its main @entity48 page , which has more than 155,000 " likes , " @entity17 has stated its philosophy that citizens should " wake from their slumber " and recognize the " danger in the @entity123 ideology
" " stop the radical @entity129 ' @entity128 , " it urges
" as a society , we should give people the chance to integrate , but we should not allow ourselves to be islamized thereby losing our freedom and democracy ! " the group claims to have supporters in more than 30 @entity4 cities and 18 countries in @entity140
a @entity17 group in @entity142 also called for demonstrators to gather outside @entity144 in the capital , @entity146 , earlier this month to show support for the @entity148 and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the " @entity128 of @entity142
" @entity4 justice minister @entity151 and chancellor @entity152 have called on the group to cancel the rallies in @entity39 and other @entity4 cities
counterprotests have taken place or been planned in @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity39 , @entity108 and @entity66
during a january 5 demonstration , @entity4 's @entity161 turned off its lights in a symbolic rejection of the rally taking place in its shadow
@entity168 , a @entity140 analyst with the @entity169 , told @entity0 that the @entity17 's message resonated only in the @entity39 area , where its ideas had fallen on " particularly fertile soil
" " these protests are not so much fueled by fear of @entity123 and fear of @entity178 attacks , but by frustration at the cost of reunification -- about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the @entity185 , " @entity168 said
@entity39 already had a well - established network of right - wing extremists before @entity17 's emergence , he said
" it 's more a case of @entity191 not entirely feeling at home in @entity4 , " @entity168 said
" there is a feeling of second - class citizenship , and in order to be heard , many @entity191 take to radical measures
" @entity0 's @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .
