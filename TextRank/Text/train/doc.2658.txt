@entity0 -- the captain of the @entity4 did not " fall " into a lifeboat after the ship hit rocks , as he contends , a crew member testified
instead , @entity10 " jumped into the lifeboat , " @entity8 said
@entity11 is on trial in @entity13 on charges of manslaughter and abandoning ship after 32 people died in the shipwreck off the @entity20 island of @entity21 on january 13 , 2012
@entity8 , who was on the bridge when the ship hit the outcropping , testified that @entity11 's reaction was , " what have i done ? ! " as part of his defense for the abandoning ship charge , @entity11 has maintained that by the time he left the crippled vessel , the inclination made it impossible to stay on the ship
he told the court at a hearing in october that the ship was literally falling on top of him and he fell into the lifeboat
the ship ended up lying on its side
interactive : how ill - fated cruise liner was raised from @entity43 seabed @entity8 , who followed @entity11 off the ship , testified monday that he did not see passengers when they left the vessel , even though more than 1,000 people were later rescued from the ship
in a taped conversation between the captain and the port authority in @entity53 , the port authority ordered @entity11 to " get back on board " while passengers were still being rescued from the other side of the ship
@entity11 , who admits that he was in command when the ship veered off course and hit the rocks , also blames a malfunction of the ship 's watertight doors for making the situation worse
his defense lawyers say that created a new emergency after the initial accident
on tuesday , the court heard testimony from @entity70 , a technician who was working in the engine room when @entity11 hit the rocks
the court heard a taped call from @entity70 and the bridge in which he is heard saying that " something " had ripped a 70 - meter ( 230 - foot ) gash in the hull and warning that the engine rooms were flooding
" a 10 - foot jet of water hit my back , " @entity70 told the court
he said he then closed the watertight doors but the " water infiltrated " the seals
if the watertight doors had functioned , @entity11 's defense maintains , the ship would have stayed upright and afloat despite the fact that it had picked up an 80 - ton boulder from the seabed
after losing power , the @entity4 glided past the port of @entity21 and then made a 180 - degree turn back toward the port before capsizing
@entity70 said he narrowly escaped the flooded engine rooms
" i opened other doors but the water kept rising , " he told the court before describing how he and another technician escaped to the upper control platform and the engine room flooded
the court also heard an intercepted telephone conversation a week after the accident in which @entity70 said that @entity11 seemed oblivious to the gravity of the situation
" he did n't understand the situation
we were idiots and he did n't give a damn if we died , " @entity70 said
after tuesday 's testimony from crew members , the trial will resume next week with testimony from traumatized passengers who survived the incident
@entity11 is expected to testify before the end of the year
@entity11 argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people , not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32
in addition to blaming the watertight doors , the captain 's attorneys also say the ship would not have crashed had the helmsman turned it in the direction that @entity11 told him to 13 seconds before impact
the helmsman , @entity131 , and four others were convicted in a plea deal in july for their role in the disaster
a @entity137 court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements .
