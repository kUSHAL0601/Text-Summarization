-- world number one @entity2 has sensationally been knocked out of the @entity3
the 2011 champion was beaten in the semi final in four sets by @entity8 's @entity7 6 - 4 , 1 - 6 , 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) , 6 - 3 in what must go down as one of the biggest shocks of the modern era
in staggeringly humid conditions @entity7 , who has been coached by former @entity14 player @entity13 , burst out of the blocks and snatched the first set
@entity2 battled back to easily win the second
with the @entity21 ascendant , few gave @entity7 a chance against a player in his pomp who is considered one of the greatest of all time
but @entity2 was clearly struggling with the conditions and gave up a succession of unforced errors and a string of uncharacteristic double faults
humid conditions the match changed in the third set when it became clear that @entity7 was coping better with the heat , despite coming through two previous five set matches
the @entity8 player won a third set tie break 7 - 4 before breaking @entity2 's serve in the first game of the fourth
a tiring @entity2 could do nothing to stop @entity7 , who powered on and became the first @entity8 player , as well as the first @entity44 male player , to ever reach a grand slam final
" i do n't know whats going on , i was a little tired , " an ecstatic and emotional @entity7 said on court shortly after his stunning victory
" it 's my first semi final in a grand slam
it is an amazing feeling playing a number one player
it was really tough conditions today
but i love to play long matches ! i hope i can recover well for the final
" although no one gave @entity7 a hope before the match , there were signs that @entity8 's number one could spring a surprise after recently beating @entity63 and narrowly losing to @entity64
equally as significant has been his teaming up with @entity13
" he 's been helping me a lot , " @entity7 said when asked about @entity13 's influence on his game
" we have been working super well
" a dejected @entity2 refused to blame the conditions for his defeat
" it was the same for both players , " he said
he was the better player today ... my game today was not even close to what i wanted it to be
a lot of unforced errors
" ghosts of ' 33 @entity7 was the first @entity8 player to reach a major semi final for 81 years
the last player to reach that level was @entity84 , who reached five major semifinals , including @entity86 in 1933
but later that year @entity84 committed suicide after jumping off the ship that was taking him and his teammates to @entity90 for a @entity92 tie
@entity7 's victory saw him surpass @entity84 's long running record
" i hope it 's big news in @entity8 , " he said
" i feel the support from @entity8
it is 4am in the morning but i hope a lot of people are watching
" @entity7 will play @entity101 in the final after the @entity103 blew @entity63 away in straight sets 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4
the day 's second semi final was delayed by rain , but when it restarted @entity63 must have wished for the heavens to open once again
@entity101 attacked from the opening game , using his booming serve to devastating effect
" it was an amazing day for me , to be able to play like this , it was the best performance ever in my career , " @entity101 said on court after the game
it will be a first grand slam final for both @entity101 and @entity7
" i think it will be a sensational day for both of us , " @entity101 said when asked about his @entity8 opponent
" i 'm just going to enjoy it , be happy and try to win
" the 2014 @entity3 final will the first since the @entity123 in 2005 to not feature one of the big four of @entity2 , @entity63 , @entity64 or @entity127 .
