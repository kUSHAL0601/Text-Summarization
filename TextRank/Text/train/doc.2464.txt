@entity1 's current president @entity0 has conceded defeat to rival @entity4 in the country 's presidential election , bringing an end to a decade of leadership increasingly criticized as corrupt and nepotistic
@entity0 acknowledged the defeat on his official @entity12 account friday , writing : " i value and respect our democratic process and the people 's verdict , and look forward to the peaceful transition of power
" @entity4 would be sworn in at 6 p.m. local time in @entity20 's @entity19 , @entity21 , the head of his media unit , said
the defeat of the once untouchable president , the longest - serving political leader in the region , was the result of a failed electoral gamble
in november , the 69 - year - old called elections two years earlier than required , only to be shocked by the defection of many key political allies , including the man who would unseat him
the defections apparently wrong - footed @entity0 , and the opposition had the better of the campaign , say analysts
" he did n't expect the candidate to be @entity4 , " said @entity39 , executive director of @entity1 's @entity40
" i think he probably underestimated the disaffection in the country and the desire for change
" unexpected departure @entity4 , 63 , served as general - secretary of @entity0 's @entity50 and health minister in his cabinet , before switching allegiance to a broad opposition alliance that proved to be the former president 's most serious political challenge
the unwieldy coalition includes the center - right @entity58 , the hardline @entity60 as well as parties representing the substantial @entity62 and @entity64 minorities
the alliance could prove fractious as @entity4 pursues his ambitious agenda , said political scientist @entity67
" @entity4 not only has this coalition to hold together , he has to do so having promised a fast - track program of drastic political reform , " he said
" one does n't know how this coalition will handle that
" during a campaign focused on @entity0 's perceived nepotism and dynastic urges , @entity4 pledged to weaken the powers of the presidency , crack down on corruption and hold fresh parliamentary election within 100 days
' heartland appeal ' a former @entity80 , @entity4 was jailed as a young political activist , before being entering mainstream politics and being elected as a parliamentarian in 1989
the farmer - turned - politician comes from a humble background in the rice - producing @entity86 -- credentials that appealed to @entity0 's political base in the @entity90 heartland , said @entity67
" he 's a @entity92 from a peasant background -- you could n't get more mainstream than that in @entity1 politics , " he said
" he 's someone that the @entity90 would trust
" but he also had the overwhelming backing of the country 's substantial @entity62 and @entity64 minorities , who had been alienated by @entity0 's perceived failure to advance national reconciliation efforts in the wake of the country 's decades - long civil war , and perceived tolerance of hardline @entity109 extremists blamed for stoking @entity111 violence

the victory remained his main political asset , contributing to a " rock star appeal , " said @entity128
but in recent years , the luster seemed to have faded for voters , with criticisms that his presidency had become increasingly authoritarian , power - hungry and dynastic
three of @entity0 's brothers occupied powerful positions : @entity138 as the minister of economic development , @entity139 as defense secretary and @entity141 as the speaker of parliament
following his 2010 reelection , in which he earned 58 % of the vote , an emboldened @entity0 amended the constitution to concentrate power in the presidential office and remove term limits , allowing for a tilt at an unprecedented third term
many @entity1 felt the move excessive , said @entity39
" they want the force of the executive president trimmed or abolished
" congratulations flow world leaders were quick to offer their congratulations to the incoming president
@entity160 prime minister @entity159 tweeted that he had called @entity4 , and congratulated " the people of @entity1 on the peaceful & democratic poll process
" @entity164 secretary of state @entity163 congratulated @entity0 on accepting the results " in the proud tradition of peaceful and orderly transfers of power , " and said he looked forward to working with @entity4 on implementing his platform of building a " @entity1 that is peaceful , inclusive , democratic , and prosperous
" @entity128 said there was a sense of satisfaction in @entity1 that , five years after the end of a decades - long civil war , the country had witnessed a smooth transfer of power
" that 's something that any society can be proud of , " he said
@entity2 's @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this story .
