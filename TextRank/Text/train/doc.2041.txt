@entity1 , @entity0 -- it may look like an air mattress you might see lying around next to a swimming pool but in reality its function could n't be less trivial
the @entity9 could play a major role in saving lives in the developing world
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) -- a new portable water purifier -- could be a major step forward in the fight against disease and mortality in the @entity18
@entity19 , a @entity20 - based architect and the inventor of the @entity9 believes the product could help eradicate the scourge of polluted water which the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) estimate claims over 1.5 million lives every year
not only does it purify water -- up to 20 liters -- it makes it more portable in large quantities -- a vital dual role in @entity32 and parts of @entity34 where access to clean water is often scarce
" there are lots of products that do one or the other , " @entity36 told @entity2
" there 's a really interesting product that 's been around for 10 or 12 years called the @entity42 -- a 20 gallon drum with a handle attached that allows people -- mostly women -- to transport a week 's worth of water back home "
@entity36 also points to another product developed by the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) that has successfully tackled water impurities
according to @entity54 ( @entity53 ) is already used by more than two million in over 30 countries
" the idea of @entity9 , " he says , " is to combine these two products and make them into something that can do both roles effectively "
made out of a top layer of recycled low - density polyethylene ( @entity63 ) and a bottom layer of durable rubberized nylon , the @entity9 is both flexible and robust
its design was morphologically inspired by the saguaro cactus and is adaptable to a variety of situations -- as a wrap to carry or placed on the roof of a mud hut -- and is easy to store
the @entity9 uses passive solar radiation -- a water sterilizing method approved by @entity25 -- which disrupts the reproduction of microorganisms
@entity78 and @entity80 radiation from the sun pass through the @entity63 layer and into the water cavity and are reflected back by the bottom layer of nylon
on a sunny day purification takes five hours
@entity36 admits that its performance is hampered by its low density -- scratches to the surface mean it does n't transmit the sun 's rays as effectively -- but he is confident that this can be overcome with more research
production using a @entity99 equipment may be relatively expensive but @entity36 says that the raw materials are cheap and the labor is inexpensive
" we are trying to imagine ways that this thing can be made and repaired by people where it is most needed , " he said
" we are working on a sheet welding process which is much lower tech , inexpensive and also capitalizes on the handcraft skills of local people "
what started out as a solo effort a little over a year ago has gradually grown into a collaborative project
@entity36 's students at the @entity117 , where he currently teaches -- he moves to a new post at @entity120 this fall -- have lent their enthusiasm and experts from the bioscience and textile industries are increasingly coming on board
@entity36 's efforts have already been recognized
the @entity9 won first prize in the 2008 @entity128 run by @entity129 -- netting him $ 10,000 -- and he is waiting for conformation that the invention has been selected for @entity135 's @entity134 show which takes place in @entity137 later this year
so what next for @entity36 and his invention ? the aim is to adapt the original design and turn it from a water carrying wrap into a fully fledged coat and he 's also looking at ways the material might be redrawn as a tent
he 's currently in the process of trying to qualify for non-profit status
and with the likes of the @entity152 and other institutions out there , he thinks the prospects for funding development and deployment look promising .
