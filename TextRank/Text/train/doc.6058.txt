-- after 40 years of appearing on the silver screen , actor @entity1 is the elder statesman of @entity4 cinema and is possibly the most recognized man in @entity4
the @entity1 : the patriarch of @entity4 cinema has appeared in over 180 films
born to a famous @entity4 poet , @entity1 made his screen debut at the age of 27 and has gone on to star in over 180 films
as such an established star he has seen @entity4 film making change over the years , weathered changing audience tastes and the evolution of @entity17 cinema
" i 'm actually very happy with our content
even though we were ridiculed , and the @entity20 were very cynical about the way we made our films and the content that it contained , " he told @entity0
" but that very aspect has now become its @entity26 ( unique selling point ) almost , and people love to see that
i would not want to change that
i would expect that this is how and what our cinema is all about
" if @entity4 films have gained a new found international interest , the way that @entity4 films are produced has also changed
from the industry 's alleged connection to organized crime to better production quality , @entity1 has worked within the system and at the sharp end of making movies
" we have our own modes of working and how does one actually decipher that the person that you 're working with has some kind of an underground link ? you know , ' i am mafia ' does n't come written on somebody 's forehead
" whether he , you know , collects his money from wherever it is ... is really not our concern
we are interested the story , the concept , in our roles , the director who 's going to be making it , in the creative aspect
that 's it , " he said
the role that propelled him to superstardom was of a working class hero standing up to oppression and injustice in the 1975 film " @entity73 "
" during the 1970s there was a feeling of great dissatisfaction in the youth that the establishment of the system is not doing enough to take care of their issues and problems
when one individual stood out and challenged the system and came out victorious he suddenly became a hero , " he told @entity0
" i fortunately happened to be the actor that they chose to represent that kind of philosophy or thinking
and therefore i became a beneficiary
" from being the " angry young man " of cinema in @entity4 he is now more commonly known as " the @entity1 " to the media and his millions of fans
but being such a public figure has never been a problem ; @entity1 writes a daily blog and believes that it 's in an actor 's make - up to thrive in public attention and that stars should be able to deal with praise as well as criticism
" i think we all live to be recognized ... creativity would be useless if no one ever saw it or recognized it
we want our work to be known
" i enjoy my blog greatly because i invite comment
not all of them are complimentary , many of them are abusive , but i never moderate it because i think it 's important to know what the rest of the world actually thinks about you
" taking the good with the bad , @entity1 was recently criticized for reportedly being less than impressed by @entity126 's @entity125 - winning film , " @entity127
" but says @entity1 the unnecessary controversy was because of comments from readers on his blog had been mistakenly attributed to him
" i was wrongly accused
i did get to see the film
i thought it was a very well made film , great story , " he told @entity0
if " @entity127 " illustrates current interest in @entity4 films by the @entity20 , @entity4 movies have also developed in ways more familiar to @entity140 movies
" life has become a lot faster
we 've had to move with the times and adjust
if you were to analyze an indie film of the 1970s ... there would be far , far less editing cuts of , say , a film that was released in 2009
that philosophy [ from tv editing ] , for some peculiar reason , has now translated into the minds of the audiences and they expect the same kind of treatment when they go out to see a movie , " he told @entity0 .
