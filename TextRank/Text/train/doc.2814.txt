-- the mother of @entity2 , an 11 - month old @entity4 girl missing for nearly two weeks , said in an interview she was drunk the night the infant disappeared
@entity2 made the admission during an @entity9 interview , portions of which were aired monday on " today
" she also said she last saw @entity13 at 6:40 p.m. october 3 , when she put the girl to bed , not at 10:30 p.m. , as initially believed
@entity13 was reported missing at 4 a.m. october 4 , after @entity13 's father , @entity2 , came home from work to find the door unlocked , lights on and a window that had been tampered with at the family 's @entity22 home
@entity25 told @entity9 she is afraid she will be arrested
police have accused her of killing @entity13 , she said , and told her that she failed a lie detector test , with deception indicated when she was asked where @entity13 was
" i was the last one with her , " a tearful @entity25 said in the interview
" and from judging on how the questioning went , that 's kind of a fear that i have
and the main fear with that is , if they arrest me , people are going to stop looking for her
and then i 'll never see her again , and i 'll never know what happened
" asked how much she had been drinking that night , @entity25 said , " enough to be drunk
" but she rejected the notion that she could have harmed her daughter while under the influence of alcohol
" no , no , no , " she told @entity9
" and if i thought there was a chance , i 'd say it
no. no. i do n't think alcohol changes a person enough to do something like that
" she said it 's " terrible " that police may be focusing on her
" my daughter is missing , " she said
" the last thing that i want to have to worry about is something like that
i should n't have to put any energy , any time or effort , into anything but finding her
" asked whether he had questions about @entity25 , @entity63 told @entity9 , " no. there 's no question to be had there
i know who she is
i know the kind of mother she is
" he said it 's possible someone could have entered the house without @entity25 hearing , as the couple 's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from @entity13 's room and @entity25 sleeps with a fan at high speed
police have said three cell phones were also missing from the home along with @entity13
on sunday , @entity4 gov. @entity86 ordered the one - day deployment of 25 @entity88 to help search for @entity13
two anonymous benefactors have offered a $ 100,000 reward for @entity13 's safe return , according to @entity93 , a private investigator working with the family
@entity63 and @entity25 told @entity9 they have refused to let authorities re-interview @entity13 's older brothers
" they said they heard noises ( the night @entity13 disappeared ) , " @entity25 said
" i do n't know if that was before we went to sleep or after
" she said she has not talked to her sons about it because she is reluctant to put them through " anything else
" asked what she would say to someone who might be holding @entity13 , @entity25 told @entity9 , " she needs her family , and we need her
we 're losing more sanity as each day progresses
" @entity13 is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair , according to police
she weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it
the missing girl has two bottom teeth and a " beauty mark " on her right outer thigh , police said
at the time of her disappearance , she had a cold with a cough .
