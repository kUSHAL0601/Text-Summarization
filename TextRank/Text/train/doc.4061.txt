-- can you remember what you were doing 30 years ago ? in 1983 , @entity3 retired from a glittering tennis career , the @entity6 @entity5 was officially charged with war crimes and the final episode of @entity9 was breaking tv records
more importantly , for the purpose of this exercise , millions of black and " non-white " @entity11 were living -- and dying -- in misery under a brutal apartheid regime
whatever you were doing back then , i would think it unlikely that any single decision you made has shaped what has become of your life since
that 's not the case , however , for the young black cricketers that left the @entity26 to play in @entity11
for them , everything changed the day they boarded a plane for @entity31
they are the focus of @entity0 's documentary " @entity35 : branded a rebel
" in 1977 , the @entity38 nations added a sporting ban to their campaign against apartheid in @entity11
by isolating the country 's teams and starving passionate and influential @entity11 of their beloved sport , it was hoped their government would be forced into changing policies that discriminated against a majority of the population
as a result , cricket 's " @entity55 " were highly controversial , unofficial , international matches that were organized in defiance of those sanctions
it was an issue that split the world 's cricket community right down the middle
the invited players that declined , such as @entity64 's @entity63 and @entity66 @entity65 , took a strong moral stance in opposition
contact ' branded as a rebel ' presenter @entity69 on @entity71 but , whether from @entity64 , @entity72 or @entity73 , the massive financial inducements were often too much even for some of the sport 's biggest names to refuse
for each of the seven tours , there was outcry , but it was the @entity83 ' role that provoked the most outrage
these men did n't steal anything -- they certainly did n't kill anyone -- and they did n't break any laws , but their " crime " was almost worse
they were condemned for supporting an abhorrent , racist regime ; effectively betraying their own race
ironically , it was they who were isolated
they were banished from playing international sport and shunned by their peers and communities ; many were forced to relocate abroad
only one ever played for the @entity83 again
hardly anything has been written or broadcast about their two tours between 1982 - 84 , a period which has been described as one of the darkest chapters in the history of cricket
whatever views have been articulated are typically negative , damning and highly critical of the players and those who funded and organized the matches
the common narrative is that they were mercenaries , traitors and rebels
but while the players ca n't deny that many were influenced by the money -- some were paid in excess of $ 100,000 for a month of cricket -- some would prefer to be known as missionaries
i knew it would n't be easy getting them to talk about their experience , just tracking them down was hard enough
for obvious reasons the @entity132 , which had banned them , was n't much use
some of the players like @entity137 and @entity138 -- known to have struggled with substance abuse -- have effectively fallen off the grid
trying to forget of those we tracked down , it soon became clear very few had any interest in reliving the experience
it was n't the tours that they did n't want to revisit , but the judgment and condemnation they had endured since
some players flatly declined , others wanted to be paid outrageous sums ; @entity0 's policy is not to pay for interviews
over a period of several weeks , myself and our producer @entity158 had a series of exhaustive exchanges with the team 's captain @entity163 , a talented batsman who was forced to leave @entity165 and settle in @entity166
we really thought he was close to giving an interview but ultimately he declined
i know he desperately wanted to tell his side of the story , a side which has never been heard before , but he was concerned his involvement would only reignite the controversy
he just could n't take the risk
i would say that the players who did speak with us had mixed reasons for giving their interviews
@entity179 is known as the greatest player never to have played for the @entity83 , but he is proud of his involvement
he still treasures his tour blazer and the team photo sits proudly on his shelf
he genuinely believes that the tours helped to change attitudes in @entity11 , claiming that for the first time in their lives , white fans were able to see that the black race was at the very least equal , if not superior , to theirs
of all the rebel teams , the @entity83 were the only one to win a test match in @entity11
@entity66 society 's ' running wound ' @entity194 , a hero of the @entity83 ' 1979 @entity196 final victory , felt the same
he was still angry at his treatment and we did n't have to scratch too far beneath the surface to find the bitterness still simmering
i believe that both men and the former wicketkeeper @entity203 talked to us because they did n't have anything else to lose -- whatever the tour had once cost them , being associated with it could no longer hurt them
that 's not the case for the likes of @entity210
even if he had wanted to share his story with us and a global audience , he has been " rehabilitated " as the current coach of the @entity217 national team
that status could have been jeopardized by reminding everyone he was once a " rebel
" as the regional historian professor @entity222 put it , the rebel tours still represent a " running wound " in @entity66 society
@entity179 , @entity194 and @entity203 all told me they had no regrets
@entity194 was very clear that he would never say sorry for going to @entity11
others have apologized , in the hope the controversy would be laid to rest
it will be interesting to see the reaction to our program ; whether hearing a different perspective will change perceptions of the fateful decision these players made 30 years ago
and it makes you wonder , if you were ever put in their position , what would you do ?
