-- @entity2 's exceptional abilities are hard to spot at first
she 's an adorably cute 5 - year - old girl from southern @entity3 , small , pretty with big brown eyes
to gain her black belt , @entity2 had to learn up to 15 karate moves
when we meet for our interview , her hair is tied up in two pigtails , with bright hair clips and a glittering headband
she is as shy as most kids her age would be when confronted by a strange man and a television crew
some child stars can be precocious but @entity2 does n't act like one
in fact , it would have been impossible to imagine her as a karate black belt if it was n't for her white martial arts outfit and her actual black belt
like many young girls she would love to be a dancer and she smiles when i tell her that we are doing the interview in a dance studio
it 's got varnished wooden floors and ceiling - high mirrors
the venue was chosen because it looks a bit like a dojo , or martial arts school
i 'm not sure @entity2 understands what a dance studio is and it 's hard to discover her thoughts on many things
she only speaks a few words of @entity43 and , even when we use an interpreter , she has to be prompted by her father before whispering short , quiet responses to my questions
at first i was concerned her dad was feeding her the answers rather than helping her say what she really thinks
however , it soon becomes clear that this is a healthy father - daughter relationship instead of a case of " pushy parents
" @entity56 can be stern with his daughter but she clearly worships him , hanging on his every word and happy to follow his instructions
when the pair practice karate together their movements are surprisingly well synchronized despite the huge difference in size
@entity2 's father is her inspiration
he was @entity3 's karate champion for four successive years from 1999 to 2002
his daughter started watching him teach the sport and , at the age of 2 , she asked to try
@entity56 insists it was @entity2 's idea not his
initially , he only gave her some small training and stretching exercises but @entity72 soon realized that his daughter possessed what he describes as a @entity75 - given talent
@entity56 says what @entity2 has done in 3Â½ years takes most people eight years to learn
to gain her black belt , @entity2 had to learn up to 15 katas
a kata is a sequence of complicated karate moves
@entity2 can punch , kick and wield different weapons : the @entity85 stick , which is almost as big as she is , and a nunchaku , two short sticks connected by a metal chain
there is no doubt that @entity2 's abilities are impressive
you only have to enter the phrase " nunchaku accidents " into @entity93 to see how easily things can go wrong
however , she is no freak of nature
her karate is a feat of memory and technique more than agility and power
to be frank , she could n't beat me up -- although i was obviously far too proud to find out by taking her on in a sparring session
@entity2 trains for at least two hours every day but says she still has time for other games
as well as her dancing , she likes to play football and badminton
she tells me that her friends have all started taking up karate after seeing how good she has become
unlike her friends , @entity2 's gift has given her the chance to see @entity114
she was invited to @entity43 by a @entity116 company to promote a new video game
her trip appears to have been handled carefully , with as much time set aside for sightseeing as media work
the day after we filmed with @entity2 she was due to go on the @entity123 and was very excited about it
@entity2 says she would like to continue her karate in the years ahead
she is a black belt first dan , or grade , and there are 10 grades in total
she is already a mini master but if she makes it to second dan she can start teaching -- just like her father .
