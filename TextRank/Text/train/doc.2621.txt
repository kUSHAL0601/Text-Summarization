-- deep in my heart , i do believe that we shall overcome someday : this is the refrain that guided the hearts and hands and voices of the ' 60s generation
at the @entity12 , april 8 - 10 , the @entity11 will begin -- the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the great 1960s civil rights laws
it was legislation that changed @entity19 forever and for the better
there were four great laws , each building upon the other
the 1964 @entity24 , also known as the @entity25 , ensured that people of color could use the same water fountains , toilets , public transport and seats in restaurants and hotels as white people
the @entity35 ensured people of color the right to vote
the @entity38 made it possible for people of color and all religions to be able to buy a house where they could afford to
the 1968 @entity43 eliminated racial and ethnic quotas
these laws opened the doors of liberty and justice for all as never before
no matter how imperfect they were , they made ours a more just society
for me it was all so very personal
my father , president @entity55 , signed the 1964 @entity56 on my 17th birthday
the only handwritten note i have from my father was his birthday letter written at 12:10 p.m. that day
@entity61 did n't have time to go to the pharmacy to buy a @entity65 card
at 6 p.m. , he was signing a bill into law that would liberate my generation from the shackles of legalized apartheid
it was the best birthday present anyone could ever receive
many doubt 1964 @entity56 could pass today when i questioned why he gave the first pen used to sign the bill to the @entity78 leader sen. @entity77 instead of one of the great civil rights leaders , he shook his head in disappointment that i had n't gotten the obvious lesson
he told me , " @entity84 , i did n't have to convince one of the great civil rights leaders to be for that legislation
they were already for it
but because of @entity77 's decision to support this law and bring his supporters with him , the great civil rights leaders and i have a law , not just a bill
that 's why @entity77 got the pen
" when i questioned why we had gone to the @entity99 for the signing , @entity61 shook his head in disappointment again
" @entity84 , we have to go to the @entity99 of the @entity102
" there will be many brave men and women not returning to these hallowed halls because of their courageous stand for voting rights
and there are many brave men and women who will be able to serve here only because of the courage of this @entity114
that 's why we must go to the @entity99 to let the world know how grateful we are to this @entity114
" i was on " daddy duty " on august 6 , 1965 , and stood behind him in the @entity99 as he signed the @entity35 into law
that day he taught me not only about the justice of the act ; he taught me the importance of his favorite biblical passage , " come , let us reason together
" these lessons of social justice have changed our country forever , for the better , although their work is far from done
the lessons of coming and reasoning together remain a cry we need to answer now more than ever
it was all so very personal
i grew up in @entity132 in an area fondly known as " @entity134
" we lived in " @entity135 " because there were no restrictive covenants as there were in other areas that discriminated against buyers based on their color or religion
my first employer and forever friend was one of the first @entity146 able to buy a home in what had been a restricted neighborhood
the @entity38 was not just a bill for justice to me
it was all so very personal
there are 25 members in my immediate family
we are of mixed race , mixed ethnicities , many nationalities
we are @entity158 , protestants , @entity146 and others
we are a family of immigrants with all the diversity that @entity55 celebrated
at the head of the stairs in the @entity12 is one of my favorite quotes of my father
" until justice is blind to color , until education is unaware of race , until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men 's skins , emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact
" much was accomplished when our nation " came and reasoned together
" but there are still laws that make it harder for the poor to have access to the voting booth
and there are laws that still exist that bar equality based on whom you love
there remains much to be done
generations of @entity193 are so grateful that four presidents are coming to the @entity12 to celebrate this civil rights 50th anniversary with a new generation committed to social justice
it is our hope that by coming and reasoning together once more , we can renew our commitment to making ours a country " blind to color , where education is unaware of race and opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men 's skins
" only then will our proclamation for emancipation become a fact
only then will we overcome the bondage of social injustice that hurts us all
but with a new renewal to the needs of social justice , i do believe , deep in my heart that we shall overcome someday !
