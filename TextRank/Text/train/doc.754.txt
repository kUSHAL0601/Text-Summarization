-- after two weekends atop the box office , " @entity3 " was thwarted by a pair of newcomers , " immortals " and " @entity7 , " both of which opened to solid numbers
" @entity16 " was n't quite as fortunate , but overall , the box office exhibited life like it has n't for the past few months , and the top ten ticked up 18 percent over the same weekend last year -- a good sign headed into @entity15
check out all the details below : relativity 's " immortals " became the new box office titan , fending off competition and scoring a strong $ 32 million opening
while that number pales in comparison to the openings of 300 ( $ 70.8 million ) and " @entity27 " ( $ 61.2 mil ) , it puts " immortals " ahead of other swords - and - sandals debuts like " @entity29 " ( $ 30.1 mil ) and " @entity30 " ( 13.7 mil )
the @entity33 - directed visual feast , which stars @entity34 and @entity35 , also revives the ancient epic genre 's viability in 2011 after flop openings from " @entity39 " ( $ 8.7 mil ) and " @entity40 " ( $ 10 mil )
for @entity22 , a $ 32 million debut ( 66 percent of which came from 3 - d screens ) is a major win
the studio spent a surprisingly small $ 75 million on the film , and a rep told me on friday that they were hoping for a $ 25 - 26 million start
now , @entity22 is hoping that broad appeal will continue to drive attendance
the studio 's exit polling reveals that " @entity55 " audience was 60/40 percent male / female and ethnically diverse as well -- 35 percent @entity58 , 30 percent @entity56 , 13 percent @entity59 , and 12 percent @entity60
according to @entity72 , @entity22 's president of @entity73 , " a lot of people are enjoying the picture , and when you look down the road going into the holidays , there 's just nothing for the action fans , so i think that 's good for us
" but will the film actually continue to perform well into the @entity15 holiday ? that could be difficult
" @entity55 " looks like it may already be suffering from the fanboy effect , which occurs when eager sci - fi fans rush out to the theater en masse on opening night , thereby inflating numbers on the front end of a film 's box office run
this can often lead precipitous drops in the days / weeks that follow
just look at " @entity55 ' " weekend trajectory : the flick earned $ 15 million on friday , followed by a 32 percent drop to $ 10.2 million on saturday ( while the rest of the @entity93 increased by an average of 8 percent ) , followed by a more - standard 33 percent decline to $ 6.8 million on sunday
@entity72 attributes the large friday - to - saturday drop to the fact that @entity98 fell on a friday
he claims that with kids out of school all day , fridays numbers were boosted substantially
we 'll have to wait and see how " immortals , " which earned an alright " b " @entity105 grade , does in the weeks to come
in second place ( for now ) was @entity108 's latest comedy , " @entity7 , " which scored a $ 26 million debut out of 3,438 theaters -- good for a $ 7,563 per theater average
@entity113 's $ 80 million picture performed within expectations , but when compared to the rest of @entity108 's bawdy mainstream comedy wheelhouse , this is one of his poorer results , and his worst live - action comedic opening ( not including 2009â € ²s death - themed dramedy " @entity122 " ) since " @entity124 " 's $ 16.1 million bow in 2000
" @entity7 " received atrocious reviews , and while those have never stopped @entity108 's films from succeeding in the past , there is a sense that the summation of so many truly awful critical reactions back - to - back - to - back -- when not balanced by winking affection for lovably dumb films like " @entity134 " and " @entity135 " -- may actually be hurting @entity108 's golden box office record
that being said , it 's too soon to write off " @entity7
" working in the cross-dressing comedy 's favor is a family - friendly pg - rating , which could help " @entity7 " hold nicely with parents and children as we move into the extra-lucrative holidays -- although " @entity147 , " " @entity148 , " " the @entity149 , " and " @entity150 " will provide ample competition
but the comedy , which received a fair " b " @entity105 grade , will have to work very hard to reach the $ 100 million plateau that @entity108 is so used to
after two weekends in first place , " @entity3 " settled for third ( though it may swap places with " @entity7 " once final results are released tomorrow ) with an estimated $ 25.5 million
the " @entity161 " spin - off only dropped 3 percent last weekend , and this time around , " @entity3 " scored another terrific 23 percent decline
the $ 130 million @entity164 picture , which looked like a bust when it opened , has now earned a robust $ 103 million
with a @entity15 boost , " @entity3 " should march right past the $ 160 million mark with ease
" @entity173 " drooped 45 percent this weekend to $ 13.2 million , giving the $ 85 million @entity171 caper a ten - day total of $ 43.9 million
the one - two punch of @entity177 's @entity176 ousting and " @entity173 " 's underperformance have certainly taken the director down a few notches this week
rounding out the top 5 was @entity183 ' $ 35 million biopic " @entity16
" the @entity185 film , which stars @entity186 as infamous @entity188 figurehead @entity187 , earned $ 11.5 million out of 1,910 theaters , giving it a solid $ 6,005 venue average
the tepidly reviewed drama opened slightly below @entity185 's last tepidly reviewed drama , " hereafter , " which earned $ 12 million in its first opening weekend last year
" @entity16 " may finish in the same range as " hereafter , " which grossed $ 32.7 million total
the film played much like @entity186 's 2008 misfire " @entity201 , " another film that paired him with a prestige director ( @entity200 ) , but did n't connect with audiences and opened with $ 12.8 million
for @entity186 , " @entity16 " is no " @entity208 " or " @entity209 , " but the star has always modulated between mainstream crowd - pleasers and smaller , more serious fare , and his star is not in danger
audiences issued " @entity16 " an uninspiring " b " cinemascore grade
in limited release , two films stood out
after being available on - demand for a three weeks , @entity217 's " @entity216 " still debuted with a solid $ 265,000 out of 19 theaters , leading to a $ 13,947 per theater average
meanwhile , @entity219 's directorial effort " @entity223 " has quietly hiked all the way to $ 2.6 million over six weeks ( $ 334,000 from 171 locations this weekend ) , despite never playing in more than 283 theaters
the @entity225 drama is clearly experiencing good word - of - mouth on a small scale , so it will be interesting to see if " @entity223 " 's distributor , @entity230 's @entity229 , pushes the film any harder in an effort to garner awards attention
in milestone news , " @entity238 " has now earned $ 100.8 million after five weekends thanks to its $ 3.6 million frame
it has grossed $ 189 million worldwide against a $ 5 million budget
