@entity0 , @entity1 -- at @entity5 's urging , the @entity3 will hold an emergency meeting sunday morning aimed at defusing simmering tensions in the @entity8
the meeting will take place at 11 a.m. et on sunday , a day after @entity5 had originally wanted to meet , its ambassador to the @entity11 @entity10 said in a statement
@entity10 blamed the @entity16 delegation -- which this month heads up the security council -- for the one - day delay , adding , " we assume that nothing will happen in the interim that would bring about further aggravation
" @entity25 gov. @entity24 , a former prominent @entity16 diplomat now in the middle of an unofficial four - day trip meeting with high - level @entity0 officials , applauded the development as something that could help skirt further military escalation
" it 's a very , very tense situation , a crisis situation , " @entity24 told @entity2 's @entity32 from @entity0
" this is when the @entity3 can be most effective
" the former @entity16 energy secretary and ambassador to the @entity11 met sunday morning for one - and - a - half hours with maj. gen. @entity38 , who leads @entity1 forces in the demilitarized zone along the @entity42 border
he called it a " very tough meeting " that included " some progress
" @entity24 told @entity2 that @entity38 was receptive to his proposal that a military hotline be set up between @entity1 and @entity42 forces , in order to address issues should an incident occur
@entity38 was also open to the governor 's idea for a military commission -- with representatives from @entity1 , @entity42 and the @entity16 -- to monitor disputed areas in and around the @entity56
the goal , @entity24 said , would be to address issues before they flared into larger confrontations
the @entity1 general , separately , told @entity24 that the remains of several hundred @entity16 servicemen killed about six decades ago during the @entity63 had recently been recovered , showing the governor pictures of some of them and a dog tag from one soldier
@entity38 then offered to resume joint recovery efforts with the @entity16
" it was a positive gesture , " @entity24 said
still , the governor said that the @entity3 's meeting on sunday might be an even more significant development when it comes to the regional crisis
he called @entity77 's recent statements on and @entity5 's leadership on the issue a positive -- saying he hoped that the council might issue a statement " urging all sides to exercise maximum restraint ( and to ) cool things down
" the @entity3 has five permanent members in @entity77 , @entity87 , @entity5 , the @entity88 and the @entity16
there are also 10 rotating members , which are currently @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity25 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101
the @entity16 , as well as @entity5 and @entity97 , have been key international players in the crisis , and @entity77 officials have also conducted a series of high - level talks with @entity1 and @entity42 officials
on saturday , @entity77 foreign minister @entity108 reiterated his nation 's strong desire to avert war , which he said would be devastating for both @entity42 nations and the region as a whole , according to state - run news agency @entity115
@entity24 came to @entity1 at the invitation of its top nuclear negotiator as a private citizen -- with the knowledge of but not as a representative of the @entity16 government -- amidst one of the region 's most serious crises since the 1953 @entity63 armistice
@entity1 says that its @entity42 counterparts are instigating tensions with planned live military exercises on and around the disputed @entity130
@entity132 cited bad weather as its reason for pushing back the drills a day or two , which were originally scheduled between december 18 and 21 , @entity42 's official @entity131 reported
saying the exercises would be in " the inviolable territorial waters " of @entity1 , the @entity1 's state - run @entity136 warned saturday that its forces " will deal the second and third unpredictable self - defensive blow " if the drills proceed
such strikes , according to the agency , would be " deadlier ... in terms of the powerfulness and sphere " than its november 23 shelling of @entity130 that left four @entity42 dead
noting that @entity1 is " very , very provoked by this potential incident , " @entity24 said he hoped that a strong statement from the @entity11 council might spur @entity132 to cancel the drills and " give both sides cover " to tamp down their rhetoric and actions
@entity38 was the first non-political official to talk to @entity24 , who earlier said he had a " good meeting " with the @entity1 's chief nuclear negotiator @entity157 and also met with the vice minister of @entity1 's @entity155 on friday
both @entity159 have traded tough talk and conducted aggressive military drills in the weeks after the @entity130 incident
the @entity16 military has said it is concerned that @entity42 's scheduled exercises could spark an uncontrollable clash with the @entity166 , but the @entity167 said the exercises are not meant to be threatening or provocative
@entity2 's @entity169 contributed to this report
watch @entity171 with @entity32 weekdays at 5pm to 8pm et and saturdays at 6pm et. for the latest from @entity172 .
