@entity0 , @entity1 -- luge is a dangerous sport in which accidents happen
that was the refrain from athlete after athlete when asked how they felt about the death of @entity12 luger @entity11 , who was killed when he flew off the @entity14 track during training in @entity16 on friday
but luge athletes will be the first to tell you they are more driving technicians than adrenaline junkies , and when pressed about why they would participate in a sport that 's so dangerous , several concede they do n't consider the sport to be that risky
amidst the shock at the death of a young athlete , the fact has been lost that in the hands -- and feet -- of masters , luge is relatively safe
a 1997 paper in the @entity31 analyzed luge injuries between 1985 and ' 92 on the @entity33 , @entity34 , luge course , a track that sliders consider to be technically trickier , though slower , than @entity16
the conclusion was that luge on that difficult track is remarkably safe
with " injury rates comparable with recreational skiing , " the study says , " the sport of luge is quite safe ... despite the appearance of danger
" the study analyzed 57,244 runs by competitive , or training to be competitive , men and women from 12 - to 35 - years - old
the vast majority of those were bruises , scrapes and muscle strains
luge is rough on the back and neck muscles
during the seven years , a mere 10 injuries were serious enough , like a broken bone , to force the athlete to miss a week or more of practice
according to the study , athletes were more likely to get hurt away from the track while carrying their sleds than to suffer a major injury on it
the grand total of concussions recorded was 10
a six - year study of the @entity77 found , conservatively , that a concussion happened about every other game
because 16 games are played on the opening @entity77 weekend , concussions during pro football should surpass seven years of @entity33 luge in week 2 of the season
and never mind boxing , where athletes are occasionally killed , and the actual goal is to physically insult the brain of a competitor until he or she is unable to stand
it 's a discrepancy that @entity93 luge coach @entity92 , who was angered that the men 's race was moved to the lower women 's start after @entity11 's death , was quick to address
the speed of race cars is not reduced every time a professional driver crashes and dies , he said
for that matter , nor are speed limits on roads , where 37,261 people in the @entity106 died in crashes in 2008
that said , nothing would be wrong with reducing speeds at the @entity16 course ; the sport is just as exciting for fans at 80 mph as at 90 mph
as for the @entity33 luge analysis , study author dr. @entity114 , an orthopedic surgeon in @entity115 , @entity116 , said different tracks have different hazards
( @entity114 was a competitive luger himself , and said he never suffered a serious injury
) much was made of the @entity16 track being the world 's fastest after a @entity124 slider topped 95 mph on it last year
@entity11 was going 88 mph when he crashed
and yet , in the three years of its existence , the @entity16 track 's crash stats are in line with other tracks around the world , according to officials from the @entity135
out of more than 30,000 runs in the three sliding sports -- bobsled , luge and skeleton -- @entity16 has seen 340 crashes
lugers and coaches at the @entity14 said that they 've never seen an athlete fly off the course entirely , as @entity11 did
" everything came together at the same time , " said @entity146 , a @entity106 luger who finished eighth on sunday , " but there are places on every track where that could feasibly happen
" for another view , click here but it essentially does n't happen
this was a terrible , terrible , freak accident
@entity106 luge coach @entity157 says he has n't seen an athlete fly off a course in his 35 years in the sport
that is n't to say that the modifications in @entity16 -- the ice on curve 16 was shaved to make it harder for sleds to go up the wall , a new retaining wall was put in place and a lower start is being used -- are not perfectly prudent
perhaps retaining walls should be put along every curve at every track in the world
even the athletes who were upset at the change of their starting spots said the luge federation had to show the world how serious it is about safety
what happened to @entity11 was a tragedy so deeply affecting that athletes who should have been basking in the realization of their @entity14 dreams were frequently choking back tears
still , they agreed that the rush to see every luge run as a gambler 's game of life and death is a characterization that can only be made by those who started following the sport on that tragic friday
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .
