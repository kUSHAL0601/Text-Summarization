@entity0 -- it was a crowning achievement , but he was n't sure that he wanted to be there
he was n't sure he could make it through the speech without running out of the @entity8 chamber in panic
and he did n't know how many of his country 's leaders cared
@entity12 wore his camouflage combat uniform , surrounded by lawmakers , innovators and a few celebrities , and he stepped into a room that would hold the world 's greatest concentration of power per square inch for an hour or so
but the everyday hero just wanted to get through the @entity23 on tuesday night
his seat was next to the door , just in case
the much - coveted invitation came because of his heroism on november 5 , 2009 , when he stopped by the @entity29 at the sprawling @entity31 base at @entity32 , @entity33
moments after military psychiatrist @entity34 opened fire , @entity12 threw himself on top of another soldier , likely saving that man 's life but taking five bullets himself
his wounds still affect him
his eyesight may deteriorate for the rest of his life
but as @entity12 looked out from the @entity8 chamber balcony tuesday night , the biggest potential issues were his mind and fears
" i do n't like being by myself , " he said earlier before the event , pausing
" i do n't trust , it 's hard for me to trust people now
" @entity12 was honored to be at the @entity52 , of course
but logistics dictated that the shy , blue - eyed veteran had to sit with strangers
( each member of @entity57 got one ticket
) and he did n't like that
@entity12 needs to be around people he knows
and after he survived the massacre in the middle of a @entity31 base , he has a hard time trusting security anywhere
the increased measures at the @entity52 actually added to those concerns , raising the idea that this place was especially threatened
but the unassuming man came anyway , battling his post-traumatic stress disorder - instincts out of gratitude to his hometown congressman , @entity74 @entity73 of @entity75 , and to push for what he believes is long overdue recognition for the victims of @entity32
" the @entity81 says it was workplace violence , " @entity12 relayed hours before the @entity23 , sitting on a window bench tucked into a @entity8 office building stairway
" it was a terrorist act ... to me , it seems they 're trying to cover it up , almost as if it never happened the way it did
" there are multiple issues here
under the " workplace violence " designation , benefits are lower than if the attack were considered terrorism or part of an active conflict
victims and families face lower disabled income or death benefits
thirteen people were killed at @entity32
a softer @entity74 side in response to @entity104 @entity12 spoke with determination on this
" it 's not about the money for me
it has nothing to do with the money , " he said
he wants the families to be recognized , for victims to be able to receive purple hearts for their wounds and be afforded all honors appropriate to that at a military burial
but @entity12 and his family believe the vast majority of @entity120 do n't know about their continued battle
and that @entity57 is happy to move on
" there is a bill , @entity124 3111 , to declare @entity32 a terrorist act , but @entity57 ... , " he shakes his head
" @entity127 at the @entity128 was a terrorist attack , but this , no. " @entity34 was convicted last august in a military court of murder and attempted murder
a jury recommended a death sentence
thirteen people were killed at @entity32
a @entity120 - born citizen of @entity137 descent who was preparing to deploy to @entity139 , @entity34 admitted to targeting soldiers
he said at one point that he wanted to protect the @entity142 and its leaders from the @entity120 military
comprehensive coverage : @entity23 investigations after the massacre found he had been communicating via e-mail with @entity150 , an @entity151 - @entity120 radical cleric killed by a @entity120 drone attack in 2011
@entity12 's foot taps as he talks about it , but otherwise his bearing was deeply calm
his injuries rewrote his life
he is no longer allowed to drive
and he lives with his mom , @entity160 , and stepdad , @entity162
the couple sometimes ca n't get the 34 - year - old to leave his room
" before ( coming to @entity0 ) , he spent three days in his bedroom , " @entity160 confided
" he was really nervous
" that bedroom is a safe place , he thinks
to help , @entity160 and @entity162 made the road trip with their son
they stood next to him during interviews
walked beside him down @entity177 's hard marble hallways
for @entity160 , the trip is a part of her son 's recovery and his mission now
" i think it 's time for some of his story to come out , " said @entity160 , who is as feisty and confident as her son is humble and careful
this is the first time @entity12 has ever heard a @entity23 address
but frankly the speech was not his main interest
he was at the @entity52 to represent people who served the military , suffered at the hands of a gunman and who now feel overlooked
when asked what he hopes for himself , the 13 - year veteran gave an answer of recovery
" i do n't know
right now , i 'm hoping for today , " he said
and , it turns out , the day was good
in the teeming @entity8 chamber , @entity12 saw the unexpected -- the face of fellow @entity32 survivor @entity204 , just a few seats away
@entity12 knew his friend was in town , but not where he 'd be during the speech
he did n't need to run
and he could listen as the president and @entity57 honored another surviving soldier -- sgt. @entity213
high up in the balcony , off camera , @entity12 soaked in the wave of cheers
" it was a pretty good night , " he said .
