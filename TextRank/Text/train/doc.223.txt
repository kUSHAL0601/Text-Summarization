-- @entity2 scientists say new data provided by twin spacecraft analyzing the sun will help them more accurately predict how so - called solar tsunamis wreak havoc on our planet
@entity2 says new data on so - called solar tsunamis will help predict how they will affect our planet
the tsunamis -- powerful explosions known as coronal mass ejections , or @entity15 -- produce solar cosmic rays that can interfere with technology , causing power blackouts and disrupting air traffic communications and cell phone networks
@entity2 says images captured by its twin @entity22 , or @entity22 , spacecraft have enabled scientists to map the tsunamis in @entity27 to examine their structure , velocity , mass and direction
the solar ejections , its says , can release billions of tons of high - velocity plasma into space , producing a shockwave that generates cosmic rays which then plow into our atmosphere
these can create the brightly - colored auroras , more commonly known as the @entity44 or @entity45 lights , but also have more damaging effects , posing particular threats to spacecraft and astronauts
solar physicist @entity50 of the @entity51 in @entity52 said the new data from the @entity22 craft -- launched into orbit in october 2006 -- will revolutionize the study of cosmic weather patterns
" before this unique mission , measurements and the subsequent data of a @entity62 observed near the sun had to wait until the ejections arrived at @entity65 three to seven days later , " he said in statement
" now we can see a @entity62 from the time it leaves the solar surface until it reaches @entity65 and we can reconstruct the event in @entity27 directly from the images
