-- six children ages 1 to 7 have been hospitalized for severe gastrointestinal illnesses after swimming this month in an @entity5 indoor water park , a state health official said friday
the children got sick after visiting the @entity7 and @entity8 between june 12 - 18 , said dr. @entity9 , medical officer of the @entity10 at the @entity11
the indoor splash park was closed friday but the park 's other facilities remained open , a park official said
environmental officials will test chemical levels before the splash park will re-open , according to @entity9
" we are continuing to work with the medical community to identify the extent of the problem , " she said
five of the children have been transferred from @entity25 in @entity26 to the @entity27 of @entity5 in @entity28 , where they were being treated with antibiotics , the official said
in a statement , the department of public health urged parents whose children who may have visited the park to contact the health department if they suffer symptoms of nausea , vomiting or severe diarrhea
seven day - care centers took children to the @entity7 and @entity43 for a day camp during the time frame officials have identified as when the water may have been contaminated , the health department said
" we 're recommending any children who did attend the splash park , until we can determine the full extent of the infection , not to swim in inflatable pools , " @entity9 said
she added that such swimming could risk exposing other children to the bacteria
illnesses linked to pools are commonly caused by germs spread through contact with contaminated water , the department said in a news release
@entity64 infections are caused by bacteria that can be found in foods and stool
children often become infected after being exposed to others who are not toilet - trained
" it 's not uncommon for recreational water illnesses to occur , particularly in the summer , because a lot of people are in the pools , " @entity9 said
" children have a tendency to swallow water which is probably why we 're seeing it in a younger group
" the health department warns people not to swim if they have diarrhea ; to avoid swallowing pool or lake water ; and to shower with soap before swimming so that germs and bacteria do not end up in pool water .
