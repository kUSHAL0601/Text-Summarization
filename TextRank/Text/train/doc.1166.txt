-- @entity1 announced saturday that it is grounding 81 planes for inspection following an incident in which one of its flights was forced to make an emergency landing after a 3 - foot hole tore open in the fuselage of the plane
investigators are trying to determine the cause of the " depressurization event " and have " decided to keep a subset of its @entity16 fleet out of the flying schedule to begin an aggressive inspection effort in cooperation with @entity16 engineers , " according to a company statement
" the safety of our customers and @entity26 is our primary concern , and we are grateful there were no serious injuries , " said @entity22 , @entity1 's executive vice president and chief operating officer
the plane managed to land safely at a military base in @entity33 , @entity34 on friday , where authorities " discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft , " the company said earlier
meanwhile , passengers who were aboard the crippled the @entity16 said they had feared for their lives
" we were in shock , " passenger @entity41 told @entity0 saturday
" we were in row 16 and my husband and i could see blue sky ... the wiring , the cabling
" a lot of people were crying and holding hands " but had trouble hearing due to the noise of air rushing through the plane 's opening
" it was very , very scary
" " i heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us , " passenger @entity58 said
" ( then ) a big explosion happened
a big noise , and from there , you felt some of the air being sucked out
it happened right behind me , in the row behind me and it covers about two - and - a - half rows , " he said from seat @entity67
@entity58 , 41 , a regional sales manager for a biotech company , was flying home to @entity72 , @entity73 , from a business trip
some people panicked and screamed as the blue sky and sun began to shine through the cabin in mid-flight , he said
" most people were just white knuckles holding onto the arm rests
the pilots did a great job and were under control to get us to a manageable level , " he said
but just behind him , @entity58 said he could see the jagged edge of the aircraft where the rivets used to be
" you can see the insulation and wiring
the interior ceiling panel was bouncing up and down with the air , " he said
" it was surreal , when you 're riding in a modern aircraft
you 're used to being enclosed and not having the window rolled down , " he said
@entity58 described the hole as being about 3 or 4 feet long and about a foot wide
passenger @entity103 told @entity0 affiliates @entity106 and @entity107 she began to fear for her life
" i was texting my sister to make certain that she told my kids that i loved them , " @entity103 said

" we do not know the cause of the decompression , " said @entity119 of the @entity114
@entity58 said the incident took place about 35 minutes into the flight
he says that it took about 45 seconds or a minute before the oxygen masks came down after the hole blew open
" the crew was pretty calm about it
they walked around and checked on everyone , " he said
" but it was n't like the movies where papers get sucked out of the hole , but you could feel it and hear the noise
" @entity58 said that most of the passengers were complaining of a pain in their eardrums from a rapid descent
@entity1 said only one injury was reported
" there are no reported customer injuries , " according to a statement released by the airline
" one of the flight attendants , however , received a minor injury upon descent
" @entity58 said one male flight attendant appeared to fall and was bleeding from a facial injury
@entity158 spokeswoman gen @entity156 said passengers were tended to and given refreshments because the temperature on the tarmac was close to 100 degrees
