-- september 1 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity5 @entity4 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity14 , @entity15 : welcome to our show
why is @entity18 testing a rocket that might never get off the ground ? we 're launching into the details in today 's edition of @entity0
first up : @entity27 @entity28 : first up , @entity27
a viewer sent in the video you see over my shoulder here of @entity27
yesterday , it was a category four hurricane with maximum winds around 135 miles per hour
this is a powerful storm
it 's in the @entity40 and expected to turn towards the @entity5 east coast tomorrow
officials say @entity27 probably wo n't make landfall ; that 's when the center of the hurricane actually reaches shore
but the storm is so big that @entity49 , the @entity49 , says people along the coast may need to evacuate
on monday , rain and wind from @entity27 knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people in @entity56 and the @entity57
this @entity58 you 're looking at shows some of the flooding in @entity56
is this legit ? @entity61 , @entity15 : is this legit ? a kilometer is longer than a mile
not at all ! it 's the other way around
a kilometer is about six - tenths of a mile
@entity6 aid @entity28 : a lot of people in @entity6 are traveling more than a dozen kilometers to try and get away from dangerous flooding
if you 've been watching our show , you 've seen our reports about these floods
they 've killed more than 1,600 people in @entity6 and affected at least 17 million other people there
aid is coming in from countries around the globe and from private companies : money , food , medical supplies
the @entity5 is sending more helicopters to @entity6 to help distribute that aid top people who need it
dr. @entity90 , @entity0 medical correspondent , is in @entity6
he gives us a look at the journey that some families there are going through and the struggles that they 're facing
( begin video ) @entity90 , @entity98 : most people actually are leaving like this : by foot , in the hot sun , walking for kilometers with no real idea of where exactly they 're going or what they 're going to find there
it is easy to see why they 're leaving
we are literally surrounded by water , and they 're worried that that water is just going to get higher and higher
so , they 're fleeing the floods with the thing , the priority that they value the most , their livestock , and just starting to walk
this is where so many of them ended up
they were just walking for kilometers and kilometers down that hot road , looking for high land , anything that could protect them from the flood waters
and look at what their lives are like now
thousands of people , literally , they have this little barrier here
it is so hot outside , anything to try to keep themselves cool
there 's no question that relief is slow coming here , but even as we 're filming today at the camp , this @entity6 army helicopter comes over and drops parcels of food
but this is just one camp
there are thousands of camps like this
there are more than 20 million people displaced
a fifth of this country is under water
( @entity156 ) trapped @entity157 @entity28 : terrible conditions there
now over in the @entity162 country of @entity7 , efforts are underway to rescue 33 miners who are trapped more than 2,300 feet underground
they 've been down there since a cave - in back in early august
all 33 people who are trapped survived and officials think it could take several months before they get out
the plan right now is to drill down through all that rock to reach the miners
what they 're making at this time is called an excavation hole
that 's where the drill bit will go
reports are that the miners are doing all right
they 're living off of supplies that are being sent down through bore holes
now those things are only about 4 inches in diameter
a team from @entity18 is helping out with ideas on how to keep the miners healthy
@entity189 [ sounds of @entity191 ] @entity192 @entity28 : behold : the @entity192 rocket
the thing kicks out 22 million horsepower
it could launch humans to the @entity198 , to @entity199
it 's a huge part of @entity18 's @entity201
just one problem : a lot of people do n't want it , including some officials at @entity18
the @entity206 canceled the @entity201
a panel declared that the @entity192 rocket is too expensive and behind schedule
so , the big question
why run the test ? some members of @entity212 still want it
and since the money for @entity192 is still in the federal budget , at least for the moment , the company that makes the rocket is required to keep developing it , even if it never gets off the ground
this day in history september 1 , 1897 -- the first @entity5 subway line begins service in @entity224 september 1 , 1939 -- @entity225 invades @entity226 , launching the start of @entity228 september 1 , 1985 -- the wreck of the @entity230 is found on the ocean floor fix our schools @entity28 : well , i know you guys get assignments every day
i had a little homework last thursday after we wrapped up @entity0
it was to interview 11 high school students from around the @entity241 , some of the state 's brightest for fix our schools
this is a special project that 's running all over @entity0 all week long
it takes ideas from teachers , administrators and , yes , students to look at how schools can succeed even while they 're facing challenges
and you 've probably seen some of those challenges at your school
now that homework assignment that i had - that group of high school juniors and seniors that i sat down to speak to - yesterday we brought you what they had to say about what makes schools good
today , we 're focusing on teachers
( begin video ) @entity28 : teachers , should they be your friends on @entity270 ? female student : no. @entity28 : anybody think so ? go ahead
@entity273 , @entity274 : ok
so , my teacher has her own @entity270 page , and all of my friends add her , all my classmates
and it 's so convenient because we ask her a question on what homework we had that night and she automatically replies
@entity28 : any of you think teachers should not be your friend on @entity270 ? want to say why ? @entity288 , @entity289 : i still really think a teacher is a teacher and students are just also there to learn
@entity28 : what qualities does a good teacher have ? think of your best teacher
tell me what he or she is like
@entity302 , @entity301 : she had a way of adding humor to the class
but then when we were studying , she would be serious about it
and we had a level of respect for her because she added that comedic level to the classroom
@entity28 : sort of a human factor ? @entity302 : yes
@entity315 , @entity316 : if it were n't for the dedication , the passion that my teachers have , we would all probably be all failing in those classes
but it 's the fact that they 're willing to stay after school , to be there before school , to walk around during lunch and come say , " oh , you 're working on the homework ? how are you doing ? " @entity28 : so , i 'm hearing passion , dedication and humor
let 's say your administration asks you to sit in on a hiring session
what qualities are you going to be looking for if you could make that decision to hire a teacher ? @entity340 , @entity341 : i would say someone that always prepares you for the next step
@entity345 , @entity346 : i would definitely ask them to talk about the subject , maybe talk about their favorite ways to teach
beause my teacher , he does n't teach the same way every day
he finds different ways to communicate the information
it really sticks once you laugh about it and you share experiences with your classmates
@entity28 : you are n't afraid of a challenging teacher as long as you 're learning something
does anybody not like a hard teacher ? @entity365 , @entity366 : it depends on what you mean by " hard teacher , " because there are teachers that be more hard than they should be
so , it 's a difference between being hard and overly aggressive
@entity28 : what do teachers do that make you shy away from learning ? @entity378 , @entity379 : when you spend too much time on one subject and you ca n't complete the entire course , it makes me shy away from trying to study myself , because i think we 're going to spend that much time , the rest of the time , on each subject , that long
@entity388 : something that shies me away from learning is when i know what 's going to happen in the classroom
for instance , i had a math teacher that , every day , we would walk in and we knew what we were going to do
we were going to check homework , take notes , start on homework
so , i think adding creativity to the teaching really helps keep our attention in the front of the classroom
( @entity156 ) before we go @entity28 : before we go today is something we 've been laughing about at workall day long
looks like man 's best friend is man 's best dance partner
that dog is burning up the dance floor , and this @entity414 video is burning up the internet
you might think we 're just showing this just because it 's awesome video , and you 're right
but it also fits in with one of the main goals of @entity0
goodbye @entity28 : making sure our show has plenty of balance
time to clear the dance floor for now
@entity0 , i 'm @entity25
we return tomorrow fired up and ready to go
looking forward to seeing you then .
