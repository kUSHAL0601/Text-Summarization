-- so we thought @entity3 kids did great in school
a new study suggests that women and minorities are less likely to receive early support from potential academic mentors
researchers from @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 ran an interesting field experiment : pretending to be students , they e-mailed more than 6500 professors at top @entity18 universities admiring each professor 's work and asking to meet
the e-mails were all identical except for the senders ' names
names that one can associate with a gender or race -- like @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 -- were used
the researchers found that faculty were most likely to respond to e-mails from white males
but more surprising was the high level of racial bias against @entity40 and @entity41 -- professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students
one of the researchers noted , " we see tremendous bias against @entity3 students and that 's not something we expected
... a lot of people think of @entity40 as a model minority group
we expect them to be treated quite well in academia
" the study highlights the pernicious nature of the " model minority " stereotype of @entity40 , and the fact that @entity40 are still viewed as the most foreign " other " in our @entity18 culture -- perhaps the biggest outsiders in the politics of " not like us
" a common refrain i hear from well - meaning friends and colleagues is : " what 's so bad about the @entity3 stereotype ? seems to me @entity40 have done all right
as a woman of color , i 'm keenly aware that on the spectrum of bias , there are plenty of worse things to be called than good at school
it does n't sound so terrible to be thought of as hardworking or quiet when there are so many more obviously sinister racial myths out there to bust
but the flip side of the model minority myth is an assumption that @entity40 do just fine and do n't need any mentoring or help in the academic or professional world
whether due to bias or mere lack of interest , the professors in the study treated @entity3 and @entity41 students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement
and this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace
there 's still a huge disparity between the percentage of @entity40 graduating at the top of their class from the best schools in the country and the percentage of @entity40 who go on to achieve top leadership positions in their chosen fields
disturbingly , i have heard thoughtful colleagues wonder aloud whether the underrepresentation of @entity40 in senior leadership roles is due to systemic , external factors that should be addressed with reform in the workplace , or whether it 's @entity40 who are responsible for taking themselves out of the c - suite pipeline because " they 're just happy being the worker bees
" is there any truth to the perceptions that @entity40 are passive , lack leadership skills and assertiveness , are unwilling to take initiative or risk , and even unable to have fun or a decent sense of humor ? some people definitely think so
i 'm not the only @entity18 of @entity3 descent who has been told , in the form of a compliment , that i 'm surprisingly outgoing , funny , or sociable -- for an @entity3
i still get friendly compliments on my " very good @entity136
" and at one of my very first legal job interviews , one judge put it succinctly : " i 've always thought your people were very bright
" it 's the very benignity of these model minority stereotypes that render them so persistent and difficult to eradicate
so , what can we do about it ? we can start by improving mentor and sponsor programs
mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world
employers should consider the real affinities that may actually exist within their workforce and offer employees the tools , training and access to identify , cultivate and maintain their own meaningful mentor and sponsor relationships
at one law job early in my career , i was assigned to a " mentor " who himself had only been at the firm a few weeks
why ? he was from @entity171
i 'm from @entity172 and grew up in @entity173 and i 'm not even @entity174
meanwhile , i went to a college that graduates about 400 students a year , and a white male senior partner whose office was down the hall had gone to this same small college , yet no one at the firm had stopped to think that perhaps i might have something in common with him
sure , it 's also incumbent on people to take initiative and simply walk down the hall and introduce themselves to potential mentors
but it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers -- in academia , the corporate world , public service , media , entertainment and the arts , whatever path talented young people might choose -- to recognize the subtle , unconscious biases that sometimes prevent @entity40 from achieving their true potential
maybe then @entity40 in @entity18 can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school
