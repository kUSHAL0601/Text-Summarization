editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive officer of @entity3 , @entity5 - based @entity4 , which generates much of its power from coal - burning plants and is making investments in clean energy technology in @entity10
@entity11 is the president of the @entity12
@entity13 is @entity14 representative of the @entity15
@entity2 , ceo of coal - burning @entity4 , wants the @entity17 to join with @entity10 against greenhouse gases
( @entity19 ) -- there is a lot of rhetoric on @entity23 and in our nation 's @entity27 these days portraying @entity10 as a job - stealing polluter whose economy is growing at the expense of the @entity17
but business leaders and policy advocates who work in @entity10 see a different picture : a @entity10 that is investing heavily in innovation and determined to win the global race to supply its citizens and the world with clean energy technologies
@entity10 is the largest producer of solar water heaters , with 50 percent of the world 's production and 65 percent of all installations
it produces 30 percent of the world 's photovoltaic sets and is installing wind turbines faster than any other nation
@entity10 's expanding middle class is increasingly mobile , with more than 50 million electric bicycles , and @entity10 is developing the first mass - produced plug - in hybrid electric car
the country has 14 nuclear power plants under construction and plans to start 10 more next year
although there has been much talk about creating " green jobs " in the @entity17 , @entity10 leads the world with its massive investment in energy efficiency and renewable power
@entity10 's growth has come with a heavy price : pollution
@entity10 produces 80 percent of its electricity from coal and now leads the world in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants
dirty air and contaminated water affect many millions of @entity10 and are two of the nation 's most serious problems
although the @entity17 has made great strides in reducing pollution in recent decades , we are still the world 's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions , with emissions per capita four times higher than @entity10 's
our nation is also heavily dependent on coal and imported oil
we are moving ahead in solar energy , wind and efficiency , but we are doing so in a fragmented , state - by - state approach that reflects our democracy and regulatory structures
by forging relationships with leading @entity10 state - owned and private energy and technology companies , @entity17 companies -- at times working with the federal government -- can create a " ladder of cooperation " with the @entity10 to lead the world forward on climate change
we will not climb this ladder overnight but one rung at a time
with the @entity104 ' climate change conference in @entity105 , @entity106 , just two months away , it is imperative that our two nations establish a more trusting , give - and - take relationship upon which good business partnerships are built
the @entity12 , the @entity15 and @entity4 have started this work , with great prospects for results
@entity12 , an independent , non-partisan environmental research organization , is working with @entity10 to calculate its greenhouse emissions as a key part of its next national @entity116 to advance its economy
the intent is to develop reportable and verifiable measures in the plan that could facilitate @entity10 's participation in an international climate agreement
@entity4 recently announced a memorandum of understanding with the @entity125 , @entity10 's largest power generator , and the @entity127 , one of the nation 's largest private energy companies
the focus of these efforts is to cooperatively develop and commercialize an array of clean energy technologies
the @entity15 -- an environmental organization advancing clean technology in the @entity17 and @entity10 -- is pivotal to @entity4 efforts
it has created a network of a dozen @entity10 and @entity17 companies to develop joint business ventures to build advanced , low - carbon coal technology in @entity10 and around the world
this network is expanding to include an array of other renewable and clean energy technologies
historically , @entity17 have known little about @entity10 and , at times , are justifiably concerned about its growing power and influence
this is changing as our trading and financial interdependencies grow
today , @entity10 is the largest exporter to the @entity17 and the largest holder of @entity17 debt
it is clearly not beneficial to either country to turn back the clock
there always will be healthy competition between @entity10 and the @entity17 in developing and marketing technologies , but we must work closely together to scale up and commercialize the best ideas , regardless of whether it comes from our two nations or other countries in @entity165 or @entity14 or @entity166
@entity10 and the @entity17 bring extraordinary and complementary skills to the table
@entity10 's 1.3 billion people and unmatched economies of scale can bring new technologies to market fast -- in " @entity10 time " -- at a speed that is virtually impossible anywhere else in the world
the @entity17 is the world 's largest economy , with an educational and technological infrastructure that is unmatched in the world , and stable energy regulation and investment policies
the sooner we get to work on achieving proposed congressional targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , the less expensive addressing climate change will ultimately be
we need to build on the emerging cooperation that exists between our two nations on energy and climate
we need to take responsibility for the fact that we are the world 's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases
if the @entity17 and @entity10 can come together to lead on addressing climate change , the rest of world will follow
to make this relationship work , each country should leave fear and timidity at the door , put economic self - interest to work and forge the strategic partnerships necessary to get the job done
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 , @entity11 and @entity13 .
