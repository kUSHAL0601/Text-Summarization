-- two @entity1 and an @entity2 were awarded the @entity3 in chemistry on wednesday for painstakingly mapping out the thousands of atoms that make up the ribosome -- work that paves the way for new antibiotics
@entity1 researcher @entity11 is one of three scientists sharing the @entity13 in chemistry
inside all animals , plants and bacteria are dna molecules that contain the blueprint for life
ribosomes are an organism 's protein factories
they use the information in the @entity26 to make the tens of thousands of proteins that enable the organism to function properly
these proteins include hormones , enzymes and hemoglobin , which transports oxygen
from a medicinal standpoint , the ribosome is important because it is what antibiotics target
in a bacterial strain , antibiotics bind to the ribosomes , preventing them from making the proteins the bacteria need to survive
@entity1 @entity44 and @entity11 and @entity2 @entity45 shared the $ 1.4 million prize for mapping the position of the thousands and thousands of atoms that make up ribosomes
their three - dimensional models showed how different antibiotics bind to the ribosome
" these models are now used by scientists in order to develop new antibiotics , directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity 's suffering , " said the @entity56 , which awards the prize
@entity44 , a @entity1 citizen who was born in @entity67 , is a senior scientist and group leader at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , according to the @entity3 web site
@entity11 is a professor at @entity74 and an investigator at @entity76 at @entity74 , the site said
yonath is a professor at the @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity2 , and director of the @entity82 at the @entity79 , the @entity13 site said
the @entity13 are being awarded this week and next
the medicine award was handed out on monday and the one for physics on tuesday
the prize for literature will be awarded thursday ; the @entity88 winner will be named on friday , and the award in economics will be issued on monday .
