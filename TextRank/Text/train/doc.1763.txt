-- auctions are like sporting events ; pundits and punters predict the outcome but never really know what will happen
triumphs and record breakers tend to make art press headlines , while upsets are quickly swept under the nearest @entity12 rug
the performance this week of a @entity16 @entity15 bowl , bought for $ 3 at a yard sale and sold at auction in @entity19 for $ 2.2 million , is the latest result in a string of successes for " undiscovered " @entity16 porcelain at auction
it began in earnest in the 1970s and reached a climax on november 13 , 2010 , when a porcelain vase from the reign of 18th - century emperor @entity28 took a staggering 53 million pounds from a @entity16 bidder in a tiny suburban @entity33 salesroom , the kind where bidders sit on sofas and chairs that are part of the estate auction
both pieces sat unidentified , and unappreciated , for generations , rekindling the flame of hope that burns dimly inside all antiques enthusiasts , whether or not they care to admit it
flea - marketeers and yard - salers openly acknowledge they live in a world of false hope , spending countless hours , like fishermen who catch nothing but the smallest fry , or nothing at all in most outings
most hopes that live on are commonly dashed by the first encounter with a professional
the floor of an " @entity61 " taping set is littered with broken dreams -- and sometimes broken porcelain in emphasis
i do not believe anyone has ever statistically plotted the chances of turning up a valuable object at a yard sale opportunity , but expect such a number would be too small to register on any scale
before any attempt to uncover a dream , it pays to think strategically about what it is you are looking for
like finding the perfect partner , this may involve a process of elimination but depends largely on common sense and good powers of observation
the essential ingredient in determining value of an art object is no secret : supply and demand
i suggest those on the way to an early - morning yard sale repeat this over and over in the van
@entity96 may therefore be a positive factor , but if something is rare , or perhaps unique , and no one wants it ( your grandfather 's homemade table lamp perhaps ? ) , it has no value
on the other hand , an object may be plentiful , even mass - produced , but have even greater demand and therefore value
some years ago i sold a @entity110 perfume bottle at auction for a little more than $ 200,000
its owner had purchased the bottle at @entity115 in 1937 ( where it was marked down 50 % on sale ) for $ 25
there were plenty more waiting to be sold at the time
quality is sometimes but not always a factor in value
most baseball cards are extremely inexpensively made , and mass - produced , making all cards from any given series fundamentally the same , except of course for the subject
most cards , even those a century old , are worth a few dollars at best , and a pitiful percentage rise into the hundreds individually , but a few are valued into six or even seven figures
the economics of supply and demand work powerfully when applied to the subtleties of collecting a set
it is not coincidental that most remarkable numbers lately have been put up by @entity16 objects
the year 2010 , in which @entity16 overtook @entity140 to become the second - largest art market after the @entity142 , has been described as an annus mirabilis for @entity16 art collecting as wealthy @entity16 from all levels of the new society chose art and objects as tangible assets , suitable for investment , trading and bragging rights beyond simple display
the demand is as large as the @entity16 population and economy , and supply of exquisite objects limited , thanks to most being in @entity161 museums or private collections
a fundamental awareness of @entity16 porcelain may be a big help in your hopes of finding the same success as the owner of the @entity15 bowl , but serious knowledge is an area of immense expertise shared by an elite few and respected by the trade above all other areas of understanding
if you rely on luck , however , @entity16 porcelain is a fairly good bet
the @entity15 bowl looks quite ordinary to most of us
it is monochrome , with an extremely subtle pattern , and does not have a mark translating as " valuable @entity15 bowl " stamped on the bottom , making it look like a bowl found in @entity187 ( and more commonly found at yard sales )
good luck in your search
the only other comparable example is in the @entity192
perhaps a hidden treasure may be closer than you think
@entity194 offers an example of the insanely rare 1913 liberty head nickel in april
the last one we offered sold for $ 3.73 million
it looks pretty much like any other nickel to most of us , and there may have been others in circulation
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .
