-- sixty - one percent of @entity1 polled , who watched president @entity3 's prime - time speech , told @entity0 that they support his policy towards @entity5
since some surveys showed as much as two - thirds opposition to military action against @entity5 in the days before the speech , the poll suggests that he did what presidents rarely do : change people 's minds , if only temporarily
read the speech how did he do it ? in only 15 minutes , president @entity3 made his points , simply and straightforwardly
anyone arguing a controversial case in the court of public opinion can learn from what he said and how he said it : identifying with the audience
addressing a war - weary public , president @entity3 began by saying that he had " resisted calls for military action " in @entity5 before " @entity31 's government gassed to death over a thousand people
" the message : the terrible event that changed my mind should change yours , too
opinion : @entity3 's speech wo n't sell @entity1 on @entity5 telling a story
president @entity3 told how the world community declared chemical weapons " off limits , a crime against humanity and a violation of the laws of war
" his story began with the deadly use of gas in the trenches in @entity54 and continued with the @entity56 use of poison gas in the @entity58
having made the human rights case , president @entity3 explained why chemical weapons threaten @entity1
if @entity31 is n't punished , " our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield
" terrorists could get these weapons and use them against civilians
@entity69 could be emboldened to build nuclear weapons
some opponents warn he 's willfully starting a new war
others call him indecisive because he delayed military action
president @entity3 said he 's taking the debate to @entity79 , even though he maintains he does n't have to , because " our democracy is stronger when the president acts with the support of @entity79
" @entity3 seeks support for attacking @entity5 while pursuing diplomacy answering questions
like the faqs on a website , much of the speech answered questions that president @entity3 said members of @entity79 and private citizens have asked him , such as " wo n't this put us on a slippery slope to another war ? " president @entity96 also made a point of answering questions that people had asked in their letters to him
in his address to a @entity102 after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , president @entity103 answered questions , as did @entity105 in his radio talks during @entity107 offering hopeful news
towards the end of a speech that could have been completed several days earlier , president @entity3 discussed the latest developments surrounding the @entity113 proposal that @entity5 turn over its weapons to international authorities
yes , the transition sounded choppy , but listeners care more about encouraging news than elegant rhetoric
opinion : speech aims to keep heat on @entity5 appealing to @entity1 patriotism
president @entity3 said @entity1 is " different " because we right wrongs when we can
answering the common criticism that he does n't believe in " @entity127 , " he concluded , " that 's what makes @entity1 exceptional ... let us never lose sight of that essential truth
" with down - to - earth arguments and a lofty conclusion , last night 's speech was a model of how to turn an audience around , point by point
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .
