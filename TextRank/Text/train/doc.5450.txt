-- since 2001 , there have been many excellent , award - winning and ground - breaking films , both narrative and documentary , about the wars in @entity6 and @entity7
" the @entity8 , " " @entity9 , " " @entity10 , " " occupation : @entity13 , " " @entity12 , " " @entity14 , " " @entity15 , " " @entity16 , " " @entity17 , " " @entity18 , " " the prisoner : or how i planned to kill @entity20 , " " @entity21 " and so on
all of these films have their place
many are exceptional , moving and award - winning pieces of work , but of those that i have seen , none pack the visceral , emotional and artistic wallop that @entity31 ' documentary " @entity32 " delivers , and all without any politics whatsoever
there 's nothing , not one word of whether the @entity37 should be fighting these wars , why we 're there or who 's to blame
this is an intimate film about then - 25 - year - old @entity42 sgt. @entity42 , his wife ( and high school sweetheart ) @entity45 and the personal cost of war
it is also an astonishing technical achievement in war journalism and documentary filmmaking that may very possibly change the way conflicts are reported forever
@entity31 designed and built a customized steadicam rig ( a device that enables a filmmaker to move over an uneven surface without the camera bouncing up and down ) , allowing him to shoot footage that looks " @entity60 , " but was shot with a " prosumer " @entity63 digital slr : basically a still camera that shoots hd video
along with a customized sound rig , @entity31 was able to shoot intimate war footage that until now has been impossible
the combat footage is , however , only part of the story
six months into his third tour of duty in @entity6 and @entity7 , and just days from rotating out , @entity42 ( @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ) is gravely wounded during a @entity77 ambush
his hip and leg are broken , and blood transfusions and multiple surgeries are required to save his life
@entity31 was embedded with @entity71 when it was dropped deep behind enemy lines , and as an embedded reporter , he did his job , filming the troops in combat and interacting with @entity7 locals
during his time with the troops , @entity31 got to know @entity42 , and after he was wounded , @entity31 rejoined him in @entity91 and continued filming there
as the film moves back and forth between @entity7 and @entity91 , where @entity42 is undergoing rehab for his injuries , it becomes painfully clear that the hell of war does n't end when troops return home
and after watching the film , it 's unclear whether the " hell " of the title is @entity7 or back home
@entity42 ' injuries are horrific , and he 's on multiple medications
in an early scene , his wife is driving the pair on a shopping trip and he 's going through his meds ( @entity112 , @entity113 , etc. )
it 's a pharmacy of addictive painkillers
later in the film , one of @entity42 ' doctors explains the process of weaning him off the drugs , including withdrawal and the risk of dependency
it 's clear that @entity42 does n't want to have to use the drugs forever , as he continuously complains of being nauseated and out of it , but he is also is just as clearly becoming dependent on them
in @entity7 , life is chaotic and dangerous and terrifying , but it is also , on one level , very simple
troops are there to do one main thing : kill bad guys
( an early shot of a @entity135 instructor telling his charges that they are " experts in the application of violence " is chilling
) however , once a @entity135 returns home , the frustrations of everyday life can be crippling
for example , looking for a space in a crowded mall parking lot can be irritating enough as an everyday experience , but to a @entity135 recently returned from a war zone , this and many other mundane annoyances can be extremely frustrating , trivial and ultimately useless
add to that a body full of pain and medications , and you have the makings of a difficult re-entry into life on the home front
with injuries as severe as @entity42 ' , it 's virtually impossible to avoid getting hooked on pain pills
not only does the injury cause pain , but the brutal physical therapy that is needed to regain maximum usage of his leg is excruciating
the differences between the strong , vigorous and professional leader in @entity7 and the severely injured , angry , depressed , dependent and occasionally almost childlike man at home is shocking
one chilling scene involves @entity42 relating his mindset when he first joined the @entity135 : " all i wanted to do was kill people
" he was told by the recruiters that was the best answer they 'd heard
he says he no longer thinks that way , but it 's clear that the @entity135 and the wars have had a serious effect on his psyche , as he is rarely seen in the film without a handgun , nervously loading and unloading it , pretending to play @entity184 roulette and even sleeping with it , loaded , under his mattress
an additional casualty of the war is his wife , @entity45
portrayed as loyal and loving , it 's clear that at times , she is scared for , and occasionally of , her husband
@entity194 and his injuries have changed him , and in one unsettling scene , she recounts how there are times when @entity42 basically becomes a different person
friday marks the 10th anniversary of the start of the war in @entity7 , and if this film does anything , it reminds us that the cost of war extends far beyond those who die in battle
the returning troops and those to whom they return are also casualties , and they deserve our care and attention
" @entity32 " opened in @entity214 on wednesday and rolls out in major cities across the country over the coming weeks
check the movie 's website for the release schedule
the film is rated @entity221 as one would expect , it contains a fair amount of off - color language as well as some brutal imagery
but this is a documentary , and war is ugly .
