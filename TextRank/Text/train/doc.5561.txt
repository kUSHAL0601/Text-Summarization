-- @entity1 described his achievement of claiming a third successive @entity4 crown in the country of racing legend @entity6 as ' unreal '
the @entity9 driver became the youngest ever triple world champion in the history of the sport after recovering from a disastrous start to finish sixth at the @entity15 @entity14
@entity15 favourite @entity6 , who won his home @entity14 in 1990 and 1991 , was also a three - time world champion before his tragic death following a crash at @entity19 in 1994
@entity20 makes history @entity6 , who died at the age of just 34 , won 41 races in 161 attempts and established himself as one of the most talented drivers to have ever graced the sport
@entity1 , 25 , is just the third driver in history to win three successive titles , equaling the achievements of @entity31 @entity30 and @entity33 's @entity32
he now joins the likes of @entity6 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 on three championship triumphs
@entity40 " to do this , for all of us in the team it is unreal , " he told reporters
" also to win a third title here , where one of the greatest @entity6 ( @entity47 ) came from
" it is very difficult to imagine that i join him and other great names by winning three successive titles
" my radio was not working , i was crying and you did n't hear that and i am very happy about that
i just ca n't find the right words to describe how i feel right now
" @entity57 ( @entity58 ) came on the radio and told me the names of all the three - time champions and i cried
" tears for much of the race it appeared that @entity1 would be shedding different kind of tears following a nightmare start to the race
the @entity33 was involved in an opening lap collision with @entity70 ' @entity47 , which damaged his car and left him at the back of the grid
@entity30 vs. @entity6 : who is the greatest ? with his chief rival @entity76 claiming second place , @entity1 somehow managed to fight his way up to a sixth place finish to win the title by just three points
he added : " i just kept trying to race
" i was so very happy to climb back after being hit like that at the start -- you imagine spinning backwards on the @entity88 ( @entity87 motorway )
it was not a very comfortable feeling
" i really want to thank everyone in the team here and in the factory and all of us
nobody feels more important than anybody else
it is unbelievable for me
" i had to avoid everyone and i was lucky nobody hit me
fortunately , the front wing was intact which was important
i was forced back and in the mixed conditions i was the slowest car out there on the straight
" we just did our thing
that 's the way we do it and it works in our team
