@entity0 -- @entity3 must report to jail by june 17 to begin serving a 120 - day sentence for a necklace theft charge , a judge ordered wednesday
after her sentencing , the court released a probation report that said the actress " appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues
" @entity3 was not at the hearing , but her lawyer entered a no contest plea -- equivalent to a guilty plea -- to the misdemeanor theft charge on her behalf wednesday morning
" i am glad to be able to put this past me and move on with my life and my career , " @entity3 said in a written statement released wednesday afternoon
" i support the judge 's decision and hold myself accountable for being in this situation
" early release formulas , required by a federal order to reduce jail overcrowding , will likely reduce the sentence to about 14 days in jail , @entity25 spokesman @entity24 said after the hearing
" because of budget constraints and because we 're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation , nonviolent offenders , lesser crimes , get 20 % of their sentence , " @entity24 said
@entity40 judge @entity39 said the discounts on the sentences " seems to be like shopping at @entity41
" @entity3 likely qualifies to serve her sentence in home confinement , instead of a jail cell , but the probation officials will decide that , @entity24 said
a report prepared by @entity3 's probation officer and released wednesday said , " it would appear that the defendant 's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity , " yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail
despite several months in court - ordered drug rehab last year , @entity3 " appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues
" she tested positive for alcohol use , a violation of probation rules , in february , the report said
it also revealed that the drug test failure last august , which resulted in a jail sentence and court - ordered rehab , involved cocaine and amphetamines
@entity39 ordered that @entity3 remain on supervised probation until she completes 480 hours of community service included in her punishment but the judge rejected deputy city attorney @entity75 's request for substance abuse counseling for @entity3
@entity39 said drugs and alcohol are not the root of @entity3 's legal troubles , but " she 's got other problems for which she self - medicates
" @entity3 's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007
since then , she 's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehab
@entity3 is already two days into completing her 480 hours of community service , including 360 hours at the @entity88
" i have already started my community service at the @entity90 and thank everyone there for their warm welcome , " @entity3 said
" i hope to be able to fulfill my obligation without any press attention
i think the media spotlight should be on issues such as homelessness and domestic violence instead of on me
" @entity39 said she 's asked @entity0 police to keep the paparazzi away from the center while @entity3 performs her service .
