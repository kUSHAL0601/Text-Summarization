@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 judge sentenced @entity7 's three widows and two daughters on monday to 45 days of house detention for living illegally in @entity1 , the widows ' lawyer said
the judge ordered that after their term , the five be deported back to their countries of citizenship , said @entity15 , the lawyer
he said the time served began march 3 , when the five were formally arrested or taken into custody , and that they would all be released by mid-april
the widows -- identified by @entity21 and @entity1 officials as @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 -- have been in @entity1 custody since @entity26 raided @entity7 's compound in @entity28 and killed the @entity30 leader in may 2011
the daughters are ages 17 and 21 , @entity15 said
since all five defendants confessed to impersonation , illegal entry into @entity1 and staying illegally in @entity1 , there was no need for a trial , said @entity15 , who added that his clients would not appeal the " lenient " sentence
they will serve their sentence in the @entity0 residence where the trial took place , @entity15 said
a source familiar with the widows ' case said last week that the @entity50 government has expressed willingness to let @entity52 , @entity7 's youngest widow , return home
@entity55 , where the other two women are from , has been resistant
the judge also fined each of the defendants 10,000 rupees , or about $ 110 , @entity15 said , adding that the fines had been paid in court
@entity7 spent years on the run in @entity1 after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children -- at least one of whom was born in a government hospital , @entity52 has told @entity1 investigators
a deposition taken from @entity52 gives the clearest picture yet of @entity7 's life while international forces hunted him
" while we may never be able to corroborate every detail , generally speaking , @entity7 's wife 's account seems plausible , and it confirms some previously held theories on where the @entity30 leader was hiding over the years , " a @entity21 official said about the widow 's account
in the january 19 police report , @entity52 said she had always wanted to marry a holy warrior
when word of plans for her arranged marriage to @entity7 came in 2000 , she flew to @entity1 , crossed the @entity91 border at @entity92 and went to @entity93
she said she did not recall exactly when , but she was married before the 2001 attacks on @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97
she lived with @entity7 and his two other wives until the attacks
the family " scattered " after that , she told police
she said she returned to the southern port city of @entity104 with her eldest daughter , @entity105 , and stayed in an apartment for eight or nine months
she said that " all the things were arranged by some @entity1 family and @entity109 , " @entity7 's eldest son
they moved six or seven times in @entity104 before she reunited with @entity7 in the border city of @entity114
they moved to the @entity116 , living in two houses over an eight - or nine - month period
next , they shifted to @entity119 , also in northern @entity1
@entity52 's daughter @entity120 was born there in 2003 and son @entity121 the next year
@entity52 said she stayed in a hospital on both occasions
they settled in @entity28 in 2005 and stayed there for six years before @entity7 was killed
@entity52 gave birth to two more children in @entity28 -- daughter @entity127 was born in 2006 and son @entity128 in 2008
@entity52 said two families , whom she called the @entity121 and @entity132 families , stayed with them while they were in @entity116 , @entity119 and @entity28 , and " everything was arranged by them
" she said some members of those two families were killed in the raid , as was @entity7 's 20 - year - old son , @entity138
she told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in @entity1
@entity2 asked @entity1 officials in @entity96 , in e-mails and over the phone , whether they had any knowledge of @entity52 's movements and got no response .
