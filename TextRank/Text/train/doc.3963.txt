-- we began breakfast one recent morning delivering this news to @entity4 : @entity5 , her caregiver , was going on a two - week vacation
" who is going to take care of me ? " she asked
and then she gave me " the look
" i call it pouty face
her dime - sized brown eyes squeeze together , the lower lip rolls out , the hands ball up
every time she looks like that , my crazy @entity17 empties of sugarplum fairies and fills with fears of pedophilia and child snatching
previously on @entity0 : i 'm her mom , not the nanny ! we have had the same babysitter since @entity4 was born
@entity5 would step in front of a train for @entity4
she is not easily replaced
but when @entity4 was a baby , we figured we had options
there is a reason @entity32 gave us mothers , tias ( aunties ) , abuelitas ( grandmothers ) and the occasional bff you call " co-madre " regardless of whether they are actually your kid 's godmother and hence your " co-mother
" the problem is every @entity43 in @entity44 works until death
there is no cotton - topped @entity47 on standby sitting in her house - dress feeding chickens
i do n't think all @entity51 are so overprotective of their kids
@entity4 was just a baby the first time @entity5 went on vacation
i called my mother who lives in @entity56 and laid on the guilt
i recited the @entity59 statistic that 1 in 4 girls is sexually abused before age 18 ( it 's all about sexual abuse with the @entity63 )
she hopped on a train and i left for work
she called me an hour later with @entity67 blaring in the background
@entity4 had early pouty face
she must be malnourished by my lousy parenting and in need of chicken soup
i told my mother she drinks only breast milk and to look in the fridge
@entity4 began throwing up at 3 a.m. i called the pediatrician , who yelled through the speakerphone to call 911
" you ate soup when you were a week old , " my mother admitted sheepishly
@entity80 : my nanny 's sadness is also my own @entity5 demanded to vet her next replacement
she hangs out with a legion of sitters representing all the nations of @entity89 and @entity90 , and they have their special ways
children should be stuffed with comfort food ; pock marked by lipstick kisses , wrinkled from hugging and rocking , and wear fuzzy socks because their feet can never be too warm
i 'm not saying other ethnic groups do n't coddle their kids , but @entity51 just seem to excel at it
i remember being handed a worksheet at a @entity63 and me group that mapped out three goals for toddlers : adaptation , separation , and integration
my sitter and her gang laughed at me
adaptation ? @entity110 will do it when she 's ready
for months my toilet was surrounded by @entity43 sitters staring at @entity115 , waiting for poo
mamas , grandmas , nanas , your 400 tias and most particularly your girlfriends are in this with you cradle - to - grave
integration ? yes , they are allowed to play with children being raised by their friends
i was n't going to be drawn into this kind of ethnocentricity
my employer offers a service providing bonded , certified , triple - a , recommended , backup babysitters
my sitter threatened to pull my @entity43 card
" you 're leaving your / my child with a total stranger in a strange land ? ! " i reminded her i was born here
the next morning " @entity142 " arrived
@entity4 gave me pouty face , but i walked out the door with my head high
i got a call an hour later
one of @entity5 's snitches was at my apartment
" she 's feeding her cold plantains , " she whispered in @entity149
i told her to butt out
then came call no. 2 , this time from my neighbor
" the @entity149 nannies are icing the replacement , " she warned me
" @entity4 has pouty face
" call no. 3 came from the sitter herself
" @entity4 does n't want to take a nap or eat her porridge , " she said
" @entity4 no longer naps , and what is porridge ? " i asked
i came home after call no. 5 to a troupe of nannies staring down this poor woman from " a @entity170 country where they do n't even speak @entity149
" i accused everyone of bigotry and got that stare that says " new mom
" @entity142 revealed she had never cared for a child " this particular age " and said she had to go
the specter of @entity142 reigned over our household for months
if you do n't behave , @entity142 will be coming for the weekend
clean up your toys , or @entity142 will pick you up from preschool
if only i could find that woman , i 'd hire her one more time just to revive the memory
the next replacement sitter was an aging woman sent by an agency with hearts and fairies dancing across their logo
not an hour after her arrival came phone call no. 1
" @entity17 , it 's @entity4
i 'm on the phone upstairs
" let 's start with the fact that @entity4 had never dialed the phone on her own
" why are you upstairs ? " i inquired
" i do n't nap
i do n't want bath
" i could feel pouty face through the phone
the nanny was on the other line complaining that @entity4 would n't bathe at 2 o'clock in the afternoon
" @entity17 come ! " i was home in an hour
during her next vacations , she outsourced @entity4 to her tribe -- @entity210 from @entity211 , @entity212 from @entity213 , @entity214 from @entity215
it was a brilliant solution for about a year , until all their kiddies started school
suddenly , mamas were ditching their @entity43 sitters left and right in exchange for grimy after - school programs and college students trying to make an extra buck toward tuition
those who did n't soon lost their sitters to more fulltime jobs
but her next vacation left us in a lurch
we requested a @entity149 speaker from an agency , and they sent a woman from @entity236
an hour later , my building superintendent called
" your baby sitter is a freak , " he said
" @entity4 told me to call
and she 's not @entity236
" who pretends to be @entity236 to get a job ? i could n't come home
i posted a cry for help to my faux friends on @entity247 , which elicited only sympathy
" would you like me to take her ? " he asked , he of the four kids who 've scampered our halls chatting in @entity255 since they were toddlers
great ! he even has the keys ! i expressed my glee on @entity247 and the replies poured in
in short order , my super was accused of being a pedophile , a child trafficker , a canonize - able saint , and a shyster looking to rob me
i got home to find @entity4 with his daughter , @entity268 , all grown up , making paper bag puppets
pouty face no more ! @entity272 -- sitter @entity273 ! i had found an unemployed college graduate who lives down the hall and is great with kids
i was all set until i got altruistic and recommended her to a friend
less than a year later she had a fulltime job
that brings me back to this week
as soon as i mentioned back - up care , @entity5 sprung into action and ran it all by @entity4 who now talks in full sentences
they announced a girl named @entity289 would be monitoring @entity4
i also hired a lovely girl from back - up care who they allowed to hang out with them
i still had @entity4 cruising from play - date to play - date
@entity5 somehow managed to monitor the entire thing from the @entity296
by week 's end , everyone had it covered
i was out of it , sitting totally detached at work , sporting my own pouty face .
