@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 launched a grisly attack on a @entity1 village in an area that troops had been using as a base in the search for hundreds of schoolgirls abducted by the militant group , witnesses told @entity2 on wednesday
the hourslong assault on @entity14 that left at least 150 people dead , some of whom were burned alive , is the latest in a series of brazen attacks and abductions by @entity4 , raising concern about whether the @entity1 government can retake control of the region from the entrenched terror group
word of the attack follows news that president @entity31 , who has been under fire for his handling of the mass abduction , accepted @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity38 offers of assistance to find the schoolgirls , officials with those governments said
it 's unclear what impact the latest attack could have on the international response to @entity1 's fight with @entity4 , which so far has concentrated on helping the government rescue 276 schoolgirls abducted on april 14
the assault on the village came after military troops deployed to the area were called to the border area near @entity53 , where reports -- later determined to be false -- surfaced that the schoolgirls had been found with @entity4 militants , witnesses and local officials said
@entity2 can not independently confirm the report , and attempts wednesday to contact @entity1 's military for comment were unsuccessful
indiscriminate killing witnesses described a well - coordinated attack that began shortly after 1:30 p.m. local time monday at a busy outdoor market in @entity14
wearing military uniforms , the militants arrived with three armored personnel carriers , they said
they shouted " @entity73 " -- " @entity74 is great " -- and opened up on the market , firing rocket - propelled grenades and tossing improvised explosive devices , witnesses said
some marketgoers tried to take shelter in shops only to be burned alive when the gunmen set fire to a number of the businesses , the witnesses said
a few @entity1 soldiers who had been left behind at the village could not hold off the assault and were forced to flee , they said
many sought safe haven in nearby @entity88 , they said
the fighters also attacked the police station during the 12 - hour assault , initially facing stiff resistance
they eventually used explosives to blow the roof off the building , witnesses said
fourteen police officers were found dead inside , they said
the final death toll could be closer to 300 , @entity1 sen. @entity98 told @entity2
monday 's bloody attack by @entity4 militants , some of whom @entity35 officials say have been trained by @entity103 , follows a pattern of seeking revenge against anybody who is perceived to have provided aid to the @entity1 government
international aid taking shape news of the attack came as @entity35 officials pressed ahead with plans to provide @entity1 with law enforcement assistance and military consultations , @entity113 spokeswoman @entity112 said
" obviously , this is in the interest of the @entity1 government to accept every aspect of our assistance , " she told reporters during a briefing wednesday
" they conveyed that they were willing to do that yesterday and it continues to be in their interest to be as cooperative as possible
" @entity35 officials will establish a joint coordination cell at the @entity132 in @entity0 where the goal will be to provide intelligence , investigations and hostage negotiation expertise , @entity112 said
the cell will include @entity35 military personnel , who are expected to arrive in @entity1 in the coming days , she said
the @entity140 has started planning for how it can help @entity1 , a senior @entity35 military official told @entity2
it 's unlikely at this point that @entity35 troops would be involved in operations , the officials said
@entity36 is sending a small team of experts to complement the @entity35 team , a spokesman for prime minister @entity147 said wednesday
the spokesman did n't specify the nature of the team 's expertise
on behalf of @entity38 , premier @entity154 offered satellite and intelligence services to aid in the search
meanwhile , @entity1 authorities offered a reward of about $ 310,000 on wednesday for information leading to the rescue of the girls
" while calling on the general public to be part of the solution to the present security challenge , the @entity165 also reassures all citizens that any information given would be treated anonymously and with utmost confidentiality , " the @entity163 said in a statement
according to accounts , armed members of @entity4 overpowered security guards at an all - girls school in @entity177 , yanked the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks
the convoy of trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering @entity88
the reward offer comes amid international outcry over the mass kidnapping in mid-april
the # @entity188 campaign initially began on @entity189
it quickly spread , with demonstrators taking to the streets over the weekend in major cities around the world to demand action
defending the response @entity1 's president has been under enormous international pressure to step up efforts to rescue the girls after come after waiting three weeks to publicly acknowledge the kidnappings
his administration , however , is defending its response -- even as details emerged this about a second mass kidnapping
at least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15 were snatched sunday night from the village of @entity211 by @entity4 , villagers said
" the president and the government ( are ) not taking this as easy as people all over the world think , " presidential spokesman @entity212 said , adding that helicopters and airplanes have searched for the girls in 250 locations
more troops , he said , are on the way
despite the flurry of activity , the father of two of the schoolgirls taken by @entity4 scoffed at the @entity1 government 's response
" we have never seen any military man there , " said the father , who is not being identified for fear of reprisals by the government or @entity4
" had it been military men who went into the bush to rescue our daughters , we would have seen them
" members of the @entity245 called for action , former @entity243 secretary - general @entity242 called the abductions " abominable " and @entity248 , the @entity249 children 's rights activist shot in the head by the @entity251 , spoke out , too
" the girls in @entity1 are my sisters and it is my responsibility that i speak up for my sisters , " @entity248 told @entity2 's " @entity256
" the @entity35 first lady , @entity257 , was among the latest high - profile figures to take to @entity189 about the girls ' plight , tweeting a photo of herself holding a sign that read : # @entity188
" our prayers are with the missing @entity1 girls and their families , " she said in the post
@entity4 : a bloody insurgency , a growing challenge ' i abducted your girls ' @entity4 translates to " @entity274 education is sin " in the local @entity277 language , and the group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity282 law across @entity284 's most populous nation , which is split between a majority @entity286 north and a mostly @entity289 south
the @entity35 has branded @entity4 a terror organization and has put a $ 7 million bounty on the group 's elusive leader , @entity292
a man claiming to be @entity292 appeared in a video announcing he would sell his victims
the video was first obtained monday by @entity298
" i abducted your girls
i will sell them in the market , by @entity302 , " he said
" there is a market for selling humans
@entity302 says i should sell
he commands me to sell
