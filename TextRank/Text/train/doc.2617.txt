-- it has become a commonplace that it is hard to comprehend the disaster in @entity5
if so , and if we hope to provide @entity5 with anything like the help that they need , then we must understand where our minds fail us
one problem that we do not yet face is having our compassion numbed by the sheer magnitude of the calamity
indeed , it has evoked a deep visceral response , as we see graphic images of individual suffering on a background of mass devastation
when our local tea store is devoting 20 percent of sales to relief and cell phone donations keep pouring in , the scope of the tragedy is mobilizing , not paralyzing
the threat to our compassion comes , rather , from feeling ineffective
we risk that failure if we can not grasp the realities facing @entity5
here , we face two deep mental challenges
one is that we must struggle to comprehend how many interdependent threads of @entity5 's social fabric have been ripped apart
people lost family , friends and communities in an instant
children were orphaned in a nation already struggling to care for many orphans
hospitals , factories and government agencies disappeared
essential aid organizations lost brave people and resources
communications and transportation were ruined , including the port that brings almost all goods into the nation
here , imagining ourselves in the @entity5 ' plight might help
can we imagine trying to recover , if our country faced the most massive disaster in its history , without work , food , medicine , transportation , commerce or government ? the second challenge is that our minds also struggle to reason quantitatively about events beyond our normal experience
here , a back - of - the - envelope calculation might help
assume , plausibly , that everything that 3 million @entity5 need must be brought in from outside their country for a period of time
assume that each @entity5 needs 5 pounds of goods per day ( food , water , medical supplies , soap , cooking fuel , the gasoline needed to distribute these supplies and more )
assume that everything must be flown in ( at least until the port can be reopened )
that means 15 million pounds ( 7,500 tons ) of airfreight per day
if a cargo plane can carry 75 tons , then that means 100 flights per day , or one plane landing every 15 minutes , then having its goods unloaded and distributed to victims across the country
one way to understand what those numbers mean is by analogy
the @entity99 was another crisis that required a massive mobilization to supply an isolated population in desperate need
@entity104 was cut off by a hostile power , rather than by an ocean
it was devastated by war rather than by an earthquake
its 2 million citizens needed roughly 5,000 tons of goods per day , delivered through limited entry points , over distances comparable to those of @entity5 's island neighbors
the airlift required an unprecedented logistics operation , which @entity121 and @entity120 authorities believed impossible
it encountered serious organizational problems in coordinating @entity125 forces among themselves and with our allies
it drew resources from other military theaters
it was enormously expensive , in both money and the lives of aviators
in some ways , supplying @entity5 is easier
technology is vastly improved and the world much wealthier
but in other ways , supplying @entity5 is even more difficult than the @entity99
@entity104 was occupied territory , under @entity141 military rule ; while @entity5 has little functioning government , and those trying to help are struggling to work out their division of labor
if we are not thinking in terms of an effort as massive and risky as the @entity99 , then we have not gotten our minds around the problem
unless we grasp the complexity and magnitude of the task , then we may be expecting brave , dedicated relief workers to do the impossible -- and be disappointed when they can not do it all
as a nation , we may fail to support our leaders in providing the sustained resources that the mission requires
if our collective imagination and our sense of history fail us , then we will not achieve the results that our compassion demands -- and will fail @entity5 and its people in their long , difficult road to recovery
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 and @entity172 .
