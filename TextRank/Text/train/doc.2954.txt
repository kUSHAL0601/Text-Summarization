-- sandwiched between @entity1 and @entity2 -- two of the world 's busiest metropolises -- lies a @entity7 - era anomaly : a 26 square kilometer green zone that is home to isolated villages , fishponds and flocks of migratory birds
little more than 50m to the north , beyond the mesh fence and barbed wire that mark the border between mainland @entity19 and the @entity1 , the skyscrapers of @entity2 loom incongruously over the wetlands and vegetable patches of the @entity22
established in 1951 after the @entity24 placed colonial @entity1 in the frontline of a @entity28 embargo against the @entity19 , the buffer zone was created to stop illegal immigrants , smugglers and spies
sixty years later and the @entity22 has long since passed its useful life , leaving behind a natural habitat largely untouched by humans and some of the most valuable undeveloped real estate in the world
last month , the @entity1 government launched the first stage of a large - scale reduction in the area of the zone , allowing public access to 740 hectares of the 2,800 hectare cordon
previously , tourists and non-residents needed permits to enter the zone and the estimated 9,500 people living inside the area were required to flash special passes to take transport into the frontier area
while the move represents a further step in the integration of @entity1 -- until 1997 a @entity59 colony -- with mainland @entity19 , at a local level a spat is brewing over the future use of the valuable stretch of land
villagers from @entity64 , a hamlet of little more than 150 people which will remain within the closed area until 2015 , claim the government 's plan to turn the area into a " green buffer " will interfere with their right to develop property they have owned for generations
while the rest of @entity1 is riding a boom , property prices in the @entity22 have been depressed for decades
as the temperature of the debate ramps up , @entity64 residents have told @entity1 government meetings they will fight land use plans for the @entity22 in the same way they fought and resisted the @entity84 during the war
@entity64 village chief @entity86 told local media the residents of the zone are not against plans for a green heritage zone , but he believed there should be plenty of room for tourism - related projects
" after our section of the @entity99 is fully opened to the public , we hope the government will step forward and give us the necessary support for tourism and agricultural development , " he told @entity96
under a feasibility study undertaken by the @entity1 @entity106 , with the help of global engineering giants @entity108 , the government envisages a public - private partnership to create a combined conservation and eco-tourism zone involving low - density private residential and passive recreation development
while the study does not envisage large - scale development in the zone , it does not rule it out in the future depending on @entity1 's population and economic pressures
already conservationists have expressed concern over the fate of wetlands in the zone which make up part of the @entity129 - @entity128 flyway -- a corridor for migratory birds
as many as 10 species of globally endangered birds use this wetlands , according to conservation group @entity135
while half the wetlands fall within the protected area of the @entity139 and @entity141 nature reserve , the other half is in part of the @entity22 that could be earmarked for development
ecologists fear that if the integrity of the continuous habitat is interrupted , the whole system could be under threat
conservation manager at the @entity150 , @entity151 , says the pressure from land - hungry @entity1 -- which has some of the highest land and property prices in the world -- means any conservation programs for the area would need to be strongly policed
in the past , @entity1 developers have used illegal tactics such as tree - felling , landfill and land excavation to degrade land , later lodging development applications that claim the area had little or no conservation value
" our biggest concern is unauthorized development , " @entity151 told @entity0
" much of this area is out of sight of the general public
it 's very difficult for the government to monitor it
