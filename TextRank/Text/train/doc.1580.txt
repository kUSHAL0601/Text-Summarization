@entity0 -- four people in the @entity3 , including a journalist at @entity7 newspaper , have been charged in a police probe into alleged payments for newspaper stories involving the royal family , @entity3 prosecutors said wednesday
they will appear before @entity13 on may 8
their cases stem from @entity16 , a police probe into " allegations involving the unlawful provision of information by public officials to journalists
" one of the men charged is @entity24 , royal editor at @entity7 , @entity3 's best - selling tabloid and part of @entity28 's @entity27 empire
he faces a charge of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office
@entity33 and @entity34 , who worked at the @entity36 military academy during the time @entity37 and @entity38 were based there , also are charged with conspiracy to commit public misconduct in office
@entity33 served as a color sergeant at @entity36 and @entity34 is his wife
" it is alleged that from 10 february 2006 to 15 october 2008 , 34 payments were made to either @entity33 or @entity34 totaling over Â £ 23,000 for stories relating mainly to the @entity49 or matters at @entity36 , " prosecutors said in a statement
the fourth is @entity52 , a @entity53 pharmacy assistant at the @entity36 medical center , who is charged with one count of misconduct in public office
" it is alleged that @entity52 received Â £ 1,250 between 17 october 2005 and 7 july 2006 relating to five articles published in @entity7 regarding matters at @entity36 , " the prosecutors said
@entity0 's @entity61 is running @entity16 parallel to a probe into claims that @entity3 journalists hacked people 's voice mails to get stories
the two investigations were set up in the wake of the scandal over an allegation that in 2002 , the voice mail of a missing 13 - year - old girl , @entity75 , was hacked by an investigator working for the @entity78 newspaper before she was found murdered
the furor led to the closure of @entity81 's sunday tabloid , the @entity78 , in 2011
dozens of arrests have been made in connection with the two inquiries
an executive editor at @entity7 , @entity87 , was charged last week for alleged illegal payments to a public official
@entity87 is due at @entity13 on the same day as the four people charged wednesday
' collective amnesia ' separately , the @entity3 police watchdog released the findings wednesday of its inquiry into @entity96 's handling of the hacking of @entity75 's voice mail
@entity96 officers appear to be " afflicted by a form of collective amnesia " in relation to the force 's failure to investigate an allegation in 2002 that the @entity78 had hacked the teenager 's phone , said the @entity108
no action was taken to investigate the claim despite it being known about at all levels , the @entity108 said
" we will never know what would have happened had @entity96 carried out an investigation into the hacking of @entity75 's phone in 2002 , " said @entity112 , @entity108 deputy chairwoman , in a statement
" phone hacking was a crime and this should have been acted upon , if not in 2002 , then later , once the @entity78 's widespread use of phone hacking became a matter of public knowledge and concern
" @entity96 has since apologized to the @entity128 family
