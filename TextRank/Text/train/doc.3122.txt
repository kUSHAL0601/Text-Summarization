-- it 's early in the morning on a sunny mid-january day and @entity3 primary school is buzzing once again
cheers and laughter fill the schoolyard as groups of arriving pupils line up in rows under a big red kiosk
after a long summer break , it 's back to school time -- and rules need repeating
" the school starts at 10 to eight , " principal @entity15 reminds the students sporting immaculate blue and crimson uniforms
" you are supposed to be here by half past seven , " he continues , " so no late - coming because we have now started
" @entity3 primary is a no - fee school at the heart of the @entity29 township , some 20 minutes north of @entity32 's administrative capital city @entity30
this is a disadvantaged area , ringed by informal settlements where poverty and @entity37 prevalence is high

but now , thanks to the hard work and determination of its principal , the school has become the pride of the region -- @entity15 has transformed @entity3 into a model institution that is one of the top performing schools in the country
" every year we are making an improvement and this is what actually made more parents say ' i am taking my child to @entity63 primary school , ' " says @entity15
" and yes , we want to change everything but it 's not possible to accommodate every learner
" @entity15 's remarkable achievements have been acknowledged by his peers with several awards , including a win at @entity32 's @entity72 recognizing his excellence in primary school leadership
" i firmly believe that nothing yields better results than working very hard , " says @entity15
" you 've got to work very hard for you to achieve anything and this is what i am striving throughout the way
" from gardener to top educator most of @entity15 's students , aged five to 12 , come from very poor homes , much the same as he did
the award - winning educator was raised in a single parent family by a domestic worker mother
poverty prevented him from staying in school so @entity15 went on to become a gardener , paying for his education with the money he made -- @entity15 did his bachelor of arts at the @entity98 before gaining a @entity99 from the @entity100 and a phd from the @entity102 , to name just a few of his educational qualifications

" most of the people think when you are a principal , you are coming from a well - to - do family , " says @entity15
" it 's not like that , " he adds
" it 's how prepared are you , how do you see life -- you 've got to see life beyond where you are and nothing is impossible
this is what i tell everybody , especially my children at school : if you want to achieve something , nobody will actually stand in your place
it 's you who can turn things around
" changing lives @entity15 says one of the ways he manages to ensure his school keeps on achieving great results is to continually upgrade the facility and make sure his pupils have access to competitive teaching materials -- from new display boards and books to functional computers and bigger classrooms
government schools struggle to maintain standards on the amounts of financial aid they receive from the education department
this has prompted @entity15 to often turn elsewhere -- especially in the local business community -- to find support for his initiatives
" i do n't ask a donation or a sponsorship but i want to partner with this people , " he says
" as a partnership , there is a common goal that we want to achieve and that is education
and of course many people are eager as long as they see that the school is doing well
you 've got to show people how well are you prepared and what is it that you are doing and probably they will assist you
" and although @entity15 is sometimes frustrated by the challenges he faces as he tries to keep his school in top shape , he refuses to give up
" i do n't fold my arms , and then sit and cry , i am going out and doing something , " he says
" and it 's only that my resources are limited but i am prepared to go extra mile -- should i get any resource i would make it to the fullest and i think i would be able to change the lives of this community around
