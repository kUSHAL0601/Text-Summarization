@entity3 insists that her real identity is @entity20 , an android traveling through space and time to escape destruction ordered because she fell in love with a human , a fatal infraction of robots ' rules
along the way , she 's making music that moves into the future while drawing from decades past
" it is cool , futuristic soul with a real ' 80s quality , " said @entity32 , a disc jockey at @entity0 , @entity1 , radio station @entity34
@entity32 spotted @entity38 three years ago , and he 's been watching her like an astronomer tracking the approach of a distant comet destined to light @entity44 's sky
" i believe she 's going to be a household name in the next year or two , " said @entity32 , a self - described " champion of the underdog " who is credited with giving @entity47 and @entity48 early radio airplay
@entity38 -- the human -- is a striking combination of voice , style , imagination and fearlessness that defies conventional description , making it easier to buy into the fantasy of @entity61 the android
when her song " @entity66 " was nominated for a @entity67 in december , it was in the urban / alternative category
if @entity70 is an android from the future , her musical programming included the past
@entity32 compared her " very fluid , very pleasing " voice to @entity75 , circa 1976
at a @entity0 show this month , she mixed 20th - century classics with her own futuristic songs
@entity3 delivered a sweet version of @entity81 's " smile " while standing atop a barstool
senior citizens danced the " twist " when her band broke out into the @entity85 ' 1964 hit " @entity86
" she loves timeless music , @entity3 said after her show
" we look to a lot of people whose bodies are dead and gone , but their spirit is still with us , " @entity3 said
her choreography borrows from @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , with dance moves from the future
@entity3 -- or @entity61 -- thinks she can fly
she jumped head - first into the audience , " crowd surfing " the unlikely mosh pit in @entity106 's @entity105
@entity70 's name on @entity108 and you 'll see her jumping into swimming pools to end her shows
she climbed a tree in @entity113 -- after her swim
unlike some performers , her talent matches @entity70 's onstage antics , @entity32 said
" it 's one thing for her to perform a certain way , but she backs with it up with talent , " he said
@entity3 's android - on - the - run theme , reminiscent of the 1982 movie " @entity124 , " reminds @entity32 " of all the great albums from the past that had a story and concept attached
" " she was just kind of like bored with everything else going on , and she wanted to transcend it and tell a story , " he said
@entity3 said she is not following a formula , that she is " being led by my maker
" " i 'm very similar to a terminal , " she said
@entity70 will inevitably capture the world 's attention because she is " outshining a lot of what 's happening in the mainstream , " @entity32 said
that time may be near
