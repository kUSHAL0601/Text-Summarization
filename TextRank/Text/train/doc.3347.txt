@entity0 -- home is the hardest place to find for children of immigrants , but for us , nothing hits closer to home than when a bomb goes off in @entity10
last week , just days after @entity13 troops pulled out of @entity14 , 63 people died and 176 were wounded in @entity10
as the son of @entity14 who left home in the late ' 70s , i find fleeting moments of hope that seldom return to me
the withering memories of my last visit to @entity22 play like broken records in my mind
i remember our grandparents ' home , my uncle 's dog and the size of the tires on his jeep
i remember the smell distinctly but i ca n't put it into words
i remember feeling small ; after all i was only 5
i have watched @entity14 's tragedies only through television or the internet for more than 20 years now
we make frantic fuzzy phone calls to @entity14 , the voices on the other end are lost in reception ; there is no awe in their shock
my aunt said that it felt like " hell opened loose " this past thursday , heat lingering in the air as it rose from the rubble and twisted metal around @entity10
the violence follows @entity14 ' sense of security like the ghost of @entity59 past
as we hang up the phone with our families , we are all wondering : where do we go from here ? with troops reaching home in time for the holidays , many are asking why they were there in the first place ? we should have asked ourselves these questions many years ago
my cousin grew up with my grandparents in @entity14
as a child of the late eighties , he saw war for much of two decades coming out of their front door
i had the privilege of a selfish teenage rebellion in @entity0 , as a voyeur into the war , watching news on our television
in the process , we were both detached from each other 's realities
we spent some time together in the @entity86 , after my maternal family had the rare opportunity to leave @entity14 in 2005 , drained by the successive wars pounding on their chests
the decades of bombings had taken its toll , far too often carrying bad news to those in the diaspora , sending ripples back through the hearts of all @entity14
those same bombs did something to my cousin
one night , we sat down and watched a movie together , something i had never done with him before
as a car exploded on the screen , his immediate reflex was to cover his ears and close his eyes
he was transported back home , and i was lost
the contrast in our perspectives on life riddled me with guilt
some of us take so much for granted
i switched the tv off
in the @entity121 area of @entity10 , a local women 's @entity118 is offering an awareness seminar for widows
my sister - in - law returned from @entity10 last week , with pictures from the seminar
most of the mothers and daughters , sometimes both widowed , lost their husbands in violence in 2007 and 2008
what is left of their homes is a fragmented family structure , compounded with the damage from decades of sanctions and mass exodus , lack of infrastructure , broken education systems and bouts of political corruption
i could n't help but think about the future of the forgotten children of @entity14
that is what war is to me
war is the leftover pain in our hearts and souls
that detachment from home ; trying to reach for safety
as @entity14 ran home from the violence and explosions in neighborhoods such as @entity160 , they could n't cover their ears and eyes
there is no remote control for @entity10
most of your returning soldiers still feel that pain in their hearts
nothing good came out of this war
there is no victory in any violence
with staggering body counts surfacing , and a possible link to rising cancer and birth defect rates , where do you start looking for justice ? where do we stand as an international body of people , looking for a new , positive outlook on our future ? what a year
we 've streamed so - called leaders ' deaths in @entity189 on our cell phones , become obsessed with @entity191 and our children are playing @entity193 holding the fate of digital @entity195 in their little hands
movies are being made about @entity14 as the news unfolds , blurring the lines of reality
the problems this generation are facing feel so big , you start feeling powerless
sometimes , i still feel small when i think of @entity14
where do @entity14 go next ? @entity14 's chance at a " spring " was robbed and their neighbors are losing balance
whatever you do @entity13 , remember them in your prayers this @entity213 season with your kids
as the children of @entity10 ask , " when will the war really be over ? " there is always hope in our youth
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .
