-- army sgt. @entity1 survived two tours of duty in @entity4 -- only to be killed back home , allegedly by her boyfriend
now , eight months later , her family is mourning again because they ca n't keep two @entity10 memorials at her gravesite
to say @entity12 loved the cartoon character may be an understatement
" every year , my sister had a @entity10 birthday party , " @entity12 's twin sister @entity15 said
" everything she had was spongebob
" even her curtains and bathroom were decked out with the underwater fry cook 's image , her mother told @entity0 affiliate @entity24
" the funeral home actually bought the pillow of @entity10 and we asked if they could put it in her casket , " @entity25 said
so the family decided to spend $ 26,000 on two massive @entity10 monuments at @entity12 's gravesite -- one in an @entity38 uniform for @entity12 , and another in a @entity40 uniform to honor @entity15 , an it specialist for the @entity40
each of the monuments stands more than 6 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds
before the family ordered the @entity10 memorials , it got the go - ahead from a cemetery representative , @entity25 said
" they came and said , ' yeah , we can go ahead and do @entity10
' she gave us a statement , we signed a contract , and then they started the design , " the mother told @entity24
the stone @entity10 finally arrived on october 10
but less than a day later , @entity57 in @entity58 said it was going to remove the statues
" the family chose a design with the guidance of a @entity57 employee who unfortunately made an error in judgment , " the cemetery 's president told @entity0
" the monument does not fit within @entity57 guidelines , was not approved by senior management and can not remain here
" @entity12 's family is devastated
" it was just heartbreaking , " @entity25 said
" i just felt we were just trying to honor her wishes
" the family is going to meet with officials from the cemetery on tuesday
@entity57 said it is working with the @entity80 to design a solution at the cemetery 's expense " that will properly memorialize @entity1
