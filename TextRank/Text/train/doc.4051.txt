@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's a question that i have asked myself for a long time
why ca n't @entity5 produce a top golfer ? @entity7 was the only @entity5 golfer to make the cut at the recent @entity5 masters
the weather is great , courses are popping up all over the country , and still , they do n't have a single player in the top 400 of the world rankings
on the surface , it might not make sense , but if you dig a little a deeper , like i had a chance to do during a recent @entity23 report in the @entity24 , there are plenty of reasons why golf is n't taking off among the locals
the most shocking statistic of all is that in the whole country there is not a single public golf course
this means if you want to play , you have to become a member of a club or pay something in the region of 100 euros ( $ 137 ) for a round of golf
considering the minimum salary in @entity5 is under 400 euros a month , it becomes clear the vast majority of @entity5 people simply ca n't afford it
this means most of the people out on golf courses in @entity5 are foreign , and while this is great for tourism , it 's doing nothing to help the grass roots of the game in the country
another issue is that the sport is seen as elitist and is not part of the nation 's sporting culture
there is great passion among @entity5 's youngsters , as there is in many @entity64 countries , for football
and though people play other sports , and you can get lessons in sports like golf , there is an almost complete lack of interest -- no - one really talks about golf
what the country really needs is a golfing superstar to kick - start a revolution and inspire the new generation -- a @entity81 of golf
the @entity82 says the tide is turning and they claim they are doing their best to invest in young amateur players
they also have allies with some of the private investors who have built golf courses in @entity5 sponsoring some of the nation 's top prospects
@entity90 is an example of this , with the company that has built seven courses in the @entity24 backing three of @entity5 's five professionals
the more organizations that invest in up - and - coming golfers like this , the more chance @entity5 will have in producing the next @entity101
there could yet be hope for golf in the country , but it will take more investment , more time and a figure to unite an otherwise football obsessed country around a relatively neglected sport
watch @entity113 examine @entity5 's golf scene on this month 's @entity23 , which airs thursday , november 6 , 1400 , 1830 ; saturday , november 8 , 0800 , 1830 sunday ; november 9 , 0400 , 0830 , 1430 ( all times gmt ) .
