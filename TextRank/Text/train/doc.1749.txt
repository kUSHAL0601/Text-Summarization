@entity0 , @entity1 -- police were searching tuesday for a gun used in the fatal shooting of a top regional politician , killed in a brazen attack in broad daylight that has shaken @entity1
prime minister @entity9 went to the northern city of @entity11 to attend the funeral of the politician , @entity13 , 59 , who had held various regional posts in @entity9 's ruling conservative @entity15
officials say two women , a mother , 55 , and her daughter , 35 , were arrested soon after the shooting monday in @entity11 , and the suspected motive is revenge
the daughter was let go in 2011 from a provincial government office headed by the slain politician , and she recently had pay disputes with the office while working as an outside contractor , officials said
in addition , the two suspects are the wife and daughter of a senior national police officer in the small nearby city of @entity36
he told investigators that he was in possession of his police - issued firearm , and it was not thought to have been used in the shooting , officials said
@entity13 was walking on a pedestrian footbridge around 5 p.m. local time when shot
she collapsed and died at the scene
other people were in the area , including a retired national police officer , who helped lead police quickly to the suspects , who had fled , and by some accounts , threw the gun into the river below
the search for the gun includes the river and other areas , officials said
tests on the hands of the two suspects have not revealed who may have fired the weapon
officials did not immediately say what caliber or type it was
@entity13 was walking to the @entity15 's provincial headquarters and was due to attend a campaign rally that day for the @entity72 parliamentary elections on may 25
campaigning across @entity1 for that election was suspended monday and the only face - to - face debate between the conservative and opposition @entity76 candidates was postponed from its scheduled time on tuesday evening
firearms are difficult to obtain legally in @entity1 , and fatal shootings are uncommon
in the northwest town of @entity83 , a @entity76 councilman was forced to resign late monday after posting a comment to her @entity87 page regarding the death of @entity13 that was widely deemed inappropriate , a town spokeswoman said .
