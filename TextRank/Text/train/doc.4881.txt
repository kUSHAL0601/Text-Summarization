@entity0 , @entity1 -- gen. @entity3 , the outgoing top commander of the @entity5 forces in @entity1 , formally transferred authority monday to incoming commander @entity7 gen. @entity7
several senior @entity1 and @entity5 officials , including @entity10 chairman of the @entity11 adm. @entity12 , attended the change - of - command ceremony in @entity0
" throughout , we will keep our eyes on the horizon -- the future of @entity1 , " @entity7 told the audience , " a nation of free people at peace , governed under its constitution , pursuing economic enterprise and development , in a secure and stable environment free from the extremism and terrorism that has plagued this wonderful country and its people for more than a generation
in the end -- together we will prevail
" he inherits a force that is coming under renewed attack just as @entity5 prepares to begin the first phase of handing over provincial security to @entity1 security forces
on monday , three service members with the @entity5 - led @entity40 were killed in a blast in eastern @entity1
their deaths bring to 34 the number of international troops who have died in @entity1 in july
. since the start of this year , 314 coalition soldiers have died in the country
for his part , @entity3 plans to retire from the @entity49 at the end of august and assume the @entity53 director 's job september 6
" i wanted this job , " @entity3 , 58 , said at his @entity55 confirmation hearing
" i am taking off the uniform i have worn for 37 years to do this the right way
" dubbed @entity60 for turning around what seemed like a losing battle as top @entity10 commander in @entity64 before he went to @entity1 , @entity3 is considered a top general in his era , with @entity67 naming him one of the most influential people of the 21st century
he took over in @entity1 on july 4 last year unexpectedly after a @entity70 magazine article prompted the resignation of gen. @entity72
" we 've jokingly said that i went to the @entity74 for the monthly @entity76 meeting on @entity1 and @entity77 with president @entity78 , and came out with a new job , " @entity3 said
" and that 's not far from the truth
" the @entity10 military is losing the architect of modern - day counterinsurgency operations
@entity3 wrote his doctorate dissertation on the lessons @entity10 learned in @entity87
later , he devised the @entity49 / @entity7 field manual , challenging the military to think differently about how it relates to the civilian population in dealing with a bloody insurgency
this week , ahead of his departure , @entity3 assessed the results of his strategy in @entity1
" what we have done is implement the so - called @entity5 comprehensive approach , a civil - military campaign ... that does indeed embody many of the principles of the counterinsurgency field manual that we developed back in 2006 , and which we employed in @entity64 in the surge of 2007 - 2008 , " he said in an interview with @entity96
" i think generally , it has borne fruit
" he said it has been a difficult journey , rife with setbacks , but coalition forces have halted the momentum of the @entity111 in much of the country and reversed the insurgent hold in restive @entity115 province
@entity3 ' experience in working with the @entity53 on counterinsurgency efforts in the field was cited as a reason for his nomination as the spy agency 's director
@entity2 's @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .
