-- @entity1 did n't officially start until monday , but @entity2 was already getting the lion 's share of the buzz here on the show floor , with its glasses-less @entity7
the device was announced sunday night , and people flocked to the demonstration in a dark makeshift theater monday , where the wait was nearly an hour
the reason ? because finally , mercifully , a tv maker has come up with a way to watch @entity7 at home without those ridiculous plastic glasses
there were three sizes on display : 12 inches , 20 inches , and 56 inches
while the smaller size models are destined for the @entity24 market in december , the 56 - incher is just a prototype and there are no imminent plans to make it into an actual product , according to a @entity2 representative here
the @entity31 uses the @entity32 that takes a @entity34 image and then simultaneously creates nine images of it from nine different directions , in real time
it 's displayed on a high - definition @entity40
@entity0 : watch an explanation video of how the technology works after spending some time in the theater , we found the tv works surprisingly well
it 's not a @entity7 cinema - quality experience , and there 's clearly room to improve , but again , you do n't have to wear any glasses
still images fare better than moving images
and you have to sit ( though we stood during the demo ) very close to the center of the screen to get the effect
with the 12 - inch version , move more than a few inches to the left or right and the 3d effect is lost
however , the viewing angle was better on the 20 - inch model , and the best on the 56 - inch one
and there 's another matter of practicality : to get the best effect , you have to stand pretty close to the @entity40 , closer than any normal person would want to for fear singeing their retinas
that 's why the glasses-less @entity7 laptop , a @entity75 , is a far more realistic application of the glasses-less technology : it 's the same size as the 12 - inch tv , but since it 's natural to sit very close to a laptop and look at it straight on , the aforementioned problems are negated
the 12 - inch @entity7 goes on sale in @entity24 at the end of this year for 120,000 yen , or $ 1,500
the 20 - inch will have a 240,000 yen price tag , or about $ 2,900
sorry , rest of the world , you 'll have to wait , since there 's no timetable for bringing either to other markets
