@entity0 -- three @entity4 men are charged with violating voting rights , accused of assaulting african - americans after @entity8 's win in the november presidential election , authorities said wednesday
a grand jury indicted @entity11 , 18 , @entity12 , 18 , and @entity13 , 21 , on charges of conspiracy to interfere with voting rights
all three pleaded not guilty in federal court wednesday afternoon
according to the indictment , the three " knowingly and intentionally " conspired to intimidate african - americans " in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right ... and because of having so exercised that right , to wit , the right to vote
" @entity11 and @entity13 are white , and @entity12 is @entity24
they face up to 10 years in prison if convicted
at the arraignment , @entity11 and @entity12 were ordered held without bail , while @entity13 was released on a $ 200,000 bond but ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device
@entity12 ' attorney , public defender @entity31 , could not be reached for comment
@entity11 's attorney , @entity33 , had no comment
prosecutors said in court filings that on the night of november 4 , the defendants were at a " makeshift outdoor clubhouse " in the @entity40 section of @entity4 when they learned of @entity8 's victory
at that point , prosecutors said , @entity11 drove @entity12 , @entity13 and another friend to the predominantly african - american @entity46 neighborhood in @entity4
their purpose , prosecutors said , was to assault african - americans because of @entity8 's win
their first victim , according to the @entity52 , was 17 - year - old @entity54 , whom they beat with a metal pipe and a collapsible police baton
@entity54 escaped after suffering a concussion and injuries to his legs
" the first swing that swung -- it hit my head
it cut my head , " @entity54 told @entity1 affiliate @entity64
" i got staples on my head now
" @entity54 said he hid in a neighbor 's backyard until the boys moved on
continuing to the @entity73 section of @entity4 , the group assaulted a second @entity75 - @entity75 man , pushing him down , the federal prosecutors alleged
they then allegedly accosted a @entity24 man , demanding to know how he voted , and shouted profanities about @entity8 at a group of african - americans at a hair salon
next , prosecutors said , the group targeted @entity82 , a man they mistakenly believed to be @entity75 who was walking along @entity83 in predominantly @entity84
@entity82 is white , but because he was wearing a hoodie , the men were unable to identify his race and assumed that he was african - american
according to the indictment , the men decided to assault @entity82 with the police baton as they drove by , but at the last moment , @entity11 swerved the vehicle directly into the 38 - year - old man instead
@entity82 was thrown onto the hood of the car , shattering the front windshield
according to @entity4 @entity98 ( silive.com ) , @entity82 was in a coma for 45 days , returning to his family 's home in @entity102 in mid-december , said his mother , @entity103
she added that her son now has serious brain damage and motor control problems
" he 's not good
he 's never going to be good , " she said
" every day , i just see something different , and it 's so scary
" @entity109 attorney @entity108 decried the attacks
" violence and intimidation aimed at interfering with the constitutional rights of every citizen , including the right to vote , will not be tolerated , " he said in a written statement
according to the @entity52 , @entity11 has an extensive history of violent criminal activity including burglary , car break - ins , firebombing , assault , and marijuana and cocaine distribution
he is also a member of the " @entity125 " ( @entity126 ) founded by his now - incarcerated younger brother , @entity127
investigators found a cache of weapons and police batons stolen from vehicles owned by police , as well as letters from @entity11 's brother urging @entity11 to maintain @entity126 loyalty and not cooperate with authorities
@entity11 and three others approached @entity12 three weeks ago at his house , believing he was cooperating with authorities , according to a filing with the @entity52
they allegedly attacked him and called him a snitch , according to a letter from assistant @entity109 attorneys @entity145 and @entity146 to the judge in the case
the letter petitions for home confinement , drug testing and other pretrial release conditions for @entity11 and @entity13
the judge has not responded to the request
@entity1 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .
