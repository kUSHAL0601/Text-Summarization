@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the window opened for @entity1 's latest rocket launch opened thursday morning , the nation 's neighbors were watching developments at the remote base nervously
@entity10 patriot missile defense systems scanned the clear skies in @entity12 and an air base in @entity14 , underlining the regional tensions
'' we would like to call ( on @entity1 ) for restraint until the very end , " @entity10 prime minister @entity19 said outside his office as he arrived thursday , according to news agency @entity21
he added , " we are fully prepared to deal with any contingency , " the news agency reported
@entity10 has threatened to shoot down the @entity1 rocket if it is seen threatening its territory
@entity25 has described the move as a " grave provocation " and says it will respond with " appropriate countermeasures
" the announcement last month of the satellite launch -- which countries like the @entity32 and @entity25 see as a cover for a ballistic missile test -- ratcheted up tensions in the region and prompted @entity37 to suspend a recent deal to supply food aid to the @entity1
" this launch will give credence to the view that @entity1 leaders see improved relations with the outside world as a threat to the existence of their system , " @entity32 secretary of state @entity40 said in a speech tuesday
" and recent history strongly suggests that additional provocations may follow
" the @entity53 and @entity25 have ordered commercial planes and fishermen to stay clear of the rockets proposed path over the next few days
@entity1 has said that it plans to launch its rocket sometime between thursday and monday , between the hours of 7 a.m. and noon ( 6 p.m. -11 p.m. wednesday - sunday in the @entity32 @entity59 )
@entity1 says it has started fueling a long - range rocket in final - stage preparation , a senior national space official said wednesday
fueling will be completed at the " appropriate time , " said @entity65 , head of the @entity66 and @entity67
he declined to be more specific
@entity1 says the rocket will put a satellite in orbit
a recent report from @entity25 intelligence officials claimed that @entity1 is planning a new nuclear test in the area where it staged previous atomic blasts
the report noted that the two previous rocket launches that @entity0 said were intended to put satellites into orbit were followed a few weeks or months later by nuclear tests
international leaders have urged @entity1 to cancel the launch , but @entity0 has refused to back down , insisting that the operation is for peaceful purposes
the last time @entity0 carried out what it described as a satellite launch , in april 2009 , the @entity84 condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated
the announcement of the fueling was made on the same day as a conference of the @entity1 ruling @entity91 that began to cement the position of the secretive state 's new leader
@entity1 television showed a somber @entity98 standing beneath two towering statues of his father and grandfather while receiving applause from party functionaries and the military
the meeting of party delegates and the controversial launch come as the nation prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity112 , the founder of @entity1 who ruled the communist state for more than four decades
his birthday on april 15 , known as the " @entity116 , " is a key public holiday in the @entity1 calendar
at the conference , the late former leader @entity119 was given an everlasting title
he is now eternal general secretary of the @entity122
current leader @entity98 was named the first secretary of the @entity122
the title appears to be a newly created position that sets the table for a virtual coronation of @entity98 , says @entity1 watcher @entity128 of the @entity37 - based @entity129
" creating this new position is sort of like retiring a jersey number for a famous baseball player , " said @entity128
" it shows a deference to his father and to the old guard , while still cementing his control on power
" @entity1 announced several other titles for @entity98 , including making him a member of the @entity141 of the @entity142 and chairman of the @entity144
@entity98 is already described as the supreme leader of the party , state and army
but it is still unclear how directly the young @entity112 , thought to be in his late 20s , is involved in policy decisions
" this move fully parallels what happened with his father , " said @entity128
" @entity119 is now venerated at the same level as his father , buried in the same tomb and they are making statues of them riding together on horseback
" " but @entity98 never got the on - the - job training his father did , so he may have this title to allow some mentoring or sharing power and decisions with his elders
" @entity2 's @entity166 contributed to this report .
