-- in the latest " x-men " film , @entity1 levitates @entity3 and drops it around the @entity4 ; the stadium is destroyed
in " @entity7 , " the monster fights off what looks like the entire @entity10 military while he flattens both @entity12 and @entity13
and in the new @entity16 film , " @entity24 , " @entity14 is left underwater after an alien attack , and a futuristic @entity19 - like invasion leaves a @entity21 beach strewn with dead bodies and smoldering war materiel
there 's plenty more mayhem to come as this season 's glut of blow - ' em - up flicks rolls out : " transformers : @entity32 " ( aliens drop a cruise liner on a city ) , " @entity43 " ( outer space vehicles liquefied by the dozens ) , " @entity44 " ( the title character fights off lions , sea monsters and a whole army of bad guys ) and " @entity45 " ( @entity46 and gang ; train rams into prison )
@entity50 recently referred to it as " the summer of destruction
" but let 's call it what it is : destruction porn
like real porn , these movies play to our most atavistic instincts
they all include some sort of buildup , the titillation of expectation that really bad , but cool , things are about to happen
they generally climax -- pun intended -- with a massive set piece of @entity71 carnage
and like real porn , afterwards we 're supposed to feel deliriously fulfilled and exhausted
fact is , we should hate ourselves for feeling this way , as if we 'd just had really bad sex
but that 's not the reaction destruction porn elicits
even worse , we 're exporting this @entity10 blood - lust globally , giving outsiders the impression of a country that has totally gone over to the @entity81
it 's not as if there has n't been massive carnage in the movies before this
@entity87 has produced plenty of war films , ecological disaster flicks and alien invasion epics in the past
but the sheer frequency of destruction porn these days -- at least 11 movies of this type in summer 2012 ( " @entity99 , " @entity100 , " etc. ) and 12 during the same season last year ( " @entity101 , " " @entity102 , " etc. ) -- and our delight in seeing things blown up , should make us worry about the mental health of society
movies have always reflected the anxieties of their age
in the 1950s , we had plenty of nuclear paranoia films , often featuring mutated life forms
( can you say " godzilla " ? ) the ' 60s and ' 70s brought us ecological and bio-terror themes in films such as " the @entity116 " and " @entity117
" and later films , like " @entity119 , " reflect an apocalyptic mindset
but the recent spate of films seem to reflect a collective psychic collapse
sure , there are reasons for this : fear of terrorism , the insecurity created by all those mass murders , like the recent episode in @entity132
we feel that world has gotten even more chaotic
that there 's too much of everything
that society has gotten way too complicated , with too many people , too much technology , too many opposing ideologies clashing against each other
it recalls the classic 1959 dystopian novel " @entity148 , " by @entity143 , in which the end of industrial civilization is referred to as " the @entity147
" it 's as if we 're preparing for a global meltdown
and the summertime , when we 're supposed to be mellowing out , is a perfect time for @entity87 to exploit our growing appetite for this kind of carnage
there are two specific reasons for this : most filmgoers are in the under - 40 demographic , looking for a night out away from the heat and to put their brains on pause -- and believe me , there 's nothing more mindless than watching stuff blow up
if it 's photographed lovingly , and with insanely good computer graphics , all the better
the second reason is the importance of the foreign market , which now accounts for nearly 70 % of total box office gross
our global neighbors tend to go for what we do best , which is make big budget films with state - of - the - art special effects , a minimum of dialogue ( explosions speak a universal language ) and lots of mayhem
just to take two recent examples : the just - opened x-men film has grossed $ 168 million in the @entity10 , and twice that much overseas
and the new " @entity190 " flick -- " @entity190 , " no less ! -- has grossed $ 255 million domestically and a whopping $ 454 million overseas
@entity190 : a country where scenes of mass destruction are the norm , and carnage is preferred over peace , love and understanding
is this the kind of negative image of @entity190 we want to export ? and sure , we all know that " it 's only a movie , " but do n't kid yourself : when we get geeked at the leveling of entire cities , it says something about who we are , and where our society is going
and you 'd think after 9/11 and the never - ending mass murders in this country we would be a bit more sensitive to scenes where cities are destroyed and thousands of lives lost , but the opposite seems to have taken place : we wallow in it
like porn , we ca n't take our eyes off it
it 's seductive and incredibly addictive
wish fulfillment ? catharsis ? just good old entertainment ? it really does n't matter
while we 're in the grips of whatever social psychosis is stoking this ravenous appetite for mayhem , @entity87 will be happy to oblige .
