-- @entity2 strugglers @entity1 have sacked manager @entity3 following a poor run of recent results
the 40 - year - old former @entity6 international led @entity1 to promotion from the @entity9 last season , his first at the club
and they continued that good form into the start of the current campaign , notably winning 3 - 2 at @entity14 and earning a 2 - 2 draw at @entity16 -- the only team to avoid defeat at @entity19 this season
their start to the season was so impressive that @entity22 won the @entity23 for september
however , results have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks , and @entity3 was relieved of his duties following saturday 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity28 which left them just one place above the relegation zone in 16th place
a statement on the official club website read : " @entity1 have relieved head coach @entity3 of his duties with immediate effect
" this was the unanimous decision of the football club 's board of directors in light of a worrying sequence of results which has seen the club lose 13 of their last 18 games in all competitions , winning only three
" first - team coach @entity45 will assume control of first - team affairs whilst the club considers all available options for a new head coach
" @entity52 chairman @entity51 added : " this has been a tough decision , but we , as a board , believe it is the right one to give the club the best possible chance of remaining in the @entity2 this decision
