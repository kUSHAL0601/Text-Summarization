@entity0 -- @entity5 's prime minister @entity4 will learn the fate of a controversial law that would shield him from prosecution on thursday , the country 's @entity2 said tuesday
the court heard arguments tuesday about the legality of the " legitimate impediment " law , which would effectively grant top @entity5 government officials immunity while they are in office
the @entity4 - backed law says top government officials can not be prosecuted because their officials duties make it impossible for them to attend court hearings
the law would suspend criminal trials until the official leaves office
the law was approved in march 2010 , but prosecutors in @entity29 challenged the constitutionality of the measure , saying it should be judges , not politicians , who determined whether someone had time to attend court
two separate trials against @entity4 are pending , and a third one is in the works
he 's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case , and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another
both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed
@entity4 has called the charges politically motivated
a third case against the prime minister , also related to tax fraud , is in preliminary stages
@entity4 has been tried on at least 17 separate charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994 , but remains very popular with the @entity5 public
the immunity law was due to expire 18 months after it was passed , which would make it expire in october
the @entity2 can rule it is unconstitutional and strike it down , uphold it , or rule it partially unconstitutional and modify it , @entity5 media reported .
