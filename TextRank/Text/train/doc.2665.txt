-- a @entity2 magazine has been fined for publishing topless photographs of @entity6 's likely future queen , @entity5 , @entity5 , and ordered not to distribute the magazine in print or online , a @entity2 court ruled tuesday
the court ordered closer magazine to hand over the original photos to the royal family within 24 hours of the ruling and to pay them 2,000 euros ( about $ 2,600 )
the magazine must pay a further 10,000 euros a day if it is late in handing over the photos
and a @entity2 prosecutor opened a preliminary criminal investigation into the incident , the @entity19 prosecutor 's office said tuesday
@entity5 and her husband , prince @entity24 , the second in line to the throne , " welcome the injunction that 's been granted
they always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy , " the palace said
@entity2 law provides for " draconian sanctions " to protect against invasions of privacy , @entity6 lawyer @entity34 said , including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines
separately , the board of a newspaper that published the topless photos is conducting an internal investigation
the board of the @entity49 was considering shutting down the newspaper but decided to await the investigation results , which are expected in " a few weeks
" after the @entity49 published the photos saturday , one of the newspaper 's editors was suspended , pending the investigation
the royal family filed a criminal complaint seeking invasion of privacy charges against closer and possibly the photographer , a palace spokeswoman said
the photos of @entity64 are more about invasion of privacy rather than nudity , royal biographer @entity62 said
prince @entity24 and his brother , prince @entity69 , still blame the media for the 1997 death of their mother , princess @entity72 , in a @entity75 traffic accident as her driver fled paparazzi , @entity68 said
@entity2 investigators concluded the driver of the car @entity72 was traveling in lost control while he was intoxicated
the royal family is concerned about similar invasions , particularly if @entity24 and @entity5 have a child , @entity68 said
in a civil court proceeding monday in @entity75 , attorneys for the royals asked for damages and a court order to prevent the photos from being published again
@entity91 : keeping calm and carrying on they also want existing photos taken offline , a palace spokesman said
the court ruled in their favor on both counts tuesday
lawyer @entity101 denounced the published photos in court monday , calling them an infringement of privacy , @entity0 affiliates reported
" it is a scene of married life , intimate , personal , that has nothing to do on a magazine , " @entity101 said
@entity111 , an @entity112 magazine owned by the same company as @entity60 , put out a special edition monday with 26 pages of photos of @entity24 and @entity5 on vacation
as editors at @entity60 did last week , chi executives defended publishing the photos despite the furor from @entity122
" it is a story worth publishing in an extraordinary edition because it shows in a natural light the everyday life of a very famous contemporary young couple in love , " editor - in - chief @entity123 said in a statement
@entity111 and @entity60 are owned by the @entity134 publishing company , which is headed by @entity135 , daughter of former @entity112 prime minister @entity136
opinion : wake up , @entity5 ; photogs are always watching @entity0 's @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , and journalist @entity142 contributed to this report .
