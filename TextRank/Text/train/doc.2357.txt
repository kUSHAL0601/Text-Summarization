-- on the road for 300 days a year , a @entity2 touring troupe of 175 relies on the same precise planning for its travel arrangements as it does for its acrobatic moves and dare devil routines
" right now , we 're in @entity14 , in the @entity15 , and we 're working on making sure we have documents ready for @entity17 , for @entity18 , for @entity19 , because we 're visiting those countries by the end of the year , " said @entity8 , the manager of the @entity11 performing group 's traveling show @entity12
to plan for its visit to each city , one of the first orders of business is finding a place to stay
during their time in @entity14 earlier this year , the cast and crew stayed in the @entity33 area in 85 apartments
" for @entity14 , it 's really nice that we have everyone in the same place , but in @entity41 , we 're in 24 different places , " said @entity35 , the travel and lodging coordinator
he says they work on housing for about three cities at the same time
everyone must pack for all seasons , taking everything they will need all year round
each of these ultimate road warriors is allowed three suitcases -- two to send ahead and one to travel with
" we do n't live in the present -- sometimes it 's sad to say like that -- we really live in the future , " @entity8 said
more than just a circus , @entity12 is a community that includes two physiotherapists and four chefs
teachers provide schooling for the younger performers
for 15 - year - old @entity66 contortionists , it 's straight from math class to warm - ups for the next show
but learning on the road has its benefits , according to @entity72 , one of the teachers
" my student is reading about @entity76 , and we 're going to visit it , " she said .
