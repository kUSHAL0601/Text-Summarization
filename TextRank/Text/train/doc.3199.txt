former @entity3 prisoner @entity2 will meet wednesday with an army general leading the investigation into the sergeant 's disappearance five years ago , his lawyer said
attorney @entity8 would n't characterize the upcoming session as an interrogation
he called it an interview and said he assumed it would be " people sitting around a conference table
" @entity2 's team spent tuesday meeting and reviewing documents , some classified
" i think tomorrow will be an interesting and productive day , " @entity8 said
@entity2 has met once before , briefly , with maj. gen. @entity20 , the point person for the @entity22 's investigation
after he disappeared in @entity24 in june 2009 , the now 28 - year - old soldier spent five years in the hands of @entity3 militants
after he was released in may in exchange for five senior @entity3 members held by the @entity30 military , @entity2 underwent counseling and medical care at a hospital in @entity34 , where he is back on regular duty at @entity36
the news of @entity2 's freedom initially was met with jubilation , but the mood quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity
some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war
an @entity22 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official who was briefed on the report
the @entity22 has no definitive finding that @entity2 deserted because that would require knowing his intent , something officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity30 military official recently told @entity62
@entity2 works at the headquarters of @entity64 in @entity65
he is with a unit responsible for homeland defense , civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as @entity71 , @entity72 and the @entity73
he will eventually be given a position commensurate with his rank of sergeant , the @entity22 said last month
@entity2 was a private first class when he was captured , and the @entity22 extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity
a grateful @entity2 ' understands that his life has been saved , ' lawyer says
