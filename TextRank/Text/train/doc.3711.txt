-- if you 're overweight , slimming down will make you feel great , right ? for @entity4 , embracing his own body took more than just weight loss
the 24 - year - old chemistry ph.d. candidate at @entity7 is just under 6 feet tall , and struggled with his body image for years
even after losing 125 pounds , he still felt fat , and pushed himself in unhealthy ways in terms of diet and fitness
these days , at a lean 165 pounds , @entity4 feels more confident and generally better about himself
" i feel more generically attractive in terms of what society 's views are , " he said
" but i guess i also feel like that was something i thought would be very quick , and would sort of happen right away
" getting motivated in childhood , @entity4 heard from his pediatrician that his weight was n't healthy so many times that he became desensitized to it
but as his father remembers it , he was n't ever really fat
intense studying and bad eating habits piled on pounds during college
by the fall of junior year , @entity4 weighed about 290 pounds
" i would always be sort of afraid of how i thought people would think of me , " he said
" i always expected my girlfriend at the time would find someone better
" the first stage of @entity4 's weight loss came when he lived at home in @entity36 during college
a friend encouraged @entity4 to go to the gym with him , even offering to buy him running shoes
@entity4 started going to the gym often , focusing on jogging and light weights
instead of greasy takeout meals from food stands , @entity4 started picking up leaner options such as grilled chicken and broccoli , and cooked more on weekends
his father helped cook when @entity4 was busy
" i started with the idea that being very strict with my diet was the solution , " he said
during his senior year , with graduate school applications and his father becoming ill , @entity4 slipped , forgoing the gym because there were n't enough hours in the day
his weight fluctuated , never quite bouncing back as high as it was , but still reversing some of the progress he had made
the move from @entity36 to @entity60 , @entity61 , and a breakup from a long relationship also distracted him from healthy eating
he was about 240 pounds when he entered @entity7
graduate school jump - started his motivation again
he told himself : " i 've had so many changes , and it 's really time to have an absolute fresh start
" how he did it during the summer of 2011 , @entity4 went to the gym consistently and cooked at least four nights a week
he had in his head a " running clock " of calorie and protein limits for meal times , aiming for about 2,000 calories a day
breakfast was usually a protein shake
lunch would be salad , sandwich or burrito
dinner would be around 1,000 calories
by the end of autumn of his first year at @entity7 , he was closer to 200 pounds
on a visit home to @entity36 , he ran his first @entity94 race , which motivated him to keep working on his fitness
@entity4 also encouraged his roommates to go with him to exercise , and helped friends with their workouts and stretches
" i guess that was a point where i was sort of feeling happy , " he said
focused on fitness , he competed in volleyball leagues , swam , and played squash and soccer
by mid- 2012 , he was down to 170 pounds
losing those last 60 to 70 pounds in @entity61 brought about the most substantial physical changes in his fitness journey
" i said , ' what happened to you ? are they not feeding you ? ' " his father , @entity110 , remembers telling his son when he first visited after the weight loss
generally , though , @entity4 's new physique looks good , his father said
" now when he puts a suit on , he looks better
" going too far slim and athletic as he was , @entity4 still did n't feel good about how he looked in may 2012
it was an awkward time he calls the " transition " -- when he had lost a lot of weight , but his new body did n't register in his mind as a positive image
" i would wake up in the morning , look in the mirror and feel like ' oh @entity126 , i 'm fat and ugly and this is terrible , ' " he said
at the same time , others told him he had gotten too skinny and did n't need to get thinner
objectively , he had reached his goal -- but he could n't see that in his reflection
he thought his mirror image still needed to lose 10 or 20 more pounds
focused on weight loss and fitness , @entity4 did n't pay close attention to his body 's signals that it was being pushed too hard
as he ate less and started running farther and faster , @entity4 noticed he would start to get dizzy or even fall
last semester he collapsed outside of a laboratory
" that was a scary time for a lot of people -- my lab mates , my advisor and myself included , " he said
" if you do n't balance your diet properly ( you ) ca n't go and work yourself really hard
" his aversion to overeating had gone too far -- his appetite for some foods had diminished
friends even wondered if he had an eating disorder
" there were days when i could barely finish half a sandwich , " he said
" i felt full but i clearly had not taken in all of the calories i need as a functioning person
" he has since gone to nutritionists for help
he is n't as rigid about what he eats anymore , and is more flexible about his workouts
he still minimizes fried foods but tries to be more varied with meals
the cut : what no one tells you about losing lots of weight embracing a new self body image disturbance is n't unusual when people lose weight , said @entity170 , assistant professor of psychology at the @entity172
often people have huge expectations about the life changes that will result from a weight loss that do n't actually happen
" their experience of themselves as fat extends far beyond their actual body , " she said
" people have to learn how to be in their skin in a new way
" @entity170 's approach to helping people with body image problems is to shift the focus to other areas of their lives that they care about , such as work or parenting
mindfulness -- the idea of being present and in the moment -- is incorporated in her approach to helping clients be more accepting of their bodies
can mindfulness help manage pain and mental illness ? over time , @entity4 has been able to reconcile his weight with his body image -- but there was no one moment where it suddenly clicked
positive reinforcement from others and self - assurance have helped him feel better about himself
his message to others many of @entity4 's old friends who see his recent photos on @entity215 have contacted him to ask : " how did you do it ? " @entity4 's bottom line is that he was intensely motivated
" if you count your calories and you 're like , ' i want to lose weight , ' you 're going to be stuck in that forever , " he said
" but i think if you can make changes in your lifestyle that you actually want to be doing , and then you 'll do those no matter what -- you enjoy them -- then you never have to feel like you 're trapped in a routine
