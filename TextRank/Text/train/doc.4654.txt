-- @entity3 and @entity4 signed an agreement friday to soon withdraw their respective military forces from a demilitarized zone between the two @entity9 countries , officials from both nations said
signed in @entity11 , @entity12 , the deal was brokered by former @entity9 president @entity13
defense ministers from both @entity3 and @entity4 promised they will implement the agreement over the 14 - mile - wide area later this month
" we will be ... committed , definitely , to implement ( the agreement ) word - by - word and step - by - step , " @entity3 defense minister lt. gen. @entity18 said
his @entity4 counterpart , @entity19 , promised too that his nation 's forces will be pulled out of the " 14 miles and other areas
" @entity4 became independent from @entity3 in july 2011 , following a popular referendum and a war that left nearly 2 million people dead
but the two nations have remained at odds on some issues , including defining their borders and oil exports
the upcoming withdrawals will be monitored by the commander of the @entity33 , according to the state - run @entity34 , also known as @entity35
under a 2005 peace agreement that ended @entity3 's two - decade civil war , @entity37 residents were to take part in a referendum on whether to join the @entity4 or remain a special administrative region within @entity3
but disputes over who was eligible to vote prevented a scheduled january 2011 referendum from going forward in the hotly disputed , 4,000 - square - mile region between the two countries , and last april , @entity3 and @entity4 slipped close to all - out war in series of air and ground exchanges
@entity3 and @entity4 have been under increasing pressure from the @entity53 and @entity54 to resolve that and other disputes peacefully
in september , the two countries ' leaders signed a deal to resume oil exports , but failed to address other issues such as the fate of @entity37
when @entity4 president @entity63 and @entity4 president @entity64 met again in early 2013 , they agreed to temporary administrative and security arrangements for the @entity37 region , including the creation of a police service and a limited governing council .
