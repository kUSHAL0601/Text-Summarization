@entity0 -- @entity2 grew up a military kid and , like most military families , often moved as her dad rose through the ranks of the @entity7
enamored with the military and her father 's service to his country , @entity2 decided in high school that military life was calling her
" i think it 's definitely a tight - knit community , and i was willing to be a part of that , " @entity2 recalled of her decision to join the @entity15 , commonly called @entity15 , at age 18
" i think the families are welcomed
i remember going to a base , and we 'd be welcomed by these families we did n't even know
" when the @entity23 offered her a full scholarship to @entity25 , @entity2 jumped at the chance to become a nurse and serve her country
@entity25 is a @entity29 university , a perfect fit for the practicing @entity29
nothing captured her feeling of community and sense of military pride more than when her equally proud father , capt. @entity36 , swore in his oldest child as a second lieutenant in the @entity23
" it was very special , '' she recalled of her commissioning in july 2011 , shortly after college graduation
" i was so happy that ( my parents ) had an opportunity to come out and be a part of that ceremony and have him administer the oath of office to me as an active - duty officer
" today , her dream of serving her country has been shattered
weeks before being commissioned as a military officer , @entity2 discovered that she was pregnant
that was before she says she learned the @entity23 forbid single parents from enlisting
the reason for the policy , according to @entity23 officials , is that the demands of deployment and military service put strain on family life and even more so for single parents
the @entity23 accused @entity2 of committing fraud , ejected her from its ranks and revoked her $ 92,000 scholarship
her case is currently under review
@entity71 ' mother , @entity70 , a military wife for 25 years , said deployments are tough on all service members and their families , married or not
if her daughter were to deploy , @entity75 said , her grandson would be well cared for by an extended family that includes the child 's father and both sets of grandparents
@entity71 ' mother said she believes the policy discriminates against single women and encourages pregnant single women to abort their pregnancies
" the @entity23 is making an assumption that single parents can not provide adequately for their children if deployed , " @entity2 ' mother said
" that 's what burns me up
" after she was " dis - enrolled " from the @entity23 -- the military term for the separation from service -- @entity2 appealed to the @entity23 and her congressman , rep. @entity96 , now the @entity98 nominee for vice president
the @entity23 rejected her initial appeal but said this week that her case is now being reviewed at the highest levels
@entity2 has also hired a military attorney , @entity103
@entity2 , her family and her attorney claim that the @entity23 is encouraging its members to give up their children , through either adoption or abortion , a position they say was revealed in a comment from an @entity23 colonel
in a letter responding to @entity96 's inquiry on @entity2 ' case , col. @entity119 wrote , " if ms. @entity2 had reported her pregnancy she would have been placed on medical recheck status until she gave birth
at that time she would have been been able to commission if she were not a single parent , for example , if she were married , or had given the child up for adoption
" @entity1 has repeatedly asked to interview @entity119 , to no avail
@entity2 said that letter confirms her fear at the time she discovered she was pregnant
she had just found out that she was expecting when she had what would be one of her final counseling sessions with an officer , as required by the @entity15
" he just says , ' i do n't know what would happen to a cadet if she were to become pregnant
but i do n't think it would be good
so just do n't get pregnant , ' " @entity2 recalled of the conversation with the officer
" he said that word for word to me
at that point , i thought , ' ok , i do n't think i have to tell anybody this
' " @entity2 completed all her physical and academic requirements , telling only her boyfriend and her family of her pregnancy
abortion was never an option , she said , because of her catholic faith and her personal beliefs
thirteen weeks into her pregnancy , she was sworn in by her father as a second lieutenant and started making plans to go to @entity154 to begin her military service
five months into her pregnancy , she said , she told her new commanders that she was going to have a child , and they told her they did n't think it would be a problem
citing a contract she signed in 2007 when she enrolled in @entity15 at age 18 , the @entity23 said she committed a fraud by not reporting a change in her medical condition , as indicated in the contract
the @entity23 ejected her , noting in its ruling , " it is not the responsibility of the staff to constantly remind you of the terms of your contract
" it further stated that her file contained eight forms in which she was briefed on the medical change reporting requirement
@entity2 said no one ever brought the issue up during her subsequent counseling sessions while she was enrolled at @entity25
@entity2 said she asked the officer who informed her that she was being ejected from the @entity23 , " had i terminated the pregnancy before my commissioning , would i have been able to commission at that point ? " and , according to @entity2 , " he said , ' well
' that was the hardest part of all of this
someone telling me to my face that had i gotten an abortion , then i would be eligible for service
" in a statement to @entity1 , a spokesman for the @entity23 said it had no knowledge of that conversation
" any such counseling would have been inappropriate and i have seen no evidence of any such discussion , '' maj. @entity194 wrote
" however , ms. @entity2 ' case is under review by the @entity200
" @entity194 also said the @entity23 would never tell non-married service members to give up their children , despite @entity119 ' letter to @entity96
" the assertion that the @entity23 would in any way encourage single parents to give up their children is unfounded , " he wrote
the @entity207 and their attorney feel otherwise
" this offends me on a number of different levels , " said @entity103 , the attorney
" because we 're telling young single woman that they can not serve if they have a child
that they have to get married , give the baby up or have an abortion
" @entity2 said she realizes there will be those who say she should n't have gotten pregnant or have gone public with her story
she said that she may have made a mistake but that she now has a beautiful 10 - month old son , @entity224 , to show for it and he is no mistake
she is taking responsibility for her actions and raising her child
she hopes that because she has told her story , the military will reconsider its policy on single parents being allowed to enlist
as she waits for her situation to be resolved , @entity2 is working as a pediatric nurse , paying $ 100 a month -- with interest -- toward the $ 92,000 scholarship debt
after all , @entity75 points out , defense secretary @entity236 recently stated his commitment " to removing all the barriers that would prevent @entity239 from serving their country " when hailing last year 's decision to abandon the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy for gay men and women serving in the military
she hopes his words will apply to women like her daughter
" i believe a woman has the right to choose life , go on to serve and reach ( her ) full potential , including being an officer in the @entity23 , " @entity75 said
