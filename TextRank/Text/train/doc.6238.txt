@entity1 prosecutors say they will appeal after former ruler @entity2 was cleared of charges linking him to the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the country 's 2011 uprising
the ruling was a stunning reversal for the ex-president who had been convicted of ordering the killings of peaceful protesters and was sentenced to life in prison for the same charges two years ago
on saturday , a @entity17 judge dismissed charges linking @entity2 to the deaths of protesters during the 2011 revolt that led to the end of his 29 - year rule
the judge also found him not guilty of corruption
the 86 - year - old was stoic as his supporters in the courtroom cheered the decision that capped a months - long retrial
reclining on a hospital gurney in a defendants ' cage , he nodded while fellow defendants kissed him on the head
later , he told the country 's @entity38 tv station in a brief phone interview that he " did n't commit anything
" " i laughed when i heard the first verdict , " he said of the first trial , which he appealed
" when it came to the second verdict , i said i was waiting
it would go either way
it would n't have made a difference to me either way
" prosecutor - general @entity54 will appeal the verdict , @entity1 's government - controlled @entity52 website reported sunday
also acquitted saturday were @entity2 's former interior minister @entity56 and six of @entity56 's aides , who 'd been accused of being connected to the deaths of 239 protesters as security forces cracked down on them in 2011
@entity2 's two sons also were acquitted saturday of corruption
@entity2 is still serving a three - year sentence for a previous conviction for embezzlement handed down in may , but it 's not clear when he will be released because he is expected to be credited for time already served
@entity68 's efforts to reach @entity2 's lawyer @entity69 for comment were n't immediately successful
both sides have alleged that @entity2 's trials have been politicized , with supporters arguing he was unfairly vilified and opponents fearing that he 'd be acquitted as memories of the revolution faded
his legal fortunes did seem to parallel the political climate -- just last year , @entity79 , the @entity80 who became @entity1 's first democratically elected president , supported a retrial with the backing of his supporters , who argued @entity2 should have received a death sentence rather than life in captivity
but @entity79 himself was deposed by the military in july 2013 , as opponents accused him of pursuing an @entity80 agenda at the exclusion of other factions
and now the @entity95 revolt that ousted @entity2 has come nearly full circle -- @entity2 appears close to freedom ; @entity79 is jailed , his @entity98 banned ; and @entity79 supporters allege the current government has returned to @entity2 's authoritarian practices
@entity2 cleared , but drama is n't over yet explaining the verdict judge @entity104 said he dropped charges against @entity2 because @entity106 did n't have the jurisdiction to try him for the protesters ' deaths
the judge said the case that prosecutors initially referred to the court listed only @entity56 and his aides as defendants -- not @entity2 himself
but after mass protests pressured the prosecutor general to question @entity2 , a second referral was made to the court , and the two cases were merged into one
lawyer @entity121 , who represents the families of 65 slain and injured protesters , said the inclusion of @entity2 in a second referral should have trumped his exclusion in the first
" the judge shied away from directly acquitting @entity2 even though he was accused of conspiring with @entity56 , and @entity56 was acquitted , " she said
" the judge resorted to formalities instead
" ' i want only @entity133 's retribution ' @entity134 , mother of one of the slain 2011 protesters , sat down on a sidewalk outside the court after she heard saturday 's verdicts , praying to @entity133 to deliver justice
she broke down in tears , her hands shaking , as she recalled her son @entity143 , who was killed in january 2011 at @entity17 's @entity144 -- the epicenter of the uprising
" i 'm worried my son 's blood would go in vain , " she said
" our children 's blood is n't cheap
their blood is precious , like any other blood
" " i do n't want execution , " she continued
" this wo n't bring back my son ... i want only @entity133 's retribution
" @entity144 was closed to traffic following saturday 's verdicts
one man was killed and nine people were injured as several hundred demonstrators clashed nearby with @entity1 security forces , @entity1 @entity164 spokesman @entity163 told @entity68
police fired tear gas and bird shot at the protesters
the @entity173 said police were pelted by rocks before the incident escalated
the human rights group @entity176 , whose lawyers represented more than 60 civil plaintiffs in the case , said that saturday 's verdict solidified the impunity that it says security forces and their leaders enjoy
" justice was dealt another severe blow , " the group said in a news release
how it started in january 2011 , throngs of @entity1 filled the streets of @entity17 to decry the country 's poverty , unemployment and repression
protesters called for @entity2 to step down but were met by a fierce and often violent government crackdown
@entity2 eventually stepped down in february 2011
that freed up long - supressed @entity80 movements , including the @entity98 , to run for office
@entity79 , backed by the @entity98 's @entity201 , became president in june 2012
but @entity79 was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule
since then , @entity17 's military - installed government has banned the @entity98 , calling it a terrorist group -- an allegation it denies -- and accusing it of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on police and the military
many @entity80 and secular activists have been arrested and given lengthy sentences
a restrictive protest law and repeated deadly crackdowns on demonstrations followed
@entity218 , the general who led @entity79 's ouster , was elected president in may after leaving the military to run for the office
since @entity2 stepped down in february 2011 , the ailing former ruler has appeared in court numerous times on a variety of charges , often wheeled in on a gurney
his lawyers say he suffered health problems after his 2011 arrest , including a stroke , and he has served much of his prison time at a military medical facility
in may , when a @entity17 court sentenced @entity2 to three years in prison for embezzlement , his sons @entity236 and @entity237 were sentenced to four years each on the same charge
all three were convicted of embezzling $ 18 million that was allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces
the mubaraks have insisted they are not guilty .
