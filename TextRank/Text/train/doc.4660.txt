@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 president @entity3 says peace talks with @entity6 could resume if the jewish state showed willingness to fully engage in the process
" this peace process can not only be relaunched by one party
@entity4 wants peace and we have a mediator , @entity15 , which is ready to use its mediation role as well as the @entity19 partnership
what we are missing is the @entity6 partnership , and we need it in order to renew peace talks and obtain results , " @entity3 told reporters
@entity3 traveled to @entity1 , sat down with president @entity26 on friday for a one - hour lunch , and held a press briefing , where he blamed @entity6 for the stalled talks with @entity4
@entity15 recently had mediated indirect talks between @entity6 and @entity4 , neighboring countries that have been adversaries for years
among their many differences are @entity6 's occupation of the @entity36 from @entity4 in the @entity37 and @entity4 's ties with @entity39 and anti-israel militants
his visit to @entity0 comes days after the visit of @entity6 prime minister @entity44
questioned on @entity44 's statement that @entity6 was ready to relaunch peace talks @entity4 without pre-conditions , @entity3 emphasized that if @entity6 is serious about talks , @entity4 is ready to send experts to @entity15 and begin discussions with @entity6 experts
asked if he was ready to meet @entity44 in person at some point without conditions , @entity3 did n't say he would or would n't , but said it would depend on the subject of the discussion
" are we talking about the menu or about land restitution ? we must talk about territory restitution
for this matter , mechanisms and a framework exist
the negotiators know the mechanisms
it is neither me nor @entity44 , " he said
asked about the role of @entity1 in the peace process , @entity3 said he hopes @entity1 backs the relaunch of the peace negotiations through @entity15 and persuades @entity6 to accept this mediation process
as for the peace process in the wider @entity74 , he said it will only work if @entity6 stops tearing down the other side 's rights and demands
@entity3 said he and @entity26 discussed living conditions in the @entity82 - controlled @entity81 territory of @entity83 -- reeling from the ongoing conflict with @entity6 , including the fierce @entity6 offensive against militants that began late last year after constant rocket attacks on @entity6 by @entity83 guerrillas
saying a civilian was shot on friday by @entity6 troops , @entity3 said he asked @entity26 to stop violence against civilians in the territory
@entity95 and @entity83 security sources both confirmed an incident , but the sides had different accounts
the @entity95 said soldiers identified a number of suspected terror operatives who appeared to be planting explosive devices adjacent to the northern @entity83 security fence near " the @entity105 humanitarian crossing
" the soldiers opened fire and identified hitting two of the suspects -- one of which was transferred to an @entity6 hospital ; the other operative died of his wounds
three other suspects were taken for questioning
the @entity81 security sources said a special force opened fire on a number of youths near the border fence with @entity6 in central @entity83
one of the youths was killed and four others were taken by the @entity6 soldiers
@entity3 said he and @entity26 also discussed @entity39 's nuclear program and @entity125
