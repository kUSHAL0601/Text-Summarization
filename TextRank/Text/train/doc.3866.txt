-- a nun and two peace activists could spend the rest of their lives in federal prison after being convicted of breaching one of the nation 's most secure nuclear facilities
after two days of testimony , a federal jury in @entity10 , @entity11 , found sister @entity13 , 83 ; @entity15 - @entity14 , 57 ; and @entity16 , 63 , guilty of destroying @entity18 government property and depredation against federal property exceeding $ 1,000
that could mean up to 30 years in prison , according to @entity23 , @entity0 's affiliate in @entity10
the three are scheduled to be sentenced on september 23
when the guilty verdict was read wednesday evening , the three defendants appeared content , even singing along with protest hymns before they were taken into custody , according to @entity23
" they 're at peace about this , they 're peace makers , and they knew that they risked this , " @entity30 , attorney for @entity16 , told the @entity10 station
" nobody is happy to go jail , but they understand
" in the predawn hours of july 28 , 2012 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity16 walked under the cover of darkness through the woods and up a hillside , approaching a chain - link fence surrounding the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity11
armed with flashlights and a bolt cutter , they cut their way through the fence , fully expecting to be arrested on the spot
instead , they walked nearly a mile , cutting through four fences in all , breaching what was supposed to be the most tightly secured uranium processing and storage facility in the country
" when we got to the very high security fence where there 's a lethal force authorized ... i thought , maybe we should turn around , " @entity14 told @entity0 's @entity68
hours later , the three activists were finally confronted by a guard after hoisting banners , spray - painting messages and splattering human blood on a building that houses highly enriched uranium
they have said they wanted call attention to the dangers of nuclear weapons , but their actions triggered a very different concern : if three older peaceniks can easily trespass onto what was once considered the " @entity84 " for highly enriched uranium , just how safe are the nation 's nuclear weapons material from terrorists ? nuclear weapons interactive : who has what ? since the incident , @entity91 has held a series of hearings and issued security recommendations to the @entity96 and its @entity97 , which runs @entity49 and seven other nuclear weapons sites
most recently , deputy energy secretary @entity99 testified before the @entity100 in march that the @entity96 has taken " several major actions ... to improve security " since the y - 12 breach , including management changes and independent security reviews
today , changes at @entity49 are noticeable
a new security contractor is in charge
new signs and security fences are going up
while last year 's security breach shed light on systematic weaknesses at @entity49 , a former nuclear reactor safety manager at the @entity115 in @entity116 said he does n't think the nation 's nuclear weapons material were ever at any risk
" what these people did was more like trespassing than gaining access to any weapons - grade material , " said @entity121 , who is now a vice provost and dean at @entity123
" once they got in , they could spray paint things , but it 's just like if you got into @entity84 , you would n't know the combination to the locks
" @entity121 said the country 's nuclear weapons material is spread across eight sites that are " usually out in the middle of nowhere " to protect against threats
" there 's really only one place where the weapons are fully assembled ; i 'm not going to tell you which one , " @entity121 said
" and the reason there are eight places , they do n't want people to have the full knowledge ( of what the other facilities do )
" we almost never see an assembled nuclear weapon
" but another nuclear security expert said the y - 12 breach was more than just trespassing by a few environmental protesters
" this was a very serious incident because they penetrated the protected area , and that 's when there was supposed to be an immediate security response , " said @entity157 , a senior scientist with @entity158 , a watchdog group that monitors the @entity96 and the @entity159
" if they had been trained , the kind of paramilitary group that the @entity96 is supposed to be ensuring they can protect against , with hand - carried explosives , other breaching tools , physical access to the building structure ... the guards would have already lost
" @entity157 said the breach was not an isolated incident
" it was a result of this reduced central oversight , giving contractors more responsibility for supervising themselves , and that 's an invitation of corner - cutting and complacency to set in , " he said
the incident not only broke the public 's trust that the government is " exercising good oversight " of its nuclear weapons facilities , according to @entity157 , but he said it also has " global implications
" " if we ca n't even control our own nuclear weapons material , it shows what a major challenge it is around the world ... that have comparably dangerous materials but are even less protected
and , @entity157 pointed out , if the @entity18 appears to have vulnerabilities in protecting its nuclear weapons material , " then that not only reduces our authority to criticize other countries , it raising questions about the integrity of our own security
" @entity0 's @entity68 and @entity209 contributed to this report .
