@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sudden death of @entity1 's president , @entity4 , on july 24 did not come as a rude surprise
most @entity1 already knew his health was failing ; he was losing his eyesight and voice
for the seven months that i was in @entity1 ( dec 2011 - july 2012 ) , he rarely made a public appearance -- and despite official assertions to the contrary , most people did not believe he had the will nor the capacity to campaign for re-election in this year 's elections in december
thousands of mourners pay respects to their late leader what was remarkable , however , was that within hours of his death , the vice-president , @entity23 , had been sworn in as the new president
the smoothness of the transition was exactly how @entity4 would have wanted it
he was a man of peace and ardent believer in the rule of law
@entity1 in mourning after president dies the smooth transfer of power not only attested to the strength and stability of @entity1 's democracy but also stood in sharp contrast to the rocky and chaotic transitions that followed the deaths of presidents @entity43 of @entity44 in 1993 ; @entity45 of @entity46 in 2010 and @entity47 of @entity48 in 2012
@entity49 hailed @entity1 as ' model for democracy ' also standing in sharp contrast to the smooth political transition process is the performance of @entity1 's economy
after a stellar performance the past few years , the economy has hit some road bumps
at a time when @entity60 has been in deep crisis , @entity1 's economy galloped at a dizzying 14.5 % rate of growth in 2011
in the fourth quarter , the rate was an astonishing 16 %
the country achieved a single digit inflation rate of 8.6 % and the lowest fiscal deficit to gdp ratio of 4.8 % in decades , according to figures from the minister of finance
moreover , @entity1 attracted $ 7 billion in foreign investment -- the highest amount recorded in its history
this economic boom has been sparked by recent discovery and production of oil
however , prospects for 2012 have dimmed
the projected growth rate has been scaled back to 10 % , although still impressive
an @entity81 team which visited the country in june described the economy as " sick " -- perhaps , an unintended allusion to the condition of the president
the external value of the local currency , the cedi , has dropped precipitously from 1.4 cedis to the dollar in january 2.2 cedis to the dollar in july -- a drop of 57 % in terms of the local currency
that drop has made imports more expensive and pushed the rate of inflation up above 10 %
there is widespread grumbling about the rising cost of living
former @entity1 president : fight poverty with wealth creation , not charity it may seem skeptics , who questioned the sustainability of @entity1 's economic success , are being proven right
they point to @entity1 's neighbor , @entity44 , which was once declared an " economic miracle " back in the late 1990s but then convulsed into civil war and economic ruination in 2005 and 2010
they ask further : has n't oil been a curse to such countries as @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity46 , among others ? is @entity1 not destined to follow the same path ? to some extent , the skeptics have a point but that is not the whole picture
to be sure , @entity44 was declared an " economic miracle " in the late 1980s and in 1994 , the @entity129 declared @entity1 to be an economic success story
however , received wisdom and accumulated evidence suggest that doing well economically is not enough
intellectual freedom ( freedom of expression , of the media , etc. ) and political reform ( establishment of democratic pluralism ) are also needed to sustain economic prosperity
countries that resist them eventually implode , unraveling all the economic gains made
this was what happened in @entity44 in 2005 and also in @entity147 ( 1995 ) , @entity148 ( 1998 ) , @entity149 ( 2001 ) , @entity150 ( 2011 ) and @entity151 ( 2011 )
in other words , democracy is not necessary to engineer an economic success story but vital to sustain it
in @entity1 's case , incomplete political liberalization and fitful intellectual reform clipped its economic success in the 1990s
however , things are much different today
the intellectual environment is much freer now
there are more than 100 private radio stations and over 20 privately - owned newspapers in @entity1
there is a vibrant and vigilant media that sparks intense intellectual debates
call - in radio programs hold the feet of politicians to the fire and expose their shenanigans
now and then , the country 's @entity172 rules against the government
freedom of information bill is wending its way through @entity177 , although it has been dragging its feet
media 's role in @entity1 politics politically , democracy is also being entrenched
since 2000 , there have been two successful transfers of power without violence or bloodshed
and the smooth transfer of power after the president passed away is another feather in the @entity1 's democracy cap
all these bode well for the sustainability of the current economic prosperity
but still , some serious hurdles lie ahead for @entity1 's economic prosperity
first , the non-oil sector of the economy is performing poorly
@entity199 , which employs over 60 % of the population , grew marginally at 2.8 % in 2011
with food production per capita declining , the country has to rely on food imports to feed itself
the performance of the manufacturing sector has also been weak
it is hard to find a manufactured good with the label , " made in @entity1
" as @entity1 often lament , " we do n't produce anything ; we import everything from tooth - picks to toilet paper
" as a result , imports are surging dangerously out of control
@entity1 farmers lose out in gold mining boom the situation is eerily reminiscent of @entity46 in the 1980s when the country neglected its agriculture and manufacturing base and splurged on luxury imports
army chiefs parked @entity226 and even @entity227 outside plush government villas , while their children attended expensive schools in @entity231
one even had his @entity233 flown from @entity231 to @entity46
@entity46 , which used to export food in the 1960s , now spends over $ 120 billion [ latest figure i found ] on food imports while 61 % of @entity46 now live in poverty
there are other bumps as well on @entity1 's road to economic prosperity
the bloated size of the government suffocates the economy
in 1997 , there were 88 cabinet and regional ministers plus their deputy ministers in a country with a population of 25 million
by 2004 , the number had reached 92 but now down to 84
[ the @entity254 , with a population of 300 million , has 40 secretaries and assistant secretaries
] too many ministries means overlapping jurisdiction and functions and a bloated bureaucracy
indeed , the vice president , @entity23 , has been complaining persistently about " excessive bureaucracy and red - tapeism in the public sector " in the state - owned @entity266
the public sector is riddled with overspending , wasteful practices and financial irregularities and profligacy
the situation has become so dire that the government consumes all it collects in revenue , leaving it with little or no savings to finance investments
for example , in 2011 , total revenue stood at ghÂ ¢ 12 billion ( or $ 7.5 billion ) but general government expenditures added up to ghÂ ¢ 13 billion , leaving the government with negative savings
can @entity283 break its ' resource curse ' ? however , the biggest hurdle when i was in the country was the high level of anxiety , tension and uncertainty about the december poll
in times of uncertainty , investors hold on to their wallets and the rich park their wealth outside the country
capital flight and surging imports have evidently contributed to the sharp drop in the external value of the local currency
i left @entity1 for the @entity254 on july 21 and president @entity4 passed away on july 24
most likely , political tension in the country will abate somewhat as @entity1 put away their differences to mourn their departed president
however , the uncertainty will resurface after the burial
while the new president , @entity23 , is respected and level - headed , he is unlikely to accomplish much before december
one wag has urged @entity1 to vote for a " non-john " in december
since 1981 , @entity1 has had the following presidents : @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity4 , and now @entity23
@entity318 ! this is the worst form of name tribalism
time for a revolution , " the wag exclaims
well , @entity1 will decide in december
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity325 .
