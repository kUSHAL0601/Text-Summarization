@entity1 prosecutors are seeking an arrest warrant for the former @entity4 executive @entity3 who sparked outrage by kicking a flight attendant off a plane for serving macadamia nuts the wrong way
the warrant would cover charges of violating aviation safety rules , including a change in a flight plan , assault on a plane , coercion and interference in the execution of duty , the @entity12 western district prosecutors ' office said wednesday
a decision will be taken on issuing of the warrant early next week after a review procedure , the prosecutors ' office said
@entity29 , the 40 - year - old daughter of @entity4 's chairman , resigned from her post as vice president at the company in the aftermath of the incident earlier this month on a flight from @entity39 's @entity38 to @entity1 's @entity40
she ordered that the plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class
amid public anger over her behavior , she and her father both apologized for the incident
@entity29 , whose @entity1 name is @entity53 - ah , said she accepted " full responsibility " for what happened
she was n't available for comment wednesday
' violent language testimonies of crew members and passengers confirm that @entity29 used " violent language in a loud voice , " which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight , the @entity58 said last week
although her role put her in charge of in - flight service , she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity
officials are also seeking an arrest warrant for another @entity4 executive , identified by his surname of @entity78 , on charges of ordering employees to delete an initial report of the incident , the prosecutors ' office said
@entity4 said wednesday it was monitoring the situation , as an arrest warrant had n't been issued yet
the office said that prosecutors had raided the office and residence of a government official at the @entity58 who was suspected of leaking information on the investigation into the case to @entity78
the captain of the plane has also faced criticism for obeying @entity29 's demands to turn back the plane and remove the flight attendant
because of that , the airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain 's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight , the ministry said last week .
