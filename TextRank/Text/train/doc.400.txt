as a polio survivor , @entity0 is more than a date on the calendar -- it 's a reminder that we can and must end this crippling disease
i grew up in the @entity8 of @entity9 and contracted polio at age 3
this disease often causes paralysis and left me mostly paralyzed and unable to walk
my brothers had to help me move when we traveled long distances ; even traveling to and from school was difficult
living with polio was not easy when i was younger , but i have found ways to cope and lead an active life
and that has given me a lot of strength
for example , i was very interested in soccer when i was young , and i later went on to found para-soccer , a nationally - recognized soccer - style game for people with disabilities in @entity9
why polio has n't gone away yet while polio has not stopped me , i am determined to stop polio
children today should n't have to go through what i 've been through -- especially when a few drops of the polio vaccine can protect them from the disease
i have committed myself to raising awareness and educating people not just about polio , but about the importance of vaccinations
in fact , to mark @entity46 in @entity9 , more than 300 polio survivors are actively participating in sporting activities across the country
on an ongoing basis , more than 1,000 survivors are actively campaigning for polio eradication in communities
empowering people affected by polio will strengthen our campaign against the disease and help spread the message that vaccinating our children is the only way to prevent them from similar fates
at the @entity63 , money backs up vow to eradicate polio by 2015 @entity9 is the only polio endemic country in @entity65 and one of only three remaining countries ( the others are @entity69 and @entity70 ) that have not been able to stop the transmission of the disease , according to the @entity74
if we fail to end polio in these countries , all other countries are at risk
this contagious disease can be imported , paralyzing children in countries that thought they were done with polio
a recent outbreak in the @entity84 is a reminder that we must finish the job
in my country , we must make sure more children are vaccinated and overall immunity is higher , especially in the northern states
every child that does not get polio drops breaks the circle of protection and exposes him or her and others to contracting the virus
challenges still exist in @entity9 , especially in reaching children in some communities where security is an issue , like @entity8 , @entity105 and @entity106
we are helping to fix this by ensuring local ownership by the government and communities themselves
the good news is that we have made progress against polio in @entity9 and around the world
in @entity9 , the government , partners , and survivors are working hard , and polio cases are down right now compared to this time last year
globally , polio cases have been reduced by more than 99 percent in the past 25 years
opinion : do n't fall at the finish line in the race to eradicate polio thanks to a worldwide effort of governments and the @entity131 , including the @entity63 , the number of polio cases has dropped from 350,000 a year in 1988 to just 223 last year , and the number of countries where polio is transmitted has dropped from 125 to 3 , according to the eradication initiative
i look forward to the day @entity9 overcomes the devastation of polio and joins the list of polio - free countries
the @entity131 has developed a plan to end polio for good ; now is the time for all of us to support this effort , educate our communities , and make sure our children are vaccinated
on @entity0 , my wish is that one day we end polio in @entity9 and in the world
i made my dream of playing soccer come true , and i believe we can make this one come true , too .
