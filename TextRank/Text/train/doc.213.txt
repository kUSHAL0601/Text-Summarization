more : @entity2 plane skids off runway , 13 injured after touching down in @entity5 at 11:20 p.m. , the @entity12 aircraft , which departed from @entity13 , @entity14 , suffered a landing gear malfunction that caused it to slide off the runway , according to the airline
no passengers were reported injured during the actual landing , although 13 received minor injuries during the evacuation and were taken to hospital , the airline said
after the accident , workers on a crane painted over the @entity2 logo on the tail and body of the aircraft in black
known as the " crisis communication rule , " the practice of obscuring logos was a recommendation from @entity36 -- of which @entity2 is a member -- to protect the airline 's image , an airline official initially said
however , @entity36 denied the claims
" @entity46 crisis communications policy does not state that logos are to covered , " in the event of an accident , a spokesman for the airline group , @entity44 , told @entity0
@entity2 later issued a statement " clarifying " its policy
" though @entity53 generally practices the de-identifying of an aircraft after an incident ... the company also clarifies that this is not a @entity36 policy
" established in 1997 , @entity36 is a global airline network with 28 member airlines
" standard practice " draws criticism judging from the attention -- even derision -- @entity68 's actions have attracted in this case , the effort to protect the airline 's image seems to have had the opposite of its intended effect
attention on @entity73 quickly focused as much on the obscuring of the logos as on the accident itself
