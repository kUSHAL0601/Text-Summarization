the morning tide keeps time on the barrier islands of @entity2
it slowly washes away tiny tracks left by newly hatched sea turtles that wobble into the surf under the cover of darkness
meanwhile , dolphins play in the waters close to shore as brown pelicans hover in competition to snack on schools of fish
the @entity16 were home to @entity18 long before 1584 when sir @entity19 attempted to make @entity22 the first permanent @entity21 settlement in the new world
a little more than a century later , the pirate @entity24 unscrupulously assaulted @entity25 , marauding and terrorizing merchants
the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 lighthouses were built and rebuilt throughout the 19th century to help ships avoid the " graveyard of the @entity34 , " and the @entity35 made history 's first recorded flight in @entity38 at the beginning of the 20th century
@entity2 is history , a vacation destination , a home to endangered wildlife and a geological wonder combined into one national park site on @entity47 's coast
@entity49 stats : more than 2.3 million people visited @entity2 in 2012 , and it has averaged more than 2 million guests per year since 2008
it is the fourth-most visited national seashore , according to the @entity55
the location : @entity2 lies on @entity47 's @entity16 , about a four - hour drive from @entity58 and 2Â½ hours from @entity59 , @entity60
the park has north and south entrances
the north entrance is in @entity64 at the junction of @entity67 and state highway 12
the south entrance , state highway 12 north of @entity29 , is accessible only by ferry
if you go : there is no admission to enter @entity2 , and there are visitor centers on @entity30 and on @entity77 and @entity29 islands
@entity30 and @entity31 lighthouses are open from the third friday in april through @entity79
admission to each lighthouse is $ 8 for adults and $ 4 for children under 12
ticket purchases do not transfer from one lighthouse to the other
weather permitting , visitors can climb the steps of @entity90 on their own , and rangers conduct guided tours of the @entity93
@entity29 , home to the second - oldest operating lighthouse in the @entity95 , is about 60 miles south on state highway 12 and accessing it requires taking a ferry across @entity99
the ferry to @entity29 from @entity101 , @entity47 , is free , but ferries from @entity103 or @entity104 are paid and require reservations
the @entity106 is in @entity38 , about seven miles north of @entity64
@entity107 is on @entity22 about three miles north of @entity108
meet our ranger : @entity111 is the district interpretative ranger for @entity2
the seeds for @entity111 's career in the park service were planted when his aunt gave him a subscription to @entity118 as a gift for his 7th birthday
@entity111 , now 44 , grew up in @entity121 and says ranger @entity123 's adventures taught him environmental ethics
while attending the @entity125 , @entity111 sought out nature during spring break instead of following classmates to traditional destinations
" i would n't go party , " he says
" i chose national parks instead
" @entity111 changed his major to geology after spending a summer volunteering at @entity49
after graduation , he joined the @entity135 and helped develop cave national parks in the @entity138
he then worked seasonal ranger jobs until landing his first permanent job in the park system at @entity143 's backcountry office
he came to @entity2 in 2010
" it 's a barrier island , one of the three most dynamic geological formations ( along with volcanoes and glaciers ) in the world , " he says
" we 're having a ball here because there are so many fun things to do
" for a day trip , do n't miss : seashell hunting on the beach , touring one of the lighthouses and watching the sun set over @entity99
" it 's rare to see sunset on a body of water on the @entity165 , " he says
favorite less - traveled spot : nighttime on the beach
@entity111 says @entity30 has the darkest night sky on the @entity165
in addition to stargazing and watching ghost crabs scramble across the sand , he says , hot summer nights cause the water to glow with bioluminescence
" i ca n't get enough of it here , " he says
" the night sky blows me away
" favorite spot to view wildlife : the boardwalk near @entity93
@entity111 says the boardwalk leads guests through bird ponds to a gazebo , where they can also watch crabs chase fish
" there is always great wildlife sightings no matter what time of day , " he says
most magical moment in the park : his first trip kayaking on the @entity99
@entity111 says @entity99 is not deep and is a relatively safe body of water
almost every village on @entity2 rents kayaks , and he recommends paddling along the shore to " bliss out
" " it all has to do with peace and tranquillity , " he says
" whenever i take my kayak out , i 'm seeing turtles and brown pelicans
" moment that made him smile : raising a camera to photograph a young couple at @entity93 and seeing the guy get down on one knee
" i 'm like , ' @entity207 , i think i know what is going to happen , ' " he says
" i just went crazy taking pictures
there are a lot of ( wedding ) proposals at the top of lighthouses
" @entity111 says the woman accepted , and he was happy to share news of the marriage engagement with the other guests on the tour
@entity221 moment at the park : a music teacher giving students a demonstrative lesson on sound resonance by playing a didgeridoo , a wind instrument used by @entity230 aborigines , at the base of @entity90
" it was way out there , but i really liked it , " he says
" the crowd waiting applauded when he finished
" a ranger 's request : educate yourself about rip currents before entering the water and do not go swimming at sunset or sunrise
@entity111 says rip currents are common at @entity30 because of small sand dunes that build up in shallow water
when the water gets pulled back out to sea , it punches holes in the dunes , creating the pull for rip currents
@entity111 says the way to escape a rip tide is to remain calm and float on your back
the current will take you out about 100 yards , he says
from there you should swim parallel to the shore until you clear the pull
" people try to swim out of it and you ca n't , " he says
" @entity267 could n't do it
" another park he 'd like to visit : @entity270 in @entity271
the area features a combination of science , history , geography , petroglyphs and fossils
" they 've got dinosaur bones , " he says
" how cool is that ? " what national park would you like to visit ? please share your thoughts in the comments section below .
