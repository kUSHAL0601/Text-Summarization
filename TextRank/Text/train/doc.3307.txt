-- an isolated @entity2 tribe in @entity3 seemingly has vanished like a morning mist in the @entity6 jungle
concerns are rising that the tribe , filmed this past year for the first time , may have been run off by drug traffickers
aid group @entity11 first reported this week that suspected traffickers had destroyed a @entity3 guard post built near the tribe 's location to protect them from outsiders
the organization said it was feared that a nearby river has become a transit point for cocaine from @entity21
an overflight of huts where the tribe lives showed no one in the area , @entity25 , a spokesman for @entity3 's @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , told @entity0 thursday
the fact that none of the @entity30 could be spotted by the air is worrisome , @entity25 said
however , the huts were still standing and the crops appeared untouched , which indicates that contact was not made , at least not there
video of the previously uncontacted tribe , released in february , made headlines around the world , as did 2008 photos of a settlement
in the videos , residents in bright body paint stand near thatch - covered structures
it 's not clear if the images were of the same @entity6 tribe
" we have done overflights before , and they were not scared , and we were even able to take photos of them , " @entity25 said
it is possible that the @entity30 fled or were hiding in fear , he said , but added , " we do n't know if there was contact
" authorities recovered a backpack , believed to belong to a drug trafficker , that had an arrow inside of it
a clue , but " that does n't mean there was contact , " @entity25 said
more than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide , and about half live in the remote reaches of the @entity6 rainforest in @entity21 or @entity3 , says @entity11 , which advocates for tribal peoples
it refers to such tribes as " peoples who have no peaceful contact with anyone in the mainstream or dominant society
" @entity3 and @entity11 have warned of the dangers posed by logging and disease
loggers in @entity21 are pushing isolated @entity30 from @entity21 into @entity3 , where , according to @entity11 , " the two groups are likely to come into conflict
" @entity3 authorities said they know that the armed men seen in the area -- about 40 of them -- crossed the border from @entity21 , but they do n't know the nationality of the suspected traffickers or with what criminal organization they might work
the incursion was first reported by @entity30 from the @entity89 people , who at the end of july reported to @entity27 that a group of armed men from @entity21 ransacked their village
this village was about five days by boat away from the area where a number of isolated and uncontacted tribes reside , @entity27 said
as a result , @entity3 authorities dispatched a group of federal police to the region
maj. @entity102 of the @entity103 told @entity0 that they have an outpost on the @entity21 side not far from where the armed men were spotted , but said that he had not received any recent reports of traffickers in that area
@entity25 , of @entity27 , agreed that drug trafficking in the area was new
" in this region , drug trafficking is an isolated problem , " he said
it was the first time that traffickers were suspected of crossing from @entity21 in the area near the @entity2 tribe .
