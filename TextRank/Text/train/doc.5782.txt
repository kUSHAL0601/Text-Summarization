-- want to visit @entity1 , @entity2 or @entity3 next year ? pack your camping supplies and knock those parks off your bucket list now , because it may cost you a little bit more to explore the national parks by summer 2015
for the first time in eight years , the @entity13 sites that charge entrance and amenity fees can increase their rates by set amounts
they have to engage their communities , note what the increases will cover and get approval by park service headquarters
fee increase proposals are due by march 15
though just 133 of the 401 @entity13 sites across the @entity28 charge an entrance fee , they 're some of the parks that travelers often think of first
@entity1 , which released its fee proposal on tuesday , wants to increase its weekly entrance pass from $ 20 to $ 30
camping fees would rise from the current range of $ 5 to $ 20 per night for family sites ( $ 40 per night for group sites ) to a range of $ 6 to $ 24 per night for family sites ( $ 48 per night for group sites )
the cost of national park passes will remain at $ 80 for the regular annual pass , $ 10 for the lifetime senior pass and free for the annual military passes and access passes ( for those with permanent disabilities )
these are five national park sites we think you must see , either now or after any fee increases take effect
they 're still a bargain ! @entity1 , @entity56 president @entity57 first protected @entity1 with his signing of the @entity59 on june 30 , 1864 , 150 years ago
@entity1 will celebrate 125 years as a national park in 2015
@entity61 , @entity62 the @entity63 cuts through the bottom of the magnificent @entity2 for 277 miles , and it 's a full vertical mile from the @entity2 to the canyon floor
the canyon 's width varies , but it measures 18 miles in several spots
the @entity2 is open year - round , but the @entity2 -- generally the coolest place in the park -- is open during the spring and summer
current vehicle entrance fee : $ 25 @entity3 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 @entity76 calls this place home
established as the @entity28 ' first national park in 1872 , @entity3 is also one of the first 12 sites on @entity83 's @entity82 , which recognizes the world 's most important natural and cultural wonders
@entity3 is one of the few remaining intact ecosystems of significant size in the northern temperate zone on @entity89 , including a volcano , more than 300 geysers and more than 10,000 thermal features
current vehicle entrance fee : $ 25 @entity93 , @entity94 @entity93 is one of the most unique spots on @entity89 , home to the world 's highest collection of natural sandstone arches
they include the largest , @entity100 , and the tallest , @entity101
current vehicle entrance fee : $ 10 @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 it 's free ! despite its reign as the most - visited national park in the country last year , with 9.4 million visitors , @entity102 is our bargain park , with no entrance fees
( there are camping and other amenity fees
) that 's because the park 's @entity115 was once owned by the state of @entity104
when the state transferred it to the federal government , the state required that no fee " ever be imposed " to travel the road .
