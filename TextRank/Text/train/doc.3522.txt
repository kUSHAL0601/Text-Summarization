-- @entity1 showed a blistering turn of pace to win the @entity4 and confirm his status as one of the greatest race horses in history
@entity1 finishes clear of the field to win @entity12 's top horse race
it was the fifth consecutive win for the three - year - old colt , including the @entity15 and @entity16 , as he claimed @entity12 's premier flat race on sunday
trained in @entity19 by @entity20 , @entity1 was boxed in approaching the final furlong , but jockey @entity22 found a gap before bursting clear of the field
he relegated @entity25 , ridden by the returning @entity26 , into second place with seven - time @entity4 winning trainer @entity29 's @entity28 , under @entity30 , in third
@entity31 was finishing fast but could do no better than fourth
@entity1 started as a 4 - 6 favorite and was supported by a huge following , being cheered to the rafters in the ring even prior to the race
but the @entity38 - trained @entity37 and @entity39 set a blistering pace with the former leading by 15 lengths entering the home straight of the mile and a half ( 2,400 meters ) race
unbeaten @entity49 filly @entity47 then hit the front before 50 - year - old @entity22 and the superstar @entity1 worked their magic to emulate his dam ( mother ) @entity56 who won the race in 1993 .
