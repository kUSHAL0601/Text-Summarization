@entity0 -- @entity3 's wife has agreed to drop a legal claim over her husband 's remains , according to @entity8 conservator @entity7
@entity8 will be buried at @entity9 following a private family service , @entity7 said , instead of another cemetery plot he bought years ago before splitting with his wife
@entity9 is the final resting place of @entity14 , @entity15 and a long list of show biz a-listers
a date for the funeral will be decided next week , @entity7 said
@entity7 said he 'll approach studio leaders about holding another memorial service the public can attend
the agreement between @entity8 and @entity7 , reached just before a court hearing on the dispute friday , also bans @entity8 's estranged stepson @entity26 from attending the service
@entity8 died sunday of natural causes at age 93
while @entity8 disinherited his children , his wife and all but one of her children in a will he signed just weeks before his death , court papers suggest there is not much in his estate to fight over
his personal property is valued at just $ 18,000 despite an unmatched 90 - year film career
@entity7 had said in a court filing that he believed @entity8 's estranged wife , @entity8 , and her son , @entity26 , would attempt to remove @entity8 's body from @entity44 's mortuary
a @entity0 judge signed a handwritten order tuesday preventing anyone from removing @entity8 's remains until friday 's hearing
@entity7 , who is named as estate executor in the will , asked for that authority
@entity8 signed an agreement waiving all claims to her husband 's estate after the couple separated in june 2012 after 34 years of marriage , according to a court filing
she will benefit from @entity8 's @entity60 and other pensions totaling $ 8,400 a month , @entity7 said
@entity8 : a spokesman against elder abuse the will signed by @entity8 on march 11 , 2014 , left the entire estate to stepson @entity66 , one of @entity8 's sons , who was the actor 's caretaker the last two years of his life
@entity8 had no negative feelings toward his surviving children , but they were all financially better off than he was , @entity7 said
he believed what little he had to leave should go to @entity66 and his wife , because they had been taking good care of him in the final two years , @entity7 said
@entity7 acknowledged hearing " grumbling " from @entity8 's family members about being left out of the estate but said none of the others " ever changed one of @entity80 ( adult undergarments )
" a probate hearing is scheduled for may 12 to start the process of probating the actor 's will .
