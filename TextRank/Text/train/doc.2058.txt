@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 shipping company has been in contact with @entity7 pirates who hijacked a ship with nine crew members as it traveled through the @entity10 on sunday , a spokesman said tuesday
last month @entity12 commandoes landed in @entity7 and captured a group of pirates
@entity15 , of @entity16 , which owns the @entity17 , revealed the company has been in contact with the hijackers and that none of the crew had been harmed
" everybody was fine under the circumstances , " he said , speaking from @entity23 , @entity1
" they were all fine ... [ and ] were treated quite well
" the ship was anchored off the coast of @entity7 , within @entity7 's 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) territorial limit , @entity15 said
he would not comment on the pirates ' demands out of concern for the crew of four @entity34 and five @entity35 , and would not say whether the shipping company was negotiating with them
he said he assumed the pirate gang was armed but they have not told him how many they are or whether the are associated with any group
the ship , carrying parts of an old oil rig , was chartered by @entity43 , and was traveling from @entity44 to @entity45 , @entity15 said
it flies under an @entity48 flag
" of course , we hope we get our people , " @entity15 said
he said that the shipping company had contacted all relevant countries for help , including the @entity1 , @entity34 , and @entity7
wary of previous hijackings near the @entity7 coast , @entity15 said the @entity17 had not been traveling within the country 's 12 - mile ( 20 - kilometer ) territorial limit when it was seized
there have been 24 attacks on ships near the @entity7 coast and in the @entity10 this year , said capt. @entity61 , director of the @entity62 , which tracks pirate attacks
of those 24 , he said , seven have been successful hijackings
@entity65 of the same bureau said that @entity7 pirates seem to take ships " purely for financial gain
" in the seven cases this year , most were resolved with a ransom payment , @entity65 said , adding that the pirates in @entity7 typically treat the crews on the hijacked ships well
@entity65 added there are at least four distinct pirate groups in the country and it is difficult to tell which group is responsible for which hijacking
a draft resolution introduced to the @entity82 last month would combat @entity7 hijackings by allowing foreign governments to pursue pirate vessels into @entity7 's territorial waters and make arrests
the resolution , sponsored by the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity12 and @entity91 , noted that @entity7 's transitional government welcomes international assistance
maritime groups say they hope the resolution is adopted and expanded to other waters .
