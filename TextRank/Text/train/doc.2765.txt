-- they were orphaned and separated at a young age , victims of the devastating violence that ravaged @entity5 in 1994
but @entity6 and her brother @entity9 were reunited nearly 10 years after the genocide and have now joined forces to help develop their country and link all @entity5 together
the two siblings have combined their skills in it and communication to launch @entity17 , @entity5 's top online advertisement platform
similar to the popular @entity21 website @entity22 , @entity19 is a web - based classified ad directory where @entity5 can post or look for job vacancies as well as buy , sell and rent just about anything -- from houses and cars to watches and shoes
just two years after its launch , @entity19 is today the third most popular website in @entity5 , with about 9,000 visitors per day
" we said we had to create a product that would help a lot of people , " says @entity9
" what @entity5 need now is information , so we started @entity40 to deliver the most accurate and timely information to them

" when you went to @entity55 and you wrote @entity5 , you used to have all the stories about the genocide , " she says
" but now , if you write @entity5 , you can have jobs , cars and get another image of the country -- a positive image that 's bringing hope to people
" separation , despair , euphoria it 's this deep desire to help @entity5 overcome the legacy of conflict that 's been driving @entity70 and @entity6 's efforts -- a sentiment rooted within their troubled past and their personal tales of loss , struggle and survival
back in 1994 , the two siblings , along with their parents and brother , fled to the @entity82 to escape the violence plaguing @entity5
but while in @entity85 , their mother passed away from blood loss following surgery
it was then that it was decided that it 'd be better for @entity6 , who was 11 at the time , to go and live with her godmother in @entity92
@entity9 , six years older than @entity6 , stayed behind with his father and brother and continued his school education
but in 1996 , just after @entity70 had traveled to the city of @entity98 by himself to take his university entrance exams , violence erupted in the eastern @entity82 , forcing his father and brother to head back to @entity5
for @entity70 , however , there was no escape route
alone in a foreign country , he had to " follow the refugee direction , " he says
" during all those years , i was struggling in the @entity82 , " adds @entity70 , " without knowing if my father or my brother or my sister , were still alive -- i was without any information
" read this : old boat sails turned into uplifting art back home , no one knew anything about @entity70 or his whereabouts
his father and relatives were constantly trying to track him but their efforts were proving fruitless , since @entity70 had found refuge in @entity122 , an isolated region in eastern @entity82 situated in the middle of equatorial forest
the days without news turned to weeks and the weeks turned to years
as time passed by , some of his relatives lost hope -- but not his younger sister in @entity92
" they were saying that you should forget about him because nine years is too long to hope that someone is alive , " remembers @entity6
" but i could n't believe that ! " @entity6 's faith was rewarded in late 2003 when some relatives managed to finally trace @entity70 in @entity5 's neighboring country
" when you are in the @entity82 there is a lot of misleading information , like ' in @entity5 there is no life , ' or ' once you reach there you will be killed , ' " says @entity9
" but this man came with a photograph of one member of my family as a proof they 'd met each other , " he adds
" he told me ' they need you ' so we can arrange how you can meet your family
" convinced that his relatives were still alive , @entity70 embarked on the dangerous journey on foot
passing through armed militia and traveling at night , he traversed the eastern @entity82 's tough terrains for one week before managing to reach @entity98
there , a family member was waiting for him to get him back home and sadly inform him that his father had passed away a couple of months before
" i still have , today , a picture of me where my father has written at the back saying that they 're still searching for me , " says @entity9
" even if he died , he died with that hope i 'm still alive , " he continues

" in @entity92 , @entity6 was also ecstatic about her brother 's return
" it 's like a fairy tale , " she says
" sometimes he says , ' chance , i know that we 're going far , because if @entity189 kept us alive , it 's for a reason , so this is why i am here and that is our story
' " connecting a country the two siblings have now added a new chapter to their long story with the launch of @entity200
currently , they are the company 's only staff -- @entity9 , who went on to do computer courses after his return , is in charge of it , while @entity6 , an information and communications graduate , is dealing with marketing and @entity210 " we have to work hard , " says @entity6 , who also works full - time as an administration coordinator for a @entity214 - based ngo
" so we are , for now , the web masters , we are our own bosses , we are the ones marketing , we are the @entity210 although @entity19 barely makes a profit at the moment , the two entrepreneurs have big plans for the future
by next year they aim to advance the site so visitors can navigate its information without an internet connection , using the simplest mobile phones -- over 60 % of @entity5 's population have mobile phones , a much larger number than people with access to the @entity234
@entity70 and @entity6 are exploring voice options and sms technology as they look to grow their company
but for this brother and sister team , boosting connectivity amongst all @entity5 through their business will be the ultimate success
" we are inspired by our parents because they taught us that nothing is impossible , " says @entity9
" they were like , ' if you have an idea , go for it , there is no limit -- you just need to work hard , ' " adds @entity6
