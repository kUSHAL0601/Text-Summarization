-- local favorite @entity1 was a man under pressure but it seldom showed as he kept his @entity4 bid alive on tuesday
the @entity5 knew that anything other than victory against @entity9 @entity8 would have eliminated him from the prestigious season - ending event in @entity11
after losing his opening match to @entity14 's @entity13 on sunday , @entity1 raised his game as he won 6 - 3 7 - 5 while @entity8 , who suffered his second straight defeat , hit 33 unforced errors
" on sunday , there was n't much magic , " @entity1 said on court after victory
" today , i came up with some good shots at the right moments
@entity8 did n't serve as well as he can
" i played a solid match
" the @entity5 now needs to beat an in - form @entity25 in both players ' final @entity28 game on thursday to be sure of reaching the semifinals
@entity25 tops the group with a 100 % record , while both @entity1 and @entity13 have won one and lost one
" it 's always a pleasure to play against @entity25 , " @entity1 added
" he 's one of the greatest players that 's ever played the game so to get the opportunity to play him in an atmosphere like this is excellent
" @entity1 may well find that he does n't receive all the support at the @entity44 given the sizable @entity46 contingent that greeted their favorite 's 6 - 3 6 - 2 victory over @entity13 earlier on tuesday
with two wins out of two in @entity28 , following a straight sets win over @entity8 on sunday , @entity25 is on course to continue his dependable displays at the tournament
993 and counting ... the 33 - year - old , who needs just one set to go through , has reached the semifinals on all but one of his 12 previous appearances at the @entity4
should he reach the last four , he will match the record of @entity62 -- who reached the semis on 12 occasions
a masterly display against @entity13 , the first @entity67 man to qualify for the @entity4 singles , also took @entity25 to within seven wins of 1,000 career victories
currently boasting 993 triumphs from 1,219 matches , only @entity73 ( 1,253 wins ) and @entity62 ( 1,071 ) have previously broken a barrier that is testament to both longevity and class
" it would obviously be cool to get there -- i think it 's a great number , " said the 17 - time grand slam champion , to cheers and the sound of cowbells from a vocal @entity46 contingent
he also has the chance to finish the year as no. 1 for a record - equalling sixth time , although any possibility of doing so will be dashed should @entity91 , who beat @entity93 champion @entity92 in his opener on monday , win all three of his @entity96 games
@entity13 , who lacked the poise he showed when beating @entity1 on sunday , showered praise on the @entity99 afterwards
" i never feel that he 's 33 , " said the 24 - year - old , who finished runner - up at this year 's @entity93
" he still looks young and plays amazing tennis
" on wednesday , @entity96 hosts its second round of matches as @entity91 meets @entity105 while @entity92 and @entity106 both go in search of their first wins .
