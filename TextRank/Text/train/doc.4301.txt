@entity0 -- the @entity3 , with a shiny new high - definition screen , may have been the sexiest star of @entity6 's keynote address at its @entity7 on monday
but updates to its mobile operating system may make the biggest impact on users in the months , and years , to come
and they both clearly target @entity14 , @entity6 's fellow tech titan and , increasingly , its key rival
a brand new map system , complete with @entity19 imaging and voice - assisted , turn - by - turn navigation is clearly @entity6 's effort to keep @entity22 and @entity24 users home instead of clicking on what had been the system 's go - to app , @entity28
and an upgrade to @entity30 looks to turn the @entity32 's feature from a novelty with a few useful applications into the full - fledged " digital assistant " the company promises , with voice - activated search being a key component
some might view these changes as continuing the late @entity41 ' feud with @entity14 over what he felt was that company 's theft of @entity22 features for its mobile @entity46 system
" i 'm willing to go to thermonuclear war on this , " @entity41 told his biographer , @entity47 , after suing @entity14 in 2010
at least one expert on monday saw @entity6 's latest moves as a strategic way to limit @entity14 's mobile growth
" we believe the biggest takeaway is that @entity6 is strengthening not only the interaction within its own ecosystem , but also creating a consortium of powerful web partners to offer an experience that largely falls outside of @entity14 's walls , " said @entity54 , an industry analyst with @entity55
" we believe @entity6 will continue to add content partners for @entity30 to marginalize @entity14 's presence on the @entity22
" even enhanced @entity67 integration ( it 's cooked right in to @entity68 , making sharing to the site seamless ) , can be seen as a jab at @entity14 's efforts to gain a foothold in the social media world with @entity74
but it was maps which may have marked the most direct @entity78 move
@entity14 has been providing mapping information to @entity6 since the @entity22 launched in 2007
" in @entity68 , we have built an entire new mapping system from the ground up ; and it looks beautiful , " @entity80 , @entity6 's vice president in charge of the mobile system , said monday
" this is a worldwide effort
we 're covering the world
" there was turn - by - turn navigation , with voice assistance delivered in the same voice that @entity22 users know as @entity30
and then there were the stylistic flourishes @entity6 has made its trademark , like " @entity95 , " images recorded from planes and helicopters that give the user a panoramic look at their location from just about any angle
@entity14 did n't have much to say monday , handing out a brief , basic statement
" we 've been working on maps for years , in fact just announced some exciting new developments for @entity28 and @entity109 last week and are looking forward to continuing to build the perfect map for our users in the months and years ahead , " a spokesperson said
@entity14 clearly saw at least that part of the broadside coming
in anticipation of the @entity6 announcement , @entity14 announced a set of improvements last week to @entity28 in what it called part of " the never - ending quest for the perfect map
" significantly , 3 - d modeling , one of the features touted by @entity6 on monday , was among the upgrades
and the " never - ending quest " bit highlights one of @entity14 's perceived advantages here
and @entity14 has , in fact , been working on mapping the world since maps was introduced in 2004
duplicating those efforts with an essentially new product will be a tall order for @entity6 , and if it does n't work smoothly from the outset , users will find it easy to migrate back
another , more subtle swipe at a @entity14 stronghold , came voiced by @entity30
the @entity22 voice assistant , which will soon be available for the new @entity24 , has been fun for the past eight months
but now , @entity6 wants to make her more useful
she 's learned how to give you sports scores
you know ... the sort of things you now @entity14
the @entity154 update is scheduled to roll out this fall ( which , not coincidentally , is around the time analysts expect a new @entity22 to be introduced )
that 's plenty of time for @entity6 to build buzz around the new features
but it 's also plenty of time for @entity14 to roll out something new of its own
the company has n't been shy about encroaching on what @entity6 considered its own turf
the relative success of @entity14 's @entity46 operating system , which is now on more phones than @entity6 's @entity68 , has n't shown any signs of slowing down
all of which means tech consumers might be able to just sit back and reap the benefits .
