@entity5 had thumped @entity6 6 - 0 on their own ground last season and the visitors were out for revenge -- but conceded twice in four minutes
after 15 minutes , @entity18 goalkeeper @entity17 let a routine @entity2 cross slip out of his hands and @entity21 rolled home into the empty net
four minutes later @entity2 played a great one - two with @entity11 and rifled a shot past @entity17 for his sixth goal of the season and @entity27 added a third late on
" it was a deserved victory against a rival that we have had problems with in the past , " explained @entity5 coach @entity28

" it was an important victory because it is the final match before we go away on international duty , " said @entity48 winger @entity63
" we are now top for the next two weeks and can build on that when we return
