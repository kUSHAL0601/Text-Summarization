@entity0 -- the @entity3 on monday condemned the violence in @entity5 and called for a halt to the " unacceptable bloodshed " in response to civil unrest , secretary of state @entity2 said in a statement
" the government of @entity5 has a responsibility to respect the universal rights of the people , including the right to free expression and assembly , " @entity12 's statement said
" now is the time to stop this unacceptable bloodshed
we are working urgently with friends and partners around the world to convey this message to the @entity5 government
" it was the highest - level statement so far by the @entity3 government on the accelerating strife in @entity5 , where reports monday indicated a deteriorating situation with some military forces and pro-government allies attacking anti-government demonstrators
two @entity37 senators called monday for president @entity38 to publicly denounce what they called " egregious violations of human rights " by @entity5 leader col. @entity42
" we urge the president to speak out clearly in support of the @entity5 people , " said a statement by sen. @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46 , @entity47
@entity3 authorities were keeping a close watch on @entity5 's rapidly unfolding political crisis , in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform , a senior @entity38 administration official said
among other things , @entity0 was taking a close look at a speech early monday by @entity62 -- the @entity5 leader 's son -- which included warnings of a civil war if demonstrations in the @entity69 country do n't stop
in the speech , @entity70 also acknowledged political change occurring throughout @entity69 and the @entity73 , and proposed " radical " reforms -- such as bolstering local governments , relaxing restrictive laws , raising salaries , extending loans and drafting a constitution , which does n't exist now
@entity38 officials continued to discuss with their @entity5 counterparts the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters , the @entity38 administration official added
the @entity86 , meanwhile , ordered all @entity3 @entity88 family members and non-emergency personnel to depart @entity5
@entity3 citizens were urged to defer all travel to the country
despite the warning from @entity42 's son , @entity5 's protesters showed no sign of backing down
after @entity42 's government apparently lost control of the city of @entity101 , angry protesters said they hoped for a similar turn of events in the capital , @entity105
@entity105 residents said state - run @entity107 was attacked sunday evening by anti-government protesters
@entity1 , however , could not immediately confirm reports
the @entity5 government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from @entity1 for access to the country
@entity1 has interviewed witnesses by phone
the unrest , spurred largely by high unemployment and demands for freedom , has left at least 233 people dead in @entity5 , according to @entity123 , citing hospital sources
the growing @entity3 pressure on @entity42 -- a famously mercurial leader -- is only the latest in a series of twists and turns in the relationship between @entity0 and @entity105 over his 42 years of rule
in 1986 , @entity5 was implicated in the fatal bombing at a @entity135 nightclub that resulted in the death an @entity3 service member
president @entity138 ordered the bombing targets in @entity5 in response and imposed economic sanctions
@entity138 dubbed @entity42 the " mad dog of the @entity73
" two years later , @entity5 was implicated in the 1988 bombing of @entity144 , which exploded over @entity145 , @entity146
in 1999 , @entity42 tried to thaw his icy relationship with the @entity135 , agreeing to demands to turn over suspects in the @entity145 bombing
in 2003 , he agreed to eliminate his pursuit and stockpile of weapons of mass destruction
the moves helped @entity5 regain diplomatic relations with the @entity3 in 2006
in 2008 , however , @entity158 officials jailed one of @entity42 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw @entity5 money from @entity158 banks and threaten to sever diplomatic ties
two years ago , @entity42 returned to the international spotlight yet again when @entity146 agreed to release convicted @entity145 bomber @entity168 , who received a hero 's welcome in @entity5
@entity146 authorities said @entity168 was terminally ill with cancer and , as a result , was released on compassionate grounds
skeptics , including several @entity3 senators , contend that @entity168 was released as part of a deal fueled by @entity180 business interests in @entity5 , including oil giant @entity181
@entity5 is one of @entity184 's key oil suppliers
@entity1 's @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .
