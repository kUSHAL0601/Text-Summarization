" we know it 's @entity5
we apologize for the delay , but we ca n't control the weather , " @entity16 said
" as soon as we can , we 're going to get all of those packages delivered
" hundreds of people waited in line saturday outside of the @entity11 building in @entity23 , hoping to pick up their packages , @entity7 said
a winter weather system blasted broad swaths of the @entity27 and @entity28 this week , dumping heavy snow
" this makes no sense
that 's what it does here
so how are you in the business that you ca n't deliver what you say ? " @entity40 , a frustrated customer , told kusa
@entity11 has said it planned to make more than 120 million deliveries this week , its busiest of the year .
