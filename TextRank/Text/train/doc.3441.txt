drinking a daily cup of coffee -- or even several cups -- is n't likely to harm your health , and it may even lower your risk of dying from chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease , a new study in the @entity11 suggests
the relationship between coffee drinking and health has been a hot topic in recent years , but research has produced mixed results
some studies have linked coffee consumption to better health and a lower risk of premature death , while others suggest that coffee -- or rather caffeine -- might contribute to heart disease through negative effects on blood pressure , cholesterol , and heart rate
the new study is by far the largest of its kind to date
as part of a joint project with the @entity37 , researchers from the @entity34 followed more than 400,000 healthy men and women between the ages of 50 and 71 for up to 13 years , during which 13 % of the participants died
@entity42 : big perks -- coffee 's health benefits overall , coffee drinkers were less likely than their peers to die during the study , and the more coffee they drank , the lower their mortality risk tended to be
compared with people who drank no coffee at all , men and women who drank six or more cups per day were 10 % and 15 % less likely , respectively , to die during the study
this pattern held when the researchers broke out the data by specific causes of death , including heart disease , lung disease , pneumonia , stroke , diabetes , infections , and even injuries and accidents
cancer was the only major cause of death not associated with coffee consumption
" there has been some concern that coffee might increase the risk of death , and this provides some reassurance against that worry , " says @entity74 , @entity75 , the lead author of the study and an investigator with the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the @entity81 , in @entity82 , @entity83
@entity42 : trying to cut back on coffee ? here 's how even moderate coffee consumption was linked to better survival odds
drinking a single cup per day -- which was much more common than a six - cup - a - day habit -- was associated with a 6 % lower risk of dying among men and a 5 % lower risk among women
although these reductions in risk might seem modest , they could have potentially dramatic implications for public health if spread out over the tens of millions of coffee drinkers in the @entity107 , says @entity108 , @entity75 , chair of community and preventive medicine at the @entity111 , in @entity112 , @entity113
" even a small decrease , when you 're talking about a [ behavior ] that is so ubiquitous across the human population , could mean many , many lives saved , " @entity108 says
@entity42 : is coffee healthier than you think ? the findings , however , stop short of saying that coffee drinking directly lowers the risk of chronic disease
like much of the previous research on coffee , the study was based on survey data -- in this case , a single questionnaire distributed in the mid- 1990s -- that may provide an incomplete picture of the participants ' overall health and lifestyle
although the researchers took into account a wide range of extenuating factors , including diet and exercise regimens , smoking , alcohol consumption , body mass index , and marital status , it 's possible that people who drink coffee differ from the rest of the population in as - yet unidentified ways that make them less vulnerable to disease and early death
the explanation for the study findings " might not specifically be the coffee , " @entity108 says
" it might be some characteristic of the coffee drinker
" @entity42 : surprising sources of caffeine still , it 's plausible that coffee drinking actually improves health
coffee contains some 1,000 compounds , many of which are health - promoting antioxidants , @entity74 says
" there 's some data showing that some of these components may prevent insulin resistance and have a role in diabetes , " he says
in the study , both regular and decaf were associated with a lower risk of dying , which suggests that these and other substances in coffee might be more important than caffeine
but even decaf contains trace amounts of caffeine , so the authors ca n't entirely rule out the possibility that caffeine has an effect on health , @entity74 says .
