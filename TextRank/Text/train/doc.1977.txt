-- @entity2 striker @entity1 has escaped further punishment after a show of petulance following his sending off during @entity7 's weekend defeat at @entity8
@entity1 confronts referee @entity9 following his dismissal during the defeat at @entity8
but @entity1 will receive a formal written warning from the @entity13 after punching the corner flag when ordered from the pitch
@entity1 was dismissed for two bookable offences during his side 's 2 - 0 defeat -- the second caution coming after he hurled the ball in the direction of where referee @entity9 wanted a free kick taken
although @entity1 exchanged words with @entity9 after being shown red , the official has confirmed he was not sworn at by the player
an @entity13 spokesman said : " we have clarified with @entity9 that there was no abuse from the player after he was dismissed
" in relation to the incident when he punched the corner flag , the referee did not see that and we have written to @entity1 reminding him of his responsibilities
" it means @entity1 will only be suspended for one game , the @entity43 visit of @entity44 to @entity45 on april 5 .
