@entity0 , @entity1 -- we 've all seen them on the train or the bus
@entity7 glued to their chest , thumbs hovering and their eyes locked in a digitally - induced trance
but according to a @entity17 occupational psychologist , persistent monitoring of your @entity14 will increase stress levels and most likely decrease productivity too
@entity20 from @entity21 studied the @entity14 habits of a group of executives in middle to senior management who were either high or low frequency users
" high " users would typically switch on their @entity14 during the commute to work and would keep them on in the evenings and during weekends
" @entity33 " users would generally allocate specific times to check their @entity14 and respond to emails
" people who fell into the high user category tend to have a distorted perception of their own usage and they equate their @entity14 use with being dedicated to the job , " @entity20 told @entity2
but these displays of enthusiasm did n't translate into efficiency
in one example @entity20 observed a high frequency user trying to complete a simple spreadsheet
the task , @entity20 estimates , should have taken about 20 minutes but ended up taking three times as long because of @entity14 monitoring
the knock - on effect of this disruption is the anxiety it creates
" you 're not finishing what you are supposed to be doing
the dependency it creates when you ca n't find it , or it buzzes when you ca n't do anything about it because you are in a meeting causes stress , " he said
while high users are driven to distraction , their partners are sometimes compelled to destruction
i heard a story of one being flushed down the toilet , " @entity20 said
@entity20 advises companies whose employees have been issued with a smartphone to at least provide a basic level of training
" you need to know how to use it properly
after all , we get training when every other technology comes online , " @entity20 said
he suggests companies try to encourage their employees to set a limit on usage
of course , there are going to be exceptions -- but on the whole @entity20 recommends a maximum of 12 hours use during the working week
on a personal level , @entity20 advice is simple : " at the start of any task , turn it off ! interruptions do n't help anyone do anything better , faster or at a higher quality
" he added that research suggests people who respond to emails in batches take much less time doing it and are better at it
with more people upgrading to smartphones , issues over productivity and stress will surely rise as more executives find the line between work and leisure time blurring
it 's a trend which concerns @entity114 , professor of organizational psychology and health at @entity17 's @entity116
" we are finding that people are working on their paid work in what used to be their leisure time and that 's having consequences both for their health and their productivity , " @entity114 told @entity2
" remember , all these technologies are supposed to be our social support system
but what they 've ended up being is an umbilical cord back to the workplace even in our non-work roles in life
" i think what 's ended up happening is the technology is managing the people rather than the people managing the technology , " he added
@entity114 believes the recession has perhaps compounded the problem as people feel more job insecure but he urges executives to seize the initiative
" the thing that causes people the most stress in life is not having control
if you are on holiday , access it once every two days , explain to someone that you are away and you 'll deal with it when you get back
