@entity0 is speaking out about his flub while introducing @entity3 's singing performance at the @entity4 on sunday night
@entity0 butchered the singer 's name , calling her " the wickedly talented @entity3
" for the record , the pronunciation should have been closer to " @entity9 - zelle
" @entity3 performed the @entity4 - winning song " @entity11 " from " frozen , " which also won the best animated feature @entity4
@entity0 's publicist sent this statement to @entity17 , requesting that it be shared in its entirety : " i 've been beating myself up all day
then i thought ... what would @entity3 say she 'd say , let it go , let it go ! @entity3 is incredibly talented and i am so happy @entity12 took home two @entity4 sunday night ! " ironically , the initial statement sent to @entity17 tuesday was also somewhat distorted , containing sentence fragments and missing key phrases
the blunder resulted in great fun across social networks , with some help from @entity30 's " widget to travoltify your own name
" " you 're no one until you 've had your name mangled by a confused , squinting @entity0 , " @entity30 said
" what 's your @entity36 name ? find out with our handy widget ! " @entity40 " @entity39 " becomes " @entity41
" @entity42 is translated into " @entity43
" @entity0 is " @entity44
