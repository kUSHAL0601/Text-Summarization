-- an @entity2 court has sentenced former president @entity3 to seven years in prison for his role in illegally smuggling weapons to @entity7 and @entity8
an appeals court found @entity3 guilty of aggravated smuggling earlier this year
@entity3 , 82 , is serving as a senator and has immunity from going to prison , but lawmakers could vote to strip him of that protection
on thursday , the court also sentenced former @entity2 defense minister @entity18 to 5Â½ years in prison
@entity3 was @entity2 's president from 1989 to 1999
he has maintained his innocence
the case against him and other government officials began in october 2008
hundreds of witnesses testified , according to judicial officials
in 2011 , a court absolved him of charges that he violated international weapons embargoes , but prosecutors won an appeal earlier this year
prosecutors alleged that @entity3 authorized the illegal sales of weapons to @entity7 and @entity8 between 1991 and 1995
both @entity7 and @entity8 were involved in armed conflicts at the time , and prosecutors said the weapons sales violated @entity39 and @entity41 embargoes
in 2011 , @entity3 told judges at a @entity44 court that his actions as president were " limited to signing decrees exporting weapons to @entity49 and @entity50
" " from there , all the proceedings that were carried out were out of control of the president , " he said
