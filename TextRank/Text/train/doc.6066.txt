@entity0 , @entity1 -- when president @entity3 said wednesday night that rep. @entity4 had opened her eyes for the first time since being shot on saturday , an overflow crowd of nearly 30,000 people at a memorial event erupted into cheers that the congresswoman may have heard in her hospital room
@entity3 said he learned of the eye - opening from @entity4 ' husband , astronaut @entity14
" she knows we 're here , and she knows we love her , and she knows that we will be rooting for her throughout what will be a difficult journey , " the president said at a memorial in @entity0 to honor the victims of the shooting
@entity4 is still listed in critical condition at the @entity24 's @entity23
suspect @entity25 allegedly fired at her first , striking her in the head
as soon as @entity3 finished his remarks , sen. @entity27 , @entity29 - @entity28 , let it be known that she , rep. @entity27 , @entity32 , and @entity34 minority leader @entity33 , @entity35 , were in the room at the time , along with @entity14 and @entity4 ' parents
" it was like witnessing a miracle , " @entity27 told @entity2
" @entity27 and i were telling her how much she was inspiring the nation with her courage , her strength , and we were talking about the things we wanted to do as soon as she was better , " the senator said
" i said , ' we 'll have another night out for beer and pizza with your husband
' and @entity27 started talking to her about their house in @entity54 , just talking about all the things we wanted to do , and all of a sudden she started to struggle to open her eyes
so @entity14 saw that and said , ' @entity59 , @entity57 , open your eyes
' she kept struggling and struggling and @entity14 just kept encouraging her
and within a moment she literally opened her eyes
" " the doctors could n't believe it , " @entity27 said
" @entity14 started encouraging her , saying ' @entity57 , give me a thumbs up if you can see , if you can see me , touch my ring , touch my wedding ring
' she started doing that , " she said
" we just kept talking to her and talking to her about the fun we 've had with her , and so then she opened her eyes more
she went from opening her eyes really just in slits to opening them nearly fully
it was n't very long , and then they closed again
but it was just absolutely -- it was the most incredible , aside from my kids , the most incredible experience
" @entity4 kept her eyes open " for a moment , " @entity27 said -- " maybe 30 seconds , maybe 60 seconds
" " you could see she was focusing and @entity14 said , ' @entity57 if you can see me , give me the thumbs up , ' and not only did she give the thumbs up , she literally raised her entire hand , " @entity27 later told @entity2
doctors sent them out of the room shortly after that , @entity27 said , because @entity4 needed to rest .
