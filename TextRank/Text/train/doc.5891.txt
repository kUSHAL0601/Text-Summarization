it has been described as @entity2 on snow
twelve horses line up in a start gate but the race is far from conventional
the race track is a snow - covered frozen lake and attached to each horse is a skier
it is akin to human chariot racing as riders hit speeds of 50km/h jostling for position and , ultimately , victory
the sport of skijoring has a long and rich history
and @entity21 and the @entity23 ski resort of @entity24 have been a part of the @entity27 event for over three decades
with its often combative nature , it is no wonder @entity32 likens the sport to the 1959 film starring @entity35
" skijoring is just something that people want to see , " he says
" it 's like @entity2 on snow , the modern way
i love the speed , the adrenalin rush is something special
" skijoring comes from the @entity49 word skikj√∏ring , which literally translates as ski driving , and is thought to date back to the 14th century
in @entity24 , the sport began in 1906 and was even a display sport at the @entity53
when it first began , participants set off at one - minute intervals over a 10 - kilometer stretch
but after it was switched to a makeshift racecourse , the race now consists of two laps covering a distance of 2,700 meters
there is no doubting the precarious nature of the sport
at one notorious race in 1965 , not a single entrant finished
and at the last race , during the notoriously challenging start where jockeys aim to avoid getting their ropes tangled , @entity21 says : " one jockey crashed his head and lost a few minutes with a loss of consciousness
" some 10,000 people flock to each race in the @entity77 , creating a party atmosphere for the only three events of the year held each february
the overall victor is crowned " @entity81 , " so called after the valley where the racing takes place
@entity21 , who has been skijoring for 31 years and has no qualms about nudging horses out of his in a bid for on - track supremacy , was crowned king on sunday
the 55 - year - old could only finish fifth in the third and final race of the three - week series , but two previous wins towed by the horse @entity95 proved sufficient for another title
his family ran a horse - carriage business , so skijoring allies one passion with another
his day job is as the director of @entity104
and having stumbled on the sport in the first place , he says : " skijoring is something you ca n't forget
maybe we 're a little bit crazy , i do n't know
" there are obvious dangers to the sport , not least wrestling with reins and ropes in a melee of horses and drivers at the start
" you get very close to the other horses , it 's like a sandwich and it 's a bit dangerous , " he explained
" you have horses in front and behind and the danger is someone can stand on your ski
" amazingly , though , @entity32 has never had a major accident in his time in the sport and is pleased to point out there have been no deaths during his era
although there have been a litany of injuries to others , " nothing too bad , broken arms and legs , " he adds matter - of - factly
it 's not just in @entity23 where skijoring has taken hold , variations of the sport can entail people being driven by dogs or even motor vehicles
in the @entity158 , it generally involves jockeyed horses pulling skiers along by a rope -- catching hoops and tackling jumps along the course
for @entity166 , president of the @entity168 @entity167 , which hosts its own @entity169 at the end of january each year in front of 4,000 spectators , the sport almost cost him his life
@entity166 does not ski -- he rides the horses instead -- but became precariously unstuck while training for one particular competition
" i was running my horse through ice and snow when it broke through the ground and half a ton of horse came down on me , " he recalled
" it all happened in slow motion
" i heard my neck break , i heard it crack like a gun going off
" with his head planted , he could n't move
he was trapped in the snow , with just enough room to breathe in a gap under his chin
he had broken the @entity195 and @entity196 vertebrae in his neck and was now alone as his horse headed back to the barn
" i was getting very anxious that this was where i was going to die , " he said
but eventually he regained sufficient movement in his arm to telephone for help and was in an ambulance 20 minutes later
two hours later he was moving his toes and , defying the doctors , he was walking within two days
" the doctor said one tenth of 1 % of people that have that injury live and one tenth of that number walk again
" despite the horrific nature of his injuries four years ago he returned to skijoring only to fall again and break eight ribs leading to a longer hiatus from the sport , which ended two years ago
for him , it is a drug he just can not give up : " it 's a lot of fun , it 's a kick
i do n't think there 's any sport to compare to it
it 's an unusual combination of old cowboys and skiers getting together to make a big run
when i compete , the adrenalin is just unbelievable
" as for the wider appeal , he jokes : " the silly story is that some guys got together to have a combination of who the best horseman is , the best skier and the best drinker , and this combines all three ! " so what exactly makes a good skijoring competitor ? @entity21 , who like his fellow riders has to take an exam in order to be eligible to compete , explains : " first it is experience , and knowing what can happen in a race so you can react when something goes wrong
" you have to be a very good skier and you have to have the feeling of the horse
you need to be a team
often these are horses you do n't know so they need to get an immediate confidence from you
" edging into his 2015 season finale , @entity32 continues to master that triumvirate in what is perhaps the purest form of horsepower .
