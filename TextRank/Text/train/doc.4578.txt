the @entity1 hotel will doubtless inspire a few gags about a frosty reception when it opens in december 2016 , but once guests realize they 're about to check in to a giant floating snowflake , it could just as easily melt hearts
the 86 - room luxury venue has been designed by architecture firm @entity8 for the @entity10 city of @entity11 , offering clients a unique destination and an unrivaled spot from which to view the northern lights
" we call it a scar-less development , " architect @entity16 tells @entity17 , explaining why the five - star @entity18 will sit in icy waters off @entity11 's rugged coastline rather than on dry land
" because it 's floating , we do not have any impact on that location
if you take it away after 100 years or so , it will not leave any footprint
" that 's the only way to bring a hotel to such a precious and beautiful marine environment
" @entity16 says the @entity18 has been inspired by the floating architecture widely found in his low - lying @entity36 homeland , but will be on a far grander , and more opulent scale that is hoped will attract wealthy visitors from @entity39 , @entity40 and other parts of @entity42
" in the hotel , you 'll float through hallways lined with cool , futuristic blue shapes , recline by a fireplace faced in transparent bricks resembling ice blocks and sleep in rooms tricked out in minimalist , winter - themed designs , " he adds
floating real estate the @entity56 's best features , however , are the glass roofs that will offer clear views of the northern lights and windows that will gaze over the snowy tree - lined @entity10 coast
because it 's out at sea and not moored to the land , the hotel will only be accessible by boat , but the architect promises it wo n't be affected by high winds and waves thanks to " dampers , springs and cables
" " the floating basis is very big and because of that also very stable
you will not notice any movement
this hotel is floating real estate and will not move , " @entity16 says
" it 'll have the same look and feel as a land - based hotel , but on the most beautiful spot on the water
" the cost of building such a structure is n't disclosed , though put at 15 % higher than for an equivalent hotel on dry land
the @entity56 's dry dock construction was , in fact , first planned a few years ago , but put on ice ( of course ) until 2015 because of the global financial downturn
in the meantime , @entity36 @entity93 has begun work on a separate development in the @entity97
@entity98 , a complex of 185 floating villas in a flower - shaped configuration , is already being built near the islands ' capital male
rising water levels @entity105 , another planned development for the @entity97 , involves building a floating hotel in the shape of star
a further project involving floating private islands off @entity112 has also recently been announced
though his company 's hotels are designed for the luxury leisure market , they form a wider portfolio of work intended to address a more down to earth concern -- climate change
with the effects of rising water levels that scientists have blamed on global warming already being felt in @entity97 and @entity112 , @entity16 says we need to learn to live with the water , not just fight it
it 's an approach that has already drawn criticism from some environmentalists who say that we should be tackling the causes of global warming rather than taking to the seas to avoid its affects
@entity16 is convinced of the need for his approach
" i see around me the first signs of a new generation of climate change architects who do not only want to provide icons but also solutions , " he adds
" we live in a dynamic world where static buildings do not bring us the needed flexibility
" building on water brings us new space for expansion , safety against floods and flexibility to adjust developments without demolition whenever needed
