-- @entity1 has been a integral part of one of @entity5 's most successful teams since forming it 35 years ago , but he is now starting to pass on his legacy
the @entity8 boss , who turns 70 this month , announced on friday that he is standing down from the @entity11 team 's board and that he will be replaced by his daughter @entity12
@entity1 , who is tetraplegic and has been confined to a wheelchair since a car accident in 1986 , said the time had come for him to hand control over to the next generation
however , he will remain as team principal and keep his majority shareholding
" i have decided to signal the next stage in the gradual but inevitable process of handing over the reins to the next generation by stepping down from the board at the end of this month , " he said in a statement on @entity1 ' website
" it is no secret that @entity12 is my daughter but i am proud to say that she has fought hard to earn this appointment and , of all the battles she has had to fight , the prejudices of her father were not the least challenging
" i shall be looking to @entity12 to represent the @entity1 family on the board and i know that she will work tirelessly
" as well as her board role , @entity39 will start work as director of marketing and communications on april 1 in the place of the departing @entity43
@entity1 became the first @entity8 team to float on the stock exchange in march 2011 and the team has a rich heritage in the elite division of motorsport
but despite winning nine constructors ' titles -- a record bettered only by @entity53 -- and seven drivers ' championships , the marque which once employed legendary racers such as @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 has stuttered in recent years
the last time @entity1 won a grand prix was in 2004 , when @entity63 @entity62 drove to victory in @entity65
@entity1 finished 2011 ninth in the constructors ' standings after collecting just five points
@entity60 's nephew @entity70 will make his debut for the team alongside @entity74 's @entity73 at the season - opening @entity76 @entity75 on march 18 .
