-- people in the central @entity2 suffered through more severe weather thursday -- in the form of torrential rain , golf - ball - size hail and damaging winds , including a few reported tornadoes -- and braced for even more storms
tornado warnings were issued at one point or another thursday afternoon for portions of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17
just 10 days ago , @entity17 was in the cross hairs of a powerful tornado that left 24 dead
such warnings go out when witnesses or radar indicate a tornado
the @entity26 , in fact , noted there were reports of tornadoes in at least seven communities in western @entity13 -- as far west as @entity31 , as far south as @entity32 , and as far north as @entity33
at least nine people statewide suffered injuries -- four minor ones in @entity33 , three in @entity37 and two hurt by a lightning strike in @entity39 -- state emergency management spokesman @entity40 told @entity0
no details were immediately available on the conditions of any of those injured
two homes were destroyed in the small community of @entity33 , about 50 miles west of @entity46 , according to @entity40
the weather service noted , too , that power lines were knocked down and @entity49 was blocked at one point
three houses were reportedly damaged and three people were injured , around the small @entity37 town of @entity54 , according to the same agency
tornadoes also were reported in north - central @entity17 -- including in and around @entity57 and @entity58 , which is about 10 miles east
shortly after 3 p.m. ( 4 p.m. et ) , the @entity26 tweeted that a tornado " may be developing ... south of @entity57 , " which is about 50 miles northeast of @entity61
minutes later , a new message stated there had been a " brief tornado " reported that had " dissipated
" later thursday night , a tornado was reported in @entity66 , which is about 15 miles southeast of @entity67
there are personnel on the scene , but officials have no confirmed reports of damage from the incident , @entity69 emergency management official @entity68 said
the threat , and impact , of severe weather extended well beyond @entity13 and @entity17
@entity80 watches -- which means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form , though one has n't necessarily touched down -- at one time extended through an eight - state stretch extending from @entity86 north to @entity87
the weather service , for example , noted that a tornado was reported thursday evening in @entity91 , @entity14 , though it 's not know if it caused any damage
with or without confirmed funnel clouds , these storms packed a wallop
the weather service 's @entity67 office , for instance , noted one line of thunderstorms could also pack 70 - mph wind gusts
@entity17 weather experts also noted reports of half - dollar - size hail
flooding was the problem in places like @entity109 , @entity110 , where police rescued people from 16 vehicles in a 1Â½ - hour stretch on thursday afternoon after they got trapped due to intense flooding , fire department capt. @entity105 said
water in the streets went up to cars ' headlights , if not higher , after " torrential rain " fell on ground already saturated by storms the previous night
" the gutters and our storm system could n't handle it , " the captain said
" i 've lived here since 1979 , and i 've never seen that much rain that quick , " @entity105 told @entity0
even once night sets in thursday , that does n't mean everyone can breathe easy
the weather service 's @entity133 is forecasting a moderate chance of severe weather in parts of @entity17 , @entity138 , @entity13 and @entity139 on friday
the forecast is less dire saturday , but on sunday parts of the @entity142 could be in danger
the @entity133 says there is a 30 % or higher probability for severe thunderstorms sunday in parts of seven states , including the cities of @entity150 , @entity151 ; @entity152 , @entity153 ; and of the @entity155 cities of @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158
@entity0 's @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report .
