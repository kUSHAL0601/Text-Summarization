@entity2 @entity0 is building a " significant presence " in disputed waters in the @entity4 through land reclamation , new analysis shows
satellite images from late january analyzed by @entity9 show that @entity0 is reclaiming a significant amount of land at three sites in the @entity13 , in addition to two other sites previously documented by the defense publication
" where it used to have a few , small concrete platforms , it now has full islands with helipads , airstrips , harbors , and facilities to support large numbers of troops , " @entity17 , @entity19 's @entity18 editor , told @entity1
" we can see that this is a methodical , well - planned campaign to create a chain of air and sea capable fortresses across the center of the @entity13 chain
" in november , the publication reported that @entity0 was building an " air strip capable " island at least 3,000 meters long on @entity38
the @entity4 is the subject of numerous rival -- often messy -- territorial claims , with @entity0 , @entity43 , @entity44 , the @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters
the areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources
the latest images show for the first time reclamation at @entity58 -- a " large facility " is being constructed on 75,000 square meters of reclaimed land
@entity61 's also said that significant progress has been made at @entity63 and @entity64
" the buildings on @entity58 and @entity64 have almost identical footprints : that of a main square building with what appears to be an anti-aircraft tower or radome at each corner
" this suggests that @entity0 has standardized the design of key facilities and is rolling it out across its new islands
" @entity17 said that @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity45 , which also claim the disputed archipelago , are modifying existing islands but not reclaiming land on a large scale
he said the reclamation would technically do little to bolster @entity0 's claims to the islands under the @entity84 because these have to be based on naturally occurring features
" that said , if @entity0 's on the ground and is heavily armed , then it is going to be nigh on impossible for anyone to challenge or remove it , so international law is moot on this one , " @entity17 said
@entity0 's @entity93 did n't immediately respond to a request for comment .
