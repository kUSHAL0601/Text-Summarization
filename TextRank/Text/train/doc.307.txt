do n't call it " monopoly money
" not in @entity3 , anyway
as part of the 80th anniversary of @entity8 's first appearance in @entity3 , @entity4 is issuing a handful of special sets in that country with real euros in place of the colorful paper it usually offers
of the 80 special sets , 69 will have five 10 - euro notes and five 20 - euro notes , another 10 will come with five 20 - euro , two 50 - euro and one 100 - euro bills , and one set will have a complete bank drawer of real cash
that 's 20,580 euros -- or about $ 23,650 at current exchange rates -- for whomever buys the lucky box
@entity0 asked @entity4 whether a similar plan was in the works for the @entity30 -- where the game is also celebrating its 80th anniversary , at least under a corporate parent -- but has yet to hear back
nevertheless , it 's a game that 's compiled a lot of big numbers ( and quite a bit of cash ) on its own
consider these impressive facts courtesy of @entity4 : - more than 275 million sets have been sold worldwide
- @entity8 is available in 111 countries in 43 languages
( many of those sets substitute local landmarks for the familiar @entity47 street names
) - @entity50 jeweler @entity48 is responsible for the most expensive @entity8 set , a $ 2 million game with a golden board and diamond - studded dice
- the longest game on record lasted for 70 days
that was on terra firma ; @entity8 has also been played underwater and in a treehouse
- there are 32 houses and 12 hotels in a standard @entity8 set
- a @entity8 board has 40 spaces , including 28 properties
yes , that includes the railroads
- the lowest rent in @entity8 ? @entity8 with no houses ( assuming its owner does n't also own @entity73 )
it 'll cost you $ 2 to land on it
the most expensive ? boardwalk with a hotel , worth a cool $ 2,000
- in 2008 , more than 3,000 people played the game at the same time , a record
and not one of them overturned the board in disgust .
