@entity0 , the @entity1 gun designer whose @entity3 rifle became the weapon of choice for many national armies and guerrillas around the world , died monday , the @entity8 announced on its website
@entity0 designed his first machine gun in 1942 after suffering injuries as a tank commander for the @entity14 's @entity13 during @entity15 , but it was n't until 1947 -- after years of tweaks -- that the @entity3 was introduced for @entity14 military service
the weapon , recognizable by its banana - shaped ammunition magazine , became known for its simple effectiveness
it was easy to use and maintain , and it was reliable in extreme conditions , be they hot , cold , wet or sandy
from the early 1950s , it became the standard weapon for @entity14 and @entity30 countries , according to @entity31 's
the gun also proved popular with paramilitary groups : it was so successful in @entity36 's successful rebel movement of the 1960s and 1970s that its image appears in the national flag
@entity1 stopped producing @entity3 models in the late 1960s , but production of variants continued there and in other countries
the @entity45 book recognized the @entity3 -- @entity3 being a @entity1 acronym for " @entity0 's machine gun " and 47 standing for its debut year -- as the world 's most common machine gun
@entity1 president @entity57 on monday " expressed his deepest condolences to the family of @entity0 in connection with his death , " a post on the @entity8 's website read
in 2009 , @entity0 told @entity58 that two main qualities described the @entity3 : simplicity and reliability
" it is very important because a soldier does n't have university degrees , " he said
" he needs a simple and reliable weapon
just as an academic , for that matter , in a combat situation
there 's simply no time to figure how to operate a complicated weapon and press many buttons when the enemy is advancing on you
" he said the question he hated most was whether he felt sorry about the hundreds of thousands of people that were killed as a result of his invention
he had a standard answer : " i 've designed my weapon to defend the borders of our fatherland , and let it continue to serve this purpose
" in 2011 , @entity87 , the @entity1 manufacturer of the @entity3 family of weapons , said it was abandoning the design in favor of a new one for its next - generation assault rifles
@entity0 's 90th birthday , in november 2009 , was celebrated in @entity1 nearly like a national holiday
in a televised @entity8 ceremony , then - president @entity95 decorated him with the country 's highest order , the @entity99 .
