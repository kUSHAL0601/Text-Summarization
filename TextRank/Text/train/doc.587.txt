-- a trial for nine terror suspects accused of having ties to @entity4 opened in a @entity6 court monday , with the main defendant suspected of nearly launching a terror attack just hours before a 2008 @entity10 summit in @entity11
that defendant , @entity13 , and her husband , @entity14 , are charged with heading a terrorist cell linked to @entity4 and running a web site that glorified suicide bombings and urged young @entity18 to sacrifice themselves in jihad , or holy war
the couple has long enjoyed a notorious reputation among @entity24 counterterrorism services
@entity26 's previous husband , @entity25 , had assassinated @entity27 , the head of the @entity29 , in a suicide bombing ordered by @entity31 two days before the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity33
when @entity0 interviewed the couple in 2006 , @entity34 showed how she administered a pro-al @entity4 web forum called @entity38 , which included pro-al @entity4 postings and propaganda videos
@entity6 investigators say the web site played an important role in the radicalization of members of the @entity47 - @entity6 group
the @entity6 - @entity49 woman was considered an " @entity4 living legend " upon her arrest on december 11 , 2008 , as leaders of the @entity10 's 27 member states arrived in @entity11 for the summit
fourteen people were arrested early that morning in one of the largest counterterrorism operations in @entity6 history
six eventually were charged with participation in a terrorist group
at the time , officials told @entity0 that the alleged cell had connections to a senior @entity4 operative who helped orchestrate the 2006 " @entity66 , " widely recognized as @entity4 's most serious terror attempt since 9/11
a senior counterterrorism source with detailed knowledge of the investigation said the alleged cell was connected to the top ranks of @entity4 through @entity14 , a @entity73 @entity72 militant who left @entity6 for the tribal areas of @entity75 in late 2007
according to @entity6 counterterrorism officials , @entity14 , a @entity73 citizen , relied heavily on the @entity77 to recruit members to the group
the other defendants are @entity6 citizens : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87
@entity14 , who has yet to be captured , and @entity88 , who has fled on bail , will be tried in absentia
defense lawyer @entity91 said the trial is scheduled to take place four days a week , from monday to march 26
a ruling is expected toward the end of april
the use of the internet by the suspected @entity4 cell was instrumental in getting approval recently for a law that will give state security agents power to monitor internet usage
the law will take effect at the end of the year
while the country 's intelligence services previously had some of the weakest @entity77 laws at its disposal , it now has some of the strongest regulations in the world
" one of the people involved in the case in @entity6 -- i 'd rather not name her -- is coming forward as someone who is seeking to defend jihad ideology by what 's on the @entity77 , " @entity117 , the head of @entity6 intelligence , told @entity0 in a recent interview
" i think that a lot of individuals in these cases -- and @entity128 , too -- have been wrapped up by radicalization on internet site
" @entity128 , a native of @entity131 , pleaded pleaded guilty in january 2009 to charges of aiding @entity4 and helping attack a @entity33 military base in @entity135
authorities accused @entity128 of firing rockets at the base along with others in september 2008 , and of providing @entity4 with information about the @entity131 transit system and the @entity142
@entity128 , 27 , was arrested in @entity75 late in 2008 and is awaiting sentencing
he told investigators that about the time he became an @entity4 member , he came across several @entity6 and @entity47 militants
he said he met in @entity147 in northwest @entity75 with at least three members of this group , including @entity14 and @entity88 , a @entity6 - @entity49 who once worked as a taxi driver in @entity11
in june 2008 , @entity14 wrote an e-mail to his wife , intercepted by @entity33 counterterrorism agencies , in which he claimed to have killed several americans in @entity135 , according to @entity6 legal documents
however , @entity14 's list of enemies does not seem to have been limited to @entity33 troops in @entity135
on may 11 , 2009 , he issued this threat to @entity6 authorities on his wife 's web site : " if you thought that you could pressure me to slow down through the arrest of my wife , you were wrong
it wo n't stop me fulfilling my objectives
... the place of my wife in my heart and the heart of all the mujahedeen is greater than ever
... surprises are sure to be in store for you in the days ahead
those who laugh last , laugh more
