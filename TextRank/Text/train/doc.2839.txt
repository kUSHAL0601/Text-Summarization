-- actor @entity1 says he has beaten throat cancer
" i think the odds are with the tumor gone and what i know about this particular type of cancer that i 've got it beat , " he told host @entity3 of " today " in an interview to air on @entity6 tuesday
" i have to check out on a monthly basis now to maintain
i guess there 's not a total euphoria
i 'll probably take a couple of months of getting checked out
but it 's been a wild six - month ride , " @entity1 said in his first television interview since undergoing cancer treatment
the experience left him with an appreciation of finite time , he said
" it 's put a timeline on my life , " he said
" i 'm 66 now
you know , i 'm fortunate i 've got a mother who 's 88 -- she 'll kill me -- she may be 87
so , you know , i feel good about those genes
but it 's definitely a third act
and so you 're a little more conscious of your time in how you choose to spend it
" the radiation treatment has shut down his salivary ducts for at least a year or two , and a dry mouth affects his sleep , he said
he lost 32 pounds during the ordeal , but he has regained 12 by " eating like a pig , " he said with a laugh
" i got another 20 , 25 to go , " he said about returning to his normal weight
he exercises at a gym , but he avoids cardio workouts because he wants to put on muscle mass , he said
the tabloids and paparazzi have published photographs of an emaciated @entity1 as he was undergoing treatment , and while @entity1 said he did n't follow the coverage , friends apparently did and called him to see how he was doing , he said
" they kept saying , ' you sure you 're ok ? ' " @entity1 said
" finally , my father , @entity54 , he came back to @entity55
... he came back for 10 days and came up to the apartment every day to see me because i think that some of these photographs and , you know , who knows if they 're touched up , " @entity1 said
" i was gaunt , " he continued
" so i think he was even concerned
and , yeah , it was not a lot of fun
they 're ( photographers ) there every day
" the tabloids ' chronicling of his appearance during cancer treatment was " macabre , " he said
" i guess curiosity 's gotten them a lot of coverage -- sort of following it
and there 's so many outlets now these days
i mean , i just feel for all these young kids
i mean , the generations now , with the amount of paparazzi that they have and these video cameras -- you know , you just ca n't do anything , " @entity1 said
" and i resent the amount of imposition on our children , too , because it used to be at least they would try to keep them out of that , and they do n't at all ( now )
they were having -- there was sort of a macabre enjoyment out of sort of watching me go down there for a while , i felt , by the paparazzi , " he said
as cancer put his life in jeopardy , he developed a new regard for family and friends , he said
" all of a sudden the affection from my family , from my friends , and from my fans hit me at a much deeper level than i would have ever imagined before , " @entity1 said
" and it gave me a really new appreciation of just how valuable , how precious good friends are and family
and it 's not that i disregard them before but there 's a much deeper feeling
" i 've talked to other cancer survivors about this ... that you just really , really appreciate what 's important in life , " he said
@entity1 even took his three young children to a couple of his radiation treatments
" they came into the room and they saw all the @entity132 treatment going around
and they saw them put the mask on your face because they have to kind of bolt you down like @entity140 or something , " he said
" so they can specifically target the correct area , " @entity3 interjected
" so they can -- exactly , get the area , " @entity1 continued
" at that age it was good for them
i mean , they thought it was cool , you know , all this space age stuff
so it made up for all those days when dad was lying on the couch and could n't get up
and their patience was really appreciated
and we 've had a big celebration these last couple of days when i found out the tumor 's gone
" a portion of the interview will air tuesday on " today , " and the entire interview will air sunday on " @entity6 " at 7 p.m. et.
