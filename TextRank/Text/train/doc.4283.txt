-- it 's time to stop being surprised by @entity2
since he became pontiff , he 's made a lot of news
his tweets echo around the world
he embodies principles of humility and piety
he eschews the fancy trappings of office favored by his predecessor , from the @entity14 to the red shoes
he washed the feet of prisoners , including a @entity19 woman , on holy thursday
he telephones ordinary people who write to him
in @entity21 , he called for " revolutionaries " to leave the comforts of their home and bring the word into the streets
in @entity28 , he told the gathered youth to " make a mess " in the dioceses as they help the church shake off clericalism
he has sought to create a " culture of encounter " in which atheists and @entity38 might come together
" do good , " he said memorably
" we will meet each other there
" when he announced that he would canonize pope @entity42 , the great reformer , on the same day as @entity44 , he emphasized continuity among all @entity38 , even those of different factions
when asked about gay priests , he replied , " who am i to judge ? " most recently , he gave a long interview in which he articulated a new vision of the church that does seem revolutionary
in the @entity54 , reaction has focused on his statements about hot - button social issues
for example , he said , " the teaching of the church ( on abortion , gay marriage , and contraception ) , for that matter , is clear ... ( but ) it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time
" given the constant drumbeat of the @entity69 church hierarchy on exactly those issues , the line comes off as a surprising rebuke
deeper critiques lie within the interview as well
when he spoke about doubt and dialogue , he said , " if the @entity77 is a restorationist , a legalist , if he wants everything clear and safe , then he will find nothing
" at the very least , @entity2 has found a message that resonates with @entity38 and non-catholics alike
but as repeatedly stated by commentators and church officials , he has not changed anything
he has called for no new doctrines
his reorganization of the @entity89 goes slowly
the problems besetting the church before his election remain
traditionalists , who wish to preserve gains won under the past two popes , and reformers , who are frustrated by the pace of change , agree on this one thing
to this point , @entity2 ' impact emerges from his behavior and his words , not his executive power as pope
and yet , he has this power to surprise
every time he demonstrates his humility or his empathy , his words resonate with @entity38 and non-catholics alike
they bring both pleasure and surprise that such a seemingly honest , humble and holy person really could be pope
do n't be surprised at what @entity2 is doing ; instead , wonder if the rest of the church hierarchy is going to catch up
@entity2 ' revolution emerges out of the core of @entity120
he emphasizes humility , poverty , social justice , non-judgment , peace and especially mercy
that he can seem so transformative without changing any theological principles is a testament to the depth and power of his reform , not its limitations
such a reform has historical precedent
more than 800 years ago , another @entity2 , the son of a cloth merchant in @entity136 , came to @entity21 to see the pope
the church of the 13th century relied heavily on formula
this reliance distanced the priests from their parishioners and was a growing problem in an era of societal change
@entity2 and his disciples , who attempted to live in perfect poverty and humility , had dedicated themselves to preaching and outreach to the people
they tried to pattern their lives by the principles of @entity155
the pope , @entity156 , gave @entity2 his approval and supported the new @entity159 order
he hoped that the charismatic humility of @entity2 might help address some of the problems the church was facing
eight hundred years later , archbishop @entity2 became the first pope to take @entity2 ' name as his own
@entity166 ' revolutionary message focused on a return to first principles , as he saw them
while @entity2 has ascended to the throne of @entity170 and @entity166 never chose to be ordained , one can locate certain parallels unfolding between the two men and their efforts at reform
this pope is also turning to the first principles as he perceives them
pope @entity2 makes the argument that everything he needs to transform the church already exists within the core teachings
and if this is the core , how can anyone choose not to follow ? what would it look like for the rest of the hierarchy to go where @entity2 is leading ? for one thing , they might find lots of their lay parishioners and the women and men in holy order already there , working
but while the hierarchy clearly elected @entity2 to reform the workings of the @entity89 , it 's not clear that they expected his personal piety to put such pressure on them
traditionalist response to @entity2 has concentrated on his personal charisma while emphasizing the orthodoxy of his doctrinal positions
such responses seem to indicate a resistance to the idea that they might need to change anything
in a recent interview with the new catholic reporter , cardinal @entity212 of @entity213 talked about the new pope
he said that in the wake of @entity2 , he found himself " examining my own conscience ... on style , on simplicity , on lots of things
" the cardinal wondered whether his living arrangements , in the historical residence of the archbishops of @entity213 , were appropriate
but the cardinal was n't quite sure what to do about it , given that he ca n't sell the building
he carefully never argued for the church to sell of its property or divest itself of income
of course , he was outside the church hierarchy and relied on papal protection for his safety
@entity2 , on the other hand , might have a plan for an empty archbishop 's residence if @entity212 wanted to downsize
after all , he did recently suggest that empty church property should be used to house refugees
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .
