-- got a few grand to spare for a $ 3,000 phone ? yeah , we did n't think so
nobody does -- and that 's a problem for the makers of luxury phones , such as @entity8 , @entity9 & @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12
@entity12 makes phones starting at $ 6,000 and going up in price
after years of chasing the ultra-wealthy with exclusive devices that carry designer logos and promise craftsmanship from materials such as sapphire and stainless steel , luxury phone makers are now pulling back
" the culture has shifted away from conspicuous consumption , so if you are going to have a super expensive product this may not be the time for it , " says @entity23 , research director for consumer devices at @entity25
@entity8 has already gotten the memo
earlier this week , the company reportedly canceled the @entity35 , a device tentatively priced around $ 3,000
the phone had met with lack of interest from telecom carriers
if that sounds like an obvious outcome , perhaps it should n't
in the last few years , luxury phones had turned into an attractive new business , as designer houses rushed to get a foothold in the tech sector
@entity48 collaborated with @entity11 to launch two @entity50 phones in @entity51 and @entity52
last september , @entity53 launched the @entity55 phone , which carried the @entity57 insignia
a month later , @entity8 offered a $ 2,000 phone , called the @entity59 , which was fashioned out of stainless steel and sported a 62 - carat sapphire crystal lens
and then there 's @entity12 , a company that makes true luxury phones , the cheapest of which costs about $ 6,000
the recession put a spoke in those plans
and it 's not just the @entity70 of middle - class @entity71 that have been in peril
in @entity75 , many newly - minted billionaires saw their fortunes slip away with falling oil prices
by the first quarter this year , the @entity71 economy had shrunk 5.5 percent
even @entity79 has complained about losing more than a few @entity80 on the stock market
and just like that , the crystal dominoes started to fall
last october , @entity9 , whose phones retailed in @entity51 for more than $ 1,500 , shuttered its cellphone business as it decided to trim its costs and get out of non-profitable ventures
@entity8 is the latest to pull back its luxury line
luxury phones have never been a big phenomenon in @entity92 , says @entity23
their manufacturers have had better luck in emerging markets
but now even in those countries , where once 8 percent gdp growth seemed conservative , wealthy consumers are feeling the pinch
" @entity103 expensive , bling bling phones are big in markets where conspicuous consumption is a way to tell your countrymen you have arrived , " says @entity23
" but now , it 's a very different economy for everyone
" many of the troubles that the uber - expensive phones face are because they are created by companies whose main expertise is in targeting a mass market , says @entity116 , former chief of design for @entity118 and current head of @entity12
" i did n't start this business to soak the phones in diamonds and jewels , " says @entity116
" the concept is same as a fine watch or a fabulous car
to be a true luxury product , you have to look at making something that does n't have an 18 - month shelf life
" true luxury , as @entity132 defines it , does n't apply to a mere $ 2,000 phone : a @entity12 device , soaked in platinum , can run up to $ 70,000
the company 's one - off phones , designed in collaboration with luxury jewels house @entity140 , cost even more
@entity116 may have inadvertently hit on the real problem with luxury phones : phones are still a very feature - driven products
they are products where the rapid advances in technology can rend older models obsolete very quickly
" phones are n't like a handbag where the fundamental utility remains the same and the design changes all the time , " says @entity23
but @entity116 is n't convinced
" take watches and cars , " he says
" they all run the same but everyone has a unique way of delivering them stylistically
we can do the same with phones
" despite the bumps on the road now , @entity116 says the luxury phones will bounce back and find an audience
" it is no different than a fine watch or a car , " he says
" if you take people who value something that is made extraordinarily well there will always be a group interested in it
" @entity12 is determined to prove that
it will launch its latest handset the @entity177 in august
the phone is made of high - gloss carbon fiber and has a sandblasted titanium surface
the price tag ? $ 9,800
