-- one of the worst wildfires in @entity4 history grew by 40,000 acres monday , forcing the evacuation of thousands as crews battled heavy winds in trying to prevent the 30 - mile line from advancing further , officials said
the " @entity9 , " as the blaze is known , has scorched 233,522 acres as of monday evening -- up more than 21 % from the 192,746 acres reported that morning -- said @entity11 , a spokeswoman for the @entity12 that is overseeing firefighting efforts
" we had a hard day today , " @entity14 , an incident commander , told those attending a town hall meeting in @entity17 , @entity4 , on monday evening
" i do n't know exactly where that fire is at this moment , because it is moving so fast
" the eastern @entity4 wildfire , which began may 29 , has forced the closure of the @entity22 and prompted the evacuation of about 3,000 people , said @entity25 of the @entity4 @entity26
some 2,000 of those are in @entity28 , about 700 are in @entity17 , 200 to 300 are in @entity29 , and fewer than 100 are in @entity30
the @entity31 instituted a " red flag warning , " which means weather conditions are ripe for wildfires , for much of the northern half of the state
in eastern @entity4 , southwest winds blew 25 to 28 mph through the region monday with nighttime gusts forecast to blow as strong as 40 mph
wind speeds are expected to slow somewhat but still be strong in the coming days , the weather service said , with daytime temperatures in the most affected regions forecast in the mid- 60s
" tomorrow , ( the wind ) is supposed to pick back up all through thursday , " said @entity14
" we 've got two or three days ahead ... that will try all of us
" the @entity47 said the fire is the fourth largest in @entity4 's history , but @entity50 of the incident management team said it is the third largest
while there have been no significant injuries so far , officials and area residents complained of heavy smoke that has blanketed the area like fog
" to me , it feels like i 'm suffocating , " @entity59 told @entity0 affiliate @entity60
" @entity62 just sits in this valley and it sucks the air right out of you
" @entity66 , who manages @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity4 , said the fire and resulting smoke had forced a run on her store from customers looking to buy face masks
among the evacuees was @entity77 , who along with his wife , @entity78 , abandoned the house he built in @entity29 with his own hands to escape the approaching fire , according to @entity83 - based @entity0 affiliate @entity82
" what a person do n't realize is is how hard it is to face something like that , " @entity77 told @entity82
" you think you 're prepared for it , you think you 're mentally prepared for it , physically prepared for it
" it 's hard , " @entity77 said , fighting back tears
the @entity96 took as many of their possessions as they could even though there was n't enough time to pack
those belongings are now stored in a trailer out of harm 's way
@entity77 said he has a brother who stayed behind
" he wants to fight for what 's his and i do n't blame him , " @entity77 said
the fire has bedeviled fire crews with its unpredictable path , thanks to wind gusts that have carried burning embers up to three miles
@entity113 deputy chief sheriff @entity112 on monday evening urged people in the area , even if they have n't been ordered to evacuate yet , to get ready to leave
" they ca n't predict how fast it 's going to go , " @entity112 said at the town hall event in @entity17
" so make sure , please , you get ready
" if i can convince anybody , please go
it 'll make your life so much easier , " he added
" this thing is huge
