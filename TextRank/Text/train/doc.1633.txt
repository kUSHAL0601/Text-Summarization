-- at the end of first grade , 7 - year - old @entity3 , an easy - going , cheerful little boy from a tiny rural town in western @entity6 , suddenly did n't want to go to school anymore
when @entity3 adamantly refused to have a play date with a good friend , his mom , @entity8 , 36 , knew something was wrong with her middle child
his change in behavior just did n't make sense
" @entity3 finally broke down in tears and told me that several boys at school had been teasing him relentlessly , making fun of his hair , his clothes , calling him names , and not letting him play at recess
and one of those boys was his good friend , " @entity8 says
while the friend was n't actively participating in the teasing , @entity3 told his mom that he was doing nothing to stop it , which made it all even worse
at first @entity8 stayed silent , hoping the mean behavior would disappear over the summer
but when it picked up again at the start of second grade , @entity8 went to the principal with her concerns
@entity8 says that the principal dismissed the charge and convinced her that the behavior was n't bullying , but instead , it was simply boys being mean
unsatisfied , @entity8 visited the principal two more times -- now armed with both the definition of " bullying " that she printed from the website @entity47 , as well as the @entity49 statute on how it defined the term
both times , @entity8 says , the principal ( who declined to comment for this story ) disagreed that @entity3 was being bullied and refused to act -- the superintendent in @entity56 was no help either
six months later the @entity58 moved to another town
with horror stories about girls who have been bullied dominating the news , some parents are asking whether we also need to focus as much attention on how boys respond to harsh or abusive interactions with their peers
was the principal correct in assuming that the actions of 7 - year - old boys were simply mean boy behavior , or did it constitute bullying ? and does it make a difference ? " even if the behavior did n't technically match up to the definition of bullying , if the kids were being mean and there was a pattern of the kids ganging up on him -- which , by the way , does constitute bullying -- that still should n't be condoned and supported by not addressing it , " says @entity76 , author of " masterminds and @entity78 : helping @entity90 with @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , and the @entity94
" " the principal is literally telling those boys they have the carte blanche to not only continue the behavior , but increase the abuse because they can get away with it
" are we too quick to cry ' bully ' ? with " masterminds and @entity115 , " @entity104 set out to replicate with boys the success she had examining the social dynamics of girls in her book " @entity114 , " the inspiration for the movie " @entity113
" in her latest book , @entity104 reveals the ways boys think , uncovers their complicated emotional lives and explores how the power of their social hierarchies influences their emerging identity
historically , bullying among boys has been complicated and sometimes tough to identify
the belief in a " boys - will - be - boys " mentality still persists , whether it 's on a playground or in a college fraternity
and it is n't always about targeting the weakest kid
cruel taunts and physical tests can be also be a form of bonding among boys
the term bullying has become so radioactive in recent years with its strong links to adolescent suicide and school shootings , it has prompted state legislatures to take serious action , making bullying a crime in many states
officially accusing kids of bullying can carry serious , long - term consequences
according to stopbullying.gov the definition of bullying is : unwanted , aggressive behavior among school - aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance
the behavior is repeated , or has the potential to be repeated , over time
the types of bullying include : teasing , name - calling , taunting , inappropriate sexual comments , threatening to cause harm , leaving someone out on purpose , spreading rumors , trying to hurt someone 's reputation , hitting , kicking , tripping , pinching , spitting , taking or breaking someone 's things or making mean or rude hand gestures
should parents be liable for their children 's bullying ? about 16 % of students report being bullied , while 7 % report bullying others , according to " bullying in @entity179 schools , " a report published in 2013 by the @entity181 with research from the @entity183
boys report they were most frequently bullied by other boys , while girls were bullied by both girls and boys
in almost all grades , girls and boys were victimized at similar rates
" boys consistently bully other students more than girls do , and they do so at higher rates as they get older , " the survey found
in her research , @entity104 has found that while boys might get more physical than girls , the psychological hallmarks of bullying are similar
the playing field has been further leveled with the spread of cyberbullying
cyberbullying is when a child or teenager is harassed , humiliated , tormented , embarrassed or threatened using digital technology
mean texts or e-mails , pictures , videos and fake profiles can all be forms of abuse
and the pervasive reach of technology can make the bullying potentially more devastating
parents , beware of bullying on sites you 've never seen " when you think of a child being bullied , maybe you think of a loner kid , the nerd , the geek , that 's the picture that comes to my mind , " says @entity223 of @entity224 , @entity225 , and mom of 13 - year - old @entity227
" but my son plays @entity238 football and he 's a competitive hockey player and he was being bullied for years
" @entity223 says life got significantly worse for her son in sixth grade when the kids started ganging up on @entity227 on the popular app @entity243
she says about half of the class , girls included , began making fun of @entity227 's clothes , his lunch , his hockey skills and the video games he liked
it got so bad that @entity227 announced to his mom one night that he wanted to kill himself and headed into the kitchen for a knife
the next morning @entity223 went to school with @entity227 and headed straight for the principal
when @entity223 shared with the principal that her son had threatened suicide , the school immediately jumped into action
the principal and teacher met with the students in @entity227 's class and they also sent a letter home to the parents discussing bullying and its effect on a classmate
things at school did get better , but @entity227 switched to a middle school this year with none of his former classmates
" he now has a great group of friends and he helps other kids deal with bullying
he 's the first one who stands up to bullying and he stands a little taller now , " says @entity223
" but do n't assume that if you bring the problem to the school they will handle it , parents need to stay involved
" while many schools and parents are hyper - aware of the dangers and prevalence of bullying , have we gone too far in labeling what some may argue has always been normal aggressive behavior between kids ? " every conflict is not bullying and if we call it that , then it loses the power of the word , " says @entity104
not all conflict amounts to bullying and by overusing the word , we risk reducing the power of the word to describe real bullying , says @entity104
she believes that , to a certain extent , allowing boys and girls to work out their own problems is useful training for resolving conflicts at every stage of life
the challenge is to stay on top of what 's really happening in your child 's life , particularly when kids routinely answer with an " i 'm fine " -- even if they 're not
" there 's nothing wrong with kids trying to figure things out on their own , " she says
" at the same time , there are kids who are being systemically denigrated and targeted in school and blown off by administrators and teachers
