-- in focus : from importer to exporter unlike its @entity6 neighbors , @entity4 does n't sit on a wealth of oil reserves
it actually imports about 90 % of its energy needs
but as @entity13 found out , all that could change as the @entity14 explores oil shale and looks to go from an energy importer to an energy exporter
@entity18 : @entity19 according to @entity19 , @entity22 fellow , by 2020 we will witness a world where there is too much oil on the market and there will be a steep drop in oil prices
in @entity19 's latest report , the former @entity30 explains how high oil prices are fuelling the growth of unconventional oils such as oil shale and could prompt a plunge or even a collapse in oil prices
with oil prices continuing to hit $ 100 per barrel , @entity13 caught up with @entity19 and asked him about his latest findings
