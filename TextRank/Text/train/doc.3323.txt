-- @entity1 secured their sensational return to the elite of @entity5 football after winning the league title with a regulation 2 - 0 victory over @entity9
goals from @entity11 and a @entity13 own goal handed @entity1 the advantage in the race for the @entity16
but even though the @entity1 of @entity19 has gone unbeaten this season , their fate ultimately rested with events at the @entity23 stadium where the @entity25 derby was kicking off simultaneously
holders @entity25 started the day one point behind @entity1 but knew they had to beat @entity27 to take the title chase to the final weekend
what followed was one of the most memorable @entity25 derbies in recent years , as @entity27 ran out 4 - 2 winners with @entity33 scoring a hat trick , the first person do so in this fixture in almost six decades
the victory handed @entity1 title number 28
or so you would think
as fans invaded the pitch in @entity43 , where @entity9 are currently playing their matches , some held banners aloft proclaiming the triumph to be @entity16 number 30
that 's because in 2006 the club was stripped of the two titles they won under former @entity53 coach @entity52 following a match fixing scandal that engulfed the club and saw them relegated to @entity57 it was a humiliating experience for one of world football 's greatest clubs , but this season has seen something close to redemption , as the club has gone 37 games unbeaten under the reign of former @entity5 international @entity67
it is his first season in charge
the team celebrated wildly with the fans in @entity43 , while the @entity25 wondered what might have been in the @entity23
a highly dubious first half penalty converted by @entity77 international @entity76 had canceled out @entity33 's opener
@entity76 , a former @entity1 player who has never been forgiven by the fans for leaving the club so soon after their relegation to @entity57 , then gave @entity25 hope scoring his second 30 seconds after the start of the second half
but @entity27 powered forward , winning their own penalty converted by @entity33 to secure his hat trick , before @entity85 scored a stunning fourth and sealed @entity1 ' return to where many believe they have always belonged .
