@entity0 -- a backlog in processing education benefits has forced the @entity4 to authorize millions of dollars in emergency funds for veterans who need the cash to pay for school
the @entity4 department will give up to $ 3,000 to students who have n't received funds from education bills the department announced friday that it will issue up to $ 3,000 to students who have yet to receive the funds that the @entity4 's various education bills -- including the recently passed @entity15 -- provide to help veterans pay for college
" this is an extraordinary action we 're taking , " va secretary @entity18 said in a statement
" but it 's necessary because we recognize the hardships some of our veterans face
" the @entity4 estimates there are 75,000 veterans eligible for the emergency funds , including 25,000 veterans who have served since september 11
@entity4 statistics show more than 27,500 vets have already received benefits for housing or books under the new @entity15 , and hundreds of thousands more have gotten benefits under its other programs
the delay in processing the benefits has created much consternation among veterans , with some worried they would have to drop out of school because of a lack of funds
the lag was caused because some schools have not yet filed for the tuition and because of a backlog at the @entity4 offices , according to a department official
any money given to eligible veterans will be deducted from the education benefits they are scheduled to receive and can be used for housing and books
the @entity4 has been speaking to schools to ensure that veterans do not get kicked out if their tuition has not yet been paid , said @entity4 spokeswoman @entity58
" veterans were having a lot of financial issues , and we needed to address them , " she said
to help with the influx of applications , the department has hired more than 700 extra processors
veterans groups said the emergency funds were much needed
" @entity71 is very happy with the swift action taken by the secretary
we suggested a similar solution earlier this month so we are happy to see they 're listening , " said @entity74 , a spokesman for @entity71 , a veterans ' service organization .
