-- the small , seaside town of @entity2 , @entity3 , is thousands of miles away from @entity4 , but headlines are heralding its new mayor as the city 's @entity7
@entity9 beat out an incumbent sunday to become the first black mayor in @entity3 's history , securing 51.4 percent of the vote in a run - off election
the 54 - year - old doctor from @entity16 said race rarely came up during the campaign -- though opponents did try to use his accent when speaking @entity3 against him
" they were n't really very harmful comments
it was more comments like , ' we would prefer to have a real @entity3 be mayor , ' " he told @entity0 tuesday morning
there are only about 200 @entity29 immigrants in @entity3 , he said
but @entity9 is hardly new to the @entity31 nation , which declared independence from @entity33 in 1991
he first arrived in the country 's capital of @entity36 as a medical student in the late 1970s , and he has lived in @entity2 with his wife for more than 20 years
@entity9 , a general practitioner , posted pictures on his @entity41 page of campaign promises written on prescription paper -- including history , diagnoses and recommendations for treatment of the city 's problems
his plans for the city of 17,000 include encouraging people to drive electric cars down its narrow streets , building a golf course to draw more tourists and promoting local products
" we have so many thing going for us here
it 's a shame that we do n't promote them more , " he said
his campaign strategy paid off at the polls , and captured media attention across the country
several weeks before the election , the headline of a column in the @entity70 newspaper -- sold nationwide -- read , " @entity9 for president * ( well , first as mayor )
" " when the @entity75 made a historic move and elected @entity7 for president , this was a tectonic shift
a new chapter of national history ... the real question is whether we are able to do what the @entity75 did , " columnist @entity80 wrote
the @entity7 analogy started at the beginning of his campaign -- and stuck , @entity9 said
" i said that i 'm flattered by the comparison , but i 'm in no way @entity7
i 'm @entity9 , and i 'm just running for mayor of a small town , " he said
and @entity9 says he has no plans to seek higher office once his four - year term as mayor ends
" i want to be a good mayor
i want to help people , " he said
" i 'm not really thinking about what i 'm going to do in the future
