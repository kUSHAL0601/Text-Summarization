@entity0 -- you do n't find many churches making theatrical films
you especially do n't find many churches making films starring @entity7 about a firefighter in a crumbling marriage addicted to online porn
@entity7 stars in " @entity12 , " a film he was attracted to for its many themes , he said
but that 's the case for @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18
in fact , the film , " @entity13 , " was the church 's third movie
it was also an unexpected hit
in september it debuted at no. 4 at the box office , eventually bringing in $ 33.5 million and spawning two books : a novelization , also called " @entity12 , " which is in the @entity27 ' best - seller list 's @entity28 ; and a companion journal to the movie , " the @entity30 , " which has sold more than 2 million copies
last week " @entity12 " debuted on @entity32 and climbed to no. 3 on @entity34 's dvd chart , beating out " @entity36 " and " @entity37 , " among others
" you do n't often see movies made by churches do big numbers , " said @entity34 's @entity38
" having [ distributor ] @entity43 behind it helps
having @entity7 helps , but for it to come out and do 136,000 pieces [ dvds ] in its first week is pretty impressive
" " it should not be working , " said @entity48 , one of the pastors behind the film
" all i can say is we prayed for months and asked for it to honor @entity54
" @entity48 said that @entity56 's pastors gathered for prayer two years ago and asked @entity54 to give them an idea for their next movie
they were just coming off making " facing the @entity61 , " a movie shot entirely in @entity17 on a $ 100,000 budget
it starred no professional actors -- just members of their church -- but made $ 10.2 million at the box office and sold 250,000 copies on dvd , launching the church into the national spotlight
the church leaders lit upon the idea of troubled relationships
" families and marriages are crumbing and we want to do something about it , " said @entity48 , recalling the idea 's genesis
" @entity54 give us the idea
we had no clue what would happen with it
" " @entity12 " began with a $ 500,000 budget and a fresh crop of church member / actors , but the film got a left - field boost when @entity7 , best known as the 1980s heartthrob from the tv series " @entity92 , " read the script and asked to get involved
" all throughout the movie ... there are issues of communications , money , sex , addiction , porn , extramarital affairs , feeling respected at work but not at home , feeling respected by friends but not at home , " @entity7 told @entity1
the themes resonated with the actor and devout @entity109 , a husband of 17 years , and father of six , he said
that and the " cool action scenes , " he added
the makers of " @entity12 " tapped into the church market , arranging screenings for the @entity118 ' convention before release and using word - of - mouth among church leaders
however , says @entity7 , the film was pitched to general audiences , not necessarily @entity109
" ' @entity12 ' was never marketed as a @entity109 movie
this is a movie about marriage , " @entity7 said
" the fact is , though , the gospel is presented , is done well , and it 's a central part of the storyline
" although many critics panned " @entity12 " -- " as sincere , uncynical and subtlety - free as a sunday school lecture , " said @entity132 -- audiences embraced it
" there 's a huge market out there that 's underserved
that market is there and a lot of people do n't want to go there but there is a huge untapped market , " @entity7 said
@entity145 , a box office analyst for @entity147 , said he was shocked when the movie debuted in the top five its opening weekend
" with ' @entity12 , ' they really cracked the code with the major success with the film and have this appeal across the board , " he said
" they did n't follow traditional marketing methods but they did n't need them for this film
... maybe that 's why it worked out so well
" he added , " you 're talking about a very successful property
... the powers that be that put this together are really on to something
" churches are using " @entity30 " and its companion curriculum as a teaching tool , says publisher @entity172 's @entity171 , who calls " @entity12 " " a marriage movement
" for @entity176 more than 9,000 churches are scheduled to show the film , many displaying the admonition " @entity12 " on their signs
@entity172 believes " @entity30 " could hang around on the best - seller list -- where it 's already been for 19 weeks -- along the lines of @entity185 's " @entity184
" and the filmmakers have kept their success close to home
@entity48 said the church used the profits from the movie to buy 82 acres of land and build a recreation center for the town , equipped with eight tennis courts , eight basketball courts and an equestrian area
a baseball diamond is on the way
he 's confident " @entity12 " will remain a successful brand
" when something grows the only reason it happens is people say it worked and you should try it , " @entity48 said
" when it works and there 's a legitimate impact , people want to be a part of it
