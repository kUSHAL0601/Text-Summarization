-- @entity1 is perpetually one of the world 's most popular cities
and the 16 million tourists who travel to the home of @entity7 and the @entity8 leave a whopping $ 17.8 billion behind during their trips , according to @entity11 's 2012 @entity10
while @entity1 is n't generally a place you go to save money , it can be done
even in this pricey place , the clever traveler can track down activities , services and just plain pleasures that do n't cost a single centime
here 's a list of 10 fabulous and free finds in the @entity1
tour the city for free
spend an hour or 90 minutes strolling city streets on free tours -- except for the voluntary tips you give -- with @entity1 natives through @entity30
held 363 days a year -- each day except december 24 and 25 -- these rain - or - shine , small - group tours show you the @entity33 , @entity34 , the hip - and - trendy @entity35 and the picturesque city village of @entity37
just show up ready to walk
you do n't even have to book in advance unless you 're bringing a group of eight or more
soak up the organ sounds at @entity41
here 's a favorite of " @entity46 " travel guru and public television series host @entity45
the @entity48 church of @entity41 -- which gained fame thanks to its prominent role as a location in " the @entity52 " -- has a pipe organ tradition dating back to the mid- 16th century
visitors can climb up a spiral staircase to the organ loft to meet multilingual virtuoso @entity57 after the 10:30 a.m. @entity59 and subsequent organ recital
guests can watch this living legend play one of @entity65 's most majestic pipe organs during the 12:05 p.m. @entity66 , indeed
drink up -- at a sparkling water fountain
leave it to @entity1 to create a public water tap -- inside a lovely park , no less -- with the bubbly stuff
for the past couple years , the @entity72 in the city 's southeast 12th arrondissement has been serving up cooled sparkling water to quench @entity1 thirsts ( available any time the park is open )
the park 's @entity78 public fountain was the first in @entity81 to add carbon dioxide to the city 's tap water , and locals lapped it up by bringing their own bottles to fill
you 'd expect no less in the country that gave the world @entity90
on a clear day you can see ... sure , you can climb to the top of the @entity92 or @entity7 , but some of the @entity1 's most stunning -- and free ! -- views can be found from the roof terrace of the @entity48 's @entity96
an über - modern , curved - façade facility designed by famed @entity81 architect @entity99 , the @entity97 was founded by 18 @entity101 nations and @entity81 to take a multidisciplinary look at the @entity104 @entity101 world
it allows visitors , whether or not they 're visiting the @entity97 's recently revamped museum , library or bookshops , to take its glass elevator up to the ninth floor terrace
from here , gaze out at @entity34 , the @entity113 or the landmark column standing in @entity115
under 26 ? catch up on contemporary @entity81 art at @entity118 / @entity117 -- the @entity121 du @entity119
who says youth is wasted on the young ? not if they 're lovers of contemporary art and artists like @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129
here , out in the ' burb of @entity131 , @entity118 / @entity117 offers visitors a range of @entity81 modern art from the 1950s through today
and if these visitors are under 26 , they get to experience it all gratis ( flash an @entity137 to borrow a free audio guide )
from established talent to emerging artists , you 'll find them at @entity118 / @entity117 , which hosts three to four temporary exhibits each year
most folks do n't get particularly psyched about toilets
but when they 're the space - age , self - cleaning , pod - like gray structures dotting the @entity1 streetscape , you just might
you 'll find 400 of these disabled - accessible bathrooms scattered all around @entity1 ( they 're open between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. ) near major tourist spots , food markets and taxi stands
each time a visitor uses these " sanisettes , " the toilet bowl and floor are automatically cleaned , dried and disinfected -- and they contain coat hooks , a mirror and sink
and with natural roof lighting , reduced water use and renewable - source electricity , they 're eco-friendly to boot
life 's a beach ( during the summer , at least )
so what if the @entity169 that snakes through @entity1 has no beach ? this city is nothing if not inventive -- so mayor @entity174 spearheaded the creation of @entity176 , man - made " beaches " that offer locals and tourists alike a " @entity180 " each summer
starting around july 20 and for four weeks after , the city closes the streets along the river , brings in tons of sand and palm trees and offers a slew of entertaining options from beach volleyball to kayaking to open - air concerts on three different " beaches
" of course , this being @entity81 , riverside cafés , restaurants and ice cream vendors are de rigueur
you 'll have to wait ' til next year to take advantage of the next installment , but what a @entity1 way to spend those dog days of summer , from 8 a.m. to midnight
just like museums in most world - class cities , many of those within @entity1 open themselves to visitors free of charge one day a week
in the @entity1 , that 's the first sunday of each month
save those euros for a few café au laits or souvenirs and check out the @entity8 , the @entity213 and the @entity214 ( hello , @entity215 ! ) , among others
some , like the @entity217 , offer free admission to their permanent and themed collections each day
for those seeking a free dose of nighttime culture -- and who visit @entity1 in mid-may -- @entity225 is just the ticket
nearly 200 city museums keep their doors open during this one night from 6 p.m. until at least midnight
see @entity1 through local eyes
there 's nothing like traipsing through a city with a local resident by your side
the @entity236 , @entity1 greeter program , pairs city visitors with regular residents -- students , working people , retirees and others
these folks are n't formal guides or interpreters , just passionate @entity246 willing to spend two or three hours walking with groups of six or fewer tourists , showing off their favorite areas and spots based on your interests and language
just go online to register
( @entity1 greeters welcome visitors with disabilities , too
) got questions about navigating the @entity257 or @entity1 quirks ? ask away
and while the service is free , the program happily accepts donations
savor free sounds on sunday
as it has since the early 1930s , the @entity263 in @entity1 has hosted the @entity264 , which offers a performance venue to musicians of diverse backgrounds and musical styles
staged at the legendary @entity48 church every sunday at 5 p.m. from september to november and january through june , music lovers will hear everything from classical pianists to opera singers to flute - and - guitar ensembles
feel like giving thanks ? drop something in the voluntary offering at the door
@entity279 is a freelance travel and food writer who lives outside @entity1 and blogs at @entity282 .
