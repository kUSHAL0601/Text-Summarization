@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the middle of a famine , there is a place that houses the sickest survivors of all
along the border between @entity11 and @entity1 at the @entity13 hospital it is simply called a stabilization center
as a medical term , it refers to the desire to normalize vital signs , replace fluids and treat acute and deadly illness
as you might imagine , however , this place is far from stable , and instead filled with people who are starving to death -- in some cases , their bodies too far gone to even absorb the food finally made available to them
i met 6 - year - old @entity31 there
as soon as he entered @entity0 refugee camp with his father after 10 days of walking under the @entity38 sun , it was clear his tiny prone body may have been robbed of nutrition for too long
@entity41 : how you can help as dr. @entity47 told me , " he is half the size he should be -- a couple more weeks , and this child would 've been lost
" @entity47 knows , because over the last few months , he has seen it happen more times than he cares to remember
there is no way to dignify the description of death by starvation
it is neither quick nor painless
not too long after the food is cut off , the body resorts to fuel reserves in the liver and fatty tissues
once the fat is all gone , and the person is a skeleton of what he or she once was , the body searches for protein , and finds it in muscle tissue
even the muscle of the heart is consumed , leaving someone drained and listless
the pulse , the blood pressure and body temperature all precipitously drop
little kids such as @entity31 completely stop growing and become stunted in time
the tools they use here in the stabilization center are rudimentary , and they have little choice -- but they work
a small tape measure is used to measure the child 's mid-upper arm circumference or @entity85
it takes just seconds and is predictive of how much deep fat still exists in the body , a key criterion when assessing starvation
in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years , a healthy @entity85 is considered to be above 13.5 centimeters , and if it is less than 11.5 centimeters , nearly one in five die
they simply can not be saved
@entity31 had his @entity85 measured in the stabilization center -- 10.5 centimeters
@entity47 shook his head worriedly and immediately started a plan to save @entity31
an iv was placed , and fluids were started slowly
too much fluid could overwhelm his system
the same could be said of many foods , which may cause severe diarrhea or vomiting
@entity31 will be given @entity105 , a paste that has a balance of protein , carbohydrates and fat , along with vitamins and minerals
the key is to give a lot of calories in small amounts because @entity31 's stomach is so shrunken from his malnutrition
@entity31 would have his blood drawn to check for anemia and possible bacterial infections
@entity47 said he is cautiously optimistic about @entity31 , but he carries a lot of anguish over what he has seen this summer
" i have a 5 - year - old boy at home , " he told me as his eyes welled up
i shook his hand , looked him in the eye and said , " give him an extra tight hug tonight
" he nodded and said , " you too
" my thoughts turned to my own three little girls , who are always in my heart
i will , doctor , i said
