last week , president @entity1 's campaign launched a fictional storybook ad called , " @entity3
" the slide show narrative follows @entity5 , a cartoon character , from age 3 to age 67 and explains how @entity1 's policies , from @entity9 to @entity10 to mandated contraception coverage to @entity13 reform , would provide @entity5 with a better life than @entity15 or @entity16 could
@entity5 is not your typical all - american girl , but an obviously independent , yuppie liberal woman
she goes to public school , graduates college , and becomes a web designer
she is able to pursue her career because , at age 27 , " her health insurance is required to cover birth control and preventive care , letting @entity5 focus on her work rather than worry about her health
" at age 31 she " decides to have a child , " with no mention of a father or husband
her son @entity36 heads off to a @entity38 funded public school , while @entity5 goes on to start her own web business
she retires at age 67 with @entity41 and @entity13 supporting her financially and spends her later years volunteering in a community garden
@entity5 's happily - ever - after tale is remarkably void of reality
nowhere in her fictional life is it mentioned that @entity9 has done little , if anything , to improve elementary education , that she will likely graduate with $ 25,000 in student loan debt , that she has a 50 % chance of being unemployed or underemployed after college , that @entity13 and @entity41 are headed toward insolvency , and that her share of the national debt is $ 50,000 and growing
for @entity57 , @entity5 's story might seem like a joke too good to be true , but they should take it very seriously
because buried within " @entity3 " is the ideological vision of modern liberalism -- to create a state that takes care of its people from cradle to grave
the story of @entity5 is a microcosm of @entity1 's vision for @entity69 and emblematic of his view of the government 's role in an individual 's life
" @entity3 " has done what many conservatives have failed to do so far -- outline in exacting detail what modern @entity80 policy wants for individuals
here we have @entity1 's 21st century synthesis of the @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86
@entity5 's entire life is defined by her interactions with the state
government is everywhere and each step of her life is tied to a government program
notably absent in her story is any relationship with a husband , family , church or community , except a " community " garden where she works post-retirement
instead , the state has taken their place and is her primary relationship
as banal and hackneyed as @entity5 's life of government dependence may seem , many @entity69 support it
after all , similar promises lured a number of @entity113 countries into overreaching and under - supported social safety nets
with the @entity69 family less intact than ever and with single motherhood at historic highs , women like @entity5 are increasingly left on their own
the idea of government assistance can become more and more attractive to them and even necessary
@entity80 policymakers realize that in the absence of self - sustaining family units , government can step in and fill the void
and a government large enough to fill that void can eventually take the place of the family altogether
cultural commentator @entity132 recently wrote , " the single mother has become the cornerstone of @entity80 politics
" @entity5 is the perfect example
in response , conservatives must defend their own cornerstones -- individual liberty , virtue and earned success
conservatives must make the case that earned success is preferable to government dependency , and that @entity5 is more likely to achieve success and fulfillment in a good , stable family
as families grow stronger , schools , churches and communities improve , and @entity5 's chances for success improve , both for herself and her son
but as government grows larger and more intrusive , @entity5 's personal liberty and opportunities may shrink
whatever pleasure @entity57 may get from jokes or parodies of @entity5 , the fact is that many women will choose her life , some out of necessity or believing it 's necessary
" @entity3 " should make it obvious that this election is about more than offering @entity5 a better job and more benefits
conservatives must be able to provide @entity5 an alternative vision for a better future
without it , @entity5 might have nowhere else to turn but to the government , and that is nothing to laugh about
