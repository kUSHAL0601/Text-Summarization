-- a @entity2 judge rebuffed a request to step aside thursday and opened a hearing into allegations that a man executed for the killings of his three daughters was put on death row by " junk science
" the family of @entity12 has asked district judge @entity13 to posthumously clear @entity12 's name , arguing that state officials ignored an expert 's last - minute findings that the fire that killed his daughters in december 1991 was not deliberately set
the science that supported the prosecution 's case " had been discredited 10 years earlier , " @entity20 , a lawyer for the family , told the judge
@entity12 was put to death in february 2004 , insisting in his final statement that he was innocent
authorities in the town of @entity30 , where the fire took place , and @entity2 gov. @entity33 , who allowed the execution to go forward , have stood by the conviction
@entity37 district attorney @entity36 last week asked @entity13 to step aside
@entity36 argued that the judge 's impartiality was called into question by the fact that he sat on the state @entity42 when it upheld @entity12 's conviction and wrote a concurring opinion supporting the ruling
in addition , he argued , @entity13 received an award in february from the @entity49 to abolish the @entity50
@entity13 rejected @entity36 's motion thursday , finding that the prosecutor 's office was not a party to the family 's request for a " court of inquiry , " a rare proceeding under @entity2 law
" i just do n't believe that you , in your capacity as the @entity37 district attorney , are a part of this lawsuit , " @entity13 said
@entity36 left the courtroom after the ruling without participating in thursday 's hearing , which was held to determine whether there is enough evidence of a wrongful conviction to open a court of inquiry
the proceedings are separate from the long - running investigation being conducted by the @entity75 , which is scheduled to take up the @entity12 case again friday
@entity12 's relatives have the support of @entity79 , which requested the @entity75 's investigation
the group 's founder , defense lawyer @entity81 , appeared in court thursday to argue for a court of inquiry , telling @entity13 the testimony of a state fire marshal who was the prosecution 's key witness was " completely wrong and misleading
" the fire marshal , @entity89 , told jurors in @entity12 's trial that evidence at the scene of the fire showed the blaze was set intentionally with a flammable liquid
" given the science that we know today , " @entity81 said , that testimony is " false , misleading and totally unreliable
" fire scientist @entity100 , who reviewed the @entity12 case after the execution , told @entity13 that some of the indicators @entity89 relied on to reach his conclusions were outdated at the time -- and nearly all were considered obsolete by the time @entity12 was executed
" a lot of people believed that back in 1991 , " @entity100 said
" now in 2004 , nobody believed that
" @entity89 died in the mid- 1990s , but the state fire marshal 's office has reaffirmed his findings -- a stance @entity100 said was impossible to square with modern fire science
" you ca n't make it go away just by saying , ' we stand by the original conclusions , ' " he said
@entity12 's daughters -- 2 - year - old @entity122 and 1 - year - old twins @entity124 and @entity125 -- died in the blaze in @entity30 , south of @entity127
his ex-wife , @entity128 , told reporters outside the @entity131 courthouse last week that @entity12 had confessed to her in the days before his execution that he had started the fatal fire
" he burnt them , " @entity128 said
" he admitted he burnt them to me , and he was convicted for his crime
that is the closest to justice that my daughters will ever get
" @entity12 never publicly admitted guilt , and his family has questioned @entity128 's account of the confession
@entity13 said @entity128 was invited to appear at thursday 's hearing , but she declined .
