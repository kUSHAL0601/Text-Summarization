@entity0 -- @entity3 founder @entity2 was granted bail tuesday after a hearing at @entity6 in @entity0 , but a lawyer representing @entity9 prosecutors immediately filed an appeal
that means @entity2 will remain in jail until the next hearing , which should be before the @entity15 within 48 hours , lawyers said
the 39 - year - old @entity16 handed himself over to @entity0 police last week to answer a @entity20 arrest warrant over alleged sex crimes in @entity9
@entity2 is facing accusations of rape , sexual molestation and illegal use of force in separate incidents in august in @entity28
he could be sentenced to two years in prison if convicted
his lawyers deny the allegations and have vowed to fight any attempts at extradition
the magistrate agreed to grant bail tuesday after @entity36 , a former @entity37 army officer who founded @entity0 's @entity38 , testified that @entity2 could stay at his mansion in @entity40
@entity36 will keep @entity2 " if not under house arrest , at least under mansion arrest , " said defense attorney @entity43
at that , @entity2 , dressed in a white shirt and a blue jacket and sitting in a glassed - in corner of the court with three security guards , smiled wryly
the magistrate set bail at 200,000 pounds ( about $ 315,000 ) plus two sureties of 20,000 pounds each ( about $ 31,500 )
@entity2 's passport must remain with police , and he will be monitored by a location tag
@entity2 must be at @entity36 's mansion , about two hours outside of @entity0 , for at least four hours overnight and four hours during the day
he will be required to report to police daily between 6 and 8 p.m. the next court hearing was scheduled for january 11
after the conditions were set , @entity2 stood and said , " i understand , " with a neutral expression
his mother @entity60 told reporters after the hearing that she was " very , very happy " and thanked " the media for all your support of my son
" but several hours later , @entity9 filed its appeal
outside the court , about 100 people demonstrated in support of @entity2 , holding signs saying " @entity2 is a political prisoner " and " why are you shooting the messenger ? " and " this is not 1984
" during the hearing , @entity2 's team of attorneys argued that since he is only wanted for questioning and has not been formally charged , he is presumed innocent
but , said @entity83 , the attorney representing the @entity9 prosecution , " the court has already found that mr. @entity2 is a flight risk
nothing has changed in this regard
" she said if the alleged offenses had occurred in @entity89 , " it undoubtedly would have been a charge of rape in this jurisdiction
celebrity supporters of @entity2 at the hearing included @entity96 , who sat next to @entity97 , niece of the late @entity100 politician @entity99 and current @entity100 president @entity101 , and prominent left - wing journalist @entity102
socialite @entity103 came to court but it is not clear she got into the very crowded hearing room
many were turned away for lack of space
judge @entity111 denied @entity2 's first request for bail at a hearing on december 7 on the grounds that there was a risk he would fail to surrender
on tuesday , he cited four reasons for his insistence a week earlier on keeping @entity2 in jail : his lack of fixed residence , confusion over when and how he last entered the @entity37 , the evidence against him in @entity9 , and a dispute over whether @entity2 is wanted only for questioning or for prosecution
@entity36 's offer of his mansion satisfied @entity111 on the question of an address , and testimony from someone who arrived in the @entity37 with @entity2 from @entity134 answered that question , he said
he said he was not taking a position on the @entity9 evidence against @entity2 , and that a future hearing would have to determine whether @entity2 was wanted for questioning or prosecution
@entity3 ' release of thousands of secret @entity143 diplomatic and military documents is under criminal review in the @entity143
almost half of @entity37 believe that the sex charges against @entity2 are " an excuse " to keep him in custody so that the @entity143 government can prosecute him for releasing secret diplomatic cables , a new poll for @entity1 shows
the @entity153 poll of @entity37 opinion , released monday on the eve of @entity2 's bail hearing , finds that 44 % of respondents in @entity89 believe that @entity9 's sex charges are just a pretext , while only 13 % flatly disagree
the remaining 43 % say they do n't know
last week , @entity143 attorney general @entity161 said he had authorized " significant " actions related to a criminal investigation into @entity3 ' publication of the materials but has declined to elaborate
@entity3 inflamed @entity143 authorities last month by publishing the first of a large group of confidential @entity143 diplomatic cables
only a small fraction of the 250,000 @entity172 documents have been released and more are being published daily
@entity143 authorities and other @entity175 leaders say the documents ' publication threatens lives and national security
@entity3 and its supporters say that the public has a right to know what is going on behind diplomatic doors
@entity1 's @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .
