-- if you believe the cover of @entity3 magazine , @entity4 and @entity5 may be ready to come out
the cover , titled " @entity8 , " shows the @entity10 pair cuddling as they watch a television set featuring members of the @entity14
the suggestion is that the characters were happily celebrating the recent @entity14 rulings on gay marriage
there has been plenty of speculation about @entity4 over the years , which intensified after a tweet from the @entity10 account which quoted @entity25 talking about his mohawk hair cut that some took to be a hint to the character 's sexuality
the tweet read : " @entity4 : ever notice how similar my hair is to @entity33 's ? the only difference is mine is a little more ' mo , ' a little less ' hawk
' " when a petition was circulated in 2011 urging the pair to marry , @entity35 posted a statement on their @entity40 page insisting that the characters were just " best friends
" " even though they are identified as male characters and possess many human traits and characteristics ( as most @entity51 „ ¢ do ) , they remain puppets , and do not have a sexual orientation , " the statement said
the @entity3 posted on its site that the image was created by artist @entity54 who said he had originally submitted the picture to a @entity56
" it 's amazing to witness how attitudes on gay rights have evolved in my lifetime , " the magazine 's website quotes @entity54 as saying
" this is great for our kids , a moment we can all celebrate
