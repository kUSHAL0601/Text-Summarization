as the bloody battles pushed up tragic death tolls on both sides , world powers held a flurry of diplomatic meetings wednesday aimed at halting the fighting in @entity7
@entity9 secretary of state @entity8 met with @entity11 and @entity12 leaders as well as @entity14 @entity13 ban ki - moon , while several @entity16 nations worked to try to win @entity18 ' agreement for an @entity20 - led cease - fire
but perhaps the most powerful message came from a woman whose son 's death played a role in sparking the current fighting
" your children and our children -- nobody should really go through what we 're going through now , " said @entity27 , whose son @entity28 was among three @entity30 teens kidnapped and killed on the way home from school in the @entity34 last month

@entity11 has indicted an adult and two minors for the killing
the @entity47 are @entity9 citizens
@entity49 , @entity28 's uncle , works to bring @entity12 into @entity11 's high - tech sector
@entity27 met with @entity8 on wednesday
afterward , speaking to media , she said , " i just want to turn to @entity12 parents and say maybe you can stop @entity18 from using you as human shields and your death as propaganda
" " i promise the @entity12 parents : all we want is to live in peace and raise our children without threats of missiles or tunnels under our communities , " noting that an @entity11 kindergarten was struck by a rocket this week -- it was empty at the time
" maybe we can teach our children that we want to live in peace , " she said
some @entity12 parents visited her family after @entity28 's death and they had very good conversations , she said
" i do know decent , good @entity12 people
" @entity11 @entity30 families also visited the family of @entity77 , the @entity12 teen killed
despite @entity27 's sentiments , many @entity12 parents accuse @entity11 of carrying out a " massacre " -- and have called on @entity11 to push the government to stop military action
" nobody is safe and nobody can flee anywhere because everywhere is targeted , " said a mother of two who lives in the @entity86 neighborhood of @entity87 , as @entity88 reported monday
" when we hear the shelling my kids will cry
" death tolls jump the @entity97 said wednesday 695 @entity12 have been killed in the fighting , including 166 children
more than 4,500 people have been wounded , the health officials said
it 's unclear how many of the dead were civilians
the @entity14 estimates that more than 70 % were
the @entity11 military said 230 militants have been killed
@entity12 have disputed @entity11 and @entity9 assertions that many of the deaths are due to people choosing to be part of human shields
while @entity18 leaders have encouraged people to do so , many @entity12 have told @entity88 they worried that if they followed @entity11 warnings and fled their homes , they 'd have nowhere safe to go

on tuesday , the @entity11 military released the soldier 's name -- sgt. @entity135 -- but said it was " working to identify his body
" @entity11 media reported that @entity135 was missing and presumed dead
@entity14 slams possible ' war crimes ' " there seems to be a strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated , in a manner that could amount to war crimes , " @entity141 @entity140 said wednesday
" i unequivocally reiterate to all actors in this conflict that civilians must not be targeted
it is imperative that @entity11 , @entity18 and all @entity12 armed groups strictly abide by applicable norms of international humanitarian law and international human rights law , " @entity140 said
" this entails applying the principles of distinction between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives ; proportionality ; and precautions in attack
respect for the right to life of civilians , including children , should be a foremost consideration
not abiding by these principles may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity
" some @entity11 officials rejected @entity140 's statements about @entity11
" she would be better advised to seek credible first - hand information rather than making intolerably biased statements based on newspaper clippings , " @entity180 spokesman @entity178 said , according to the @entity181
he added that @entity140 's " embarrassingly shallow and populist affirmations ... do a huge disservice to actual human rights
" also wednesday , @entity189 announced he was ordering a review of incidents where rockets were placed at @entity193 schools
@entity189 " expresses his outrage , and regret , at the placing of weapons in a @entity200 school , " a written statement from the @entity14 said
