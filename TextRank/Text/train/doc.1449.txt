@entity0 -- roughly half of all @entity3 now think the @entity4 was behind the @entity6 decision to target conservative political groups , according to a recent @entity1 / @entity9 poll , a growing belief at odds with information recently provided to @entity1 by congressional investigators
the information includes a full transcript of the may 21 deposition of @entity16 , a high - ranking @entity6 official placed on administrative leave as a result of her role in the scandal
@entity16 was questioned extensively by investigators from the @entity22 , which is chaired by one of the administration 's fiercest congressional critics , @entity27 @entity26 rep. @entity23
the transcript of @entity16 's deposition , examined by @entity1 this week , shows an agency plagued more by bureaucratic ineptitude than partisan political scheming
@entity6 agents are revealed as politically tone deaf and blind to what was being done , or not done , in different offices that presumably should have been in closer contact
" @entity38 was not something they were interested in , " @entity16 told investigators
" because they are so apolitical , they are not as sensitive as we would like them to be as to how things might appear
" @entity16 is a top official at the @entity6 division responsible for reviewing applications for tax - exempt status
some critics argue the division intentionally intimidated and harassed tea party and other conservative groups , often delaying the processing of their applications for months or years
an inspector general 's report released last month found that an @entity6 unit in @entity56 had used criteria that included conservative labels such as " tea party " to target certain groups for extra questioning
@entity6 rules prevent groups engaged in excessive political activity from becoming tax exempt , but the agency has struggled to develop clear guidelines on the matter
the targeting began in 2010 and ended last year when senior @entity6 officials learned of it , according to the report
@entity72 : ' who is going to jail ' over @entity6 scandal last month , 37 % of the public thought the @entity4 was tied to the @entity6 controversy
now , 47 % say the @entity4 was directing the @entity6 , according to the latest @entity1 / @entity9 survey
@entity79 are sensitive to the charge , which some analysts contend has contributed to a recent drop in president @entity84 's approval ratings
@entity86 rep. @entity85 , the top @entity87 on @entity23 's panel , released the full transcript on tuesday of the deposition of a self - described " conservative @entity26 " @entity6 manager who has denied any administration involvement in the scandal
the manager also insisted that the initial decision to flag tea party groups for additional scrutiny originated with lower level @entity6 staff in @entity56 , not upper management in @entity0 or elsewhere
" this interview transcript provides a detailed first - hand account of how these practices first originated , and it debunks conspiracy theories about how the @entity6 first started reviewing these cases , " @entity85 said
" releasing this transcript serves the best interest of @entity107 and the @entity3 people by ensuring that there is an accurate and fair picture of the management challenges facing the @entity6
" @entity84 : @entity6 actions " intolerable and inexcusable " the move by @entity85 drew a sharp rebuke from @entity23 , who has also released certain elements of the investigation at different points
" i am deeply disappointed that ranking member @entity85 has decided to broadly disseminate and post online a 205 page transcript that will serve as a roadmap for @entity6 officials to navigate investigative interviews with @entity107 , " @entity23 said
" americans who think @entity107 should investigate @entity6 misconduct should be outraged by mr. @entity85 ' efforts to obstruct needed oversight
" @entity23 and @entity85 have both promised in appearances on @entity1 's " @entity127 " to release transcripts of all of the depositions conducted in the investigation
for her part , @entity16 told investigators from two @entity4 committees that questions about certain applications often remained unanswered because @entity6 agents were simply " waiting for guidance " from @entity0 that was never provided
meanwhile , agency leaders in @entity0 remained unaware that applicants were not receiving final answers
@entity16 was under the impression that the " tea party " label was internal @entity6 shorthand for all cases regarding groups involved in campaign politics
" it was really just an efficient way to refer to this issue , " @entity16 told investigators , noting that the first case identified with political campaign activity related to an application from a tea party group
" it 's like calling soda ' @entity159 ' or you know , tissue ' @entity156
' they knew what they meant , and the issue was campaign intervention
" applications for tax - exempt status " was an area that did not get a great deal of attention ... outside the @entity6 , " @entity16 added
" it 's only been in recent years that it 's something that has gotten , you know , more media attention and congressional attention
" many @entity6 employees have been with the agency " for decades " and " were used to a world where how they talked about things internally was not something that would be public or that anyone would be interested in , " @entity16 said
" so i do n't think they thought much about how it would appear to others
they knew what they meant , and that was sort of good enough for them
" @entity16 insisted she never took part in any discussion about targeting conservatives
she also noted other cases in recent years involved a denial of tax - exempt status for liberal groups , an assertion challenged by critics
" i had no indication that we were not being balanced in what we were doing , " she said
@entity16 noted that she was personally involved in a review of roughly 40 cases in the fall of 2010 , an acknowledgment undercutting claims that the @entity56 office was solely to blame for the debacle
roughly half of the cases involved groups with the words " tea party " in the name
@entity212 and other conservative activists are planning to hold a rally on @entity215 on wednesday to protest the @entity6 actions .
