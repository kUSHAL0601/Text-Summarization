the company that owns a cash depot targeted in a daring helicopter raid this week said friday it is offering a reward of more than $ 1 million for information about the heist
a police @entity6 enter a @entity8 cash depot in @entity9 , @entity10
@entity8 said it is offering up to 7 million @entity12 kronor ( $ 1.01 million ) for information leading directly to the arrest and conviction of the offenders or the recovery of the stolen money
@entity8 also said the circulation of cash in @entity10 would not be adversely affected by the heist , which occurred just days before @entity12 's monthly payday , when the depot would have been rife with cash
the company did not disclose how much money had been lost , but the thieves could have gotten as much as the equivalent of several millions of @entity29 dollars , according to @entity31 affiliate @entity30
a group of heavily - armed thieves used a helicopter early wednesday to land on the roof of the cash depot in @entity37 , @entity10 , which serves automatic teller machines all across the capital , @entity30 reported
they used explosives to get into the building , witness @entity42 told @entity30 , and later hoisted bags of money to the waiting chopper
@entity30 later reported that the blueprints of the building were public documents which anybody could request to see
@entity8 had never asked for the blueprints to be classified
the helicopter had been stolen earlier during the night , police said
the thieves had also placed a bag marked " bomb " outside the police heliport , meaning @entity12 police could n't immediately pursue the thieves because they had to first deal with the bag
@entity30 later reported that the bag never contained a bomb
the thieves had also blocked the roads around the cash depot with metal spikes , @entity30 reported
no one was hurt during the heist , police said , even though several employees had been in the building when the robbers entered
@entity10 police said the heist had been elaborate
" the robbery was very well planned
they brought a lot of firepower with them , among other things automatic weapons , " @entity74 from the @entity10 police , told @entity30
two people have been questioned in relation to the heist , but no one has been arrested
police are still hopeful they will find the perpetrators
" we have a lot of traces after the perpetrators , both where the robbery took place and where we found the helicopter , " @entity74 said
the investigation is the biggest operation the @entity12 police have mounted since the murder of @entity12 's then - foreign minister @entity98 in 2003
" it 's an enormous piece of puzzle , and we do n't want to miss anything , " @entity99 , head of police operations , told @entity30
since the heist , @entity12 police have been criticized for storing their helicopters at an unguarded heliport in the @entity10 archipelago , which enabled the thieves easily to put the police helicopter out of commission
@entity12 media also criticized police for not shooting at the thieves as they escaped in their helicopter
but @entity115 , the head of @entity12 police , defended the police officers ' actions
" just because we now have criminals who act like they do in the movies does n't mean that we can do it as well , " @entity115 told @entity12 newspaper @entity119 .
