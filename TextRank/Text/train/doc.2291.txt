-- in the face of @entity5 threats , @entity2 president @entity1 stepped up his nationalist push , urging countrymen in a radio address " to stand together , united as one
" " there can be no difference between you and me when it comes to national security , because our lives and the survival of the nation depend on it , " @entity1 said monday
the remarks marked the latest in the war of words between the communist @entity5 and free - enterprise @entity2 , which split after @entity27 's defeat in @entity28 over the past six decades , small - scale skirmishes have flared repeatedly along land and sea borders , including deadly naval clashes along the demarcation line in 1999 , 2002 and 2009
the situation , if anything , has worsened in recent months -- stirred by the sinking of a @entity2 warship and deadly shelling of a border island
while there previously had been movement toward reconciliation , recent events have sparked demonstrations calling for @entity44 to be bolder and more defiant
@entity1 referenced such attacks as " provocations against us without the slightest hesitation " in his sunday address , saying they proved that , " if we merely let the @entity5 have its own way , national security and peace can not be guaranteed
" the president said that @entity44 had " thus far shown patience , time and again ( as it ) struggled to maintain peace
" even so , he said that now was the time for @entity2 to rally as one -- and not to back down in the face of @entity63 's threats or actions
" if we show the @entity5 how steadfastly united we are , they will not dare challenge us , " said @entity1
just last thursday , @entity5 threatened to launch a " sacred war " after @entity2 completed large military exercises near the volatile @entity69 border
" the revolutionary armed forces of the ( @entity5 ) are getting fully prepared to launch a sacred war of justice of @entity5 style based on the nuclear deterrent at anytime necessary , " @entity5 defense minister @entity71 said , according to the state - run @entity73 news agency
" the @entity2 puppet forces perpetrated such grave military provocation as renewing their shelling against the @entity5 during their recent exercises for a war of aggression in the @entity85 of @entity2 , " @entity71 said
" this indicates that the enemy 's scenario for aggression aimed at the start of another @entity91 , has reached the phase of its implementation
" the long - planned @entity2 exercises , billed as the largest land and air winter drills , were conducted in @entity97 just 15 miles from the @entity5 border
more than 800 military personnel , fighter jets and anti-tank missiles took part in the exercise , which also involved more than 100 types of weapons
tensions have been running high since the sinking of the @entity2 warship @entity109 last march , killing 46 sailors
@entity2 and the international community blamed the @entity5 for the @entity109 incident , but @entity63 denied the accusations
then , last month , @entity5 said the @entity2 's navy fired into @entity116 waters and in retaliation , it shelled @entity118 , killing four @entity2
@entity2 said its @entity119 was simply holding drills and conducted similar naval exercises again on monday , drawing threats from @entity63 that it would attack again
but that did not happen .
