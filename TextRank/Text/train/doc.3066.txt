-- before i started working on the documentary " @entity3 , " i assumed like many others that dolphins and orcas enjoyed living at @entity8 and other marine parks
they always seemed to be smiling , jumping merrily around their tanks , eager to put on a show for human spectators
however , when i met @entity16 , my perspective changed
@entity16 was the man responsible for capturing @entity17 -- the original " @entity16 " -- from the wild and helping to create the language used to train dolphins to do tricks and flips
when @entity23 died in his arms some years later , @entity16 realized the whole process of capturing and training dolphins was wrong
he eventually co-wrote the book " behind the @entity33 , " where he explains that the smiles you see on these animals are not true reflections of happiness
in actuality , they hate to be enclosed in their holding tanks and are often not fed until it is time to perform their daily routines
during his time as a trainer , @entity16 learned dolphins had true feelings -- they would get depressed , stressed out , even suicidal
in some parks , the trainers have to give the animals @entity48 and @entity49 to treat the ulcers that develop from their stress
the horrific tragedy that occurred last week at @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , has left me deeply shaken
my heart goes out to @entity58 and her family
@entity60 lost her life doing the job that she loved , yet i -- like @entity16 -- believe that this job should no longer exist
we know now that the whale involved in this accident has a well - documented history of violent behavior
@entity53 knew of this history yet continued to exploit the animal and endanger the lives of its employees to put money in its pockets
if this is n't a wake - up call , i do n't know what is
at this very moment , a dozen boats in the town of @entity82 , @entity83 , are heading out and rounding up hundreds of dolphins in a secluded cove
the fisherman will close off the cove with nets , and with the help of employees from various dolphinariums , they will try to find the next " flipper " among their catch
the fishermen will snatch these beautiful creatures from their natural habitats , hoist them into nets , load them onto airplanes and drop them into a cement tank in the middle of @entity103 , @entity104 or other nearby @entity106 countries
in some ways , these animals are the lucky ones
these dolphins escaped the fate of many of their pod mates , who are brutally slaughtered with primitive harpoons -- turning the cove into a scene straight from @entity119 's " @entity118
" the water turns bright red with the blood of the slain
the fishermen then transport the meat -- despite health concerns of mercury content in the dolphins ' systems -- back to shore , where they sell it to local vendors
it 's time for us to step up and make a difference in these animals ' lives
until we make marine parks obsolete , dolphins and other sea mammals will continue to be senselessly captured and slaughtered
we can no longer fall for the argument that @entity53 shows " make us love the dolphins and want to understand and protect them " -- this could n't be further from the truth
as i see it , we will only truly love and understand these animals when we can watch them running wild and genuinely smiling in their natural habitat
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .
