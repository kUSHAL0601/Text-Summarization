-- @entity1 dances to his own music -- or , it turns out , to a good hip - hop tune with strangers
the actor popped up at a birthday party in @entity8 , @entity9 , over the weekend , getting down with the crowd to @entity11 and @entity13 's hit " @entity14
" @entity1 is making as much of a name for dropping in on events as he has for some of his more more famous films like " @entity19 " and " @entity20
" his appearance this time does n't quite count as crashing , as it seems the birthday boy invited him through the party 's chef , who is a friend of @entity1 's
the mercurial @entity1 did n't have to travel far -- he owns a home in @entity8 -- for the latest stop on his ongoing comical mystery tour
for those keeping score , the funnyman has turned up at a @entity8 bachelor party where he offered the groom some relationship advice , a @entity38 karaoke bar , a student house party in @entity40 , a kickball game on @entity43 's @entity42 and an event at @entity45 where he bartended , just to name a few
there 's even a website dedicated to collecting @entity1 stories , both the real and the fictitious ( which , it turns out , sound a great deal alike )
the @entity51 declared september 5 to be @entity52 in part to ensure that he 'd show up to promote his latest movie , " @entity55
" despite being an acclaimed actor , @entity1 has no agent or official representation and is not on social media
so good luck getting him as the cool factor at your next kegger unless you can do what execs have to when casting him in a @entity68 film : pick up the phone and give him a call
@entity1 's own birthday is coming up -- he turns 64 on september 21 -- but there 's no word on whether he 'll be having have a party that strangers can pop into
