as men 's college basketball comes to a close with the last game april 6 , fans are anxiously watching to see who will claim victory in this year 's national championship game
more than a century after @entity24 invented basketball at a @entity27 training school in @entity28 , the sport continues to captivate millions of fans
over the years , college basketball has sparked great dedication among its fans , from those who camp out for three months for a ticket to those who attended games before they could read
@entity0 , with the help of experts at the @entity14 , chose a handful of basketball towns filled with great fans , rich traditions and history that make these places worth a visit
@entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , and the @entity49 in @entity50 college basketball is deeply rooted in @entity48 culture , thanks to the success of the men 's teams at the @entity49 and @entity46
the epic rivalry between @entity46 's @entity7 and @entity48 's @entity58 draws in so many fans that some sports experts say it is partly responsible for reviving the waning college basketball viewership in the first half of this decade
visitors will find that @entity46 basketball fans do n't shower their support only on game day
at @entity46 -- seeded no. 2 in the @entity69 -- student fans , dubbed the @entity71 , are so eager to snare one of the 1,200 first - come - first - serve spots in the @entity75 student section that they camp out for up to three months for the infamous @entity48 - @entity46 matchup
the grassy tenting area outside the basketball arena , known as @entity80 , is named after coach @entity81 , who has been named @entity82 12 times
" it 's so easy to become enthralled with the culture of @entity46 basketball , " said @entity84 , a senior who headed up the tenting efforts this year
outside the stadium , visitors will discover plenty of @entity7 spirit off - campus in @entity47 , a former tobacco town
@entity94 and @entity95 are among the favorite hot spots where visitors will discover student and local fans watching the games
about a 20 - minute drive from @entity47 is the historic town of @entity50 , home to the @entity49 , which was seeded no. 1 in the @entity104 this year
the school has a strong record of basketball success , appearing in more than 40 @entity14 tournaments
it is also the college team of professional basketball legend @entity111
@entity112 , publisher of @entity113 , has been decked in baby blue @entity115 gear since he was a child
he even skipped school so he could attend the games with his parents , both @entity113 alums
" it 's not just a sport , " he explained
" it 's the number one thing talked about during this part of the year
you 'll have trouble holding a conversation in @entity50 in march if you do n't know the basics of @entity115 basketball
" if visitors ca n't get one of the coveted tickets to watch the game in the @entity130 , aka the @entity130 , there is plenty to do in the quaint city of @entity50
visitors can walk to @entity138 , the heart of town , where eateries , shops and sports bars are ready to embrace @entity49 fans
they can also visit the 8,000 - square - foot @entity145 , located on campus , which holds more than 450 interactive displays , memorabilia and photos documenting a basketball program that began more than a century ago
the @entity151 in @entity152 to understand the fan devotion for the defending national champions and a @entity155 no. 3 - seeded team this year , one must make a trip to @entity158 in @entity152 , @entity159
the @entity159 ' indoor arena is old - school -- smaller than some college basketball stadiums -- built in the 1950s and named in honor of revered former coach @entity164
in 1952 , " @entity164 " led the men 's basketball team to its first @entity14 victory
the energy from thousands of fans in @entity158 is contagious
in addition to the " @entity173 " chant , @entity151 students are famous for their clever antics against the other teams , particularly their longstanding rivals at the @entity177
but if you ca n't get a ticket during the regular season , check out the @entity181 , a 26,000 - square - foot museum adjacent to the stadium
the museum , which opened about three years ago , houses artifacts and information about the history of @entity151 athletics , including the men 's basketball team
visitors can head to colorful @entity189 , the main drag in downtown @entity152
the street is lined with plenty of restaurants and bars catering to @entity159 followers on game day
when @entity159 beat @entity199 to clinch the national championship last year , more than 100,000 fans poured into the street , university officials say
" people who come [ to @entity152 ] never want to leave , " said @entity202 , a 1981 alumna and editor of @entity204
" and if you 're a basketball fan , that 's all the better
@entity208 in @entity209 , @entity210 sure , the @entity211 did n't have a stellar season after going 6 - 25 , and they did n't make it to the @entity14
after @entity215 resigned as coach in february over allegations that he had violated @entity14 recruiting standards , the team lost many of its top players
despite this , college basketball in @entity209 , @entity210 , remains sacred , devout @entity211 fans say , and they believe that the men 's team will be back in full force over the next few years
@entity208 has one of the top basketball programs in the country , winning five @entity14 championships
the team was led for many years by hot - tempered but incredibly successful coach @entity232
if you are lucky enough to get a ticket to see the @entity211 play at their stadium , @entity236 , you will find droves of student fans
@entity236 holds one of the country 's largest student sections , holding more than 8,000
officials at @entity243 say basketball game days flood local restaurants and bars with students and local fans
the games tend to sell out , so be prepared to explore @entity209
most fans head to @entity251 near campus and drop by @entity254 's @entity253 , where the walls are covered with @entity211 athletic photographs and gear , or @entity258 's @entity259 to watch the game
" basketball is a religion in this state , " said @entity261 , the men 's basketball columnist at the university 's student newspaper , the @entity263
" it goes way back before @entity232
it 's what people do up here
@entity272 in @entity273 , @entity274 there is no football team at @entity272 in @entity273 , @entity274
that means students and alumni are even more dedicated to the men 's basketball team , they say
@entity272 may be a @entity283 university with just over 11,000 students , but it boasts one of the highest attendance rates at basketball games in the country
students at @entity272 do n't pitch tents like at @entity46 , but the games are so popular , some will bring their sleeping bags 10 hours before the game to get the best seat in the house " it 's such a great feeling to know you can walk anywhere in the city when you have a @entity272 shirt on a basketball day and people will talk to you about basketball , " said @entity297 , a sophomore at the university
" it gives this city a bonding feeling
" although the @entity313 no. 6 - seeded @entity314 lost to the @entity177 in the tournament last week , a trip to the @entity309 , where the @entity272 men 's basketball team plays ( and where the @entity312 's @entity311 play ) is well worth the visit
@entity272 students , called the @entity317 , are famous for their peculiar behavior , dressing up in costumes to support their team and distracting opponents with oversized cutouts of celebrities ' heads
on campus are several bars , including the @entity327 , that tout cheap beer pitchers and food specials for fans
just several blocks from the university is downtown @entity273
on @entity335 , where most of the fans crowd on game day , visitors can hang with the locals and enjoy a hub of sports bars , taverns and restaurants
@entity343 in @entity344 , @entity345 @entity343 officials call it the " @entity347 " : this small private school in @entity344 , @entity345 , has qualified for the @entity14 tournament for the 11th straight year
the @entity351 men 's basketball team is an obscure team that seems to emerge from thin air each march
this year , the team entered the tournament seeded no. 4 in the @entity354
" there have been a lot of one - and - done schools , who make a splash and disappear , but we 've been able to sustain it , " said @entity355 , a spokesman for the university
fans in " the @entity365 " at @entity343 go wild for basketball despite the school 's smaller size
for more than 17 years of the @entity365 's existence , the @entity351 have won more than 75 percent of their games , including over 90 percent during the past eight seasons , according to the @entity343 athletic department
visitors will be delighted to watch the games in the school 's arena , the $ 25 million @entity377 , which opened in 2004
before the opening , the basketball team was playing in a glorified high school gym , university officials said
on @entity384 near the university , visitors will want to head to @entity385 & @entity386 , which belongs to @entity387 , a former @entity312 and @entity343 player
the @entity388 , which claims to have the best burgers in town , is also a popular hangout during the games
meanwhile , @entity344 is preparing to host the @entity14 first - and second - round men 's basketball tournament next march
the town , tucked into eastern @entity345 , is excited to welcome visitors
a single event will probably bring in $ 2.75 million , according to the @entity398 .
