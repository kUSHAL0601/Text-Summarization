at the start of @entity3 's civil unrest , @entity0 would rally against the government alongside his schoolmates , later taking to the streets in his hometown of @entity8
two years later , at the age of 14 , he became a child soldier , training to join the ranks of rebel group @entity13
he learned how to use weapons , make bombs and use mines
but when it came to fighting on the front line , he was scared
" then our sheikh came to encourage us to go fight and gave us speeches about jihad , " @entity0 told @entity19
" so after two days , i went to front line
" @entity0 is just one of many boys being used on the battlefield in @entity3 's civil war , according to an @entity19 report released monday
many are forced to fight in battle
others must act as snipers , man checkpoints , spy on opposing forces or carry out other , equally dangerous tasks
@entity38 , 17 , told @entity19 that he first joined the @entity39 , an @entity40 rebel group , when he was 15
he later agreed to sign up for a suicide attack mission , feeling socially pressured to sign the volunteer list
other children had also signed on , he said
with @entity3 entering its fourth year of civil war , grim accounts of child soldiers being used on the battlefield are now emerging
though the specific number of child fighters in @entity3 is unknown , the @entity48 , a @entity3 monitoring group , has documented 194 deaths of " non-civilian " male children since 2011
of the 25 boys interviewed by @entity19 for the report , many reported joining opposition forces simply to follow a relative or friend
others become opposition fighters because of circumstance -- living in battle zones or suffering at the hands of government forces
the report demands the discharge of all soldiers under the age of 18 in @entity3 and warns anyone backing such organizations of being potentially complicit in war crimes
it also accuses the @entity72 in @entity73 and @entity3 , a powerful jihadist group , of recruiting children through free schooling campaigns
pro-government militias were not investigated in the @entity19 report , which cited logistical and security concerns
enlisting anyone under age 18 in armed conflict is a violation of international law .
