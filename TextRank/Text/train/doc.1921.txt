@entity0 -- the @entity3 prime minister huddled wednesday with a special @entity5 envoy in an effort to help stem the growing tide of refugees racing into @entity3 from conflict - wracked @entity5
the number of @entity5 who have crossed the border stood at 8,421 wednesday morning , according to @entity3 's disaster and emergency management directorate
their flight has been spurred by violence and a military offensive in the country , and @entity3 officials are worried that the border crisis could deteriorate and destabilize the region
world powers have been outraged at the violence , and at least 54 countries are backing a tough resolution on @entity5 that was to be issued wednesday at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28
" it is impossible for us to remain indifferent to the developments there , " @entity3 foreign minister @entity29 said
" for us , the @entity5 are people who have common future and destiny with us
therefore , it is out of question to close the door to our @entity5 brothers or the ( refugee numbers ) to stop after 10,000
however , when this turns into a big wave , it also has the potential to become a regional and an international matter
" @entity5 security personnel have been carrying out a fierce crackdown against anti-government demonstrators over the past three months
in its draft joint statement about @entity5 , the @entity26 noted that more than 1,000 people " peacefully protesting for democracy " have been killed
" the continued violence , multiday curfews and military lockdowns are restricting access to basic goods and services , such as health care , medicines and food , causing great concern for the situation of children , the elderly , the sick and wounded , as well as refugees and other vulnerable groups
injured and wounded people must be allowed to seek treatment without fear of reprisals , " it said
@entity3 prime minister @entity72 met for nearly three hours with the envoy , who was expected to provide an assessment of the refugee situation and the wider political unrest in @entity5 , according to an official from @entity72 's office
the envoy represented @entity5 president @entity81 , and the meeting followed a telephone conversation @entity72 and @entity81 had tuesday
@entity29 , who spoke at the airport in @entity85 before flying to @entity86 for a visit with the refugees , said @entity3 hopes to initiate reforms that would alleviate the volatile conditions leading to the flight of ordinary citizens
he planned to attend the meeting between @entity72 and the @entity5 envoy after his visit to @entity86
@entity29 said that " escalating violence can increase the refugee wave " and that @entity3 is working on ways " to prevent escalation of violence
" his government touts a foreign policy dubbed " no problems , " a strategy intended to promote good relations with its neighbors
that policy has been challenged by the @entity5 situation
@entity3 fears a repeat of the enormous @entity112 refugee exodus from northern @entity113 in 1991 , and the country has spent the past decade promoting warm relations and lucrative economic ties with @entity5 's @entity81
but over the past month , @entity72 began calling for reform in @entity118 in a bid to curb the escalating violence
" we hope that @entity5 changes its attitude toward the civilians to a more tolerant one and realize its steps for reform in a more convincing way for the civilians , " @entity72 said last week , according to the semi-official @entity121 news agency
@entity29 said @entity3 's " wish and effort is for a process to begin at once that can prevent such a wave to continue increasingly
" he pointed to " reforms to be made as soon as possible , conditions to be eliminated that bring security forces and people against each other and to have a more peaceful approach , beyond focusing on security , in the attitude towards the civilian people
if all these were provided , the refugee wave would lessen
" of the refugees , 4,368 are children , and 73 @entity5 are now being treated in @entity3 hospitals , the emergency directorate said
more than 1,230 tents have been set up in a number of locations
@entity3 @entity152 officials confirmed that they accepted an application for actress @entity154 to visit the @entity5 refugees in @entity86
the actress , a goodwill ambassador for the @entity26 refugee agency , is expected to arrive in @entity0 and then head friday to @entity86
many displaced @entity5 have fled toward the border but have not made it over
@entity1 's @entity160 met with some of them at a makeshift campsite tuesday in @entity5 , where they described primitive conditions at the site and frightening and deadly violence in the towns that they left
many of the refugees have fled from a region that includes the northwestern town of @entity174 , seized by the @entity5 military over the weekend , a network of human rights activists said
the @entity5 government insists that it is stopping " armed terrorist groups " who carried out a " massacre " in the city : the killing 120 members of the security forces
the state - run @entity183 said wednesday that one of its correspondents is reporting a " new mass grave " in @entity174 " containing bodies belonging to police and security forces " slain by " armed terrorist groups
" opposition activists say the government 's claims are a ruse to justify a crackdown on demonstrators demanding government reform , in keeping with the wave of political protests across the @entity202 and @entity203 this year
but @entity5 refugees who have fled to @entity3 said some @entity5 soldiers rebelled after being ordered to fire on unarmed protesters and instead started fighting among themselves
@entity5 's cabinet on tuesday hailed efforts by the army and security forces to restore calm in the @entity174 area and surrounding villages , according to the @entity183
@entity214 , the information minister , said the @entity215 urged citizens " who were forced to leave their homes to come back after calm and security were restored in the area , " @entity183 said
@entity183 later reported that thousands of @entity174 residents had " returned to their houses after the army restored security and tranquility to the city
" the minister said the cabinet " assigned the @entity229 to contact the @entity230 for cooperation to facilitate the @entity5 citizens ' return to their homes , noting that all necessary needs will be provided to secure the return , including medical aid for the patients and the injured
" @entity239 , a human rights activist based outside @entity5 , said he had not received reports of people returning to their homes
his contacts told him that military deployments were in villages around the city of @entity174 , and army vehicles nearby in the village of @entity248
@entity239 said he had received no report that the people of @entity174 were returning to their homes
as many as 800 people were detained in the past few days in the towns of @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 , either in raids on homes or at military checkpoints , @entity239 said
he also reported the defection of an unspecified number of @entity5 troops in @entity262
in its joint draft joint statement on @entity5 , the @entity26 called on @entity5 to implement reforms and end censorship and restrictions on media
" @entity270 arrests , detention and torture , including of protestors , of human rights defenders , of representatives of the media , political dissidents , and young children must cease immediately , " the statement said
@entity1 's @entity279 contributed to this report .
