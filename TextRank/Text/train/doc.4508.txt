-- for years , employees at @entity2 have suggested a project near and dear to their nerd hearts : a @entity2 - led science fair
" it 's come up over and over and over again , " says @entity6 , a senior product marketing manager in education at @entity2
after all , many a @entity9 has fond childhood memories of explaining the genius of his or her biology experiment to passersby in a school gym
( @entity6 and her best friend trained hamsters to ask for food by ringing a bell
) today those @entity21 and budding scientists worldwide should be ecstatic
the company launched @entity24 , the first global online science competition
it 's open to full - time students ages 13 to 18 , who are encouraged to use the panoply of @entity2 products to record and share their work
" we want to let kids use our online tools so they can participate from anywhere in world , " @entity6 tells @entity0
" they may be home schooled or live in a remote place or not have a physical science fair in their area
" they do , however , need an internet connection
this is a far cry from your typical local science fair
@entity2 's competition kicked off this morning at its @entity49 offices with some showy science courtesy of @entity51 , the company behind the @entity52 for last year 's @entity53 viral hit " @entity55
" @entity57 's machine for @entity2 fired a laser , activating a rover that lifted a red curtain draped over the fair 's logo
then @entity2 brought a riveting cast of scientists on stage to inspire the 100 or so local students in attendance
@entity2 's partners include @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72
consequently , the judges are not your eighth - grade biology teacher and the football coach who took a freshman chemistry course
they include @entity78 , its chief internet evangelist and one of the fathers of the @entity83 , and @entity69 's explorer - in - residence , the geneticist @entity85
@entity78 gave a brief history of the @entity87 , telling students that breakthroughs of that magnitude do n't " just happen
" they require scientists asking questions , forming hypothesis , failing , and then asking more questions
if it seems to students as if all the good stuff has already been discovered , @entity78 said , remember that " 95 % of the universe is unknown to us
" @entity0 : @entity2 drops @entity102 @entity103 , a self - taught scientist from @entity104 , @entity105 , talked about the direct impact that science can have , not just on society at large , but on an individual community
from reading a library book , @entity103 , the son of a farmer and one of seven kids , learned how to build a wind mill , which powers his family 's house and pumps water in an impoverished area
he taught his neighbors how to build wind mills , too , which have transformed schools and improved conditions in the village
if his poignant story was n't enough to spur the young scientists in the room and those watching the live stream of the event online , then that of @entity132 , a 15 - year - old dynamo from @entity133 , @entity134 , most likely did
she began programming computers at age 5 , enrolled in community college at 12 , and last year was recognized for her skills by the @entity140
one of @entity132 's experiments , using artificial intelligence to route robots and assist nurses in a local @entity146 hospital , serves as the model project on the @entity24 site
@entity0 : more technology coverage the goal of the @entity24 is n't just to give great prizes , including a trip to the @entity153 and $ 110,000 in scholarships
it 's to foster more interest in science worldwide and to come up with much - needed solutions to local and global problems -- if not now , then eventually
" we want kids to make a difference in the world , " says @entity6
" they can be agents of change
" the deadline for submissions is april 4
in july , 15 finalists will attend the awards ceremony at @entity2 headquarters in @entity171 , @entity172
