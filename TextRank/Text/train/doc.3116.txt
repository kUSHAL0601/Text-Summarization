the finger - pointing began almost immediately -- and with good reason
a mere few inches of snow had shut down @entity4 , forcing children to spend the night at schools , stranding drivers on interstates and making the city a laughingstock to the country
why did this happen ? who 's to blame ? and , more importantly , could this happen elsewhere ? perhaps
unlike @entity18 and @entity19 , with their long - established infrastructures and diverse mass transit systems , @entity15 resembles the new @entity21 city
it 's not just a city but also a region ; a metro area that claims its outlying suburbs as its own -- as do @entity27 and @entity28 and @entity29
it spans 28 counties sprawled over an area the size of @entity34
on tuesday , a rare weather phenomenon mixed with poor planning and an overdependence on cars conspired to create a perfect storm
what can other cities learn from @entity4 's debacle ? let 's comb through the claims and realities : ugly remnants after storm clobbers @entity47 @entity48 : this fiasco could have been avoided if @entity15 had a mass transit system like @entity18 's or @entity51 's both @entity4 mayor @entity52 and @entity54 gov. @entity53 put much of the blame on the fact that everyone -- government , businesses and schools -- all tried to go home at the same time , clogging highways for hours
" i said immediately yesterday that releasing all of these folks was not the right way to go , " @entity52 said wednesday
" if i had my druthers , we would have staggered the closures
" reality : yes , it could have but the problem highlights how @entity15 and cities like it depend almost exclusively on cars
@entity15 does have a commuter train system , but it does n't serve the whole metro area
while the city has a workday population of 1 million , the metro area 's population is 6 million
and when offices and schools let out tuesday , the masses got into their cars to head to the suburbs
an expansive public transportation system would have undoubtedly alleviated some of the ensuing traffic stress
this week 's debacle is also disturbing because if another catastrophe were to hit and roads were the only path out , @entity15 would be in the same situation again
while a recent poll shows that many in the metro @entity4 area support expanded mass transit , the city has n't figured out a way to pay for it
a transportation tax proposal recently failed , with some saying it would have spent too much money on roads instead of light rail
was @entity4 asleep at the wheel ? @entity48 : @entity4 needs a city government more like @entity19 's former lt. gen. @entity106 , who coordinated relief efforts along the @entity108 after @entity105 , said things would have gone more smoothly this week if @entity4 's city government was more like @entity19 's
" they need to have in @entity4 the same type of government you have in @entity19 , where the mayor controls the city and everything around that city , and the mayor can make decisions on road closures ; he has emergency powers as when schools close , " he said
the schools and the government should have been closed tuesday , he said
reality : the metro area has many leaders @entity4 comprises 140 cities and towns -- most of which have their own leaders making their own decisions
and even within the city of @entity4 , @entity52 does n't call all the shots , like @entity19 's mayor
@entity52 said he does n't have the ultimate say on some issues
for example , @entity138 was responsible for deciding when to send students home
and the state is responsible for clearing interstate freeways
but the mayor also said he would have done some things differently
" we made a mistake by not staggering when people should leave , so i will take responsibility for that -- in lessons learned , " @entity52 said wednesday
" if we had to do it again , we would have said , ' schools , you go first , private sector , you go second , and government goes last
' and so i think that would have helped
" @entity158 - stranded children @entity48 : this was an " unexpected storm , " and @entity15 did n't play it safe like @entity161 did as thousands of @entity4 commuters sat motionless on interstates tuesday night into wednesday , @entity54 's governor said the path of the storm caught officials off guard
" we have been confronted with an unexpected storm that has hit the metropolitan @entity4 area , " @entity53 told reporters late tuesday night
he said as of 10 a.m. et on tuesday , " it was still , in most of the forecasts , anticipated that the city of @entity4 would only have a mild dusting or a very small accumulation , if any , and that the majority of the effects of the storm would be south of here
preparations were made for those predictions
" reality : no it was n't , and @entity4 should have the @entity186 put the entire @entity4 metro area under a winter storm warning at 3:38 a.m. tuesday
the agency warned of 1 to 2 inches of snow accumulation and said it would begin " as early as mid-morning and last into tonight
" @entity192 meteorologist @entity191 said @entity4 had plenty of warning
@entity191 himself had predicted that up to 2 inches of snow would fall
in reality , just over 2 inches of snow landed in @entity4
while that 's nothing for most @entity200 cities , it can be a huge burden for @entity203 cities not accustomed to it
contrast @entity15 's response to @entity161 '
it , too , was hit with snow and ice this week , but it decided to play it safe by closing certain roads
to be sure , @entity161 responded slowly to the disastrous @entity105
but it 's learned to heed warnings
@entity54 's governor said he 's also learned from this week
" we all have some lessons we need to learn here from this , " @entity53 said
" and i think we all will
" opinion : stranded in @entity4 @entity48 : @entity15 did n't pre-treat roads the way @entity218 ( and many other @entity200 cities ) do it was a common refrain from drivers who sat more than 10 hours on @entity4 roads : where are the salting trucks ? @entity225 spent half a day in her car before she gave up , got out and carried her son 2 miles to a stranger 's house , where they spent the night
during those 12 hours , she did n't see a single salting truck or snowplow
" it was disheartening , " @entity225 said
" i felt like everyone knew this was coming
" she said the amount of snow " was not that horrible
" but " @entity4 was not prepared for it
" reality : @entity15 is n't entirely responsible , and the city does n't have the capacity while many pointed their fingers at the mayor , @entity4 's only responsible for surface streets in the city
it 's actually the state that 's responsible for maintaining interstates , where much of the gridlock occurred
the @entity249 commissioner said crews had been deployed farther south , but then scrambled closer to @entity4 as the storm got under way
but the traffic already choking the roads also blocked salt and sand trucks and snowplows
@entity191 , who is originally from @entity218 , @entity19 , said streets there are salted well in advance of a coming storm
but @entity4 does n't have the capacity for that kind of treatment
" we simply have never purchased the amount of equipment necessary , " he said
" why would you in a city that gets one snow event every three years ? why would you buy 500 snowplows and salt trucks and have them sit around for 1,000 days , waiting for the next event ? " stranded drivers tell their stories
