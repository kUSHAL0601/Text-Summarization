@entity0 -- psst ! here 's a truth : politicians lie
they lie about their personal lives like @entity5 did
shall we go on ? they lie about policy too
@entity14 's top spy , director of national intelligence @entity15 had to issue a statement explaining why he testified before @entity18 that the @entity14 government is not gathering dossiers on @entity14 citizens when it 's now clear that the @entity14 government is gathering all their @entity24 and phone data
when some @entity29 pledge to repeal @entity30 , it might be what the voters back home want to hear
but the lawmakers know it 's not going to happen
@entity36 says @entity37 will keep trying to stop @entity30 they change their policies between fundraising , campaigning , and governing
president @entity42 opposed a mandate that people get health insurance when he ran for president
but that did n't stop him from signing one into law
was that a lie ? @entity15 , @entity14 's top spy , found himself admitting to giving " erroneous " information to @entity18
he had testified at a @entity53 committee that the government was not collecting vast amounts of data from most @entity14
" no sir , " @entity15 said
after @entity57 leaked @entity59 secrets , @entity15 was forced to write a letter to the @entity61 and apologize
" i have thought long and hard to recreate what went through my mind at the time , " he said , adding that , " my response was clearly erroneous -- for which i apologize , " @entity15 said
so maybe @entity6 told the truth about lying when he said on @entity69 recently , explaining why it 's ok for him to run for office again after his 2011 prostitution scandal , " i think we all know that politicians dissemble all the time about negotiations , on substantive issues and probably on personal issues as well
" a lot of baseball players have been in the news recently for lying , too
in @entity87 , already coming to grips with the two cads running for citywide office , @entity83 's relationship with the truth is about as tenuous as his relationship with the @entity89
he had said he did n't take performance enhancing drugs ( @entity91 is what they 're calling them these days )
the @entity96 ' @entity95 got suspended by @entity97 for the rest of the season
he 's now admitted to taking performance - enhancing drugs
that means he lied when he stood in front of tv cameras in 2012 and said , " i 'd bet my life " @entity104 did n't enter his body
and @entity95 's life is n't over
he 'll be eligible to play again next year
let 's be clear , just about everyone lies , according to the experts
and a little lying is ok
opinion : will ' sexting ' city give @entity5 a pass ? " the ones who never lie are probably the people we do n't want to be around very much , " said @entity117 , dean of the @entity118 at the @entity119 , @entity120
" they tell us we 're putting on weight or do n't look very good that day
" " society socializes us to be deceptive and to tell people the kinds of things they want to hear , " he said , adding that most people get away with most of their little lies
but little lies can beget big lies
and when someone gets away with lying enough and they can justify it to themselves , that 's when you end up with bald - faced lies like @entity9 saying the love child was n't his
or @entity95 swearing on his life that he had n't taken the drugs
" so most of the time we get away with our lies , " said @entity117
" we 're not questioned and it 's fairly easy to be deceptive
a lot of what we see from people who come out with these egregious kinds of lies is they have experience with getting away with being deceptive so they do n't think about the consequences
" dr. @entity159 , a psychology professor at @entity160 in @entity161 , has studied what entices people to lie
in one experiment , participants were given a dollar each time they hit a number on a die
he found they were more likely to lie the more chances they got
" it is easier to shuffle the facts than to invent new facts , " he said
why we act on stupid impulses perhaps @entity176 justified lying about his own long - term use of performance - enhancing drugs because he was feeding his own inspirational narrative as a cancer survivor , @entity159 said
of course , @entity176 was also enriching himself
@entity159 did n't want to offer an opinion on @entity5 or @entity95 , but @entity117 said voters should beware
" in one sense , society seems to be encouraging people to lie
and then they do this calculus that it 's not going to be that bad , " he said , referring to @entity8 , who weathered his lie about having sexual relations with @entity188 and today is a respected elder statesman
" if you elect these guys and you expect them to be honest , you 're deluding yourself because they have a history of deception , " said @entity117
" the best predictor of future behavior is what they 've done in the past
if @entity5 wins this election , the message is that you can do virtually anything and get away with it , multiple times
