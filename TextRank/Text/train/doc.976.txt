it is safe to go back into the water again -- at least in @entity2
a warning over the weekend for male swimmers off the coast of @entity6 and @entity7 to protect their private parts because of a testicle - munching fish appears to have been a joke that got out of hand
after a @entity6 fisherman caught a @entity16 pacu among his eels and perch this month , a professor at the @entity13 told men to be careful because the fish sometimes mistake male reproductive organs for tree nuts , one of their favorite foods
" anyone choosing to bathe in the @entity30 these days had best keep their swimsuits well tied , " professor @entity25 said in a saturday news release about the fish discovery in the strait separating @entity6 and @entity7
wednesday , however , @entity25 said he was just joking and never meant for his warning to get so much publicity
" we did say that we recommend men to keep their swimsuits tied up until we know if there are more pacus out there in our waters , " @entity25 told @entity35 by e-mail
" of course , this is half a joke since it is very unlikely that you would actually meet one here and that it would bite you
it 's up to people themselves how careful they want to be
i 'll keep my shorts on , though
" finding a pacu , a close relative of the piranha normally found in @entity16 , is unusual so far north
@entity25 said it was likely dumped in the strait by an amateur aquarium owner or fish farmer
@entity61 , a piranha researcher at the @entity62 who is also curator of fishes at the school 's @entity64 , poured water on the pacu warning
for one thing , he said , pacus are vegetarian -- and there 's no record of them attacking a human
" they 're fruit eaters
those big crushing teeth they have is for crushing seeds , " he said
pacus tend to swim under fruiting trees during high water , waiting for the trees to drop their fruit , seeds and nuts , @entity61 said
the fish then swim to the surface to eat the tasty morsels
in fact , @entity61 said , that 's how fishermen catch them : by putting a piece of fruit on the end of a line and letting it float in the water
pacus swim up to grab it and then get caught
" the nuts that they 're eating , the fruits that they 're eating , are splashing down from above , and humans do n't act like that when they 're swimming , " @entity61 said
and unlike piranhas , which have rigid , razor - sharp interlocking teeth , pacus have teeth that resemble human molars and fit together in a similar bite , @entity61 said
the pacus use those teeth to crush their food , not to rip it apart -- or off
he speculated that the pacu found in @entity6 was probably released shortly before it was found because pacu species ca n't survive in either saltwater or chilly temperatures
" it 's just too cold for pacus to be living there
they certainly would n't make it through the winter , " or even past october , he said
@entity35 was among numerous news outlets around the world that reported the @entity6 news release over the weekend , focusing on the special warning for male swimmers
@entity25 said he only meant to publicize the surprise discovery of a pacu in the @entity130 and to advise the public that the fish can be invasive and possibly dangerous
" the story about the ' nuts ' was never meant to be the headline
but it certainly got people 's attention , " @entity25 told @entity35
" i 'm sorry if it has caused you any trouble
it was a bit of a joke , but i still will keep my swimsuits tied up , and i will never swim in an aquarium with these fishes
