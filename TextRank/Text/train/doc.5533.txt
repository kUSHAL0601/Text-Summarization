-- @entity2 champions @entity1 have made preparations in court for the club to go into administration as they wait to discover if they will be forced the pay the @entity8 government over $ 78 million in tax
the @entity11 - based club , who have been champions of @entity13 54 times , confirmed they had filed documents at the @entity16 in @entity17 , which gives them ten days to appoint an administrator
@entity1 , who form one half of the famous ' @entity23 ' rivalry with city neighbors @entity25 , are awaiting the outcome of a tribunal which will rule whether they owe @entity28 ( @entity28 ) more than Â £ 50 million ( $ 78m ) in tax
the club 's chairman , @entity30 said there was " no realistic or practical alternative " to @entity1 ' decision and said he was committed to ensuring their long - term future
if the club were to go into administration they would be docked ten points by the @entity41 , which would see them remain second but fall 14 points behind leaders @entity25
in a statement on the club 's website @entity44 said it was clear since his takeover in may 2011 that " the club was facing massive financial challenges both in terms of its ongoing financial structure and performance and the potential consequences of the @entity28 first tier tax tribunal
" he added : " i have taken the decision that the most practical way to safeguard the long - term future of the club is to go through a formal restructuring process
it may still be possible to avert this but that is not the most likely way forward
" what is of paramount importance is the long - term security , survival and prosperity of this great football club
" the case against @entity1 centers around the use of employee benefits trusts ( @entity76 ) which the club previously used to pay their players
@entity28 insist the club used the method as a way to avoid paying tax and @entity44 said @entity1 must prepare for the worst
he added : " there is no realistic or practical alternative to our approach because @entity28 has made it plain to the club that should we be successful in the forthcoming tax tribunal decision they will appeal the decision
" this would leave the club facing years of uncertainty and also having to pay immediately a range of liabilities to @entity28 which will be due whatever the overall result of the tax tribunal
" in blunt terms , if we waited until the outcome of the tax tribunal , the risk of @entity1 being faced with an unacceptable financial burden and years of uncertainty is too great
