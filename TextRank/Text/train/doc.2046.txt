-- " i only ever really wanted a break / i 've been away for too long , " @entity0 sings on the new @entity2 album , " @entity3 , " out november 13
it 's the band 's first all - new album since 1996 's " @entity10 " and its breakup in 1997 , so the lyric feels more like a status report
" is it a statement ? " @entity0 asked with a laugh
" or is it more of a coincidence ? probably more of a coincidence
but it does seem obvious , does n't it ? " although @entity19 imploded with @entity21 's death in 1994 and @entity22 kept trucking through the 2000s -- celebrating its 20th anniversary last year -- @entity2 predates both grunge pioneers , even though the band found mainstream popularity only in those bands ' wake , hitting a commercial peak in 1994 with the album " @entity33
" " we formed in 1984 , eight years before the world knew what @entity36 was , " @entity0 said
" i 'm just waiting for the @entity38 to call up and say , ' here 's your induction
' we can do it for the 30th anniversary , i suppose
" @entity2 's breakup was n't anything unusual , @entity0 said
no one died ; no one stole someone 's wife
" no one lost an arm , " he said
" it was just time for a break
" now , after he 's explored a different avenue of music with his three solo albums , some @entity59 reunions and @entity60 , the revamped @entity2 has a new focus , aided by @entity0 's sobriety
( he went into rehab after @entity60 's first tour
) reminded of a @entity67 party where he was spotted double - fisting champagne bottles , the singer laughed
i needed more than one
" there is one lyrical reference to @entity2 's time away from the rock arena , but you wo n't find any other explicit mentions of the band 's breakup or of bygone fame on " @entity3 , " which @entity0 said would be " inappropriate
" " if this were an @entity81 record , he would rap about what it all means , what he thinks about the last record , what he 's doing now , and we do n't do that , " @entity0 said
" that 's a different culture , to talk about you and then you talk about you some more and then when you 're done , how you 're selling so many records
i get that , but it 's a little strange
" even though the rock world has changed since the ' 90s , @entity0 says nothing has changed for @entity2 during the band 's time away , which ended in 2010 with some studio sessions , a compilation album ( " @entity101 " ) and , most recently , a song on " @entity103 " soundtrack ( " @entity105 " )
" i guess if anything , we 've reverted back to the way we operated as an indie band , " @entity0 said
" we acted like free agents
and we can do that now , like we did then , because the music business has changed so much
" lamenting the loss of importance of music videos and rock radio play , @entity0 acknowledged that it would n't be quite so easy for a new band to just put out an album and expect any fanfare
then again , when @entity2 started out as an indie band -- before becoming the first grunge group to sign to a major label , one year before @entity19 did -- success was based on " touring in a van and playing little clubs all over the @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , again and again
" ( it 's a fact that may be acknowledged on the track " @entity132 " : " you can walk a million miles and get nowhere
" ) " it would n't be the same environment if we were just starting out now , " @entity0 said
" we 're an established , well - known band and pioneers of a benchmark cultural shift in rock and pop music , so we have that ( in our favor )
but all the differences with video play and rock radio networks shrinking keeps you honest , and in a sense , it 's healthier and better for fans
" more than ever , @entity0 said , @entity2 wanted to make an album that was consistent with the aesthetic values he developed from listening to bands as a teenager
" when i was 16 years old and somebody i trusted recommended an album , i would have to go and find it , " he recalled
" and oftentimes , those albums were n't easy to find
you might search for a year for it , and then you might have to save up to buy it
and then , if i took it home and did n't love it on the first listen , i would listen to it again and again , because i wanted to like it
i put considerable energy into it
" likewise , " @entity3 " can mean different things to different people on subsequent listens
" it becomes your projection , " @entity0 said
" your life is an opera , and this can be the soundtrack of your life
" listen to " @entity3 " after @entity175 in @entity176 , for instance , and someone might sense a storm raging in @entity0 's wailings and the band 's arrangements and complicated time signatures , how the mood darkens and saddens as each song progresses , drawing the listener deeper into tracks such as " @entity188 , " the ode to nature " @entity191 , " the water - logged " rowing " and the comfort - seeking " @entity194 " ( " i was thirsty , and you gave me water / i was crying , i remember you gave me your shoulder " )
@entity0 offers minimal explanation for these songs , because he wants fans to come up with their own meanings
" if i write a song and put it out there , it 's not mine anymore , " he said
" it takes on a life of its own , and when you listen to it , it becomes your song
and over the course of generations , those meanings will change
i might have created it , but i have no control over how it evolves
but without being able to define what each fan wants , we have to look at it as , do we like this ? we have to please each other , because if we like it , @entity2 fans will love it
and i think the hardcore fans are going to feel like we brought it
i 'm more confident of that now than with any other album
