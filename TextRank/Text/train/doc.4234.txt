-- while airports across the southeastern @entity2 continued to dig out from tuesday 's snowstorm , wednesday turned into a long day of cancellations and delays for frustrated travelers
airlines had canceled more than 2,200 @entity2 flights by wednesday at 5 p.m. et according to flight tracking site @entity10
that follows about 3,200 flight cancellations on tuesday
the airport most affected was @entity14 , the world 's busiest , with more than 1,000 flights canceled , according to @entity10
@entity17 , which is based in @entity14 , was affected most
" this spate of winter weather has hit a lot of airports that usually do n't face winter weather and are less prepared for it , " @entity18 , @entity10 's vice president of operations , said via e-mail
" when every flight needs de-icing , ( those airports ) see a massive slowdown in departures , and the airlines pre-emptively cancel flights
" many airports struggled all day to return to normal operations
flights arriving in @entity14 were facing delays of more than five hours as of 5 p.m. et , according to the @entity37
that 's because @entity17 requested a ground stop , driven by the weather and airport access difficulty , which was later converted into a ground delay program , spokesman @entity38 said via e-mail
" this means that flights bound to @entity14 from other airports are seeing delays
" check fly.faa.gov for the most current information on delays
with more than 900 @entity14 flights canceled tuesday , some passengers intending to depart @entity14 stayed at the airport overnight , airport spokesman @entity51 said
on wednesday by 5 p.m. et , airlines had canceled more than 1,000 flights departing from or arriving at the @entity14 airport , according to @entity10
@entity17 reported about 1,200 cancellations systemwide by 3:30 p.m. on wednesday , on top of 1,200 tuesday cancellations , said @entity17 's @entity38
and the airline is still facing challenges getting employees to work at its @entity14 hub , he said
" last night , we did allow airport employees to sleep aboard aircraft parked at gates and we flew an extra section ( unscheduled flight ) full of pilots and flight attendants to @entity74 so they could be afforded rest in hotel rooms , " @entity38 said via e-mail
" this group was scheduled to have hotel stays near @entity14 as part of their regularly scheduled trips
" @entity83 's @entity82 shut down flight operations tuesday afternoon as the snowfall began , and " crews worked overnight and continue to work this morning to clear the ( two ) runways , " wrote airport spokeswoman @entity88
one runway had reopened by midday wednesday
@entity90 and @entity91 canceled more than 300 of 3,600 scheduled flights wednesday
the combined airline canceled nearly 400 flights tuesday
" our people in @entity14 , in particular , are facing a challenging day , " said @entity90 spokesman @entity95 via e-mail wednesday morning
" what you 're seeing there in @entity14 is a continuing operation but an extremely slow operation , resulting in just a few departures every hour
" @entity105 , which merged with @entity2 but still operates separate flights , canceled more than 200 flights wednesday , on top of 300 cancellations tuesday , said spokesman @entity110
while the @entity112 , @entity113 , airport reported no major delays in arrivals or departures wednesday , with all runways free of ice and snow , @entity105 was still hit hard
" our employees are working hard to get operations back to normal in @entity112 , " @entity110 said via e-mail
" we hope to return to normal operations by tomorrow
" @entity0 's @entity124 reported from @entity125 , @entity126 .
