-- as you are standing in an airport security line this @entity3 week , waiting to be funneled into one of the invasive new body - imaging machines , or , if you decline that , to be pulled aside and subjected to a way - too - personal pat - down , ask yourself how you would feel if you lived in a country like this : you can walk into any airport , with or without a ticket , and wander unimpeded right up to a boarding gate
you do n't have to surreptitiously slip past a security checkpoint , because there are no security checkpoints
if you do n't have a driver 's license or a photo id card with you , that does n't matter ; no one will request to see one
if you are carrying a loaded gun in your pocket or underneath your jacket , no one will know
in fact , if you do have a valid ticket , there will be nothing to prevent you from boarding a flight while armed to the teeth with concealed weaponry
the atmosphere at the airport is as free - and - easy as in a public park
the official assumption is that the people around you pose no threat ; from the moment you walk through the front doors of the airport until the moment you step onto the plane , not a soul will stop you or ask you a question
would you feel safe ? would you want to live in such a country ? you did , if you were a citizen of the @entity45 before the 1970s
opinion : scanners , patdowns violate law and , in retrospect , the surprising thing is not that airport security measures have become so intrusive and dehumanizing
the surprising thing is that , for all the years of @entity45 commercial aviation prior to the ' 70s , an implicit trust prevailed
for all those years , the strangers around you in an airport or on an airplane were presumed to bear no ill will toward their fellow passengers , to represent no potential danger
it was a series of hijackings that put the checkpoints and the first rudimentary metal detectors in @entity45 airports ; they have been there for so long now that it seems like a gauzy illusion to recall the time when travel was predicated on good faith
ever since september 11 , 2001 , airline security has escalated with each new terror attempt
no one has had to ask why
the @entity75 seems to have been caught off guard by the genuine anger on the part of passengers in recent days
@entity45 have acquiesced for so long to just about anything the government has asked them to accept in the name of national security that the @entity75 may have thought that of course , if safety was at stake , the public would always willingly go along
but the body - imaging machines that see through clothing , paired with the humiliating new pat - downs , have , perhaps for the first time since 2001 , made people begin to ask the question : how much is too much ? when is the line crossed -- when , even with the best intentions of security officials , does @entity45 stop feeling like @entity45 ? they are questions with no satisfactory answers , because no one believes that the @entity75 has instituted the new measures on a whim ; the @entity75 's job is to keep flying as safe as humanly and technologically possible
and if security measures at airports were to be significantly reduced -- if , because of an outcry by passengers , the government were to reluctantly remove some of the screening procedures that it feels are necessary -- would people feel confident getting onto planes ? @entity113 : security procedures are necessary it 's a mess , and there 's no need to point a finger at either the @entity75 or the passengers who feel that the new methods violate their dignity and their very sense of what it means to be a free citizen
neither side is at fault here ; it 's always easier to place blame , but in this instance it is hard to make the case that either side is being irrational
the saddest thing is that it is , indeed , becoming a controversy in which those with opposing viewpoints are characterized as being on different sides
yet if we step back for a second , we realize that the two sides are the government entity whose job is to keep @entity45 safe , and those very @entity45 who wish for safety for themselves and for their families
two sides that , under most circumstances , would be on the same side
but these are not most circumstances , and have not been for many years
there have been calls for mass refusals in @entity45 airports on the heavy travel day before @entity3 -- suggestions that passengers declare that they will not enter the body - imaging machines
if that happens , there could be chaos , and the most melancholy scene of all : nine years after the terror attacks on the @entity45 , the sight of @entity45 travelers facing off against their fellow @entity45 who have been assigned to keep them free from harm
more opinion on topics in the news many times each day , in airports across the nation , people can be heard saying to others who are setting off on journeys of their own : " where are you going ? " this year , in the airports that not so long ago in @entity45 history were open and unfettered , we might ask ourselves a different question : how did we get here ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .
