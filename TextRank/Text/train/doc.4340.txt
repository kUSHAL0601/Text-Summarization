-- it 's tight at the top after day two of the @entity3 at @entity4 , @entity5 , with overnight pace - setter @entity6 tied for the lead at 10 - under - par with @entity9 's @entity8
the @entity10 scored eight birdies and an eagle on thursday to card a course record 62 but a level - par round on a soggy friday allowed @entity8 to draw level atop the leaderboard
it could have been worse for @entity6 , who dropped two shots on the front nine as the rain lashed down before recovering with two birdies on 15 and 18
" those were tough conditions for everybody out there today , " the 43 year old @entity10 told @entity22 website upon returning to the clubhouse
" especially on the front nine it was extremely difficult to get into a rhythm
" we played those first four holes in i do n't know how long , and we had a couple of rulings in front of us
it was just impossible to find a good rhythm and @entity37 ( @entity38 ) left us with a back injury after five holes , so we got caught in a two - ball
" it just seems like all day we were waiting and waiting for a long time on a lot of these shots
it was a tough ask today so i was pretty pleased with the way i finished the round
" world number 142 @entity8 took advantage of @entity6 's difficulties with a 2 - under - par round of 70 to draw level with the @entity10
" i was good out there today , " @entity8 told reporters upon completing his round , " i was mentally there and really enjoyed it
" " it was tough for the front nine with the rain and stuff but it was a nice back nine and i managed to take advantage of it
" the lowest round of the day was a five - under - par carded by @entity65 , moving the @entity5 into a tie for third place with @entity69 's @entity68
the @entity5 told reporters he planned to treat himself to a friday night curry to celebrate drawing himself back into contention
another man pleased with his second round showing after a tough week was world no. 10 , @entity76
the northern @entity78 split from his fiance , tennis star @entity79 , earlier in the week , but registered a one - under par round after recovering from an awful 38 - shot ( three - over - par ) front nine to join @entity82 's @entity81 and @entity84 's @entity83 in a tie for fifth at five - under - par. @entity81 could replace @entity86 atop the world rankings this weekend this if he scores a significantly higher finish at @entity4 than @entity86 does at the @entity88 at the @entity89 in @entity90
@entity86 battled back from a poor opening round and nervy front nine on day two to make the colonial cut at one - under - par. the @entity97 is six shots behind leader @entity99 , however , who leads the way on seven - under - par. @entity101 and @entity102 are a shot behind @entity99 in a tie for second going into the weekend while @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 are all tied for fourth on five - under - par.
