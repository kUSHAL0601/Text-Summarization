-- a @entity2 judge on monday denied @entity4 's request for a postponement of a probate court trial over the proposed $ 2 billion sale of the @entity8 by the @entity4 family trust
the trial is scheduled to start july 7 and last four days
@entity11 agreed may 29 to sell the @entity13 franchise to billionaire @entity14 for what would be an @entity13 record price
but @entity4 , the @entity8 ' other co-owner , does n't want to sell the team he bought in 1981
he refused to sign on to terms of the deal
the trial will focus on @entity11 's right to sell the @entity8 and not @entity4 's mental capacity , lawyers for each side said monday
at issue will be whether the procedures for removing one of the trust 's owners were followed
@entity11 hired a neurologist and a specialist in geriatric psychiatry who separately examined her husband and judged him to be mentally incapacitated
@entity4 's attorney @entity34 maintains that the mental examinations he was given were under " undue influence " and " there was fraud " on @entity11 's behalf
@entity4 , 80 , has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend @entity43 was posted online in late april
the recording included a series of racist comments
@entity4 's comments , first posted on @entity48 , sparked outrage among @entity13 players , executives and fans
@entity13 commissioner @entity53 fined @entity4 $ 2.5 million and banned him for life from the @entity13
the @entity13 's board of governors , representatives from each of the 30 ownership groups , is scheduled to meet july 15 and could approve a sale then if the legal aspects of the deal are sorted out
in order for the team to be sold , either @entity4 would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree @entity11 acted legally in selling the team
new doctor declares @entity8 owner @entity4 mentally fit @entity4 accused of threatening to ' take out ' wife 's lawyer @entity0 's @entity71 contributed to this report .
