@entity2 president @entity1 should heed @entity4 warnings to neither use nor move chemical or biological weapons , lest he risk crossing a " red line " and provoke a @entity4 military response , president @entity0 said monday
" we can not have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people , " @entity0 told reporters at the @entity11
" we have been very clear to the @entity1 regime -- but also to other players on the ground -- that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized
" that would change my calculus ; that would change my equation
" @entity0 added that @entity4 officials are monitoring the situation " very carefully " and have put together a number of contingency plans
@entity31 support for @entity2 rebels shaped by tribal , religious ties " we have communicated in no uncertain terms with every player in the region that that 's a red line for us and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons
" @entity0 's remarks appeared to ratchet up his stance on the matter
last month , talking about @entity2 forces , he told a @entity49 convention , " they will be held accountable by the international community and the @entity4 should they make the tragic mistake of using those weapons
" the @entity2 regime " probably has the largest and most advanced chemical warfare program in the @entity62 world , " @entity55 , director of the military and security studies program at the @entity58 , told @entity59 last month
it includes " thousands of tube and rocket artillery rounds filled with mustard - type blister agents , thousands of bombs filled with the nerve agents sarin and possibly @entity71 , and binary - type and cluster @entity73 warheads filled with nerve agents for all its major missile systems
" its @entity73 infrastructure is believed to include several production facilities and numerous storage sites , mostly dispersed throughout the western half of the country , " @entity55 said
@entity2 is thought to have a biological warfare research and development program , but is not known to have offensive biological warfare agents , @entity55 said
the nation is not a party to the @entity88
that 's the body of the @entity90 dedicated to eliminating the weapons
@entity93 president @entity92 has said his country too is preparing contingency plans to attack @entity2 's chemical weapons arsenal if @entity93 is directly threatened
in september 2007 , @entity93 jets bombed a building in @entity2 that the @entity100 nuclear agency eventually concluded was " very likely a nuclear reactor
" @entity0 's warning on monday came as @entity103 in @entity2 celebrated the second of three days of feasting to honor the end of the holy month of @entity106 , with the holiday 's message of amity and tolerance contrasting sharply with reality
@entity100 observer mission in @entity2 ends , violence continues at least 150 people were killed monday , including two children and their mother in @entity118 , the opposition @entity114 said

others showed victims with bruised flesh and dark red splotches on their clothes
@entity59 can not authenticate the video
another video , said to have been shot sunday in the town of @entity153 , north of @entity154 , showed children being pushed on swings
the swings are attached to the gun of a tank on which adults are standing , chanting , " victory for the rebels ! " in a third video , showing the same tank , a man says to the camera , " we will enter @entity154 with this tank and liberate all of @entity2 , @entity168 willing ! " @entity118 province , where the conflict began in march 2011 as peaceful anti-government demonstrations , has suffered heightened violence in recent days
it is also the home province of vice president @entity175 , who rebels say has defected from the regime
on sunday , the charred bodies of 20 people were discovered in the @entity118 city of @entity181 , and 31 other people were killed in the province , the @entity114 said
government forces executed 14 people in @entity118 hours after they were detained , the opposition network said
@entity181 took another beating monday , when mortars and rockets rained down on the city , the @entity114 said
inside @entity2 : nobody imagined it would turn into this since the @entity2 crisis began 17 months ago , more than 20,000 people -- most of them civilians -- have been killed , opposition activists say
