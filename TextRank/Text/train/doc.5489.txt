a great football team combines inherent violence with a certain order , always imposed by the coaches and team leaders
famed @entity6 coach @entity5 allowed very little humor and made it abundantly clear that there would be no racism in his organization
regardless of intent , any racist remark by a player was deemed malicious and resulted in instant dismissal from the team
the culture was established at the top
leaders like @entity20 were the enforcers in the locker room , along with @entity5 's " @entity23 , " a group of hand - picked players who communicated directly with him
the @entity26 would have done well to take a page from @entity5
on wednesday , the @entity26 fired offensive line coach @entity28 and head athletic trainer @entity29
it was the latest flareup in an ongoing , ugly controversy over bullying , leadership and @entity35 locker - room realities , one that has some of the characteristics of a wildfire : the slightest breeze ignites it for a fresh run over highly flammable terrain
and now the heat has reached the top floor : the firings apparently came at the behest of team owner @entity46 , who , news reports said , conducted his own investigation into the treatment of @entity50 by fellow player @entity51 and others -- and the role their teammates , coaches and front office have played in the @entity26 ' locker room culture
that 's significant , since owners normally leave such issues to coaches
the @entity26 melodrama is a sad story of too much smart - ass talk and not enough supervision
the team 's leadership should have laid down specific guidelines regarding acceptable discussion of race and gender preference and about outright harassment
this was clear from the beginning
the team has suffered , and from the trainer to the owner , everyone -- literally everyone -- is affected
it should have never gotten this far
whether @entity46 ' firm action this week is sufficient to restore order to the @entity26 is open to question , since players have weighed in on both sides
someone should have shut the guys ' mouths on day one
normally , that would come from within the team and coaches
i have a long view on this culture
last fall marked the first season in 58 years that i was not employed full - time in a football job
fourteen of those years were spent in the @entity35 -- 10 as a player ( including with @entity5 's @entity6 ) -- and i wake up each morning with painful reminders
they seem a small price to pay for having competed in the greatest team sport ever devised
with all the sometimes absurd chatter over the @entity26 ' story , it must be difficult for thinking people to know or understand how the team 's situation could have developed
maybe i can add perspective -- to explain , if not to completely excuse
football is the only sport in which every player needs every teammate on every play just to survive
simply put , everybody matters
football locker rooms are loaded with alpha males , and daily conflicts are inevitable
my sensitive , scholarly friend , writer @entity117 , joined us with the @entity119 when we were @entity120 champions and actually played four plays against @entity122 in @entity123 before 104,000 fans
as we left the field , he turned to me and said , " that is the most disgusting experience in my life ! you guys are deranged ! i have never felt such palpable hatred in my life ! " i said " that was not hatred ; it was intensity
we are competitors ! " he was inconsolable , and our argument continued until he decided we should do a book about the subject ( " one more july " )
here are the fundamental and immutable truths that escape many media analysts and others : when you watch an @entity35 game , you are observing angry young men smashing each other with all their might on every snap of the ball
and each generation of players is bigger , faster and stronger than the one before
@entity150 is not a contact sport
it is a collision sport
that is the essence -- indeed , the whole point -- of the game
college football is a petting zoo
the @entity35 is a jungle
when players cross the white lines in the @entity35 , they take on the persona of the gladiator
the intent is to destroy the opponent 's will , to dominate him , to beat him into submission
there are no nice guys on game day
some players can exit the field and resume life as decent human beings : kind , reverent and socially aware
their unresolved anger issues are too dominant and manifest in often dangerous ways
for these players and former players , there is no equivalent in civilian life to the catharsis of two hours a day of physical combat
the only people who understand a specific locker room are those who lived or live there
when i moved to @entity190 's team in @entity191 , for example , i was surprised to learn that there was much more laughter than in my previous locker room
the team motto was " if you ca n't take a joke , bleep you ! " only we did n't say " bleep
" everyone was fair game , especially superstars like @entity203
the great @entity204 literally stripped his britches off down to jock once , in the middle of practice with several hundred spectators , because @entity209 had planted a cicada in his pants
everyone laughed , including @entity204
@entity212 smiled but quickly restored order , reminding us that we had better execute if we wanted the fun to continue
if practice deteriorated , @entity212 stuck that jaw out , and our safety valve , @entity219 , would say , " cut the crap
" i really feel that @entity212 's phenomenal record was due in part to his ability to allow for some nonsense from time to time and because we had people like @entity228 , who became his surrogates in the huddle
there was only one @entity5 , and there is a reason the @entity120 trophy bears his name
there will never be another @entity212
every organization must have its own ethos and standards that are hammered into the men 's consciousness every day as the team 's complex mix changes with waivers , injuries and trades
players often feel that they are fighting for their lives
there must be constant reminders of the focus
when the team wins , everybody benefits
individual players with differences should be expected to take care of business in private or on the field -- like the men they claim to be .
