-- @entity2 founder @entity1 is trying to avoid extradition from @entity4 to @entity5 over allegations of rape and other sex crimes by seeking asylum at the embassy of @entity11 in @entity12
@entity1 's move is dramatic , but he 's not the first person to seek an escape route through a diplomatic mission
here are some key precedents
@entity19 in @entity20 , 2012
the self - taught lawyer and activist escaped house arrest one night in april and fled to the @entity25 embassy , where he spent six days before leaving for medical treatment
@entity18 later flew out of @entity27 with his family for a fellowship at @entity30
@entity11 grants asylum to @entity2 ' @entity1 @entity32
@entity25 @entity19 in @entity33 , 1956 - 1971
vocally @entity34 lived in the @entity19 in @entity35 for 15 years after the @entity37 - led invasion of his country
he finally agreed to go into exile and died in @entity42 in 1975
@entity1 will be arrested if he comes out of embassy in @entity12 , police rep. says @entity46
@entity25 @entity19 in @entity47 , @entity48 , 1967
@entity37 dictator @entity50 's only daughter got permission to bring her lover 's ashes to @entity48 , then defected by walking into the @entity19 in @entity47 and burning her passport
she lived in the @entity25 as @entity46 until her death last november
@entity57 @entity19 in @entity58 , 1989
@entity25 forces invaded @entity58 to topple and arrest @entity56 , prompting the dictator to seek refuge in the @entity63 's mission
@entity25 troops set up large speakers around the compound , blaring music at all hours , a psychological ploy to rattle the general
he surrendered after 10 days and was taken to the @entity25 for trial
he was found guilty of drug trafficking and other crimes
@entity25 @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity27 , 2012
one of @entity27 's best - known police chiefs sought refuge at a @entity25 consulate amid a mystery over the death of @entity4 businessman @entity82 , a family friend of @entity74 's boss , top @entity84 official @entity83
the case was reopened after @entity74 's intervention , which appeared to implicate @entity83 -- but @entity74 was taken into @entity27 custody when he left the diplomatic mission and has not been seen since
why @entity1 needs @entity11 and @entity11 needs @entity1
