@entity1 has pledged to be " a chancellor for all @entity2 "
if , as expected , @entity1 forms a new coalition with the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) it will have wide - reaching implications for @entity2
the @entity13 are more economically liberal than @entity1 's previous partner , the @entity7
according to @entity0 's @entity17 , the @entity13 led by @entity16 will push for control of some key positions in the new government , including perhaps the finance ministry
@entity17 believes that economic policy is likely to change dramatically
" this means a whole lot more pro-business politics for @entity2 than in the past
you 'll probably see tax cuts and it will probably mean smaller government than seen in the past four years , " he said
speaking at a post-election news conference on monday , @entity1 said that the result is an opportunity to build a smaller government
" if one looks at the majority relationships , we will be dealing with a smaller partner , the @entity12 , " she said
" we are happy to use this chance in very difficult economic times to secure jobs , create new ones and drive growth more decisively
" @entity1 also pledged to be " a chancellor for all @entity2 "
the election was disastrous for her rival , foreign minister @entity45 and the @entity7 who saw their vote fall 10 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 to 23 percent
the result is the @entity7 's worst result since @entity50 the results leave the @entity6 as the strongest party in the @entity2 parliament with 27.3 percent of the popular vote -- slightly down on the 27.8 percent it achieved four years ago
despite being the biggest party in the @entity58 , the vote marked one of the @entity6 's poorest showings in an election
but its traditional coalition with the @entity64 -- who won 6.5 percent of the vote -- means that the @entity6 / @entity64 bloc won 33.8 percent of the vote
the biggest winners on election night were the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) whose share of the vote rose nearly five percent from 9.8 to 14.6 percent .
