here is @entity2 's response to comments on the essay he wrote after learning his father was going to become a woman
friday night my dad came down from @entity9 to watch her name was @entity12 -- the @entity14 documentary about him -- with our family and some friends
it meant a lot to me and my mother that my dad was down at our house , in the room much less where all of this first happened
my dad , my mother , some neighborhood friends and my girlfriend @entity28 all sat down saturday night to watch it
the next day my dad showed me some of the comments on the @entity14 web site about the essay i wrote about him in 8th grade for a school project
these comments were some of the nicest things i 've read about myself in my life
as people saw my posting , they started asking me some questions
one good question was : " how did my schoolmates react to all of this ? were they supportive or negative towards this ? " well , the night my dad told me about his plans to become a woman was also the same night that the news stations found out and aired the story
surprisingly to my parents , i decided to go to school the next day
i went to a small school at the time
it was a school with grades 4 - 8 and had about 300 kids total
i was in the 8th grade
as i got dropped off , before i could even walk in the school , some teachers and a bunch of my friends came running out to hug me and say it 's going to be okay
i was still in shock from all of this , but i 'm pretty good at hiding my emotions
unfortunately having all of your friends hugging you and knowing about this brought out some tears
all of my 8th grade friends knew about this , and mostly all of them were supportive
now i 'm in the 10th grade at high school with about 3000 students , so it 's a bit different
when i started high school , the story of my dad had kind of settled down
i 've not really gotten any support from my new high school friends because we do n't talk about it
i 've been asked a few times if @entity90 was related to me and i say , " yes , that 's my dad
" other than about three of those little " are - you - related " questions from people i partially knew , i have n't been approached by any kids at school
yes , some people tell me that my dad is kind of weird and i completely agree
when you truly love someone you learn to accept the choices they make
it 's no different if your mom said , " i am going to shave off all my hair
" would you stop loving her because of that ? hopefully not
this is the same thing with my dad , but its i obviously a little more than a haircut
one of the comments that i read was that it was selfish for my dad to use the money on his surgery
was it selfish of my dad ? absolutely -- 100 percent -- not
if you had those feelings , i am sure all of us would do the same thing
it would be almost rude to live the rest of his life in pain knowing he was n't himself and not truly who he felt he was
money was always a problem ever since my dad got fired
like i said in the documentary , the biggest negative change that impacted our family was dad losing his job
i know that if we were really down to the last dollars we had , my dad would not have done the surgery until we got back on our feet
both of my parents are really financially smart and we have planned ahead to live a comfortable life
the more important part is me and my mom still live in our house
i 've lived in this house since i was a baby and i ca n't imagine having to move
in conclusion , i would like to thank everyone who read my essay
the comments i read about myself are some of the nicest things i have ever read about me
i love the feedback that i get , good or bad
