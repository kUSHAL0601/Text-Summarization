@entity1 senior producer @entity0 traveled to @entity2 , @entity3 , to talk to voters , including some members of her extended family , about how a typical small town like @entity2 might vote in 2008 and what issues are on their minds
@entity2 mayor @entity11 and her husband , @entity12 , talk politics in their kitchen @entity2 , @entity3 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 is a borough of 2,200 , nestled in the anthracite - rich mountains in the northeastern part of @entity3
it 's exactly the type of place sen. @entity19 referenced last week when he said some @entity20 were " bitter " over their poor economic situation
@entity19 said he regretted the word choice but continued to argue that some voters feel desperate
after spending a day talking with @entity2 voters , it seems to me the anger @entity19 described in his now controversial comments might not have been too far off the mark
" it 's time for the politicians to come down to our level , " said @entity30 during the lunch hour at @entity32 , @entity2 's only casual eatery among a row of shuttered shops and next to a 60 - year - old movie theater that has survived
" people ca n't afford food
i 'm paying for oil for the restaurant out of my own @entity46 check
" @entity30 and her husband , @entity32 , describe their small pizza and sub restaurant on @entity50 as a " country store , " a place where the regulars can gather to talk , share a meal or -- as is the case lately -- sip a cup of coffee
" this is my business , but people ca n't afford it , " said @entity30
she detailed the myriad of problems she and others are facing -- rising gas prices , increased taxes , out of control food and prescription costs
it is no wonder , she said , people ca n't afford lunch or dinner at the restaurant they 've owned for 25 years
@entity2 's history i did not find @entity2 's quiet streets by accident
my @entity76 @entity75 grandmother was born here and some family still lives in and around the house on @entity80 where she and her nine siblings grew up while their father worked the mines
@entity2 , like many other small @entity3 communities , has seen better times
back in the 1930s , when the surrounding hills were bustling with anthracite mining , around 7,000 people lived here
by the 1950s , the mines were closing
in the 30 years that followed , the garment factories in and around town shut down
today , many of @entity2 's residents are elderly and on fixed incomes
the cost of living is low , so there is the occasional new neighbor , but the shrinking population and tough economic times could force the closure of several churches , forcing people to worship elsewhere
without a grocery store or a single stoplight , my great - uncle @entity106 frequently jokes , " @entity2 is more boring than @entity110
" @entity2 and the ' 08 election @entity11 , @entity2 's mayor since 2001 and lifelong resident , said her constituents are " tightlipped " about who will get their vote in the primary
on a drive through town , only a " @entity119 for president " yard sign could be found
@entity123 says the town is roughly split between @entity125 and @entity126 , a change from past elections
@entity129 , @entity2 -- like @entity130 at - large -- has leaned @entity126
this election season , however , the county has mirrored trends across the state -- more voters switching to the @entity125 and more new voters registering as @entity125
" i 'm a die - hard @entity126 , but i have to say this year things are going to be a little different for me , " said @entity123 , who is part of the town 's tight - knit @entity76 @entity75 community
" the party is going to be upset with me , but i feel that we need a change
" at this point @entity123 plans to cast a write - in vote for @entity19 in the primary
she joins her husband , @entity12 , in supporting @entity19
" this time around i 'm dead set against voting for @entity154 , " said @entity12 , a longtime @entity149 and retired @entity151 reservist
" as far as @entity19 goes , he 's young , he 's inexperienced , he 's new , but i think given a chance he could be a good president
" @entity11 said she is reluctant to advertise her support for @entity19 in the form of a yard sign because she fears her neighbors would think she is supporting him because @entity12 is @entity160
the two conceded race is an underlying factor in voters ' decisions , and both cited the state 's rainbow of immigrant ethnic groups and gov. @entity171 's comment that an @entity160 might have trouble winning statewide
" i do think he 's right , " she said
" i hope he 's wrong , though
" both @entity12 and @entity11 describe a visceral reaction to @entity177
they say they ca n't shake the memories of @entity181 or the belief that president @entity177 could have done more for the military during his time in the @entity185
back down the hill at @entity32 , @entity30 and @entity187 will gladly cast their primary ballot for @entity177
@entity32 says @entity19 is an unknown and believes @entity177 will be a " good start , although we do n't expect her to do everything
" they are both comforted by the fact that @entity177 would play some role in his wife 's administration -- but they want her to have the final say
" she 'll hold him at bay when she needs to , " said @entity199
neither of the @entity204 could say for sure they would vote for @entity19 if he were their party 's nominee in november
@entity106 , a @entity151 veteran , has been waiting " a long time " to vote for @entity177
he believes she deserves " another chance " to revamp health care , something he is banking on as his yearly health insurance costs approach $ 3,000
@entity106 , 82 , still lives in the house where he was born and raised
as the april 22 primary approaches , he is not banking on any of the candidates paying a visit to his sleepy town but that does n't diminish his excitement or hope that a new president will ease the daily hardships that he and his neighbors face
the last time @entity106 remembers a @entity185 aspirant coming anywhere near the borough was in 1960 when @entity225 drove through nearby hometown and @entity227
@entity106 remembers waiting on the street and jumping through the crowd to shake @entity225 's hand
