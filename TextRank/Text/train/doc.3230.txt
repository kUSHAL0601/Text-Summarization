-- it happened at @entity2
now it has happened again at @entity4
any doubts over whether @entity6 , rated the best racehorse in the world , would prove himself the master of the 10 furlong distance , as he has over eight furlongs , were dispelled wednesday
@entity6 made one of the toughest fields he has ever faced look pedestrian , defeating @entity14 and @entity15 by a widening seven lengths to win the @entity17 at the racecourse in the north of @entity20 and extend his unbeaten record to 13
@entity6 certainly can not be said to suffer from triskaidekaphobia , a fear of the number 13
the first of his victories came on friday 13th in august 2010
that half - length victory over @entity28 is the closest anyone has come to the great colt since
his biggest winning margin has been -- you guessed it -- 13 lengths
the annual @entity4 meeting had long been turned into a one - horse race ever since @entity6 's trainer , @entity37 , targeted the @entity38 for @entity6 's debut over the one mile and a quarter ( 2,000m ) trip
on wednesday , fans lined every inch of rail from the parade ring to the starting gates to get a glimpse of the horse that may possibly represent the culmination of 300 years of selective breeding to create the ultimate equine athlete
superstar swagger with the swagger of a superstar , @entity6 emerged from the saddling area to a sea of pink and green ( his owner , @entity58 's racing colors )
accompanied into the parade ring by a phalanx of policemen , the great colt looked far more relaxed than either his trainer or his jockey , @entity63
the most interesting and compelling race of @entity6 's career to date was given more piquancy by the presence of @entity37 , who was returning to the racetrack for the first time in months following ongoing treatment for cancer
the @entity17 is something of a graveyard of champions ; 11 out of 17 horses that have started as odds - on favorites here have been turned over
most famous of these was @entity79
in the summer of 1972 , brigadier @entity79 swept aside all comers in the same insouciant manner that @entity6 does today
but it was in this race 40 years ago that he suffered the only defeat of his career
in a massive upset , the 1972 @entity87 winner @entity86 ran the race of his life to beat brigadier gerard by three lengths , smashing the course record in the process
@entity6 , starting the race at 10 - 1 on , suffered no such upset
despite losing a couple of lengths at the start , there were never any signs of panic from his jockey , a virtually motionless @entity63
tactical ploy rival trainer @entity105 was determined , as ever , to halt @entity6 's seemingly inexorable progress toward perfection , making the task something of a tactical puzzle by his use of pacemakers to assist @entity15
but an unruffled @entity6 was content to settle towards the back of the field for the early part of the race , and all that remained was for @entity63 to pull the pin in his customary fashion with two furlongs to go
@entity6 duly galloped into uncharted territory and into the history books
@entity6 has now surpassed the mark set by @entity124 for consecutive @entity125 wins with eight
the view of @entity6 receding into the distance is one that the likes of top jockeys @entity130 and @entity131 are already familiar with
it is a sight that racing fans will have to accustom themselves to now that @entity6 's career looks to be following its inevitable trajectory toward the breeding shed
with just one race left on his card -- the @entity139 at @entity2 in october -- the finest athlete to grace this sport is in the home stretch of his long gallop into immortality .
