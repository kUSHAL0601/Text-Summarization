@entity0 -- the sailboat crew chose an ocean - size ambition
they sought to land in @entity5 from @entity0 with cruise ship - like speed , in less than five days
what they never expected to encounter was as unimaginable as a sea monster : a massive debris field floating in the middle of the @entity14
its origin ? the catastrophic tsunami that obliterated coastal @entity18 two years ago
" we experienced ' @entity22 's @entity21 , ' " yacht owner @entity23 told @entity1 by satellite phone hours after his boat sustained significant damage after hitting two telephone poles and other objects
@entity22 is the @entity18 city known for a nuclear meltdown in the 2011 tsunami
despite the setback , @entity23 and his @entity32 crew finished first in the 2,225 - nautical - mile race ( or 2,560 miles ) , but they were thwarted in setting a record , despite a highly orchestrated campaign to do so
the three - hulled sailboat , called a trimaran , was considered a likely contender to set a record because the 73 - foot boat is considered among the 10 fastest yachts in the world and was the only one of those 10 competing in the race , according to the team 's spokesman
exhausted friday from having received little sleep over five days , the boat 's captain , @entity50 , told @entity1 he was largely blaming what 's become a disturbing reality on the high seas : plumes of drifting junk
" the fact of the modern world is that this stuff is out there , " @entity50 said
" i sailed around the world , and even then i remember commenting on how much trash and man - made debris was out there
" we ran into six different pieces of tinder , " @entity50 continued
" tree trunks , telephone poles and whatever else caused damage to the underwater surfaces of the boat that keep you going straight and fast
" these impacts hobbled the progress of the vessel @entity77
the nine sailors aboard improvised repairs to a damaged daggerboard , a vertical board which slides through the central hull and submerges to keep the boat from slanting sideways
" that immediately started to break apart
there was a big impact on the edge which caused it to split open
we had to stop the boat and figure out how to pull it up through the bearings
it took us a few hours to be able to sail again , " @entity50 said
the crew used small , battery operated tools to fix the centerboard -- which looked like it suffered a very bad shark bite
" it was just a mess to fix those problems , " @entity50 said
" we 're talking about 12 hours that we lost to the finishing time because of these issues
" the racing crew set out saturday to be the first competitors in an annual @entity105 to beat @entity107 's 1997 record of traveling from @entity0 to @entity108 on an 86 - foot catamaran in five days , nine hours , 18 minutes , and 26 seconds
the @entity77 fell short by more than two hours , posting a time of five days , 11 hours , 52 minutes and 33 seconds
" i bought this boat to be a challenger for breaking the record , " @entity23 said
" we lengthened the floats , installed a new foil system and put together a new sail program
" for two years , he worked to build a team of world - class sailors -- using his connections in the sport during the recruiting
shortly after dawn friday , the crew was just beginning to take vacation time in @entity5 , after a night of post-race celebrations
they were undaunted by the menaces afloat in the world 's biggest ocean
" i can definitely see us coming back to try and beat it again -- it 's a great race , " @entity50 said .
