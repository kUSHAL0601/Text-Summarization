for more than 30 years , @entity0 helped operate the @entity1 near @entity2
now he 's helping to button it up for good
@entity0 is one of nearly 600 people still working at the two - reactor plant , down from a work force of more than 1,500 when the plant was still running -- " all solid , middle - class jobs , " he said
" a lot of them have already moved on , " @entity0 said
they 've gone to work for other @entity14 nuclear plants , for conventionally fueled plants or other arms of the electrical power industry , he said
and a few have gone to work overseas , where other countries are building new nuclear plants
" three or four of our guys , maybe five , went to work in @entity25 , " said @entity0 , who 's also the business manager for local 246 of the @entity22
" another one went to @entity27
" not long ago , nuclear energy seemed poised to start a much - touted renaissance in the @entity14
buoyed by forecasts of increased demand , utilities were gearing up to start building the first new reactors since the 1970s
concerns about the emissions from carbon - rich fossil fuels blamed for global warming started to offset public fears about safety that had lingered since the @entity41 accident in 1979
read @entity43 's quick facts about @entity14 nuclear power plants map : how close are you to nuclear waste ? ( @entity48 ) but since then , the industry has seen a dramatic reversal of fortune
and while some environmentalists , like those featured in the @entity56 ' documentary " @entity57 , " now argue that nuclear power is needed to head off climate change , the market has become a hostile place
" the industry got hit between the eyes by a number of things happening at once , " said @entity61 , a former @entity62 member
related : ' @entity57 ' five new reactors are currently being built , in @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70
but in the past year , utilities have permanently shut down four others and plan to take a fifth out of service next year
at least two other planned projects have been shelved
the projected increases in electric demand did n't materialize , tamped down by the steep recession of 2007 - 2009 and increasing efficiencies and conservation measures , @entity61 said
then , a revolution in drilling techniques produced a boom in cheap natural gas
and during the recession , long - debated efforts to limit carbon emissions through a " cap - and - trade " system failed to make it through @entity89
the @entity90 forecast that cap - and - trade would have led utilities to produce more nuclear plants , which produce large amounts of power without releasing carbon dioxide
" looking back as sort of an armchair quarterback , it really turns out the nuclear industry needed some kind of cap - and - trade or strong carbon regulation to get back off the ground , " said @entity97 , director of the @entity98 at @entity100 's @entity99
related : ads warn against taxing carbon emissions then in 2011 , the historic @entity112 earthquake and tsunami triggered the worst nuclear accident since the @entity116 's @entity115 in 1986 , bringing safety issues back into the spotlight
three reactors at the @entity121 plant in northeastern @entity112 melted down after the tsunami swamped the plant and knocked out its emergency power systems
though no fatalities have been blamed on the accident , the resulting contamination displaced more than 100,000 people , and the cleanup and damages have left @entity112 's largest utility on life support
@entity97 called it a " body blow " to the @entity14 nuclear establishment , following the gas revolution and the failure of government attempts to impose a price on carbon emissions
" fracking , " the use of hydraulic fracturing to break open underground rock formations that hold natural gas , has driven the cost of that fuel sharply downward
gas - fired power plants are far faster and cheaper to build than nuclear plants , which can take a decade and cost billions of dollars to get up and running
and while gas is n't carbon - free , it puts out about half the carbon emissions of coal
the shift toward selling electricity on regional grids , particularly in the @entity156 and @entity157 , has pitted nuclear - generated power directly against gas -- and nuclear is losing , @entity97 said
" from a generation standpoint , it 's really hard for them to make money in those markets , " he said
@entity166 , the head of the utility conglomerate @entity167 , predicted in april that natural gas would wipe out both coal and nuclear power
@entity167 had sought to build two new reactors in south @entity172 but abandoned the project in 2011 , citing high costs and the " extraordinary challenges " facing the industry after @entity121
" i do n't necessarily think at least the second of those is a good thing , " @entity166 said
" but i think it 's inevitable outside of government intervention , which i do n't think is going to happen
" in @entity186 , the single - reactor @entity184 plant will close in 2014 after its owner , @entity188 , decided in august that it was no longer " financially viable
" @entity189 shut down its @entity191 plant in @entity192 in may , a decision it said was " based purely on economics
" @entity195 announced in february that it would write off its @entity197 plant in @entity198 , which had been idled since 2009 for repairs to its concrete containment building
and @entity1 had been offline for more than a year when its owner , @entity203 , announced in june that it would n't reopen
the plant shut down in 2012 after a gas leak revealed problems in its massive new steam generators , which had just been replaced at a cost of nearly $ 700 million
@entity203 said the " continuing uncertainty " over the plant 's future " was not good for our customers , our investors , or the need to plan for our region 's long - term electricity needs
" read more about the closing of @entity184 @entity61 , the former @entity62 member , said utilities have been unable to draw investors for new plants , forcing them to rely on loan guarantees from the federal government -- and on customers in states like @entity68 and @entity198 , which have allowed regulated public utilities to charge them for plants still under construction
" the fundamental problem was the renaissance was always economically unsound , " @entity61 said
" there was never a point in time at which private investors were prepared to back new nuclear
there were just too many things that could go wrong
" and while the zero - carbon promise of nuclear power may be appealing , the billions it would take to build a nuclear plant could better be spent to develop renewable energy sources like wind and solar , boost conservation efforts and improve fuel efficiency for motor vehicles , he said
climate change warriors : it 's time to go nuclear " the problem with using nuclear as an answer to climate change is it 's so much more expensive than other potential answers , " @entity61 said
" it 's like building palaces to solve a housing shortage , or using caviar to solve world hunger
" @entity0 said his co-workers are n't likely to have trouble finding jobs -- " there 's a lot of skills that are transferable , " he told @entity43
but he also calls himself " a climate change guy , " and said most of the 2,200 megawatts of electricity that @entity1 used to produce will now be replaced by carbon - emitting fossil fuel plants rather than renewable
" the only greenhouse gases that @entity1 created was the smokers up on the top of the deck , when they would get together and smoke , " he said .
