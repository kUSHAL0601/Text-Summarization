@entity0 -- a @entity3 advocacy group is spending thousands of dollars to convince people that smoking pot is safer than drinking alcohol
it 's an attempt by the @entity8 to regulate @entity9 to rally support for a vote in november that would legalize the drug for recreational use
@entity3 legalized marijuana for medical use in 2000
last friday , the group aired an advertisement on a local @entity0 channel during daytime programming encouraging people to " start your conversation about marijuana
" the 30 - second spot features a young woman typing a message to her mother on her laptop , explaining that after spending her college years drinking heavily , she now prefers marijuana because " it 's less harmful ... i do n't get hung - over and honestly i feel safer around marijuana users
" the marketing campaign aims to " break down the stereotype about who the typical marijuana user is , " explained the campaign 's co-director , @entity36
" most of them are professional , hard - working people , " he said
the tv ad , which aired only on friday , cost about $ 2,000 , according to @entity36
it may run again , depending on fund - raising efforts , he said
last month , the campaign spent about $ 4,500 on a billboard near @entity0 's ( @entity45 at ) @entity46 -- purposely adjacent to the @entity48 store -- to deliver a similar message , @entity36 said
the billboard also features a woman , this one in her 50s , standing with her arms crossed next to the message : " for many reasons , i prefer ... marijuana over alcohol
does that make me a bad person ? " watch the tv ad by attempting to change " stereotypes " about marijuana users , the campaign hopes to make @entity3 the first state to legalize recreational marijuana use
" the goal is the choice -- to make sure adults have the choice to use a less harmful substance than alcohol , " @entity36 said
dr. @entity71 with the @entity72 questioned that conclusion
" the problems of excessive alcohol use and the problems caused by any even minor smoking of marijuana are so different , i have difficulty comparing , " said @entity71 , @entity75 contributor and the @entity72 's chief medical and scientific officer
" there are short - term and long - term primarily pulmonary problems associated with marijuana ( and ) excessive alcohol use is long - term correlated with @entity87 ( gastrointestinal ) and neurologic problems
" study : occasional pot smoking not as damaging as cigarettes also debatable is whether the money generated by legalizing and regulating marijuana through taxes will outweigh the costs of creating government - run marijuana distribution centers
@entity36 says the campaign to regulate @entity9 estimates that legalizing and regulating marijuana could generate $ 50 million a year in saved expenses and revenue
" we 've been pushing very hard in @entity3 and people agree , it 's not worth the law enforcement resources being used ( to crack down on marijuana users ) and it 's not worth losing out on the tax dollars , " he said
22 million @entity110 use illegal drugs , study says @entity36 said he was not aware of any criticism for the advertisement , noting that legalizing marijuana is " one of the biggest issues in our state legislature in the last few years
" " we live in a state that has made a lot of progress on the issue , " he said
" it 's not as controversial as many other issues
" that 's partly because of the prevalence of medical marijuana dispensaries across the state
state - sanctioned marijuana dispensaries now outnumber @entity130 in @entity3 and there are well over 100,000 people on the medical marijuana registry
mobile marijuana clinic for @entity3 's rural residents six years ago , an attempt to legalize marijuana in @entity3 failed
this year 's initiative goes much further than the 2006 ballot , because it establishes a system that regulates and taxes the drug , @entity36 said
he believes the infrastructure created by @entity3 's medical marijuana industry will help boost the chances that voters will approve legal recreational use of the drug
residents are also more accustomed to the idea of a legalized form of the drug , now that medical marijuana dispensaries are a common sight across the state , @entity36 said
" we 're not asking people to imagine , as we would just two years ago , " he explained
" people have seen that just because there 's a marijuana center in @entity3 ... just because there might be a storefront in your town or city , it has n't caused any problems
" he noted that the initiative would allow cities and municipalities to " opt out " of allowing marijuana sales , similar to " dry counties " which ban the sale of alcohol
@entity3 is n't the only state where voters will consider legalizing marijuana in the fall : there 's a similar ballot initiative in @entity177 and there could be one in @entity179 , as well , if enough signatures are collected
" there are actually ... close to 17 or 18 initiatives working their way to the ballots , " according to @entity186 , president and ceo of the non-profit anti-drug organization , @entity181
@entity186 said her group 's main focus is to " force the ( marijuana ) industry " to ensure that it does n't market the drug to children
" we ask a question : if a state actually does legalize marijuana for recreational use ... what kind of things can we learn form the alcohol and tobacco industries in the way they 've marketed to kids ? " she said
" what can we do to prevent that ( marijuana ) industry from marketing to kids ? " she said setting a legal age limit of 21 is not enough
" we do not trust the advocates who are trying to legalize marijuana because we do n't believe they are willing to look at these other two industries ( alcohol and tobacco ) , " @entity186 said
" everything we read in their initiative has to do with making money and not protecting kids
" if any marijuana initiative passes , @entity186 said her group is interested in working with the state agencies that write the regulations in order " to force the industry to self - police rather than ( have ) the taxpayers pay for the cost " of any negative consequences , including addiction treatment and accidents caused by driving under the influence
" we want people to take marijuana legalization seriously and think seriously about the consequences to kids , " she said
when asked about @entity186 's concerns , @entity36 said he was confident the marijuana industry would not target its product to minors
" there 's a great deal of self - regulating already taking place -- business owners not choosing marijuana leaves or cartoon characters , " he said , referring to the medical marijuana industry
" it 's an evolving industry ( and ) in theory , these are standards that are already being created
" that does n't mean the marijuana industry wo n't advertise its product in places where children might be present , though
" it 's worth noting , every young person that walks into a professional baseball game in @entity3 ( at @entity261 ) is walking into a beer commercial , " he said
" so the notion that we somehow can not possibly have marijuana legal because young people will somehow know about it and see it , is unrealistic
