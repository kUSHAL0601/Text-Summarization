@entity0 -- @entity3 drivers , long the butt of bad driver jokes , will soon give up some of their roadways to professional racers , as state officials have reached an agreement to bring @entity11 racing to the @entity3
the 10 - year deal will begin in june 2013 , a source familiar with the venture told @entity1
two sources said that @entity11 , considered the world 's premiere racing circuit , will be taking to the streets of @entity19 and @entity20 , @entity3
the route of the race featuring open cockpit , high - tech cars traveling more than 200 mph would begin in @entity19 at the beginning of @entity26 and go north , with spectacular views of the @entity28 as a backdrop , before turning right down 60th street in @entity20 to @entity31 where drivers would head south , back toward @entity19
a press conference to announce the details of the deal will be held tuesday in @entity19
@entity3 gov. @entity36 , @entity19 mayor @entity37 and @entity20 mayor @entity38 are expected to attend
the race course should be ideal for @entity11 as it combines the sport 's characteristic right turns and elevation changes and , unlike the auto racing most @entity44 are used to , generally features less passing and fewer crashes
@entity47 , @entity48 , meanwhile , will host the annual @entity44 @entity49 for the sport beginning november 2012 and continuing through 2021 -- making it the first @entity44 city in 30 years to have a multi-year deal with @entity11
the last @entity44 city to have such a deal was @entity55 , @entity0
since then , @entity11 has been hosted by @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 all on temporary street circuits
@entity62 , a spokesman for @entity36 , said the governor expects @entity11 's arrival to bring " a significant economic and tourism boom for our state
