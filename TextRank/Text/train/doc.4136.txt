-- a @entity2 tanker carrying fuel arrived in the @entity5 town of @entity6 on saturday night , the @entity7 said , as officials started preparations on delivering the much - needed supplies
@entity7 ice breaker @entity11 accompanied the fuel tanker @entity14 as it made its way through the frozen waters carrying 1.3 million gallons of petroleum products
" the first step is to ensure the ice is safe for the personnel to walk on , " said chief petty officer @entity18
" then they will work to connect the piping and check for leaks
safety is our primary concern
" the cutter has broken through almost 300 miles of ice for the tanker on a journey that took them through southern @entity34 's @entity33
the voyage is the first - ever attempt to supply fuel to an @entity34 settlement through sea ice
a company in @entity6 contracted the @entity14 to deliver the fuel after ice formed over the @entity42 following a ferocious november storm that prevented the last delivery of the season via barge
the @entity7 urged @entity6 residents not to go out on the ice to watch the operations , saying the behavior of the ice is unpredictable and ice conditions could change
@entity6 is not in immediate danger of running out of fuel , said @entity7 capt. @entity53 , who is coordinating the mission
the town has enough fuel to last until about march , but the delivery was attempted now because it would have been more difficult then , he said
officials considered flying in fuel , but it would have taken more than 300 flights , each carrying 4,000 to 5,000 gallons , to meet the town 's needs , said @entity64 , chairman of @entity65
