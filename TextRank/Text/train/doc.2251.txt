-- one of @entity2 's biggest banks is planning to make the country 's biggest foreign bank acquisition to date and has set its sights on potential targets in @entity7
@entity8 , the second - ranked @entity2 bank by assets after @entity10 , could spend as much as $ 15bn on a deal , according to @entity12 , the group 's chairman
" some of the banks in @entity7 have been put up for sale , " mr @entity12 told the @entity14 in an interview
" now we are looking for the right choice
" he said @entity8 had @entity20 ( $ 15.8bn ) of capital available to acquire a whole bank or , at a minimum , to buy a stake of 30 - 50 per cent in a larger entity
mr @entity12 , who praised the progress of @entity7 policymakers in addressing the eurozone crisis , would not be drawn on individual names but said an investment in the @entity31 , @entity32 or @entity33 would be most attractive
he valued the partnership agreement @entity8 has with @entity35 , which owns a 1 per cent stake in the @entity2 bank , but did not plan to support it with a shareholding
any acquisition would have to have a reasonable international presence , mr @entity12 added , rather than just a single - country domestic focus
an internationally minded acquisition target would pose fewer " cultural challenges " , he said
investment bankers believe banks that were part - nationalised amid the financial crisis could make appealing targets
@entity50 , 82 per cent owned by the @entity31 government , has a market capitalisation of Â £ 17bn
@entity53 , the @entity32 bank that is 25 per cent government - owned , is worth barely â ‚ ¬ 9bn
analysts and deal bankers have long predicted that @entity2 groups , which retain relatively high market valuations , could swoop on comparatively cheap western rivals
but so far there has been little activity
@entity10 's $ 5.5bn acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in @entity65 's @entity64 has been the biggest deal to date
the @entity2 financial sector has been scarred by the few deals they have done abroad
@entity70 , the sovereign wealth fund , took big stakes in @entity73 and @entity74 just before the global financial crisis savaged their share prices
in @entity7 , @entity77 has seen a big paper loss on its investment in @entity80 , while @entity81 , a life insurer , bought a stake in @entity83 just before it ran into trouble and had to be split up
with @entity7 's debt problems deepening over the past two years , @entity2 regulators have advised the country 's banks to keep a safe distance from @entity7 financial institutions
at one point they were even told to avoid basic foreign exchange transactions with certain @entity7 counterparties because of the financial risks
" in the past several years what happened to @entity2 investors was not particularly encouraging , " @entity12 of @entity96 said
" in my base case , i am not expecting any large - sized overseas acquisitions
" but if they are talking about investing in a listed entity , it may look interesting from a long - term perspective because the asking price must be reasonable now
" @entity106 , @entity12 's predecessor as chairman of @entity8 , insisted last year that price alone would not be enough of a reason to do a deal
mr @entity106 , who is now @entity2 's chief securities regulator , appealed for caution when looking at foreign banks : " their shares have really fallen , " he said at the time
" just looking at the prices , it might seem a good deal
but it would not necessarily suit our development strategy
