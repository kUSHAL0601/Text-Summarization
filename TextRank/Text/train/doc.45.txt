-- a fireplace is n't just a spot to keep logs and kindling
according to decorators and design enthusiasts , it 's where you put your heart on display
of course , in decorator speak , a fireplace serves as a design focal point , something you can use as a jumping - off point for furniture placement and accessories
it adds " charm " to any room
but in practical terms , what you choose to display on a mantel is something that will be seen -- and seen as important
often coveted as a must - have detail for home buyers , fireplaces -- and mantels in particular -- evoke a specific feeling of tradition and comfort , decorator @entity27 said
" i think they represent the coziness and warmth that we envision when we think of what ' home ' should be , " she said
it does n't matter whether the fireplace is regularly used , she said , noting that the climate around her @entity45 home does n't always provide the opportunity for a roaring fire
@entity48 of @entity49 by @entity50 said the time her family spends around their fireplace makes the cold , snowy days in @entity55 easier to bear
when hurricanes and recent record - breaking snowstorms caused power outages , their fireplace delivered
" there is something so cozy about sitting by the fireplace and enjoying the moment , " she said
but what if it 's not cold ? there 's little reason to use a fireplace in the middle of a sweltering summer , but that wo n't stop decorators from giving their mantels the summertime treatment
many decorators who contributed to this week 's @entity49 assignment confessed to switching out their mantel decor often , at least once per season
@entity49 : no matchy - matchy in the bedroom , please light , bright and simple are the go - to decor philosophies for summer mantels
fresh garden clippings in simple containers , seashells , driftwood , outdoor lanterns and cool shades of green and blue help keep the mind on beach vacations and lazy days
thoughts of home " there is absolutely something nostalgic and magical about a fireplace , " said @entity94 to radiance blogger @entity95
" while they are n't exactly a necessary thing to have these days , they represent a time period and a way of life where things were a little slower and more traditional
" she and her husband love their fireplace so much that they stared a @entity112 tradition of pulling a mattress into the living room and sleeping nearby on @entity115
sometimes , as in @entity119 's case , the memories associated with mantels are more literal
" to me , a fireplace is a symbol of my childhood in @entity123 , " she said
" my family still has the same very traditional wood - burning fireplace from when i was growing up
it has a beautiful heavy stone mantel and is surrounded by a huge built - in library wall
" we spent every winter and holiday around that fireplace , " @entity119 said
" while people in other homes used to put their family photos and knickknacks on their mantels , my mother never decorated like that
my mother always kept it simple and only displayed a few pieces of her inherited silver
" and that 's a tradition @entity119 carries on , as seen on her blog @entity145
there 's just something special about fireplaces , @entity146 of @entity147 said
aside from hanging stockings from the mantle during the winter holidays and lighting fires in the box for cold weather ambiance , " we take all of our big family photos in front of ours , " she said
@entity49 : steps to a decorated staircase application of tchotchkes for decorating purposes , a mantel is essentially a shelf
but it 's not usually very deep , and there 's no right or wrong way to decorate it
and that can stymie the best - laid decorating plans
although mounting a flat - screen television above a fireplace is one modern solution to the " focal point " part of the decorating equation , it 's also the part of a room where modern decorators feel comfortable about " breaking the rules , " said @entity184 of @entity185
memories of mantels cluttered with formal portraits , holiday cards and the urns of loved ones have given way to the idea of a mantel being a piece of art , she said : " i love that people are reclaiming it and making it their own
" " a mantel is a great way to showcase what is meaningful and beautiful to you , " said @entity200 , the owner of @entity201 on the update
" people are using mantels as more of a showpiece now
before , it was just a shelf to set things on
" " they also tell a story , " @entity48 said
" you can easily change your decorations out for every season and display things that you really love
it could be as simple as one or two things or as many as you want
" @entity49 : are you brave enough to decorate boldly in the foyer ? stories large and small as staircase pictures walls and gallery - style picture hanging continue to gain popularity , the mantel is now the place for decorative items
" scale is an important challenge when decorating a mantel , " @entity48 said
" finding that perfect big item may take some time
an oil painting , a mirror or just an interesting empty antique frame are all good options
" smaller items resting on the mantel help balance out the bigger items
but sometimes those smaller items get tricky , said @entity242 of @entity243
her home has a double - sided fireplace , with one side facing the living room and the other her bedroom
" the biggest challenge for me is trying to edit the items on the mantel , " she said
" sometimes i can go overboard and find too many things i want to stick on it , ( and they ) do n't necessarily go together
" @entity184 sticks to arranging items in groups of odd numbers , making sure the items share a similar color or shape
" i think the biggest challenge is knowing how much is enough , " she said
" be sure to include some negative , or empty , space to make it more pleasing to the eye
" or , you can run with that space , like @entity264 of @entity265 does
" nothing is wrong with a very simple mantel , so if you do n't think you got it right , keep it sparse , " she said
" ( it 's ) a much better choice than adding clutter
