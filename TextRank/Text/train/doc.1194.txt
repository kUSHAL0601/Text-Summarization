the " amphibious house " was recently granted planning permission for construction on a island on the @entity13 in @entity14 -- a small town 35 miles west of @entity0
the upper part of the house is constructed from lightweight timber , according to its creators @entity21 , while a concrete basement level sits inside a " wet dock " consisting of a base slab and four retaining walls
