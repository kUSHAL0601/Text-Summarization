-- college basketball has a new record holder for most points in a game
last week , @entity5 , a 5 - foot , 10 - inch guard at @entity7 's @entity6 , scored 138 points to lead @entity6 to a 179 - 104 blowout win over @entity10 , a nearby @entity7 college
in setting his scoring record , @entity5 made 52 of 108 shots from the field , including 27 of 71 three - point attempts and shot 7 for 10 from the foul line
@entity5 's coach and teammates were happy to see him go all out
in the 36 minutes he played , @entity5 did not have a single assist
virtually every time he got the ball , he shot it
@entity5 is not the first basketball player to go on such an outsized scoring spree
on february 2 , 1954 , @entity23 , playing for tiny @entity24 in @entity25 , scored 113 points against @entity27 of @entity28
@entity23 made 38 of 70 shots and hit on 37 free throws in a game that ended with a 134 - 91 @entity24 victory
eleven days after @entity23 set his record , @entity34 of @entity35 in @entity36 poured in 100 points in a 149 - 95 victory over @entity39
no @entity41 player has ever done as well against a four - year college
@entity34 , who finished his senior year with a 41.7 scoring average , had a spectacular shooting night , hitting 41 of 66 field goal attempts and 18 of 22 free throws
in the @entity48 , the scoring record belongs to the @entity50 ' @entity49
fifty years ago , @entity51 put up 100 points in a march 2 , 1962 , game against the @entity53 , who were missing their starting center
@entity51 , who at 7 - foot - 1 towered over his opponents , was never much of an outside shooter , but his " @entity60 " was all he needed
he was unstoppable anywhere near the basket
@entity5 's scoring feat is , nonetheless , different from that of the others
they were playing in games in which their opponent was outclassed but still in their league
that was not the case in the @entity6 game
@entity6 is , to be sure , a small college , but @entity6 is far from any small college
like a series of elite @entity77 schools -- @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 -- @entity6 has an enormous endowment , a superb faculty and a national reputation
@entity10 's situation is very different
in contrast to @entity6 , which lists its undergraduate enrollment at 1,693 , @entity10 has just 302 undergraduates , and when it comes to endowment and facilities , the gap between the two colleges is even greater
@entity6 has an endowment of more than $ 1.5 billion and charges $ 41,004 in tuition and fees
all that @entity10 charges $ 14,478 in tuition and fees , and its endowment is listed in the @entity100 report as @entity101 ( not available )
@entity5 's scoring binge came against a college that does n't come close to having his college 's resources
what the basketball players at @entity10 must be feeling about losing by 75 points does n't seem to have entered anyone 's head at @entity6 or in the media , which could n't get enough of @entity5 in the days following his scoring feat. reporters barely mentioned the 70 points that @entity10 sophomore @entity114 totaled in a losing cause
i grew up in the @entity77 playing basketball at a prep school that often competed against tiny rural high schools to get ready for our games in an interstate league
when it came to running up the score , there was a code our coaches enforced
with a big lead , we slowed the game down
we stopped taking long shots that would get our supporters cheering , and with the game in hand , we brought in the second team , and after them , anyone still on the bench
when we left the gym , we wanted the other team to feel good about having played us
we did n't want their players hanging their heads in embarrassment , especially if we had a game scheduled with them for the following year
we knew these unspoken rules by 16
how could college players not know as much as we did as teenagers ? maybe it 's the times
but i wish that the @entity6 players had had my old coach , who doubled as my math teacher
coach would have made their ears burn for showing up an opponent as they did
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .
