he even helped his cause at the plate with a run - scoring single in the second inning
the next frame , the @entity1 exploded for five runs to build a comfortable 7 - 0 lead
they never looked back , fending off a @entity4 rally in the sixth inning and tacking on more runs in the seventh and eighth innings

" it is a lot of want and a lot of will power , " @entity65 told reporters
" you have to believe you can do it
" the @entity1 easily finished the regular season atop the @entity78 with a 94 - 68 record , tied with @entity80 for fourth best in the league
@entity28 , meanwhile , had an 88 - 74 mark in pulling past the @entity84 in the final month to earn a ticket to the playoffs
