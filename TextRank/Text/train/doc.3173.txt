-- for several weeks , @entity1 had been telling her 2 - year - old son @entity2 the following : " @entity3 and @entity4 are going to go to work for a while ... but we always come back for you
" we always come back for you
" @entity2 is too young to understand that his mommy and daddy 's " work " involves deploying to @entity11 just around the new year , and that " a while " could be between six and 12 months
but there are signs he seems to grasp how his life is about to dramatically change , @entity1 said
when she said goodbye to him at the airport , which would be the last time she 'd see him in person for months , he wanted to come along and said , " @entity21 ? " @entity1 , who did n't want to cry in front of @entity2 for fear of making it even harder on him , could n't hold back the tears
" i started crying and told him that i wish he could come to work with me , but that i would come back to him like i always do as soon as i could
" " i said , ' i always come back for you
' " then , fearing she was really going to lose it , she gave him lots of kisses , hugged him for a " very long time " and walked away as fast as she could
" it 's really rough , i 'm not gon na lie , " she said in those first days after their goodbye
i ca n't even imagine how rough
the most i 've been away from my girls , ages 6 and 7 , was 2Â½ weeks
the only people who perhaps can truly understand how rough it will be are the small group of military couples who have been deployed at the same time
from 2011 to the present , 681 @entity44 couples had simultaneous deployments , according to the @entity47 for the @entity44
' man , this is going to be hard ' the @entity44 did not order the @entity50 to deploy together
@entity1 , a @entity44 combat correspondent , volunteered with her husband 's full support because she has not deployed to @entity53 or @entity11 during her six years in the military and always wanted to experience a deployment
her husband 's enlistment was about to end after 10 years , so he would remain home with @entity2 while she deployed
but then her husband , a @entity44 sergeant who is a program manager with infantry detection dogs and a clerk with the @entity63 unit , was offered a deployment that would give him a chance for a promotion to staff sergeant
@entity1 encouraged her husband , @entity68 , whom she calls @entity69 , to take it , even though it would mean both would be away from @entity2 at the same time
read @entity73 : husband wife deploying together " he 's always been there for me
he 's always encouraged me to do more and grow , " she said
" i said this is kind of a sign
' hey , it 's not time for you to go just yet
you still have a little more work in the @entity44
' " since making that decision , they have tried not to dwell on how tough it will be for @entity2 and for them , but of course , that is much easier said than done
" i said , ' at least we 'll be together , ' " said @entity1 , who will be deployed to the same base as her husband in southwestern @entity11
" other than that , it was just a whole lot of , ' man , this is going to be hard , ' especially when ( @entity2 would ) come into bed with us in the morning
he 's still sleepy but he climbs on in and he 's just all happy and cuddly and it 's just , ' man , i 'm really going to ... this is going to suck
' " ' i 've heard that i 'm a bad mom ... for leaving ' her mom and dad , who live outside @entity105 , agreed to watch @entity2 while she and her husband are overseas , so they moved him from @entity107 to @entity108 shortly before @entity109 to help him adjust to a new routine
she then had to return to work in @entity112 in early december , and her husband a few weeks later
they 'll be spending @entity114 away from @entity2 before departing to @entity11
@entity1 's family has been extremely supportive , but not everyone understands their decision , especially since it was their choice
" i 've heard that i 'm a bad mom and a bad wife for leaving , especially when we did n't know @entity69 was going to be going
i heard a lot of , ' how could you leave your son like that ? ' " she said
" sometimes , people who find out that both of us are deploying , they kind of say backhanded comments like , ' wow , you guys are so brave for leaving your son
i could never do that
' and , ' you know , i try to be so centered around my kids
' and it 's like , ' ok , well , me , too , but this is my job
' " it 's hard to know if those same people who seem to be passing judgment , even if they are doing it in a less than direct way , would have been more understanding a few years ago when there were two wars going on at the same time , the conflicts in @entity53 and @entity11 , and both were getting more attention here at home
but regardless of the answer to that question , the fact that some people do n't seem to appreciate @entity1 and @entity69 's service and the extraordinary sacrifice they will be making is n't lost on them , especially on @entity154
" it hurts , but my husband is very , very good about focusing on the positives , because i am very good at focusing on the negatives , " she said with a laugh , remembering a wacky time recently when @entity2 was cracking up during a family silly string fight
" after everything had kind of settled down , ( @entity69 ) was like , ' see he 's going to remember the good times and he thinks , this is good , and he 's not going to say , ' well , i ca n't believe you left me when i was 2
he 's going to remember the good
' " ' he can still have me close ' @entity1 plans to take " quite a few pictures " of @entity2 with her along with all the pictures she already has on her @entity169
plus , she 's bringing a special bear she and @entity69 got when she was 22 weeks pregnant with @entity2
" we had gone to a @entity174 ultrasound place , and they recorded his heartbeat and put it inside the bear so i 'll be taking that with me , " she said
she and @entity69 are also leaving plenty behind for @entity2 , including their bed and some of their clothes so that he can just " hang out with mom and dad 's scent
" they 've been taking pictures of just about everything they do so @entity2 will have them on the computer
her mom also plans to have some pictures printed on little pillowcases and to hang a canvas of pictures in his room
" i ( plan ) on writing him because he 's very , very smart , " she said
" he likes to be read to , so i wanted to write him letters so that my mom can read them to him and he understands that mom 's far away but ... he can still have me close
" leaving a son : ' ok , how do i prepare for that ? ' she feels mentally ready for her deployment , especially after a series of classes the military provides to give a better understanding of what she might encounter in @entity11
but it 's pretty much impossible to know how to prepare for being away from her son , she told me
" i 'm just like , ' ok , how do i prepare for that ? how do i ? ' " she said
" i do n't know how to handle that
" watch : saying goodbye to a college - bound daughter she has a friend who has two boys and recently returned from a deployment , and plans to reach out to get an understanding of how she coped with being apart
still , she continues to have moments where she wonders if she 'll really be able to do this
it was especially hard after some recent family outings to the park and @entity231
" then it 's like , ' man , how can i leave this ? ' " she said
a few minutes later , she said , the doubts go away
" we 're going to do this and we know it 's not going to be that bad and we 'll all be better for it , ' " she said
she and @entity69 , who has been to @entity53 twice , are aware of the dangers , but try not to dwell on them
instead , they focus on the future , especially their homecoming
" all i can think about is coming back and seeing him at the airport when i fly back , " she said
" i keep thinking about how i 'll try to be as polite as possible , but i 'll probably be running people over just to get to him
" and who could blame her ? follow @entity250 on @entity251 , and like @entity252 on @entity253 .
