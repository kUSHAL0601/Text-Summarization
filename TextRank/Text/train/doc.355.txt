-- along with math , science and social studies , gun safety could soon be part of the first - grade curriculum in some @entity8 public schools
a new measure that advocates for such classes for first - graders was signed into law last week
but the idea has prompted worry from some parents and experts about the role and effectiveness of gun safety programs in a classroom setting
" i do n't have a gun
my family does n't have a gun
there is no reason for them to be teaching about gun safety when there are children with parents like me , " @entity25 , a @entity26 blogger and mom to a 6 - year - old girl , told @entity0 in a phone interview
though her child attends school in @entity40 , @entity37 has been openly critical of the bill in her blog , @entity43 , since the legislation was introduced one day before the @entity45 shooting last december
twenty children -- all of them first - graders -- and six adults were killed at the @entity45 , @entity51 , school by a lone gunman
the measure signed friday by @entity8 gov. @entity54 is part of the larger public safety bill @entity58 / @entity57 75
it encourages schools to teach gun safety to first - graders through courses such as the @entity65 's " @entity64 " @entity66
" the purpose of the program will be to promote safety and protection of children and emphasize how students should respond if they encounter a firearm , " says the bill , which was sponsored by state sen. @entity68 , a lifetime member of the @entity65
5 things to know about guns the legislation prohibits school personnel and instructors from making judgments about guns or from using firearms to teach the program
@entity68 told @entity0 in an interview that @entity45 did n't spur any changes in the law , which he said had been percolating for years
" it became more relevant after @entity45 , " @entity68 said , also noting that he did not talk with the @entity65 about the measure
@entity68 believes kids unfamiliar with guns are more likely to play with them and pull the trigger
kids who grow up with guns , " they get it
" a number of other states have taken steps encouraging schools to promote gun safety
the @entity65 noted the @entity8 law 's signing on its legislative website , but the group did not respond to efforts seeking additional comment
but in testimony before the @entity106 earlier this year , @entity65 executive vice president @entity104 said the group has a " long and proud history of teaching " safe and responsible gun ownership across the board and to kids , in particular
" our ' @entity64 ' children 's safety program has taught over 25 million young children that if they see a gun , they should do four things : " stop
tell an adult , " he said
@entity64 is a mascot dressed as an eagle who addresses gun safety issues for children in pre-k through third grade
" the purpose of the ' @entity64 ' program is n't to teach whether guns are good or bad , but rather to promote the protection and safety of children , " the organization 's website says , adding that its purpose is to prevent accidents
@entity140 , a @entity54 spokesman , told @entity0 the program is optional for school districts and is not mandated under the new law , which authorizes schools to seek public grants to fund safety programs
states tighten , loosen gun laws after @entity45 conflicting opinions still , @entity150 , a @entity8 resident and mother of two young children , thinks gun safety should stay out of her kids ' classrooms
" i think i 'm a lot more interested in teachers and the legislature being focused on math , science and reading for our first - graders instead of an @entity65 curriculum
i trust the parents to teach the kids properly about the power of guns
that is where the responsibility lies , not in a school curriculum , " she said
" there are too many kids who grab the guns and kill their cousins
i agree , i think they should know gun safety
it would be helpful , " @entity179 told @entity0 affiliate @entity180
two studies critical of gun safety programs pediatricians and gun safety experts say , however , that the efforts behind the measure may be misguided
for instance , a 2004 study on firearm - related injuries in children , published by the @entity191 , found that gun safety programs for children were ineffective , " do not prevent risk behaviors and may even increase gun handling among children
" another 2004 study of the " @entity64 " program , published by @entity201 's @entity200 , found that children were able to verbally repeat the program 's message , but when they encountered a gun in a role - playing scenario , they were unable to put the skills to use
the @entity209 study said one shortcoming of programs like " @entity64 " was the absence of active learning approaches
when and how do parents educate children about guns ? " information - based programs are less successful because they do not actively allow the children the opportunity to practice the skills being taught , " the study said
former police investigator and gun safety expert @entity222 said " kids do n't have the emotional maturity at that age
" @entity222 is a security consultant for schools and workplaces and is also a parent
he said schools have to play a bigger role in the gun safety discussion but " in concert with the parents
" " part of the issue has to be educating the parents to keep the guns secure first
because it does n't matter if the kids have been to a gun safety program or not , " said @entity222
she said the responsibility behind gun safety lies with parents and not with teachers
but @entity104 told the @entity106 in january that " teaching safe and responsible gun ownership works " and stressed that firearms accidents are at their lowest levels in more than 100 years because of safety programs like " @entity64
" @entity68 said first - graders should n't be doing experiential learning with guns and felt the " @entity64 " video would be enough
