in the @entity10 , we 're reminded of some other female athletes of the two - legged variety who also beat the boys at their own game
@entity16 finished third at the 2009 @entity17 on saturday
@entity18 -- tennis in 1973 , @entity18 was 29 years old and the reigning queen of women 's tennis
in an era when female athletes were paid significantly less than their male counterparts , @entity18 still managed to earn $ 100,000 in 1971
@entity26 had won @entity27 back in 1939 , but by the 1970s his star was fading
he kept his name in the press by proclaiming himself a male chauvinist pig and declaring that women athletes could never be as good as men
after defeating @entity34 in may , he proclaimed " i want @entity18 ! " the much - hyped " @entity36 " was held at the @entity35 on september 20 , 1973
the idea of a woman beating a man in any sport was so unbelievable at the time that @entity42 oddsmakers heavily favored the 55 - year - old @entity26
a worldwide television audience watched via satellite as @entity18 neatly thrashed @entity26 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 and 6 - 3
@entity18 not only took home the prize money and several endorsement deals , she also opened up a new playing field for professional sportswomen

@entity51 -- shooting @entity51 's father was a @entity55 state rifle champion , so it was logical that both she and her sister took up the sport as children
when @entity51 attended @entity60 in the early 1960s , she won her varsity letter by competing on the men 's rifle team
in 1976 she became the first woman to represent the @entity65 on its @entity67 shooting team
the small - bore three position competition calls for the shooter to fire off 40 shots each in the standing , kneeling and prone position
the competitors fire from 50 meters away at a target that is a little smaller than a dime
at the end of the competition , @entity51 was tied with @entity78 , the team captain
@entity78 requested a tie - breaking shoot - off , but @entity67 rules forbade it ; instead , @entity78 was awarded the gold medal because he had scored three " 100s " to @entity51 's two
during the medal ceremony , @entity78 pulled @entity34 up from the silver pedestal to stand with him during the national anthem to indicate that she deserved the gold as much as he
@entity88 -- baseball @entity88 , known to her family as " @entity88 , " entered the world ahead of schedule and weighed only a little over three pounds at birth
as soon as she learned to walk , her father took her to the ballpark
the @entity88 's next door neighbor in @entity97 was future hall of famer @entity98 , who was still playing in the minors at the time
he coached @entity102 in the art of pitching when she was eight years old and even showed her his trademark " drop pitch , " a dazzling throw in which the ball swooped down just before crossing the plate
when @entity88 was 17 she was offered a contract with the @entity112 , today the @entity114 affiliate of the @entity115
on april 1 , 1931 , the @entity116 were in town to play an exhibition game against the @entity112
the game was postponed a day due to rain , and there was a crowd of 4,000 on hand when @entity88 finally took the mound
@entity125 stepped up to the plate and southpaw @entity88 threw her special pitch
@entity125 took the first pitch for a ball , but the next three were strikes
@entity133 , baseball 's @entity134 , was up next and similarly struck out
the crowd was on its feet , but some skeptical reporters wrote that the whole thing had been staged , since the game was originally scheduled for @entity141
nevertheless , commissioner @entity142 was sufficiently threatened by the tiny female dynamo that he had her contract voided , stating that baseball was " too strenuous " for women

@entity149 -- cycling to @entity152 , 100 - mile events are kid stuff
ultra cyclists consider events like the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) -- a 2,950 mile cross-country jaunt -- to be a real competition
@entity149 of @entity159 , @entity160 , has won the female division of @entity156 an amazing six times , and her finish times in each case usually placed her in the top 15 finishers overall
@entity166 requires about 20 hours of continuous pedaling per day , up hills ( a combined total of about 82,000 feet of climbing ) , down dales and in all weather
@entity172 holds the record for the @entity174 to @entity115 race ( beating even the best men 's time ) and was the overall winner of the 1995 @entity179 508 , which runs from @entity180 through @entity181 to @entity182
@entity16 -- auto racing @entity16 's parents met on a blind date at an auto race , so she felt that racing was her destiny
@entity189 started competing on the go - kart circuit at age 10 , and moved to @entity192 at 16 to participate in various racing events and advance her career
in 2000 , she finished second in the @entity195 , the highest finish by an @entity65 in that event
she moved back to the @entity198 where she competed in the @entity199 for @entity200 and won her first pole position
@entity189 started her @entity17 career in 2005 , making her only the fourth woman to compete in the 500
three years later she won the @entity204 in the @entity205 , the first female driver to win an @entity208 race
@entity209 -- competitive eating at five feet , five inches tall and just under 100 lbs. , @entity209 gives the impression that the slightest breeze could blow her away
but despite her wispy stature , @entity213 is known in competitive eating circles for blowing away the competition , including male contestants three times her size
@entity213 remembers being inspired to enter the world of competitive eating after watching @entity221 munching his way to the championship at the @entity226 's @entity225 hot dog contest in 2002
in 2005 she set a record for female frankfurter consumption in @entity226 's annual contest
that was n't quite good enough for @entity209 , however , and she began a training regimen that included walking two hours per day on an inclined treadmill and eating only one large meal per day
scientific - types hypothesize that @entity209 's slim physique gives her an advantage over her more zaftig competitors -- she lacks a layer of fat around her abdomen , which gives it more room to expand
whatever the explanation , @entity213 has defeated all - comers in various @entity247 contests , including " the most " oysters , chicken wings and @entity251 hamburgers downed in a prescribed amount of time
