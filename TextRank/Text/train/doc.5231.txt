an x-ray shows a bullet lodged in a baby 's head
the image would be chilling enough without knowing the child was still in its mother 's womb when it became the target of snipers hiding in the shadows in northern @entity12
and it 's not the only one
volunteer doctor @entity17 , a @entity18 surgeon who 's worked in several @entity12 hospitals with the charity @entity20 , says snipers are playing a " targeting game , " and heavily pregnant women are on the hit list
" most of the children removed were seven , eight , nine months gestation , which meant it was fairly obvious to anybody that these women were pregnant
" young children are also being targeted , @entity17 said
polio cases suspected in @entity12 photos provided to @entity32 by @entity20 show a young girl with painted nails lying in a hospital bed with head wounds
she appears no more than five years old
another , around the same age , lies under a green sheet with a gaping wound to her forehead
@entity17 said 90 % of surgeries he performed on any given day were for sniper wounds
on some days , the wounds were suspiciously similar
" after a while we noticed that there were certain trends going on , " @entity17 said
" we had some days , say , 10 or 15 gunshot wounds of which eight or nine of them were targeted in one particular area
so for example , one day , we received say 15 , 16 gunshot wounds and of that eight to nine were targeted in the left groin only
" then the following day they were targeted in the right groin only
so it seemed to me like there was some of thing going on -- a game going on -- between the snipers
" @entity65 said other local doctors he worked with told him they 'd heard snipers were receiving little presents -- like packets of cigarettes -- for people they 'd shot during the day
@entity18 foreign secretary @entity72 : no role for @entity74 in future @entity12 desperate dash for supplies in video obtained by @entity32 from @entity81 , men , women and children try to outrun snipers ' bullets as they cross from the regime - controlled enclave of the city to rebel - held areas
they risk their lives because food and provisions are on the rebel side
but their homes and families are on the regime side
desperate , they make a dash for supplies
not everyone makes it through
it is a scene reminiscent of another conflict : @entity103
its capital , @entity106 , was literally under siege from snipers of the @entity109 for more than four years
but during that war in the early 1990s , the @entity111 operated humanitarian corridors to ensure that , despite the fighting , aid still got through
@entity17 also volunteered in @entity103 and described his relief back then at seeing extra supplies trucked in
" it was wonderful to see the lorries coming in with @entity120 written on them
and when you saw one of them , you knew that that they were filled with food , provisions and medical aid for the besieged town
" he says @entity12 desperately needs the same
" now is the time to develop a humanitarian corridor to allow health and aid workers to go in , and not feel threatened on the way in and not feel threatened on the way out , " he said
" i felt very scared going in and coming out and this is n't right
" in northern @entity12 , rebels use satire as a weapon
