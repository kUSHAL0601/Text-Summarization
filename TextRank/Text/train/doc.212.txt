-- the @entity1 has finally gotten around to acknowledging that tweeting is n't just for the birds
in its latest update , the dictionary that describes itself as " the accepted authority on the evolution of the @entity7 language over the last millennium " has revamped the entry for " tweet " to include its social networking usage
although the move may seem behind the curve given the widespread use of " tweet " to refer to activity on @entity19 , the dictionary 's chief editor says he 's actually broken one of its rules by including it so soon
" a new word needs to be current for ten years before consideration for inclusion , " @entity23 wrote on the dictionary 's website
" but it seems to be catching on
" the dictionary 's entry for tweet now includes the verb -- " to make a posting on the social networking service @entity19 " -- and the noun -- " a posting made on the social networking service @entity19
" they sit alongside the well established bird - related definitions of the word , whose traces go as far back as the 16th century , according to the dictionary
by recognizing that people can tweet , too , the main @entity1 is playing catch up with its smaller , snappier cousin , the @entity46
the concise dictionary , a different product that seeks to be " progressive and up to date , " already included the word " retweet " -- meaning to repost or forward a message posted by another user on @entity19 -- in its 12th edition in 2011
but the mother dictionary , which began life in the 19th century and contains information on more than 600,000 words , tends to move more cautiously in adding and revising entries , something it does four times a year
it has nonetheless ingested several new tech - related words in this month 's update , along with " tweet
" they include " big data , " " crowdsourcing , " " e-reader " and " mouseover
" and in a belated nod to 1990s pop culture , the dictionary has also just added the @entity76 catchphrase " to have a cow
" @entity77 -- the dictionary 's editor , not the cartoon character -- points out that while @entity76 made the slang term popular , its use can be traced back to 1959
that means it took more than half a century to find its way into the dictionary 's pages , a far longer journey than the rapid rise of the non-avian " tweet
" it 's settled ! creator tells us how to pronounce ' @entity94 '
