in 2004 , sen. @entity0 entered the campaign against incumbent president @entity2 with a seemingly unassailable advantage on a sensitive issue -- the liberal @entity0 served in the @entity5 , and the conservative @entity2 did n't
rather than avoid the topic , @entity2 supporters came up with the notorious " @entity12 " campaign that raised enough questions about @entity0 's war record to negate a major strength
such " attack the strength " tactics have been a staple of this year 's presidential race , with both sides trying to undermine perceived advantages of the other
the latest example is a new web video that accuses president @entity22 of engineering classified leaks and claiming undue credit on his signature foreign policy achievement : the raid that killed @entity27
the premise is simple : in a political environment where perception often trumps policy , mount early challenges to your opponent 's strongest attributes to raise questions and create an alternative image in the minds of voters
for example , the @entity22 campaign has attacked certain @entity44 nominee @entity43 's successful business career , portraying the venture capitalist company he founded as a pioneer in outsourcing @entity48 jobs
the purpose was to blunt @entity43 's persistent claim that his business background made him better qualified than @entity22 to manage the slow - recovering economy , the most important issue to voters
meanwhile , @entity43 's team is challenging @entity22 on the volatile issue of reforming @entity57 , the popular health care program for senior citizens
by naming @entity62 chairman @entity61 as his running mate last week , @entity43 and his team knew the @entity22 campaign would attack @entity61 's proposal to partially privatize @entity57 , so they have tried to turn the tables by accusing the president this week of cutting more than $ 700 billion out of the government - run system
both of the attacks are misleading or untrue , according to independent assessments
websites such as @entity73 and @entity74 ruled that outsourcing by @entity43 's company , @entity76 , occurred after he gave up daily management responsibilities in 1999
on @entity57 , the nonpartisan @entity78 found that reforms to the program under @entity22 's 2010 health care law resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in savings , rather than spending cuts that reduced benefits , as alleged by the @entity43 campaign
@entity73 rated the @entity43 campaign 's claim as " mostly false
" to @entity44 strategist @entity90 , the @entity43 camp 's maneuver on @entity57 was " a brilliant move
" " they are going to be attacked on it anyway
they have ' jujitsued ' this , " @entity90 told @entity94 on friday , adding : " it 's a good idea to try to neutralize this issue right now , which i think they are being very effective at
" outside groups supporting the candidates also are taking part
a video spot by @entity105 , a super-pac backing @entity22 , sought to link @entity43 to the death of the wife of a steel worker who lost his job at a plant closed down by @entity76
the ad , which has yet to be scheduled for broadcast , was rated " false " by @entity73
now , a little - known group of former special forces members called the @entity115 has released the 22 - minute web video that criticizes @entity22 on the @entity27 takedown
a spokeswoman says the group has raised about $ 1 million toward an advertising campaign in some key swing states , but refused to discuss donors
over a picture of @entity22 , the video 's narrator says that the group 's mission is to stop politicians from using sensitive intelligence about the @entity27 raid and other clandestine programs for political benefit
the organization , which describes itself as nonpartisan , shares an office with two @entity44 political consulting firms in @entity137 , @entity138
its spokesman , @entity139 , worked for the @entity2 administration as a spokesman for the director of national intelligence , and its president ran for @entity144 as a @entity44
to @entity146 of the @entity147 , the video evokes memories of the @entity12 campaign that mounted a barrage of negative attacks against @entity0 's war record
" @entity22 's strong suit actually is on national security , " said @entity146 , the vice president and director of governance studies at @entity147
" he 's the guy who got @entity27 , and that 's been a central claim of his campaign
so there 's always a risk of the opposition coming in with this type of ad to try to undermine the president 's credibility and take away what is really his strong suit
" the president has regularly cited the killing of @entity27 as a campaign promise he fulfilled , and the head of special operations , adm. @entity173 , recently told @entity94 that @entity22 deserved credit
" make no mistake about it : it was the president of the @entity48 that shouldered the burden for this operation , that made the hard decisions , " @entity173 said
like other top officials , including defense secretary @entity184 and former defense secretary @entity185 , @entity186 also has been highly critical of recent leaks about clandestine operations
the @entity189 has denied leaking classified information , and two federal prosecutors have been assigned to investigate recent leaks about the @entity194 virus and drone strike operations
@entity44 blame @entity22 for the leaks that occurred on his watch , and they call for an independent investigation
the " attack the strength " tactic is nothing new , but gained prominence last decade when utilized by @entity44 strategist @entity203 , who guided @entity2 's two presidential campaigns " @entity203 did something that many other political operatives do n't do , and it 's really an element of why he 's a unique figure in @entity48 political life , " journalist @entity205 said in a @entity207 documentary titled " @entity203 : the architect
" " he understands that while other people look for the weakness in an opponent and exploit that , @entity203 has long looked at the strength of an opponent
" that was particularly true of the @entity12 attacks on @entity0 , said @entity205 , co-author of the book " @entity222 : how @entity203 made @entity223
" " the no. 1 thing that @entity0 offered was his heroic service in @entity227 , " @entity205 said in the @entity207 documentary , " and so what @entity203 did was attack the strength of @entity0 , not his weakness
" others clearly took notice
in attacking @entity43 's background at @entity76 , the @entity22 campaign is following the example of former house speaker @entity237 from the @entity44 primary campaign
@entity240 's criticism that @entity43 's business record included shutting down companies and outsourcing jobs got panned by many fellow @entity44
in response , @entity240 said his attacks were only the initial salvos of an all - out assault on the issue that @entity43 would face from the @entity22 campaign if he became the nominee .
