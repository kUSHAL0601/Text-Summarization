@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 said he is satisfied with the steps @entity0 police are taking in response to the death of officer @entity7 , but renewed his call for a federal investigation into instances of police friendly fire
officer @entity7 was shot to death by another officer on may 28
@entity7 , 25 , a black officer , was shot to death may 28 by a fellow officer , @entity15 , who is white
@entity7 was off duty at the time
@entity7 was in plainclothes and carrying a handgun as he chased a suspect past a police car , authorities said
@entity15 shot him after @entity7 failed to drop his weapon when ordered to , they said
officials said @entity15 said he did n't realize @entity7 was an officer
" every white cop that shot down a black cop , i would believe it was a mistake and not because of racism , but it takes special training for them to know , " @entity2 , @entity25 - @entity0 , told @entity1 's @entity26 on saturday
in the wake of @entity7 ' death , the @entity35 has implemented sensitivity training and provided guidance to officers on identifying themselves
in a statement , @entity2 asked the @entity42 to look into " police department practices , training of police officers and whether and to what extent race was an issue in the tragedy
" the shooting prompted @entity0 gov. @entity52 to commission a task force to investigate shootings between police officers statewide , spokeswoman @entity50 told @entity1 on saturday
@entity35 deputy commissioner @entity55 pledged saturday to assist @entity52 's investigation
also saturday , the @entity35 released a list of 10 @entity0 officers killed in cases of mistaken identity since 1930
five of the officers were @entity63 or @entity64 ; five were white
the list does not include officers who were injured by friendly fire , and does not specify whether the officers killed were on or off duty
the formation of the @entity0 task force came after @entity52 met with state officials , clergy members and civil rights leaders , including the rev. @entity75 , in a closed - door meeting friday
the group called for an independent investigation and the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the @entity35 incident
" we are handling this sensitively , " @entity52 told reporters after the meeting
" there may be issues that involve race , [ but ] we are not discussing any institutional or direct racism
" the governor spoke of what he described as a " high percentage of @entity63 and @entity64 police officers who were shot either on or off duty by friendly fire
" however , the commission will examine friendly fire incidents between all officers regardless of race , according to @entity50
the task force will ask @entity35 and police departments across the state to provide any data related to shootings where officers were either killed or injured by other officers
the governor said the task force will look at the statistics to " determine if there 's any disproportionate sense that any particular group has been victimized more than any other
" @entity52 said that he would " not close the door " on an independent investigation or special prosecutor to look into the death of @entity7 , but would rely for now on the investigation by the @entity0 district attorney and the @entity35
the focus of the task force , the governor said , would be to prevent friendly fire among all police officers , regardless of race , and to instill confidence in the state and community that such incidents are investigated properly @entity1 's @entity127 contributed to this report .
