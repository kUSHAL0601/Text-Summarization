in his memoir , " @entity6 , " @entity0 chronicles his journey from " irreverent young drunk " to ultra-runner
the author sobered up by running five miles at a time , then 10 , then 50
it was @entity0 's editor who first suggested he write about his road to recovery
" i told him point - blank , ' no one wants to hear me cry about how i f * * * ed up my own life , ' " @entity0 said
" and i was totally wrong
" when " @entity6 " was published on @entity17 's @entity16 list in 2011 , it hit no. 1 , bumping @entity19 out of the top spot
the book 's popularity may have been a surprise to @entity0 , but experts know he 's not alone in using exercise to overcome addiction
groups have been popping up around the country to help people stay sober by staying active
" it 's a great way to introduce people into something that then later becomes ... sort of their coping mechanism , as opposed to picking up a drink or a drug , " said @entity31 , one of this year 's top 10 @entity32
@entity31 's nonprofit , @entity39 , provides free athletic activities and a sober support community to thousands of people in @entity43
in 2008 , the @entity44 pledged $ 4 million to research the effect of physical activity on drug use
preclinical research has provided evidence that exercise can help treat -- and even possibly prevent -- addiction , and now human trials are taking place
according to the @entity44 , abuse of illicit drugs and alcohol contributes to the death of more than 100,000 @entity57 every year
while intervention and treatment programs have improved , relapse rates range from 60 % to 90 % in the first year of sobriety , the institute said
" habits play an important role in our health , " the institute 's director , dr. @entity63 , said in a @entity66 newsletter
" understanding the biology of how we develop routines that may be harmful to us , and how to break those routines and embrace new ones , could help us change our lifestyles and adopt healthier behaviors
" psychology professor @entity76 researches the effects of exercise on addiction in laboratory rats
one of his first preclinical studies on the subject showed lab rats that had access to an exercise wheel in their cage were much less likely to self - administer cocaine than their sedentary counterparts
he and his colleagues have also completed several follow - up studies , duplicating the results with male and female rats ; with low , medium and high doses ; with heroin ; and with different models of substance binges and relapses
" i was amazed at how consistent the effects of exercise were , " @entity76 said
other researchers have published animal studies with similar results
for example , a 2009 study in @entity107 showed treadmill exercise reduced morphine use in male rats
and in 2011 , a study in the journal @entity114 demonstrated animals ' preference for saline over amphetamines when they exercised
" these results lead us to conclude that a previous practice of regular physical activity may help in preventing amphetamine addiction , " the study 's authors wrote
while evidence mounts that exercise may help prevent and treat addiction , scientists are trying to figure out why
to get clean , addicts often give up their past social lives , including any friends who use
during their recovery , they have a lot of free time and not a lot of support
exercise and sporting groups could help fill that void , said @entity140 , a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at @entity143 and director of addictions research at @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147
when @entity140 and his colleagues started their human study on exercise and alcohol abuse , they theorized that physical activity would reduce the depressive symptoms alcoholics often suffer from , thereby reducing the risk of a relapse
they asked one group of study participants to work out once a week with the rest of the group and to work out on their own another two to three days
at the end of a three - month follow - up , the researchers found the exercise group had fewer drinking days and fewer heavy - drinking days than a group that did n't exercise as regularly
what the researchers did n't expect was feedback from participants who said they enjoyed the structure that regular exercise provided to their lives
" they liked the fact that they were getting healthy and doing something for themselves , " @entity140 said
exercise provides a " high " that could be important for addicts trying to combat cravings , experts say
in addition to decreasing anxiety and stress , physical activity helps increase levels of dopamine in the brain
dopamine , a chemical that 's associated with feelings of pleasure , is often diminished over time by substance abuse
some researchers have hypothesized that addicts are simply replacing one addiction with another
@entity76 's response ? fantastic
" one of those addictions leads to basically a devastation throughout all aspects of your life and probably premature death , " he said
" the other addiction leads to improved cardiovascular health , better self - esteem , better self - efficacy and maybe some joint problems when you get older
it 's an apples - and - chain saws comparison
" @entity140 has more theories on why exercise may help addicts stay clean
in unrelated studies , exercise has been shown to regulate sleep , a common problem for addicts early in recovery
it can even improve cognitive function , something that 's often impaired by chronic substance abuse
" these are just hypothetical , " @entity140 said
" they need to be tested
" while scientists search for more answers , @entity0 said he is content knowing that running works to keep him sober , day in and day out
" for me , exercise is the opposite of alcohol , " he said
" alcohol is the easiest , fastest and most effective way of saying : ' i do n't care
i do n't care about the good things in life or life at all
' " exercise , especially for someone who has been a sedentary alcoholic for a long time , is brutally difficult
and , as such , it 's a very meaningful way of saying : ' ok , i actually do care now
i care enough about my life that i am willing to endure this torture to get better
' " doing the hard work of exercising totally reversed my worldview
i went from a life that was headed toward one thing to a life of nearly infinite potential
