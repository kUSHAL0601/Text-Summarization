-- the wonder of travel lies equally with adventure and misadventure -- there is nothing like getting thoroughly lost in a riddling country or culture that is not your own
but it is hard these days , with our ultra-planned excursions , fixers and 4g service , to get properly disoriented
labyrinths , however , can remind us how it 's done
these mazes have appeared in various corners of the world throughout history
one can be found in a petroglyph on a river shore in @entity23 , @entity24 ; cut into the stones of @entity27 's many medieval churches ; and arranged in a contemporary land - art installation at @entity29 in @entity30
traditionally , they kept evil in and invaders out
they have been used as pleasure walks , meditative journeys and symbolic life - into - death pilgrimages
classical thinkers @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 each praised the @entity43 maze of @entity44 that @entity45 constructed in the 19th century @entity46 to protect his @entity48 tomb
( @entity41 called it a wonder of the world
) before taking to the high seas , @entity53 sailors built stone labyrinths to trap sinister winds that might follow them
@entity57 famously used one to trap a minotaur
literary figures also embraced the labyrinth
@entity63 writer @entity62 's peculiar love of them is well known -- he wrote once of gods who lived in them , encircled by forking paths
lesser known is @entity70 's affinity , particularly for the large rambling hedge maze at @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 ( since gone ) , where she wished to walk every day
@entity75 once wrote , " the only true voyage of discovery ... would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes , to behold the universe through the eyes of another
" that heightened sense is n't developed so much by traveling the world as by remembering to focus on where we stand
and the wonder of unexpected encounters , the anticipation of what might lie around the next corner , is a charm of labyrinths of all kinds , from the underground city of @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , to the overhanging gardens of @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102
departures : @entity105 's best sculpture parks @entity106 , @entity97 , @entity98 cut into one of the long , finger - like stone formations that make @entity97 famous , the underground city of @entity96 is an eight - level warren of traps and wrong turns descending about 200 feet into the earth
believed to have been built in the seventh or eighth century @entity46 by the ancient @entity116 people , it was subsequently enlarged by early @entity117 to foil the armies of various @entity120 empires
nearly 20,000 people could live behind its sealed stone doors for nearly four months , and presumably any soldiers who had the misfortune to pursue them through the narrow passageways would get lost or be squashed by one of the @entity129 - style rolling - boulder traps
@entity130 , a town that houses one of the best collections of cave churches in the region , is nearby
the more recent chapels are decorated with extraordinary examples of @entity138 painting ; do n't miss the sinister frescoes at @entity140 ( the @entity141 )
@entity142 , @entity143 , @entity102 a rose labyrinth , laid into the floor at @entity143 , was arranged by a bishop in 1360 for an @entity148 celebration of the liturgy of vespers
during the ceremony , a representative walked to the labyrinth 's center , killed @entity155 ( known until that time as the minotaur ) , triumphed over death and illuminated the world with a yellow ball that he tossed to his audience
the @entity162 labyrinth is designed as a single path that coils and unfurls , turning back and forth within a 40 - foot circle
now , once a month , chairs that normally cover the display are moved so pilgrims can walk the maze -- replicas of which exist at churches and mediation centers all across the world -- to symbolically move , as at the crypts , toward reconciliation while passing from life into death
walkers are exhorted to engage fully in body and spirit for true meditation , leaving themselves open to moments of grace
departures : stunning library architecture @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity74 hedge mazes evolved out of the twisting paths of knot gardens popularized during the high @entity190 -- an exercise in ordering nature
until the era of @entity194 of @entity74 ( aka @entity194 ) , hedge mazes were unicursal , following a single path , rather than puzzles riven with wrong turns and dead ends that were meant to disorder human perception
in 1700 , @entity194 commissioned the famous hedge maze at @entity201 's @entity185 , and the trapezoidal labyrinth remains the largest and most famous of its kind in @entity74
( supposedly visitors can get lost for hours
) the palace itself , complete with a great medieval hall where @entity209 performed and @entity211 's tapestries still hang , is worth the visit
@entity213 , @entity214 the @entity215 may not be as famous as those in @entity217 -- they have fewer passageways lined with piles of bones and are less centralized , consisting of hundreds of connecting tombs
but one particular crypt , separate from the rest , far outstrips any bone pile
the @entity213 , below the @entity226 church on the @entity227 , was built when the order relocated in 1631 , with 300 cartloads of exhumed friars in tow
the resulting display of skull - pile archways and spine - section " rose windows " -- now comprising roughly 3,700 skeletons -- are meant to remind us ( according to the @entity238 ) of the swift passage of life into death
they also serve to remind us of @entity244 's peculiar brand of surrealist acuity
departures : top travel apps @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity24 the fort at @entity249 , in the state of @entity250 , is known as @entity248 ( or @entity248 )
it was built as a massive labyrinth , or bhul bhulaiya ( another of its nicknames ) , to confuse and delay any invaders who had been able to solve the riddle of its names and locate it on a map
the architecture is early @entity264 , mimicking the @entity266 styles , and is the only building in @entity249 without @entity269 architectural influence
it was commissioned in 1784 to employ the poor during a drought
even after its completion , @entity273 , the @entity274 's commissioner and nawab ( a person of high status ) of @entity249 , spent hundreds of thousands of rupees annually on the hall 's decoration
wandering from room to room through the halls is now its own wondrous indulgence
@entity287 , @entity288 since 1398 , the @entity287 complex in @entity288 's mountains has housed the @entity291 -- the entire @entity293 scriptures carved onto more than 81,300 wooden blocks and said to be among the most accurate in the world
it was declared a @entity297 597 years later
thousands of monks from around the country make the trip there every october to carry the block scriptures on their heads in parade
each spring , a maze of colored lanterns is arranged in one of the facility 's courtyards in a labyrinthine form derived from the swastika , which in @entity312 usually refers to the intersection of truths
those willing to participate in morning and evening prayer are welcome to do a temple stay ( templestay.com ) and wander the colored maze or the mountain paths and shrines along the rugged face of @entity322
departures : top private movie theaters @entity325 , @entity101 , @entity102 in @entity101 , @entity102 , the hundred - year - old boxwoods of the overhanging gardens of @entity100 are still handshaped into a delightful hedge maze that recalls equal parts @entity330 and @entity331
@entity332 , counselor to @entity333 , built the comparatively simple castle just before the @entity335 as a summer home , complete with terraced gardens and walks
in 1860 , half a century later -- in a fit of romantic effulgence that shifted the style from flat - topped , spiraling hedge motifs to whimsical three - dimensional landscapes -- @entity344 began planting the boxwood garden
( hedge mazes in @entity74 at the time were being torn down
) here , the sole purpose of the intricate walkway -- nearly four miles of paths curl around 54 acres of garden and land -- is pleasure
( leave it to the @entity102
) walkers can admire other visitors over the many hedges , not to mention wide views of the @entity359
