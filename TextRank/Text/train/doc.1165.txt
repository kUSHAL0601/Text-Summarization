-- @entity1 was n't ready to see his friend dr. @entity2 in her condition : tethered to an oxygen tank , hardly able to speak , living with only one lung , her tiny , frail body ravaged by cancer and barely visible under her blankets
empowered patient extraordinaire : @entity2 with her daughter @entity10
but as he approached the hospital bed in her tiny @entity13 , @entity14 , apartment , he saw that she was typing furiously on a laptop computer
@entity2 , he learned , did n't let cancer -- in her lungs , chest and brain , and on her spinal cord and her vocal cord nerves -- get in the way of helping others
" [ i have ] about 2,000 rare - cancer patients under my gimlet stare , " @entity2 wrote about the patients she communicated with on the @entity25 , a web site @entity1 founded
" i have had three deaths and another person dying in the last month among the people whom i advise
the last two current ones are breaking my heart
" many of these patients say @entity2 is the reason they 're alive today
a @entity37 , @entity39 - born pediatrician who practiced in the @entity40 and @entity41 , she was found to have leiomyosarcoma , a rare and aggressive cancer , in 2001
she corresponded online with her fellow patients nearly every day -- sometimes all day -- until she died february 6
" i owe her my life , " cancer patient @entity45 wrote in tribute to @entity2 on the @entity25 web site
@entity50 explained that @entity2 convinced her to see a doctor who specialized in sarcomas , a move @entity50 said got her the treatment she needed
" @entity2 gritted her teeth and would not let go of me until i went to the right kind of doctor
she was polite , but snarky at the same time
and of course , she was right
" read more tributes to @entity2 " she was the most powerful patient advocate i 've ever known , " @entity1 added
" the world is missing a hero , " wrote @entity62 , whose wife , @entity63 , for eight years has been battling synovial sarcoma , a rare type of soft tissue cancer
@entity62 writes under the alias ' @entity69
' " i remember at one time there was a question as to whether the tumors had spread into my wife 's spinal cord or brain
we had nowhere to turn
@entity2 was herself starting a new chemotherapy treatment and was extremely tired , but sent me a three - page e-mail explaining in detail what options we had , " @entity62 wrote on the @entity25 site
" she never candy - coated anything , but we knew that she loved everybody who ever asked her a question
" with a mother - hen style , @entity2 pushed the cancer patients under her " gimlet stare " to hire the right doctor , fire the wrong doctor and find the latest treatments , which can be very difficult for rare cancers
she urged them to question doctors who told them there were no options left ; she 'd been told the same thing when her cancer was first diagnosed
" when she joined the @entity25 list in 2001 , she was told she had one month to live , " @entity1 remembers
" her ability to be up on the latest research and to impart the knowledge was uncanny , " wrote @entity103 , nursing director of the @entity104 at @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity14 , who worked with @entity2 to help patients on the @entity25 site
" even when she felt ill herself , she did research and communicated tirelessly with other patients
" sometimes @entity2 showed impatience for others in her leiomyosarcoma group
if she felt someone was n't moving quickly enough to fight @entity118 , which can spread at lightning speed , she let them know in very blunt terms
" i get very exasperated , very bitter and very worried about the people on this list , " she wrote to one woman
" [ some of them ] put their heads in the sand
... if one has high - grade @entity118 , one has to hit the road running
" @entity62 paid tribute to her forcefulness on the @entity25 site
" if she was in the @entity136 or @entity137 , there would be peace in the world now -- that is how strong she was , " he wrote
but she also showed great compassion , inspiring others on @entity25 to keep searching for the newest treatment
" together we are more , and more effective , than we are separately , " she often told her fellow cancer patients
signing off on one message , she wrote , " celebrate being alive
" @entity0 's @entity147 contributed to this report .
