@entity0 , @entity1 -- on friday in @entity0 's @entity5 , 5,000 members of the public were served a free hot curry , free apple juice and an array of fresh groceries
the lunchtime feast , dished up by volunteers -- including the @entity12 and the mayor of @entity0 , @entity14 and -- was made entirely from ingredients that otherwise would have been wasted , such as fresh but cosmetically imperfect " wonky " fruit and vegetables that fail to meet the supermarkets ' strict cosmetic standards
the event demonstrated how easy it is to reduce the unimaginable levels of food waste both in the @entity24 and internationally , and how governments , businesses and individuals can all help to change the way waste has become rife in our globalized food chain
putting on an event of this scale has involved hundreds of volunteers and numerous partner organizations and charities
before the event , over 300 volunteers have given their time to wash , peel , chop , cook and serve the delicious curry
the ingredients themselves have been sourced from farmers who donated several tons of vegetables and fruit
during the event , @entity47 , a charity which serves up community meals made from surplus food , put on cookery demonstrations in the @entity52 led by popular @entity24 chefs
tons more food donated by farmers was passed on to @entity56 , a food redistribution charity that feeds vulnerable people who may not otherwise eat a square meal
in addition , around a ton of surplus apples was delivered to @entity5 so that passersby can press them to make fresh juice
@entity65 brought along four pigs to eat the leftover apple pulp
feeding 5,000 people is a challenge , but according to my calculations , if we could hypothetically save all the food wasted across the @entity24 on any one day , there would be enough to feed 60 million people ( i.e. , the entire nation ) and still leave some over for tea - time
the aim of these activities is to demonstrate that everybody can gain by tackling food waste
the food we buy and eat is part of an international food supply chain
in straitened times it becomes ever more important to address the chronic problem of wastage in food production on farms , in factories , in supermarkets , restaurants , and in homes all across the world
saving food really does help alleviate hunger , in rich countries as in poor ones
tackling food waste is also good for the environment
in my book , waste : the @entity102 ( 2009 ) , i calculated that 10 % of all greenhouse gas emissions come from producing food that no - one eats
waste has become so endemic to food production , that we now take for granted attitudes and practices that our ancestors would be appalled by
for example , until 10 years ago , pigs in @entity112 were often raised on a diet of food scraps
today , however , @entity112 livestock is raised on a diet of soya imported from @entity119
soya is expensive for farmers , and its cultivation contributes to the destruction of the @entity125 rainforest
because pigs fed on specially - grown soya no longer eat waste food , this creates the further problem of how to dispose of food waste
@entity133 currently sent to landfill , for example , decomposes into methane , a greenhouse gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide
the answer , as the event on friday aimed to demonstrate , is to bring common - sense back into the food chain : eat what you can , redistribute what you ca n't , feed food not fit for humans to pigs , and only then turn to other waste solutions , such as composting or anaerobic digestion
we , the public , have the responsibility , and the power , to demand change
80 % of consumers in the @entity24 want businesses to cut food waste , and @entity159 is urging everyone around the world to sign the pledge calling on food businesses , governments and citizens to stop wasting so much food
food businesses , restaurants and retailers are being urged to sign up to the @entity170 and commit to tackling waste
we all have a role in ending the global food waste scandal
the opinions in this piece are solely those of @entity176 .
