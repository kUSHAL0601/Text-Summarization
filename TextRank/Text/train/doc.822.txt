genetic test predicts brain aging disorders such as @entity4 's disease and @entity5 's
a @entity7 study , announced in january 2008 , details an unprecedented method to predict brain aging disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , called als or @entity4 's disease , and parkinson 's disease
investigators identified several gene mutations that predicted which people are at high risk for @entity12 and @entity5 's , which afflicts a million @entity18
people with one set of genetic mutations were 2,000 times more likely than normal to develop @entity12
those with the other set are 400 times more likely than normal to suffer from @entity5
researchers say this approach may be used to predict other complex diseases such as @entity26 's , strokes , diabetes and cancer
they say , for example , if a test is developed that predicts someone is at high risk for diabetes , that person can change his or her behavior through exercise and diet to prevent the disease
what does this mean for people who will get these diseases ? dr. @entity44 , @entity45 chief medical correspondent : you ca n't prevent diseases like @entity5 's or @entity12
but researchers hope that by showing there are gene mutations that cause these brain diseases , new drugs will be created to prevent them
brain cells go from the brain and travel down to the end of the spinal cord
this pathway tells these brain cells which direction to go in the body
but if something goes wrong and there is a mistake in where the cells are told to go , this is enough to cause a disease
let 's say the cell travels from the brain , but stops at the shoulders or at the chest -- this could cause als or @entity5 's
keep in mind that these are devastating conditions
one million @entity18 have @entity5 's , which causes shakes , stiffness and slow movement
@entity12 , which causes muscles to waste away and leaves patients totally paralyzed , affects 30,000 people in the @entity18 how accurate were they in predicting who could get @entity12 and @entity5 's ? @entity44 : very accurate
more than 90 percent of the time , researchers correctly predicted who would get als or @entity5 's
they were also able to predict the age when people would get these diseases with 85 percent accuracy
there is n't a way to prevent these diseases , but this research could be used as a model to develop other tests that could predict diseases such as cancer , diabetes and strokes
this could actually end up saving lives
let 's say someone finds out they 're at high risk of getting diabetes
they could start eating healthy and exercising more to delay or prevent the disease
what are the implications of this ? @entity44 : it will allow other people to make similar tests for a lot of other diseases in record time
it 's possible they could make a simple blood test that tells people at birth what diseases they 're likely to get
for example , if you see that someone is likely to get @entity127 , you can start getting that kid special schooling
let 's say another person is at high risk for prostate cancer
you can start getting them tested early , at age 30 .
