it was a historic walk that observers say was in line with his appetite for the extreme and the high - wire customs of his " @entity14 " family
pumping his fist in the air , @entity1 sprinted the last few steps on the wire
after touching down on @entity20 soil , he embraced his family , grinning ear to ear
the tense 1,800 - foot journey took 25 minutes , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity25
" i 'm extremely blessed to be where i am , " @entity1 said after stepping onto @entity20 soil

" it has n't sunk in yet , " he told @entity39 , which broadcast the event
" this is something that i 've played over and over in my mind for the last 20 years , and to finally be here at this point , it is very surreal
as i said as i left that wire , i 'm extremely blessed to be where i am
" @entity1 described the difficulties of dealing with the wind and heavy mist from the roaring falls
" it 's all about the concentration , the focus , and it all goes back to the training

" it 's been a dream of mine for a long time , " @entity1 told @entity0 before the @entity4 attempt
" i 'm one of those people who always tries to overachieve
i want to do more
i want to do bigger things
