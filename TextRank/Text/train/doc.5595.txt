-- the new 15 - inch @entity1 will be a significant departure from the current design , with a retina display and an ultra-thin profile , @entity6 claims , citing sources from @entity9 's supply chain
it will be so thin , in fact , that it wo n't have room for an optical drive , just like its lightweight cousin @entity15
other design changes include a power button on the keyboard itself ( replacing the eject button ) and , possibly , the lack of an @entity21 ( replaced by an extra @entity22 )
the @entity1 's new retina display -- the same technology that 's in the new @entity25 -- is described as " definitely the most important @entity27 innovation in years " by the sources who 've handled a prototype of the device
the specifics are unknown , but users should be able to choose between several @entity34 resolution modes
finally , the new 15 - inch @entity1 will have usb 3.0 support , and the latest @entity37 processors from @entity38 are a safe bet , too
if these rumors are true , the new 15 - inch @entity1 might be one of the most important macbook devices to see the light of day in recent years
how do you like these specifications ? what do you think about a 15 - inch @entity1 without an optical drive ? share your opinions in the comments
