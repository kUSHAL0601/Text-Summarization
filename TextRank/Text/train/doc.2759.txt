@entity0 -- @entity4 author @entity3 's first adult novel went on sale amid a buzz of anticipation thursday -- but reviews suggest those hoping for a repeat of the charms and wizardry of the @entity13 books may be disappointed
" @entity26 " is firmly aimed at those in the grown - up world , with the writer 's pen dissecting social inequality , small - town politics and snobbery -- with sex , abuse and a mouthful of swearing thrown in for good measure
muggle moms await @entity3 's first adult book set in the fictional town of @entity32 , in western @entity30 , it centers on a local election following the death of a parish councilman -- and relies on what reviewers agree is a cast of finely drawn but generally unpleasant characters to bring this insular world to life
" we are firmly in muggle - land -- about as far from the enchanted world of @entity4 as we can get , " wrote @entity42 in the @entity43
" there is no magic in this book -- in terms of wizarding or in terms of narrative sorcery
instead , this novel for adults is filled with a variety of people like @entity4 's aunt and uncle , @entity59 and @entity60 : self - absorbed , small - minded , snobbish and judgmental folks , whose stories neither engage nor transport us
" the @entity66 newspaper 's @entity64 judges it " a solid , traditional and determinedly unadventurous @entity30 novel " but praises @entity3 's depiction of the " claustrophobic horror " of a small - town community , with plenty of scheming and " everyone knowing everyone
" sales of the book , which was released in paper , online and e-book form in @entity81 and the @entity82 on thursday morning , will no doubt be closely watched
but while @entity3 's publisher , @entity84 , and booksellers seem confident the tome will prove a bestseller , the mad rush and predawn lines that awaited some of the @entity4 releases were not in evidence
early sales seemed slow at a central @entity0 branch of the @entity96 's bookstore chain , where stacks of the hardback novel , with its stridently red and yellow cover , were unwrapped and ready for buyers
opinion : @entity3 explains why muggles are obsessed with class @entity96 's spokeswoman @entity104 said preorders had been " fantastic , " suggesting @entity3 commands a legion of devoted readers willing to give her new venture a try , even if they 're not beating down the doors to the store
" having known and loved her writing for the past 15 years , the world has been waiting to see what she did next , " @entity104 said
" ' the @entity26 ' has reminded us all just how popular she is and how committed her fans are
" store manager @entity119 of @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 , told @entity1 that interest in the novel had been building for months , with lots of advance orders
" people ca n't wait for this , for it to finally hit the bookstore , " she said
while the book is certainly different from @entity3 's previous works , @entity119 predicts it will win fans if readers realize it 's " an extreme opposite from @entity4 " and go into it with an open mind
@entity4 is certainly a tough act to follow
the seven - book series sold more than 450 million copies and spawned a multibillion - dollar film franchise
details of the new book 's content were kept largely under wraps ahead of its release , with @entity3 speaking to only a few media outlets in the @entity81 and the @entity82
those critics lucky enough to get their hands on an advance copy also had to keep their reviews on hold until thursday
but one young woman in @entity0 told @entity1 why she 's looking forward to reading it
" i think it will be really interesting to see how @entity3 writes something else that is n't @entity4 , that is n't aimed at children or young people , " she said
" i 've heard lots about ' @entity26 ' as being a political satire and more of that , so it 's going to be nice to see if she pulls it off
" a representative for @entity84 said that presales of the novel had gone very well and that the idea behind the limited prepublication access to the book was to make it as " normal " a launch as possible
the first print run in the @entity82 is 2 million copies , the publisher said
but with limited information leaked beforehand , many parents will probably be wondering thursday if the book will appeal to -- or perhaps be suitable for -- children who have grown up loving @entity4 's world of muggles and magic
will @entity3 net wizard profits from switch to crime ? @entity42 of the @entity43 is unequivocal in her judgment
" this is definitely not a book for children : suicide , rape , heroin addiction , beatings and thoughts of patricide percolate through its pages ; there is a sex scene set in a cemetery , a grotesque description of a used condom ... and alarming scenes of violent domestic abuse
" the novel contains moments of genuine drama and flashes here and there of humor , but it ends on such a disheartening note with two more abrupt , crudely stage - managed deaths that the reader is left stumbling about with whatever is the opposite of the emotions evoked by the end of the @entity4
" in @entity81 's @entity221 newspaper , reviewer @entity219 notes @entity3 's use of humor -- but also paints a black image of the overall mood
" @entity26 " is " sometimes funny , often startlingly well observed , and full of cruelty and despair
one teenager cuts herself to relieve her misery , another commits suicide
online pornography is described in gynecological detail , " she writes
" it feels as if the author has unleashed all the swearing , sex and vitriol that have been off - limits to her since @entity240 was published in 1997
as for the ending , dear @entity242 , it is so howlingly bleak that it makes @entity244 look like @entity245
" other reviewers bandy about big literary names such as @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 as they dissect @entity3 's minute grasp of plot and characterization
the @entity254 calls it " an old - fashioned novel , a thoughtful , angry and densely plotted story in the 19th - century tradition , set in a town in which class and racial divisions run deep
" @entity263 reviewer @entity262 finds much to enjoy in its pages , saying : " what surprised me about ' the @entity26 ' was not just how good it was , but the way in which it was good
" i suppose i 'd expected a kind of aged - up , magicked - down @entity4
... but ' @entity26 ' is a different beast entirely
it was not what i was expecting
it 's a big , ambitious , brilliant , profane , funny , deeply upsetting and magnificently eloquent novel of contemporary @entity30
" but posing the question of whether it can ever live up to the hype , the @entity274 's @entity273 says no. " not unless you want to have more than 500 pages of relentless socialist manifesto masquerading as literature crammed down your throat , " she writes
as for @entity3 , she told the @entity283 that she had written the book by choice , rather than necessity , since the success of the @entity4 series has made her wealthy
" i had nothing to prove
i do n't mean that in an arrogant way
i can pay my bills every day , i am grateful for that fact
i do n't need to publish , " she said
but while the novel was born of an idea that excited her and is " personal in the sense that it deals with broad themes that have affected my life in a very real sense -- poverty for example , " @entity3 thinks it likely her next book will be for children
for those yearning for a return to the more familiar territory of @entity13 , however , the @entity81 author has little hope to offer
" it was murder saying goodbye , but i truly -- where @entity4 's story is concerned , i 'm done
now if i had a fabulous idea , i would do it
but i 've got to have a great idea
