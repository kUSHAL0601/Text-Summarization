-- they have blown out in spectacular style and drawn criticism from one of the world 's top drivers , but @entity7 insists there is nothing wrong with the tires it supplies to @entity12
@entity7 came under intense scrutiny after tire degradation led to four retirements at june 's @entity17 @entity16 , while @entity19 's two - time world champion @entity18 recently described the tires as " not good
" @entity7 's ceo has defended the rubber provided by the @entity24 manufacturer , suggesting some drivers are not using the tires correctly
" i have to say that he was very nervous when he said that , " @entity28 told @entity0 when asked about @entity18 's remarks at october 's @entity30 , which was won by newly - crowned drivers ' champion @entity31
" it was not because of tires -- he was n't able to win for a number of reasons
if they did n't use the tires properly , it 's not our fault
" @entity7 is in the third year of its agreement to supply tires to @entity12 , and @entity28 does not rule out the possibility of extending the company 's deal beyond 2015
he warns that , if the working relationship between @entity12 and @entity7 continues , teams should pay attention to the advised limits of each tire compound
with @entity12 bosses asking for tires not to last as long , in order to make the racing more exciting , pit - stop strategies have become more important -- and teams have been pushing tires to the limit in their search for an advantage
" we can do whatever is needed , but with the respect of the rules , " the 65 - year - old said
" it means tires have to be used within the limits we provide teams
" while @entity7 's reputation in the paddock might have taken a knock , @entity28 insists the brand itself has not adversely affected by its association with @entity12 -- earning $ 1.5 billion on sales of over $ 8 billion last year
" we had some damages for a few weeks after @entity79 , " he admits , " but i think today people understand it was n't @entity7 's fault
" the 2013 @entity12 season continues with the @entity84 @entity16 in @entity85 on november 17 , before coming to a close in @entity87 seven days later .
