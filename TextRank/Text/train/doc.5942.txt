@entity20 , @entity21 : what 's in a name ? we 're to find out the answer for one couple in today 's edition of @entity0
from the @entity29 in @entity30 , i 'm @entity31
first up : @entity32 @entity33 : @entity32
the country is a partner with the @entity11 in the @entity36
it 's also dealing with terrorist attacks inside its own borders
that point made clear in yet another violent assault yesterday
government officials say an explosion in the country 's @entity45 , that 's in the northern part of @entity32 , killed at least 40 people and wounded at least 45 more
the blast took place at a security checkpoint
authorities say the target was a military vehicle
@entity56 forces took control of the @entity45 earlier this year , leading to a number of intense clashes with the @entity32 military
monday 's attack was the latest in a string of violence in the country , including a 22 - hour standoff over the weekend when militants took hostages at an army base
health care debate @entity33 : back here in the @entity11 , everyone watching the debate over health care reform has their attention focused on the @entity77 today
that is because the group is voting on a health care bill
this is the last committee vote before the issue moves to the @entity83 and @entity77
the bill that the @entity77 is considering is referred to as the @entity85 , named for sen. @entity86 , who heads up the committee
it 's a 10 - year plan that would cost the government $ 829 billion
but a new report says that @entity11 families would have to pay a hefty price as well
@entity93 says under the @entity94 , the amount that families pay for health care would go up 111 percent by 2019
the group says that under the current system , costs would go up 79 percent
a @entity100 spokesman says the report is inaccurate and self - serving
he points out that it was created by the insurance industry , which he calls one of the biggest opponents of health insurance reform
is this legit ? @entity108 , @entity21 : is this legit ? there is a @entity110 for economics
legit ! the award for economics was created in 1968 , adding to the existing @entity110 for physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace
@entity2 @entity33 : in the 40 years since the @entity2 was established , the winners had all been men
that changed yesterday , when @entity123 was named one of the recipients of this year 's award
the other winner is @entity128
they 're both experts in how the economy and businesses are regulated
@entity123 told reporters that when she first decided to pursue a post graduate degree , she was told that no major university would even think of hiring a woman
she 's proof times have changed
@entity137 @entity123 , nobel economics prize laureate : i think we 're entering a new , we 've already entered , a new era , and we recognize that women have the capabilities of doing great scientific work
and yes , i appreciate that this is an honor to be the first woman , but i wo n't be the last
@entity147 ? @entity33 : sticking with financial news , more than 80 percent of the country 's top economists believe the recession is over
that 's based on a survey done by the @entity154
however , most economists think it could take months before there 's any kind of serious improvement in terms of the housing market or job losses
the unemployment rate is expected to hit 10 percent between now and the end of the year , and to stay at that level through the first three months of 2010
@entity6 @entity33 : and looking overseas , that is where you 'll find secretary of state @entity169
she 's on a six - day trip to parts of @entity172 and @entity173 , addressing issues like arms control , health care and some long - running conflicts
@entity178 checks in from a stop in the @entity10 , where @entity7 was focused on the relationship between the @entity11 and one of its closest allies
( begin video ) @entity178 , @entity0 @entity184 , @entity185 were the handshakes with the foreign secretary a little firmer ? the smiles broader ? the hugs and kisses with the prime minister warmer than usual ? it seemed that way , as @entity169 put @entity11 and @entity195 's " special relationship " on display
@entity11 secretary of state hillary clinton : it is a special relationship
i have a special , personal relationship with the prime minister , and of course i think it ca n't be said often enough we have a special relationship between our countries
@entity206 : her mission : calm concerns in @entity210 that the @entity213 administration 's relationship with the government of prime minister @entity215 may be cooling
but on a range of international issues , there 's no daylight between the two countries
@entity222 : decisions about the future of @entity225 are up to the @entity225 people
but we will continue to speak out on behalf of human rights , on behalf of democracy , on behalf of freedom of expression , @entity232 , @entity10 foreign minister : our insistence that it is not for us to choose the government of @entity225 is clear
but also , our insistence that it is right to stand up for human rights around the world , for universal values , is also very clear
@entity206 : at @entity7 's next stops here in @entity243 and then in @entity244 , she highlighted another aspect of the special relationship : the @entity248 peace process
@entity222 : many people who are despairing over the prospects of peace look to @entity248
they think to themselves that if it could be done there , then perhaps we too have a chance to try to cross that border between conflict and peace and chart a different future for ourselves and our children
( @entity262 ) @entity263 @entity264 , @entity21 : time for the shoutout ! what is the world 's most popular sport ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity276 , b ) soccer , c ) basketball or @entity277 ) cricket ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the most popular sport in the world is soccer
@entity281 n't that a kick ! that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity12 2010 @entity33 : and next june , the soccer world will be focused on @entity12 when that country hosts the @entity289
imagine if the @entity290 included teams from around the world and only happened once every four years
that gives you an idea of how huge the @entity289 is
@entity295 shows us how @entity12 is preparing for the soccer spotlight
( begin video ) @entity299 , @entity0 correspondent : watered and protected from the hot @entity12 sun , these are the first green shoots growing on the pitch where the opening game of the @entity289 will kick off in june next year
stadiums across the country will be ready by early next year , say @entity308 officials , who with clipboards in hand , have just inspected of all the match venues
so , while all of these stadiums are on track to be completed ahead of time , despite workers downing tools and going on strike a few months ago , there still is a lot more work to be done to ensure @entity308 is satisfied
@entity322 , @entity308 president : for the time being , let us be with 7.5
@entity326 : that 's the score @entity308 president @entity322 gave @entity12 for the @entity328 played here in july , and which was seen as a test case for the @entity12
@entity308 and @entity12 are all too aware of where the problems were and where they remain
@entity334 , local organizing committee : the areas we have been focusing on are accommodation , transportation and security
those were the three key areas
@entity326 : the organizing committee here concedes if there are big matches at small town stadiums , like this one in @entity347 , there simply will not be enough places for fans to sleep
@entity351 : some of the host cities wo n't have sufficient beds , and therefore it means that we 'll have to go outside those host cities
@entity326 : also , transport remains a headache
the system is haphazard , irregular and often unsafe
a new bus transit system in @entity361 has started running , but its routes are limited
other towns have little or no organized transport systems
getting from host city to host city , most fans will have to rely on @entity12 's well - developed air network
the @entity361 airport will be open 24 hours , and much has been spent on upgrading its facilities , including managing and protecting the estimated 40,000 pieces of luggage expected through here a day
@entity375 , transport minister : if we had @entity289 in december , we would be already on top of the situation
@entity326 : police say they will also be ready to protect 500,000 fans traveling here next year
@entity295 , @entity0 , @entity361 , @entity12
( @entity383 ) before we go @entity33 : before we go , if you love your name so much , why do n't you marry it ? ok ! we 'd like to introduce you to @entity387 and her fiance , @entity388
the couple met online when @entity388 -- the female @entity388 -- searched for her own name , and @entity388 -- the male @entity388 -- was the only person who came up
coincidence led to courtship , and now the two are getting married
call it fate , call it karma ... goodbye @entity33 : ... or if you want to confuse them , just call the house and ask for @entity388
that 's the best we 've got
commercial - free news is the name of the game , and we 'll be back with more tomorrow
