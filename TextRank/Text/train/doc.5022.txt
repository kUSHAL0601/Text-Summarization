-- he is @entity2 's man for all seasons
as a mainstay of the team that won 13 @entity8 titles and two @entity10 cups under retired manager @entity11 , @entity4 provides a vital link to @entity2 's illustrious recent past
during 23 years with the @entity15 club , he has continually reinvented himself to remain a key figure in @entity19 football 's most successful team
from a pacey winger in the early 1990s to a yoga - practicing 21st century professional , @entity4 ' status as a revered veteran of @entity2 's golden age made him the only logical choice to step into the managerial hotseat vacated prematurely by @entity11 's replacement @entity26 last month
@entity4 was appointed manager on an interim basis , his four - game spell in the dugout coming to an end with sunday 's trip to @entity34
the 40 - year - old 's playing contract also expires in june , meaning for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century , the club could be absent from the life of @entity4
current @entity40 national team coach @entity39 is the man expected to take control of @entity2 on a full - time basis , but whether the former @entity44 boss will retain the services of @entity4 as a player or a coach is unclear
in a press conference last week @entity4 hinted that , should @entity49 arrive as is widely expected , he could pursue a coaching career at another club
but for one former member of @entity11 's coaching staff , retaining the services of @entity4 is essential if @entity2 are to bounce back from failing to qualify for the @entity54 for the first time since 1995
" what 's important is that @entity4 stays at @entity15 , " @entity56 , who was @entity11 's assistant manager at @entity2 between 2007 and 2013 , told @entity0
blog : is @entity2 the impossible job ? @entity56 , who was sacked as manager of @entity61 in february , thinks @entity4 is a figure of such stature within football that he could afford to skip a couple of rungs on the career ladder
" i do n't think he should go and manage a club in the @entity69 ( @entity19 football 's second tier ) , for example , " he explained
" @entity4 is an exception to that rule
" it is a common refrain within the game that great players do n't necessarily make great coaches
@entity81 @entity80 , for example , is rated by many as the finest footballer of all time but as a coach he struggled in charge of his native @entity87
a counter to such perceived wisdom is @entity80 's compatriot @entity90 , who was well - regarded as a combative midfielder and is now on the brink of leading @entity93 to a @entity54 and @entity95 title double
" it would be a transition both for the club and @entity4 but you have to give it time , " said @entity56 when asked if @entity4 should be appointed on a full - time contract
" giving @entity4 the job provides the chance to re-establish the @entity11 dynasty
that is the only way to do it if the club wants to try that route
" but if they go for @entity49 , @entity4 can learn from him
" by spending almost his entire playing career under @entity11 , @entity4 had the opportunity to learn from a giant of the game
the principles ingrained in @entity4 by the ruthless @entity113 , who brought the curtain down on his own career in may 2013 , could serve him well should he inherit his mentors old job in the near -- or distant -- future
" all his life @entity4 has shown he can manage his position on the playing field , but now he has to show he can manage everyone 's position at the club , " added @entity56 , reflecting on @entity4 ' credentials
" he has to decide what team to pick and what tactics to use -- he has to drop people that he has played with
but again i do n't see him having a problem with that
" most important -- can he manage the training ? @entity11 always stressed that what you do in training manifests itself in matches
" if what @entity4 achieved as a player manifests itself during his coaching career , @entity2 fans could have a lot to look forward to .
