-- president @entity1 needs to send @entity3 marshals to @entity4
they can protect the @entity7 women and children whom the federal government has sent out @entity10 , with more due to arrive every 72 hours under an immigrant redistribution plan hatched by the @entity1 administration
the next group of immigrants is expected to arrive on july 7
the marshals could ensure that nobody interferes with this federal law enforcement operation , as was done last week by angry protesters in @entity19 , @entity4 , a small town in southwest @entity20 , about 70 miles north of @entity21
it was there that the @entity24 had planned to process about 140 women and children who had , just a few hours earlier , arrived on a plane from @entity28
more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been caught trying to cross the @entity3 - @entity31 border since october
i 've written about immigration for 25 years and , from my many visits to the @entity3 - @entity31 border , and the tours i 've taken with @entity24 agents in @entity37 , @entity28 and @entity4 , i know this much : the war against immigrant smugglers is a battle of wits and a contest of wills
in managing the border children crisis , the @entity24 recently showed wits
now , by sending in the marshals , @entity1 can demonstrate the will
last week , on the @entity48 , @entity24 agents avoided some unpleasant fireworks by outsmarting dozens of those who are against the buses and those who are n't
both crowds had descended on @entity19 anticipating a repeat of what had happened three days earlier , when the group protesting the arrivals blocked and turned around three @entity56 buses carrying the women and children
in both protests , @entity19 police officers were on the scene
but during the first one , they were worthless
they should have arrested those protesters who blocked @entity24 buses and forced them to retreat
they were better during the sequel , and , in fact , arrested a handful of people
while the dueling crowds were facing off in @entity19 , the @entity24 took a detour from the airport and transported the immigrants to another processing center in @entity77 , about 15 miles south of @entity21
there will likely be more protests in @entity4 over the next few weeks
if things get out of hand , someone could get hurt
that 's why we need @entity3 marshals , to prevent that from happening
i should n't have to make federal case out of this , because it already is one
it 's a federal policy that lets these children stay in the @entity3 with relatives
they 're in the custody of a federal agency , in a federal law enforcement vehicle , driven by federal law enforcement officers
it 's the federal government 's job to protect its personnel and the people being transported and to ensure that this operation is not sidetracked by mob rule , even if that means arresting those who get in the way
the images coming out of @entity19 reminded me of another group of protesters intent on defying an order from the federal government : white @entity111 in the 1960s
they also terrorized children , african - americans who sought to attend desegregated public schools , much as the children on the bus were terrorized by the angry mob
it 's not a perfect comparison ; the children on the bus were undocumented immigrants , many of whom might qualify for refugee status if they can show " credible fear " of returning to their home countries
the @entity128 - @entity3 children were @entity3 citizens
still , i was n't the only person in @entity3 thinking that we had seen this movie before
" this green - eyed and blond - with - gray woman who is 74 years old can not believe that ' my fellow citizens ' have n't learned anything over the last 50 - plus years , " wrote one reader
" i remember college friends who went to @entity137 and @entity138 to help register voters , teach people to read , march for civil rights for all of us , no matter what color or race or socioeconomic status
opinion : the right fate for immigrant kids " the screaming and hateful people in ( @entity19 ) reminded me of the people who screamed at little black kids walking to schools ( accompanied by law enforcement ) , who treated @entity156 and @entity157 and so many young people horribly
it is so sad that after all these years , so many people have n't gotten a clue about decency and kindness
" in 1956 , @entity157 was the first @entity128 to attend the @entity164
in 1962 , @entity156 became the first african - american to attend the @entity166
both students were tormented by classmates
once @entity156 enrolled at @entity166 , rioting broke out on the @entity171 , @entity138 , campus
attorney general @entity172 sent 500 @entity3 marshals to maintain order and protect the civil rights pioneer
by trying to thwart the intent of the federal government , the @entity19 mob seems to want to relive the ' 60s
let 's go back to the ' 60s
send in the marshals .
