at least 52 people have died since battles ensued six days ago , lt. col. @entity11 said
@entity15 state media reported that the truce was to go into effect at midnight saturday , but army officers in the battle zone received no orders for a cease - fire , said @entity11 from the frontlines in @entity23
rebels from the @entity25 are continuing their offensive against government forces , he said
" we are left with no choice but to press on
" days of unrest the unrest has fueled fears of increased instability in a region where the central government is pursuing a new peace plan after decades of violence
the crisis in @entity23 began when large numbers of rebels from the @entity41 came ashore at the start of the week
the outbreaks of violence have killed 11 rebels , five members of the security forces and two civilians , @entity48
gen. @entity49 , a spokesman for the @entity15 military said friday
dozens of others have been wounded , he said
authorities estimated about 180 rebels are holding roughly 170 hostages in six districts
security forces blockaded affected areas , and the two sides have sporadically exchanged gunfire over the past five days
speaking friday at the @entity63 ' headquarters in @entity23 , president @entity61 warned rebel hostage - takers that they face the use of force if they further threaten civilians
" there are limits , if there is an increased threat to the safety to innocent civilians , " @entity61 said
" there are lines that they can not cross
if they cross those lines , we will be obligated to use the state 's force against them
" some hostages have managed to escape , and about 20 rebels have been detained , authorities said
thousands of people have been evacuated from the rebel - held districts in @entity23 , a city of about 800,000 on the southwestern tip of the island of @entity91
separatist movements the @entity25 , a separatist movement founded in 1971 by @entity94 with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for @entity97 in the mainly @entity5 , signed a peace deal with the central government in @entity100 in 1996
but some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign
last month , @entity94 issued a " declaration of independence " for the @entity112 nation -- referring to @entity91 's indigenous @entity41 population -- after complaining that the @entity25 had been left out of a recent wealth - sharing agreement with another insurgent group , the @entity106 , which has fought for decades to set up an independent @entity108 state on resource - rich @entity91
under the agreement signed this year , @entity97 will get a 75 % share of income derived from the exploitation of metallic minerals in the area -- reported to include gold and copper
@entity61 wants to achieve a lasting peace in the region by 2016 , when his term ends
agreements have yet to be reached on power - sharing and normalization , which means giving up arms
a report published last year by the @entity130 warned that the peace process needed to find ways to support insurgents as they build normal , civilian lives
@entity0 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .
