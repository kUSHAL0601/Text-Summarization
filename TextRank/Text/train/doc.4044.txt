-- @entity1 had been putting on weight lately , so those around her thought something was up
but she was on birth control , so if there was to be a baby , that would be a bit of a surprise
well , surprise ! @entity1 the hippopotamus is now the proud and doting mother of a healthy calf
the baby does n't have a name yet
the staff at the @entity15 has n't been able to get close enough to determine the sex of the newborn
according to a release from the zoo , @entity1 went into labor friday while in her outdoor pool but chose to gave birth on dry land
animal care staff was close by but all went well
new species of frog found in ... @entity28 @entity29 , child and father , known as @entity32 , can be viewed by zoo visitors each day
this is the first baby hippo at the zoo in 26 years
the staff had guessed that @entity1 was pregnant but only had limited testing options
@entity1 , 10 , came to @entity39 from @entity40 , @entity41 , in december and instantly bonded with @entity42 , who is 3 years old , zoo officials said
report : @entity44 may have faked pregnancy for more buns , bamboo @entity0 's @entity48 contributed to this report .
