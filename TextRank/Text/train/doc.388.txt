-- after a one - year hiatus , the @entity1 returned sunday with a different priority : security
it went off without a hitch as 47,000 runners raced through five boroughs and passed cheering crowds
last year 's marathon was canceled because of damage from @entity12
police were especially focused on security in part because of april 's bombings at the @entity17 , which left three people dead and more than 260 injured
at least 1,500 cameras were positioned along the route to help boost security , @entity20 police commissioner @entity19 said
there were baggage screenings and surveillance helicopters
runners were screened and inspected before taking their starting positions , according to police
. bomb - sniffing dogs and scuba divers scanned bridges and shorelines
counterterrorism officers escorted ferries carrying runners
@entity37 of @entity38 won the marathon 's women 's division with an official time of 2:25:07
on the men 's side , @entity43 of @entity38 won with an official time of 2:08:24
each will get $ 100,000 in prize money
opinion : how running can change the world in @entity20 , spectators watching from grandstands and family reunion areas were subject to baggage inspections and screenings as a precaution
" the safety of runners and spectators has always been our highest priority , " @entity58 , the organizers of the event , said in a statement
runners took it in stride
months after @entity69 bombings : sense of winning for amputee " it will obviously cause some problems for us , but that does n't matter , " said @entity72 , who was to run his 35th @entity1 this year
" @entity77 must come first , so i gladly accept delays
... i think most runners do
" organizers said a lot of additional security measures will be taking place in the background
" i know that it 's impossible to protect 26.2 miles of road 100 % , " @entity72 said
" the feeling about that is much like it was in 2001 after 9/11
" @entity90 parade reclaims marathon finish line @entity0 's @entity92 and @entity93 contributed to this report
