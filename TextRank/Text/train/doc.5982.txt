@entity0 -- a federal grand jury in the @entity0 has indicted two people for their alleged attempts to supply @entity6 with @entity8 materials for gas centrifuges to enrich uranium , the @entity2 said friday
the indictment charges @entity12 , an @entity6 citizen , and @entity14 , a resident of @entity15 , each with one count of conspiracy to violate the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) by conspiring to export the goods without the required license
both also face one count of conspiracy to defraud the @entity8 , two counts of smuggling , two counts of illegally exporting @entity8 goods to @entity6 in violation of @entity18 and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering , the @entity2 said
the indictment also accuses @entity12 of seeking to obtain for customers in @entity6 radioactive source materials from the @entity8
@entity12 , 43 , was arrested in the @entity30 in may
" this new indictment shows that we have no tolerance for those who try to traffic in commodities that can be used to support @entity6 's nuclear program , " @entity8 attorney @entity31 said in a statement
" it also underscores our commitment to aggressively enforcing export laws
" as a signatory to the @entity44 , @entity6 has the right , like other countries , to enrich uranium for commercial and research reactors
but the same facilities that are used for peaceful enrichment can be used to enrich uranium for a bomb
that 's what many @entity55 countries suspect @entity6 is doing
@entity6 insists its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes
among the materials @entity12 and @entity14 are accused of trying to obtain are measuring instruments , pressure transducers , vacuum pumps and maraging steel , a class of high - strength steel
all can be used in gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment
the indictment alleges they both also caused the illegal export of lathes and nickel alloy wire to @entity6 , and it accuses @entity12 of trying to obtain radioactive source materials
in 2009 and again in 2011 , he allegedly contacted an undercover @entity8 federal agent , posing as an exporter , asking the agent to purchase radioactive sources
a law enforcement official , not authorized to talk to the media , declined to say whether the radioactive and centrifuge materials made it through to @entity6
the lathes and nickel alloy wire were shipped from the @entity8 through @entity15 to @entity6
if convicted , @entity12 and @entity14 could face up to 20 years in prison for conspiring to violate @entity18 , five years for conspiring to defraud the @entity8 , 10 years for each smuggling count , 20 years for each exporting count and 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering
