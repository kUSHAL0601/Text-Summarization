-- even though he was ill , @entity1 could do little wrong in the early rounds at the @entity4
he led by seven shots at the halfway mark at @entity7 in @entity8 and , despite his advantage being cut entering the final round , still held a comfortable three - shot advantage as play began sunday
unfortunately for the @entity13 , he faltered and thus missed a chance to overtake the injured @entity15 as the world @entity16
@entity18 of the @entity19 was the unlikely winner , compiling a strong round to claim his first @entity23 title
@entity1 shot a four - over 76 , hitting five bogeys , to slip to third , two shots behind @entity18 's total of 275
it was n't the tournament he wanted ahead of the defense of his @entity31 crown next month
" i did n't putt well at all today , " @entity1 told the @entity32
" if nothing else it 's a good reminder on how much putting practice i need to do before going to the masters and just how important it is
" if i think back to last year , i made every putt that you expect to in that last round and ultimately that 's what gave me the chance to win
" every , who trailed @entity1 by four shots overnight , made up ground thanks to five birdies
but two bogeys on the last three holes gave @entity49 an opportunity to force a playoff
@entity49 , however , missed a birdie putt at the 18th that would have forced the playoff
@entity18 's drought was over
" it 's really cool , " @entity18 , who turned pro in 2006 , told reporters
" i have had a lot of looks ( at wins ) and i kept telling myself maybe it 's going to come somewhere special
i still ca n't believe i won
" it 's hard , it 's tough man
you just never know if it 's going to happen
