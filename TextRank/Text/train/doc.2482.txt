-- yes , this really happened ! a bunch of passengers left their seats to give their frozen plane a push at a snowbound airport in @entity8
that was the situation at @entity10 earlier this week where temperatures of minus 50 @entity11 left a @entity14 aircraft stranded on the runway
passengers rallied to the rescue when oil in the plane 's landing gear iced up , according to @entity20 , the airline whose livery the plane carries
according to the @entity25 website , there were cries of " @entity27 " as two rows of passengers , dressed in heavy coats and thick gloves , each took a wing and apparently began shoving the aircraft into position
" we all want to get home , " one of the burly volunteers was quoted as saying
video and images circulated on social media show the passengers succeeding in their mission , despite biting winds and freezing temperatures
@entity25 said @entity46 officials were investigating whether any aviation safety regulations had been breached by the unorthodox take off
@entity20 said the aircraft was operated by a subsidiary , @entity50 , and that the parking maneuvers of aircraft and departure conditions were the responsibility of airport ground services
" the problems at departure were caused by weather conditions , in particular , extremely low air temperature which is typical for this part of @entity63 region and sometimes gets as low as minus @entity64 , " an @entity20 spokesperson told @entity0
" while the aircraft was parked at @entity10 , its landing gear froze on to the aerodrome surface
in order to quickly resolve this issue the passengers assisted the tow truck to move the aircraft
" the plane and passengers were reportedly able to take off and landed safely several hours later in @entity63 , to the south of @entity10
thankfully there was no need for further pushing as the temperature at their destination was a balmy minus 11 celsius .
