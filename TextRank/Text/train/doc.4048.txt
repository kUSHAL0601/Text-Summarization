@entity0 , @entity1 -- residents of @entity4 , @entity5 , can begin going home sunday morning , more than a week after most of them evacuated ahead of @entity8
the staged re-entry through tuesday will include the villages of @entity12 , @entity4 and @entity13 , @entity9 announced thursday
" conditions , utility service and other supporting infrastructure in those villages is the most conducive for re-entry at this time , " the county said in a statement
" as conditions improve in the remaining villages , re-entry will be established and announced as soon as possible
" visitors will not be able to go to @entity4
instead , they can stay north of @entity25 , the county said
about 2,500 residents of the island who did not take part in a mandatory evacuation have been receiving vital supplies and services
the storm washed out a critical stretch of @entity34 , a road that runs parallel to the @entity36 and connects @entity4 to the other barrier islands on @entity5 's @entity38
causeways from those barrier islands connect them to @entity5 's mainland
meanwhile , president @entity42 declared a disaster in @entity1 , making federal grants and aid available to those who suffered losses from @entity8
the money can be used by individuals in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity54 counties for temporary housing and home repairs , according to the @entity57
low - cost loans are available to cover uninsured or under - insured property losses
counties eligible for federal funding to do emergency repairs and work are @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity50 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity72 and @entity54
the president issued disaster declarations earlier this week in @entity5 , @entity75 and @entity76
@entity77 killed 43 people from @entity79 to @entity80 as it marched up the @entity82 over the weekend , dumping torrential rain
some of the worst flooding struck @entity1 , @entity75 and upstate @entity76
ten - foot - high floodwater poured through @entity87 's 40 - year - old flooring business in @entity0 when @entity77 struck @entity1 over the weekend
the family business , where revenue has dwindled in the economic downturn , now faces at least $ 300,000 in damage
it 's devastating , " @entity87 said , her voice cracking
she is not alone , as the effects of @entity77 continue to be felt in flood - ravaged communities along the @entity97 @entity82
flood advisories remained in place thursday for portions of @entity76 , @entity101 , @entity75 , @entity102 and @entity103
in the days since @entity77 , the extent of the damage has become more evident in @entity106 , where the storm battered a cluster of communities 50 miles southwest of @entity110
" there is a lot of damage left to clean up
i know the town of @entity117 has been almost completely condemned , " said @entity114 of neighboring @entity115
" @entity118 is n't doing too well either , and @entity119 ( in ) @entity115 has been closed
" " it 's safe to say that we probably wo n't be back to normal in the @entity122 for at least a month
" in northern @entity75 , the @entity124 has begun to settle back into its banks , the @entity123 said
most locations are expected to drop below flood stage during the weekend as the high water works its way downstream
the development will be welcome news in the towns of @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , where about 1,700 residents were evacuated from their homes this week
@entity42 will travel to @entity137 on sunday to view the damage , the @entity141 announced
the full extent of @entity77 's destruction wo n't be known for some time
the federal government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $ 1 billion
analysts have put the total expected cost of @entity77 much higher
agriculture secretary @entity150 said thursday the storm also took a toll on agricultural production
" i had an opportunity to take a look at fields in @entity5 , " he said
" i have never seen anything like it
the corn was just totally destroyed
@entity160 hit hard , cotton hit hard
" it remains to be seen how some other crops , such as soybeans and tomatoes , fared , he said , but " it 's very clear that farmers in @entity5 , @entity102 , along the @entity82 have suffered pretty significant losses
" but , he said , it 's unlikely that higher prices will result , as " we have such a diverse agriculture in the @entity97 and we have so many acres planted and so many different crops
i do n't think this is going to affect much of anything
" the federal government 's tab for the storm could exhaust the $ 800 million left in the @entity57 's disaster relief fund before the fiscal year ends on september 30
with conservative @entity184 , led by rep. @entity185 , @entity102 , calling for spending cuts to offset any increase in emergency funds -- a measure opposed by many @entity190 -- the ability of @entity192 to act quickly on the issue remains uncertain
mayor @entity194 of @entity137 said he was " outraged " about the funding dispute
" @entity196 has a mind of her own , a will of her own , and we ca n't have the petty wrangling going on when we have folks in dire need , " he said
@entity75 gov. @entity204 echoed those sentiments during a news conference wednesday , saying , " we do n't have time to wait for folks in @entity192 to figure out how they want to offset this stuff with the budget cuts
our people are suffering now
and they need support now
" more than 1.1 million customers remained without electricity thursday from @entity5 to @entity216 , the @entity97 @entity213 said -- a decrease from the 1.7 million reported wednesday
@entity1 transportation officials made emergency repairs on roads to previously isolated towns , officials said
replacing washed - out bridges will take more time
in @entity0 , volunteers from across the state descended on the community to help with the cleanup
" i could n't sit at home
i had to come help , " said @entity230 , as she worked outside @entity87 's gutted flooring shop
@entity87 was touched by the gesture of so many helping hands
" they 're just people , " she said , pausing
" they 're neighbors and in @entity1 we 're all neighbors
" @entity2 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .
