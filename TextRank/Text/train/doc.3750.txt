for members of @entity3 , the @entity1 debate is getting personal
this week , lawmakers can begin their sign - up process for health care , and a @entity8 survey shows that while most senators and representatives plan to participate in the @entity1 exchanges , a sizable group is walking away from the government - coordinated exchanges and instead getting their healthcare in the private marketplace
the chart : who has signed up for @entity1 in @entity3 enrollment for the @entity19 and @entity20 opened monday and ends in early december , forcing lawmakers to make two big decisions : will they personally get coverage through an exchange -- either in @entity27 as part of their workplace or in their home state -- and if they sign on to the exchange as part of their job , will they take the thousands of dollars a year the federal government gives employees to help with premiums ? of the 118 members of @entity3 who responded to @entity8 , the clear majority plan to get coverage on the exchange as members of @entity3 , taking the employer contribution that comes with it
but nearly 20 % of those responding indicated they would not go onto the exchanges
some , like rep. @entity50 , @entity51 , are on @entity52 ; a few others rely on pension plans from previous jobs

most are republicans who see it as a statement about @entity1 and fiscal responsibility
" she came to @entity3 to fight @entity1 , not to enroll in it , " wrote a spokesman for rep. @entity67 , @entity68 , who is going directly to the private market for her health care
" he feels the taxpayers should n't have to shoulder those personal costs for him , " explained a spokesman for rep. @entity73 , @entity74 , who is also heading into the private markets
but it is not just republicans
" ( @entity85 ) declined the employer health - coverage ( on the exchange ) as part of his commitment to fiscal responsibility and saving taxpayer money , " reads a statement the office rep. @entity83 , @entity84 , sent @entity8
@entity83 will get health coverage through his wife 's plan

if they stay in the exchange , they could be accused of backing @entity1 and taking federal money for their health care
but if they leave , they could be accused of not participating in the system @entity3 invented and , as part of the @entity1 , decreed that lawmakers should personally experience
several swing - state and closely watched senators have found a possible political middle ground by joining an exchange as individuals , not as members of @entity3
under the current system , @entity3 essentially acts as a small business employer on the @entity27 exchange
thus , all members of @entity3 who want coverage and federal contribution dollars through their job have to enroll on that one exchange
but five senators are instead signing up as individuals through their home state , going through the exchange system but forgoing the federal dollars that would be attached if they signed up with their job in the @entity27 exchange
" i want to have the exact same experience and go through the same steps as other @entity134 when it comes to signing up for health care , " wrote sen. @entity130 , @entity131
@entity138 senator @entity137 is planning on doing the same in his state , as are fellow democrats @entity141 of @entity143 , @entity144 of @entity145 and @entity147 @entity146 of @entity148
no @entity19 members responded that they were moving to their state exchange
one rare category of lawmakers consists of those who are signing up as members of @entity3 , going through the @entity27 exchange , but who are nonetheless rejecting or returning the federal dollars that come with it

" same for sen. @entity163 , @entity164
rep. @entity165 , @entity166 , is still deciding exactly where he 'll get his health care , but if he goes with a plan as a member of @entity3 , his office told @entity8 , he will donate to charity the thousands of dollars in premium help from the government
still unknown is whether sen. @entity174 , @entity175 , who launched a fiery protest against the federal contributions to congressional health care plans , will take the money
his office told @entity8 that he does plan on entering the exchange as a member of @entity3 , but his staff did not respond to our repeated questions about whether he would take the contribution
members have until december 9 to decide if they want to get employer - backed coverage as part of their jobs .
