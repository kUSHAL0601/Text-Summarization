@entity0 , @entity1 -- hundreds of @entity6 workers , angry about proposed layoffs at a @entity9 factory , were holding executives of the company hostage tuesday , a spokesman for the workers said
@entity9 's @entity6 staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs
it is at least the third time this month that @entity6 workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations
executives were released unharmed in both previous situations
the latest incident started tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of @entity28
the workers were angry that @entity9 had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate , said @entity31 , a spokesman for the workers ' union
they did not want to harm the @entity9 executives , @entity31 told @entity2
one hostage was released tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the @entity9 building
the released man was a human resources director identified only as mr. @entity42 , because he has heart problems , union representative @entity40 told @entity2
@entity42 had a heart attack a few weeks ago , @entity40 said
the four others still being held are @entity46 , the head of operations ; two other executives ; and @entity42 's personal assistant , he said
about 500 employees were also outside the building protesting
a top @entity9 executive called the hostage - taking unhelpful
" the actions that are taking place today , led by a small minority of individuals , are not helping as we work for a positive resolution of this situation , " said @entity54 , @entity9 vice president with responsibility for manufacturing operations in @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity59 , in a statement
" the best way to resolve this matter is to continue the negotiations through the @entity71 to find a solution that 's fair to our employees and allows @entity9 to remain a leader in a rapidly changing global marketplace , " @entity54 said , adding that the company was " concerned for the safety of our employees
" @entity31 said all the workers wanted to do was negotiate with @entity9 and they were upset that the company did not show up to two earlier scheduled negotiating sessions
the employees being held in their office were being allowed to get food , @entity31 added
police arrived at the scene two hours after the incident began but it had not been settled
employees at a @entity6 @entity91 factory held a manager hostage for more than 24 hours wednesday and thursday of last week over a dispute about terms for laid - off staff
@entity96 , who was unharmed , was allowed to leave the plant in @entity98 , central @entity1 , early on thursday morning after talks between unions and officials from @entity1
earlier this month , the boss of @entity103 was held overnight before workers freed him after he agreed to reopen talks on compensation when the factory closed
@entity1 has been hit by nationwide strikes twice in the past two months .
