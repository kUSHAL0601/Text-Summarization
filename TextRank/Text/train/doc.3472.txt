@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 halted monday evening 's scheduled execution of a convicted murderer on procedural grounds , but rejected a plea to spare him due to mental retardation
the unanimous ruling from the seven - member court gave a reprieve to 52 - year - old @entity14 , who was condemned for bludgeoning a fellow inmate to death in 1990
he had been scheduled to die at 7 p.m. monday
justices said they would review whether prison officials needed public hearings before changing the drugs used in lethal injections from a mix of three to a single drug
@entity14 's lawyers also argue that the condemned convict should be spared because he has an iq of 70
the @entity27 @entity2 in 2002 struck down the death penalty for convicts with mental retardation , but @entity3 law says an inmate has to prove mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt , and a state court ruled earlier this month that @entity14 's lawyers had failed to do that
all justices except @entity38 refused to review @entity14 's appeal of that case
" i can not join in any ruling by this court that would allow the execution of @entity44 , who has been found by a preponderance of the evidence to have a mental disability , " @entity38 found
@entity14 was already serving a life term in the 1985 shooting death of his girlfriend , @entity50 , when convicted of killing inmate @entity51
the state announced last week that it was replacing its use of a three - drug cocktail to put prisoners to death with a single drug , pentobarbital
@entity14 's lawyers argued the decision required public notice under the state 's @entity61 , a question the court halted proceedings to consider
@entity1 's @entity66 contributed to this report .
