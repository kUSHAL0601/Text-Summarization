@entity44 , a nonprofit research organization advocating for more women in business , found that in @entity48 women hold 14.5 % of board seats , a figure that rose by only half a percent between 2009 and 2011
in @entity4 , women hold 16.1 % of board seats , an increase of less than half a percent from 2010
about 10 % of the top 500 @entity4 companies , and almost 40 % of @entity48 's 500 largest companies have no women on their boards , according to @entity44
in the @entity59 , where only 9.8 % of @entity61 companies are lead by women , and 44 % have no female board members at all , a report by former trade minister @entity65 estimated that , at the current rate of change , it will take 70 years to achieve gender balance in the boardroom
baroness @entity70 is founder of the 30 % club , which encourages company chairs to commit to achieving at least 30 % women on @entity59 corporate boards
she notes that , while there is a record number of women ceos in the @entity4 , " on the other hand , you 've got hardly any women on boards
" the @entity4 does n't have the same regulatory situation as boards in the @entity59 and parts of @entity86
in the @entity59 you can only do two terms on a board , so we 're seeing a turnaround for women , whereas in the @entity4 , people seem to get on a board and stay for a lifetime , almost
the pipeline is blocked forever
" despite this , @entity70 feels female ceos can influence the make - up of boards
" they can try to influence the chairman of their company by saying , ' look at the shortlist : how many women are you bringing on ? ' " they may also indirectly benefit others aspiring to senior positions
" a number of women ceos have children
they are looking to make change and to encourage the pipeline
there 'll be a few who wo n't be helpful but the vast majority of women ceos are doing all they can to encourage other women to go after these jobs
" more from leading women : want more female execs ? sort out the household chores companies with fewer females in senior positions might be shooting themselves in the foot
@entity44 has also analyzed the performance of @entity128 companies with women board members
it found that , from 2004 to 2008 , the @entity2 companies with the most female board directors outperformed those with the least -- by 16 % on return on sales and by 26 % on return on invested capital
companies which had three or more women on boards for at least four of those years outperformed those with the lowest rates of female representation by 84 % on return on sales , 60 % on return on invested capital and 46 % on return on equity .
