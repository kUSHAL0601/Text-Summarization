-- @entity1 was standing outside a shop window five years ago , marveling at the shiny pair of wing - tip oxfords he 'd just bought , when he started wondering whether such beautiful designer shoes could ever be produced in his country , @entity7
" @entity11 , " a nearby shoeshine boy purposefully declared after being asked by @entity1 ; later , at home , his friends were equally dismissive
" everyone was convinced that these high - end shoes could not be made in @entity7 , " recalls @entity1
despite not having any real knowledge about the shoe market , @entity1 , who was a banker at the time , decided to prove them all wrong and take on the world 's leading shoe brands
soon after , he teamed up with a friend and started @entity24 @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , a high - end shoemaking company based in @entity27 , @entity7
that was in 2011 , and one year later @entity1 quit his banking job to dedicate himself fully in his new ambitious venture
" we started buying machines ( and ) brought them over to the house , " says the young entrepreneur , who launched the company from his parents ' garage
" we had no intentions of starting the factory in the house , but one thing led to another and we just had to start
" wearing it with pride inside the @entity26 workshop , underneath fashion images hanging from its bright yellow walls , the startup 's workers are busy cutting pieces of leather and gluing soles at their work stations
the materials are imported from places like the @entity57 and @entity58 but all shoes are crafted by hand here
it 's a meticulous task , one the @entity63 staff tend to perform while wearing their bespoke creations -- anything from retro brogues and elegant loafers to stylish dress slippers and eye - catching @entity70
" they want their friends to ask them , ' where did you buy that ? ' and they say , ' no , we made it ; we made it in a garage , in @entity27 , with our own hands , ' " says @entity1
convincing people @entity26 , which currently has five full - time employees , has built a website to take orders and relies heavily on social media for marketing
yet , one problem for some potential customers is the cost -- from between $ 200 to $ 400 , the price would be limiting anywhere , let alone in @entity7 , where many people are still hit by economic hardship despite the country 's remarkable growth and record poverty reduction in recent years
" that 's an uphill challenge that we still face , " says @entity1
" it 's because most of this stuff is imported , " he explains
" you have to convince people that these things can be made here and these things is worth all the money we are asking for , " he adds
proving doubters wrong @entity26 has also started producing accessories such as so - called " empowerment beads " -- these are handcrafted creations made of glass and brass that are designed to represent all the hard work that goes into reaching a goal
it 's something @entity1 has learned first - hand , having taken the challenge of launching @entity26 to demonstrate that a high - end shoe brand can be made in @entity7
" the good things is we 're all quite young in the company -- everyone 's under 30 -- and we have a long time to prove people wrong , " says @entity1
" eventually people will not think of @entity26 and question it anymore -- people will think about it and think quality and think the most awesome brand coming out of @entity127 , " he adds
