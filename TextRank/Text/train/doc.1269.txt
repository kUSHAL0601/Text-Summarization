@entity1 's daughter was born a boy
but , from an early age , @entity1 says , his first - born made clear a preference for pink clothes , dolls and " anything princess
" the family lived in @entity9 at the time and decided to support her choices
she grew her hair long and wore pink clothes to school
she was 5 years old in december 2012 when she declared that she wanted to ditch the boy toys , pierce her ears and " live fully " as a girl -- pronouns and all , @entity1 said
her parents again decided to respect her wishes
since moving from @entity21 to @entity22 in 2013 , they 've only told school officials and close friends about her transition
they want people to get to know her without preconceived notions
@entity1 asked to withhold her name from this article to avoid making her a poster child on the internet for transgender youth
there have been ups and downs , but seeing his daughter happy on a daily basis leaves no doubt in @entity1 's mind that " this is the way she is
" when the opportunity arose for the family to walk in @entity22 's annual @entity48 this sunday , she was eager to participate to show that she 's not ashamed of who she is and that she supports others like her
" we are happy to be a part of something like the parade , and that 's because we are happy to be supportive of her , " @entity1 said in a phone interview from his @entity22 home
" she has taught us -- and i totally agree -- that it 's nothing to be ashamed of
" ' @entity48 is for kids , too ' the @entity1 walked with other families of gender nonconforming children in a group of 150 people led by the @entity67
the organization , which offers support services for families of transgender and nonconforming children , including the @entity1 family , walked under the banner " pride is for kids , too
" @entity77 , director of the @entity67 , says it was the first contingent in @entity79 to feature transgender and nonconforming youth and their families
" @entity67 and the participating families very much hope that such a positive demonstration of pride and support for gender nonconforming children and transgender adolescents will inspire other families to provide the supportive and caring environment these children need to live happy lives , " @entity77 said
the group 's presence at @entity79 was the latest effort from the transgender community to increase its visibility within the @entity100 rubric and beyond
it also comes at a time when legislators and school districts nationwide are weighing policies to protect and support transgender and gender nonconforming youth
" we 're definitely in the middle of a gender revolution and it 's exciting , " said @entity109 , medical director of the @entity110 at @entity111
" we 've come long way in a relatively short time , but the flip side is people are still being killed for being transgender , " she said
" we still have a long way to go
" transgender and gender nonconforming children and their families have been part of pride events across the country , she said
putting transgender children in the public eye through events like @entity48 underscores the message that gender nonconformity starts at an early age and is not something to be ashamed of , said @entity109 , who works with families of gender nonconforming children
research shows that allowing children to express their true gender identity from an early age leads to better mental health outcomes down the road , she said
after all , " transgender adults started as transgender kids , " she said
' we are a normal family ' coming out publicly as a family with young gender nonconforming children is not easy , and it 's not for everyone , said author @entity151 , who shares her family 's experiences with a gender nonconforming son on her blog , raising my @entity157
she started the blog in january 2011 to build a community at a time when even fewer existed than do now for families like hers
she wanted others to know they were not alone , but she did not want to overexpose her son or make him the sole focus of the conversation
ultimately , she and her husband decided it was worth the risk
to alleviate privacy concerns , she uses pseudonyms on her site and does not show her children 's faces
" we decided it was important for us to be advocates and for people to see that we are a normal family , " she said
she has learned to look beyond the hate mail and focus on the growing community she has helped build
besides , the benefits of having a happy son who feels comfortable in his skin far outweigh negativity from strangers and internet trolls
" there 's something empowering about owning it and saying this is who i am , this is who my kid is , and i 'm not going to hide him
i 'm going to celebrate him
" pride becomes family friendly @entity79 is open to anyone , regardless of age , said @entity203 , @entity79 director
youth participants have been a part of the march since the inaugural 1970 event , and organizers have long welcomed transgender youth and adults
" gender nonconforming and transgender individuals face challenges within our own community , say nothing of the vast array of perceptions they experience outside of it
compound that with the trials and tribulations of childhood and adolescence , and it 's quite obvious why these amazing young people deserve to see 2 million people supporting them along @entity229 , " @entity203 said
" what the world will see in return are smiling young faces , lit up by the ecstatic energy of rainbow - flag - waving spectators
if they 're ok with who they are , the world should be , too
" families , including infants and young children , have been a growing presence at @entity48 events across the country as they become more family - friendly
this year marked @entity48 's second " @entity254 " as part of the weeklong lineup , and @entity249 in uniform led the color guard at @entity48 under the @entity253 banner
with legislative support for same - sex marriage spreading , @entity79 organizers decided to invite transgender actor @entity258 to be grand marshal to draw attention to parts of the lgbt community " where progress in greater society is still needed , " @entity203 said
" understanding what it means to be a transgender individual is one of those areas
" ' acceptance is protection ' parents who make use of of the @entity67 's services started talking about participating in @entity79 earlier this year
involving children was a natural extension of the program 's goals to de-stigmatize gender nonconformity , program director @entity77 said
feedback from families over time has shown that " acceptance is protection , " and that people feel safe when they feel society accepts them
" the highest degree of acceptance is celebration , not that i just tolerate or accept you , but that i celebrate and embrace you , " @entity77 said
" there is value in saying it publicly
it 's saying to your child i will go out and i will publicly show the world that i really celebrate you and i really love who you are and i 'm not ashamed , " he said
some families preferred to watch the parade from the sidelines rather than march in it , @entity77 said
others , like @entity1 and his wife , discussed it with their daughter , but it was clear from the start which way she would lean
after all , this is a girl who told a boy in her first week at a new school in a new country that she was " born a boy but always felt like a girl , " her father recalled
" we were surprised that she was the one spreading the word , " he said
" but , as i see it , that 's who she is and i 'm glad to think she fully accepts what she 's going through
" people tend to underestimate children 's ability to understand and talk about their gender identity , @entity109 said
young children can tell if they 're different , but fewer challenge the pressure to conform to society 's gender standards
parental support helps them find the words -- and courage -- to express how they feel
" if your child says something to you then you know that they 're capable of having discussions about public displays of their pride , " she said
it 's true , people will judge you for your decisions , @entity109 said
but at some point , parents need to take a stand for their children
" you can suppress and oppress your child 's authentic gender so you do n't have to worry about what strangers think , but then you will have a very anxious child who will be at a high risk for very negative outcomes , " she said
" we should help children learn resiliency and to be confident and proud of who they are , " she said
hatred , hostility , even violence are all real risks whenever you take to the streets for an unpopular cause , she said
but , she said , history has shown that the willingness of some to take those risks " moves the world forward
