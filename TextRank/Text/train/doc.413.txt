editor 's note : join @entity2 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity4 at 11:10 a.m. et wednesday
if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you
a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 has said he will vote for @entity8 in november
he is the author of " listening to the @entity9 " and " speak , @entity10 ! a @entity12 's view of @entity13
" visit his web site for more information
@entity2 says @entity16 bucked other leaders and insisted on a 50 - state @entity19 strategy
( @entity4 ) -- if sen. @entity8 is able to prevail over sen. @entity21 on tuesday , all of those @entity19 who ripped @entity16 's 50 - state strategy over the last four years should call the head of the @entity25 and offer a heartfelt apology
first in line should be @entity29 sen. @entity28 , @entity30 , @entity31 , rep. @entity32 and my @entity4 colleague , political strategist @entity35
when @entity19 were in the final stages of winning back @entity37 in 2006 , those three were at odds with @entity16 , saying he should forget about his pie - in - the - sky plan to have the @entity19 competitive in all 50 states
they reasoned that money spent on get - out - the vote efforts in non-congressional elections was futile , and all the effort should be on reclaiming @entity37
but @entity16 resisted their suggestions , weathering repeated calls for him to resign after that election
@entity16 's insistence on having a @entity19 that existed in the heartland , and not just @entity52 , @entity29 and @entity53 , was brilliant in that it made clear that the party recognized the rest of @entity13
ireport.com : what would you ask @entity8 ? the @entity19 earned its liberal label because it ignored the moderate and conservative voices that paved the way for the @entity63 revolution to win three consecutive elections
yet the decisive wins were n't just on the national level
@entity67 is a prime example
what used to be a blue dog @entity19 state now has republicans holding every statewide office
but things are looking up
in @entity78 , all of the county positions except for a handful were in the hands of the @entity72 , especially the judges
that changed four years ago , and now the party could solidify itself this time around
the same thing in @entity83
the state 's most populous county saw @entity72 take everything in sight
this time around , democrats are poised to take back @entity89 and surrounding cities
@entity67 @entity19 leaders used to cry the blues when an election was near , but after seeing the massive turnout during the primary , they have been able to build their voter database and cultivate a new generation of politicians to run for office
will the state go red ? sure
but with a rock solid black vote , the ability to attract more @entity103 voters and a growing appeal to whites , @entity19 may soon make @entity67 a competitive two - party state
if @entity19 are going to achieve success on the national level , they must have significant enthusiasm on the local level
it 's hard to get your supporters ginned up for a national campaign if they see no infrastructure , especially local get - out - the - vote operations
when @entity8 announced that he was implementing a 50 - state strategy , he was laughed at
but here we are with six days left in the campaign and the @entity72 are having to spend precious dollars on ads in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , @entity72 locks in past elections
@entity8 deserves a lot of the credit for this because his " change " campaign theme , along with the horrible leadership of @entity72 nationwide , is helping his candidacy
but changing the attitude among the nation 's democrats was also vital , and that 's where @entity16 played a role
the former governor of @entity147 saw firsthand the sorry shape of the party when he ran for president in 2004
republicans , led by @entity152 , perfected their voter registration efforts , targeting voters down to the neighborhood , block and household
they knew that to win they needed a well - oiled machine that was n't activated every four years ; it needed to be active all year round and in every election cycle
so @entity16 put the people and resources behind substantial voter efforts in a number of states , and they went about rebuilding a crippled party that had no central voter registration effort , an outdated database of supporters , a fundraising arm that heavily relied on trial attorneys and @entity174 types , and a message that changed depending on the day
in addition to seeing how @entity8 performs on tuesday , we will also watch and see if @entity19 are able to increase the number of governorships and legislatures they control
that will be critical in 2010 , because that 's when the electoral map will be gerrymandered , redrawing the borders of congressional districts , and the party that rules the general assemblies , legislatures and governor 's mansions will write the rules to the game
old pols always said that all politics is local , and the only way for a revitalized @entity19 to expand its reach nationally is by re-branding the party on the home front
that takes time , money and leadership , and @entity16 was willing to put his money where his mouth is
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
