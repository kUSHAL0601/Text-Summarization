-- the world 's strongest storm of the year so far plowed across the northern @entity3 on monday , killing at least one person and leaving 20 fishermen missing
packing winds as strong as 200 kilometers per hour ( 124 mph ) , @entity6 made landfall early monday on the east coast of the @entity3 island of @entity11 , damaging hundreds of houses
" it 's the strongest typhoon we 've had so far on the planet this year , " said @entity14 meteorologist @entity13
" so that gives you some idea of the magnitude of this system
" @entity6 , known in the @entity3 as @entity23 , churned west - northwest over @entity11 , dumping heavy rain on the island 's hilly terrain and bringing the risk of landslides
it weakened as it moved over land , and by monday afternoon , it had begun to head out into the @entity31
aid groups in the @entity3 , which had been preparing for the storm 's arrival for several days , said they were only just beginning to assess the situation on the ground in the hardest - hit areas
" there 's a high risk that part of the population may get isolated because of landslides and difficulty moving around , " said @entity38 , country director for @entity39 in the @entity3
the country 's @entity46 reported one death in the province of @entity50 on monday afternoon
twenty fishermen who had headed out to sea before the storm 's arrival remained unaccounted for , the agency said
but dozens of others who had initially been reported missing had returned home safely , it said
the agency reported damage to 673 houses in the province of @entity64 , where the storm made landfall
the typhoon destroyed nearly 80 % of the infrastructure in @entity70 , a town that lay in @entity6 's path across the province , @entity0 affiliate @entity67 reported
the storm tore apart rickety houses and ripped the roof off a local hospital , the local broadcaster said , showing images of flattened homes buried under fallen trees
situated near an area of the @entity82 where typhoons form , the @entity3 regularly suffers severe storm damage
an average of 20 typhoons hit the @entity88 country every year , and two or three of those cause serious damage , according to @entity90 , an aid and development organization
@entity6 is expected to pick up more strength over the warm waters of the @entity31 over the next day or so before making landfall on the southern coast of @entity97 on wednesday
