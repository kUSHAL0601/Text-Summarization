-- a pop star wife , an estimated annual salary of $ 46 million and the most iconic player of this generation -- but to those who know the " real " @entity7 , he is just a " normal guy " and a " devoted dad "
when @entity7 announced his decision to retire from football thursday , there was one man who had already anticipated such an event
@entity14 , the assistant manager of @entity15 , became a close confidante of his compatriot @entity7 following the midfielder 's arrival in the @entity21 capital last january
nights in his exclusive suite at @entity24 were luxurious , but the distance between the 38 - year - old and the rest of his family is believed to be one of the key factors in his decision to retire
while his former @entity32 wife , @entity31 , remained at home with children @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , @entity7 spent time talking through his troubles to a man with a sympathetic ear
" the impression from the very first time we met was that he was a devoted dad , " @entity14 told @entity0
" he was very hands - on with the kids and , talking to people who knew him , i knew he wanted to be involved
" i think that being away from his family , them being in @entity48 and him being in @entity49 , was difficult for him
" we used to talk about our kids all the time and he asked me questions and we chatted about schooling and what they were up to
" he missed them and i think that was a huge part of his decision to call it a day
i just had a feeling he might retire
" in an exclusive interview with @entity0 last month , @entity7 spoke of the difficulty of being away from his family
" that 's the sacrifice i have to make as a father and as a husband : being away from my family , " @entity7 said
" it is only for a short time , but it 's difficult being away from the children every single day
they understand that @entity76 works hard
" it is an experience which has caused some anguish for the former @entity80 captain , who takes great pride in being both a father and a husband , but has had to balance that with a busy traveling schedule
not only has he played in @entity88 , the @entity86 and @entity87 , he has also kept up his many business and charity commitments and recently agreed to become a football ambassador for @entity92
" the kids have moved across the world and i think he wanted them to have some stability , " added @entity14
" the oldest , @entity35 , is 14 now and it 's important for him to get his education and feel settled and i think @entity7 felt that was crucial
" it was great to have him around and talk , but i 've got my family here and that 's been so good for me
" @entity7 has four kids and he really missed them
they 're a tight unit and he found it difficult
" for @entity14 , @entity7 's arrival came at time of personal tragedy
his friend and colleague , @entity15 's former nutritionist @entity110 , died in a highway accident last january
it was a period of great difficulty for @entity14 on a personal level and for all of those at the club
but in @entity119 , he found somebody to confide in and talk to -- a man completely different to that portrayed in fashion magazines and tabloid newspapers
" he 's just a normal guy , " said @entity14
" he 's quite shy in his own way , but he 's good to be around and he likes to have a laugh and be with his friends
" for me , it was great that he was there just after @entity110 died because that was an awful time
" it was great to have him around
it was a bit weird at first , because i 'd read so much about him through the press and had my own impression
" but speaking to people who knew him , i knew he was an absolute gentleman
for somebody so famous , he 's just a normal guy
he 's very professional , does all the right things and is a great example to the younger players
" despite his advancing years , @entity7 appeared to be in peak condition , showing a level of fitness which would embarrass some of the younger players in the @entity15 squad
but while he may have yet been able to continue playing , the off - field situation gave an inkling of what was to come , according to @entity14
" i had a feeling it might happen and he 's going out at the top , which is the way he would like it , " he added
" he could have continued on a football level because he 's certainly fit enough
but he might have been a bit - part player next season or had to move to another club and i think he wanted to go out at the very top
" he 's really enjoyed being in @entity49 and competing at a high level after time in the @entity86 he may have not thought it would have ever happened again , but he made the most of it
" while @entity7 will curtail his time in @entity49 at the end of the season , @entity14 hopes to remain to continue his work alongside manager @entity165
but although the midfielder will exit following the final game against @entity168 on may 27 , his time at the club will not be forgotten
" it 's nice to work with good players , " said @entity14
" but it 's more important to work with good people
