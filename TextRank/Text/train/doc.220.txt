-- it 's a beautiful spring morning in @entity2
i 'm standing next to my shiny new road bike on the side of a road , weeping
passers - by probably assume that i 've taken a tumble from said bicycle
so why the tears ? it 's simple : i feel completely out of control
when i was chosen as a member of the @entity14 i was thrilled
but almost immediately the fear , doubt and worry set in
in fact , my exact words to dr. @entity18 were , " i 'm so excited and a little bit terrified
" i soon settled into my new fitness routine
each workout was challenging and , for the most part , served to build my confidence
i was running longer without breaks , i was swimming faster and i stopped falling over on the bike
three months later i boarded a plane to @entity27 , @entity2 , to meet up with my teammates and coaches for a week of intense triathlon training
the schedule was ambitious , leaving me physically exhausted at the end of each day
but coach april knew we could rise to the occasion , and we did so repeatedly during the week
a few days into training , we tackled our first group bike ride
for me , this was the first time riding in traffic , and i was anxious
i was paired with @entity40 , a @entity41 alumnus , and we fell into place at the back of the pack
when we took a right and headed onto the main road , i freaked
there was no paved shoulder
we were riding on the white line , and i had to trust that drivers would n't plow into me
i was focusing on cycling , clipping in and out of my pedals and following @entity40 as close to that white line as possible
then she asked me to pass her so that she would bring up the rear
my brain just shut down
for the first time in my training , the voice telling me , " you ca n't do this " was simply too loud to ignore
i pulled over and wept
instead of my usual optimism and tenacity , i was consumed by fear and the foregone conclusion of failure
i was terrified of how close the passing cars felt and how fast they seemed to be zipping by me
i did n't trust the drivers to see me , and i did n't trust in my cycling ability to be able to stay out of harm 's way
i had pushed past the boundaries of my comfort zone , into a place where i lacked control
that is not a place i 'm used to visiting , let alone taking off my coat and staying awhile
there were other challenges for me during the week of training
do n't get me wrong ; i had some amazing successes and workouts that just clicked
but there were times that the sentiment , " what did i get myself into ? " reverberated in my mind
i quickly realized that my fear of losing control was jeopardizing my triathlon goal
worse , it was robbing me of the joy of my journey
nope , not going to happen on my watch
so here 's what i 've learned : 1
there is a ton of literature indicating that the fear of losing control is a prevalent issue
the toll that living in such a heightened state of fear , anxiety and stress can have on a person is also well - documented
a quick glance at a list of common phobias , such as fear of flying and enclosed spaces , reveals that a perceived loss of control is the root of most fear
knowing i 'm not alone prevents wasting energy wondering , " what is wrong with me ? " and instead focuses me on changing my perspective
desiring control is wanting certainty in an uncertain world
folks with this fear are usually perfectionists
i need to accept that no one is capable of controlling the future
to break out of the anxiety - filled cycle i have to give up the notion that i have some superhuman level of control
accepting that i ca n't completely control the future does not mean that i stop taking responsibility for my actions , decisions or thoughts
i can control my attitude
i can choose to rise to the challenge and genuinely try my best and be proud of that regardless of the outcome
i can make the best choices given the information i have at the time , understanding that nothing is certain
so how do i quit the control cycle ? i have to be brave
i have to have courage that i am doing my best with the tools i currently possess and that will be enough
at the beginning of this journey , my friend advised me to " lean into the fear " of triathlon training
that sentiment rang true during my time in @entity2
i 'm proud to say that these hard - won lessons have served to galvanize my resolve
i returned from @entity2 more determined , more committed , more courageous
my first week back , i squeezed in two extra swim workouts and a yoga class in addition to my regular training load
and i have enjoyed every minute of it ! the joy has returned to my journey , and i do n't plan to let it get away from me again
i know that when i cross that finish line in @entity167 , it wo n't be the capstone to a perfect race because there is no such thing
but it will be my race
and that will be more than enough
follow @entity174 on @entity175 @ @entity176
