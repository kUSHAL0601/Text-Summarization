when the @entity2 family started having serious health problems late in 2008 , they had no idea it was associated with what they call " a multitude " of drilling operations that popped up near their 40 - acre ranch in @entity11 , 60 miles northwest of @entity12
at first , @entity2 dismissed her migraine headaches , nausea and dizziness as the flu , but when her symptoms persistently got worse , she knew something more serious was involved
" by 2009 , i was having a multitude of problems , " @entity2 told @entity19
" my central nervous system was messed up
i could n't hear , and my vision was messed up
my entire body would shake inside
i was vomiting white foam in the mornings
" in 2009 , @entity2 's husband , @entity28 , and their 11 - year - old daughter , @entity29 , also became ill , suffering a laundry - list of symptoms
" they had nosebleeds , vision problems , nausea , rashes , blood pressure issues
being that the wells were not on our property , we had no idea that what they were doing on the property around us was affecting us , " she said
' private nuisance ' after a two - week trial that ended tuesday -- @entity49 , coincidentally -- a @entity12 jury awarded the @entity2 family $ 2.9 million for personal injury and property damages in the family 's lawsuit against @entity56 - based @entity55 according to the lawsuit , @entity55 had 22 natural gas wells within a 2 - mile radius of the @entity61 ' property , with three wells in close proximity to their @entity65 home
the closest was 791 feet away
as a result of poor management and lack of emission controls , @entity55 created a " private nuisance " to the @entity2 family by producing harmful air pollution and exposing them to harmful emissions of volatile organic compounds , toxic air pollutants and diesel exhaust , the lawsuit said
op - ed : make sure fracking is done right @entity55 argued to the jury that it consistently met state regulatory standards for air emissions and that there was no evidence its fracking of the wells harmed the @entity2 family in any way
in a statement released after the verdict , @entity87 said " natural gas development has long been prevalent in @entity91 , " and dozens of companies operate hundreds of wells there
the company further said it complied with state air - quality limits and that its experts made strong cases countering the @entity61 ' claims in court
" we contended the plaintiffs were neither harmed by the presence of our drilling operations nor was the value of their property diminished because of our natural gas development
we presented thorough and expert testimony from recognized toxicologists and medical professionals , as well as local real estate professionals , to help the jury make an informed decision , " @entity87 's statement said
" unfortunately , they returned a verdict that we believe is counter to the evidence presented
" an important precedent ? fracking , which is short for hydraulic fracturing , is the process by which drillers pump large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into a shale or rock formation
the wells can be deeper than 8,000 feet , and the process fractures the shale around the well , allowing the natural gas in the shale to flow freely
interactive : how fracking works is energy independence a myth ? @entity2 said that she knew by july 2010 that the " loud operation " next door to their ranch was toxic
" one night , our whole house was vibrating and shaking
we lease that property for our cattle and so i went over there to make sure our cattle was n't around there , and when i went over there my nose and throat started burning
" @entity2 called the state commission on @entity154
" my doctor , an internal specialist , found 20 chemicals in my body and he said , ' @entity2 you must move immediately
you will spend more time and money on hospitals , chemotherapy , and a mortician ... and you need to get an environmental health doctor immediately , ' " she said
the @entity165 filed suit in march 2011 , asking for $ 66 million in damages against nine companies that were originally thought to be involved in the drilling operations
eventually , some of the energy companies were dismissed from the case , and some reached settlements before the trial
their identities can not be disclosed , according to the @entity165 ' @entity177 - based attorney , @entity176
during discovery , @entity176 said that " substantial evidence " showed that @entity55 was a factor in causing the @entity181 ' health problems
he said he believes the @entity181 ' court victory -- which he says is the first jury award for personal injury in a @entity187 fracking case -- " marks an important precedent for the future of natural gas production
" " because of their courage and determination for justice , the @entity61 have successfully held @entity194 accountable for their careless and reckless behavior , " he said
@entity196 : fracking has hot year in @entity198 @entity87 had a starkly different take on the verdict and left the door open to an appeal
" we thank the jury for its service , " the company said
" the facts of the case and the law as applied to those facts do not support the verdict
... talk of an appeal is premature
@entity87 has a number of arguments to be made in the trial court for why a judgment should be entered in its favor
" ' knee - jerk reaction ' ? attorneys who represent the energy sector and are familiar with @entity2 v. @entity194 say they do n't believe the case will set a precedent
nor will it establish a blueprint for " copycat " cases , they say
rather , they see this case as an anomaly due to the fact that it went to trial and addressed a rare nuisance allegation that evolved into a case revolving around personal injury from toxic exposure
@entity235 , a @entity12 - based attorney who represented a prior defendant in the case before that company was dismissed from the lawsuit , says she does n't think the @entity165 ' jury award will survive an appeal
" the knee - jerk reaction by people not understanding the limitations of this verdict in this case may , in fact , cause others to believe there is an avenue for cases that there may not ultimately turn out to be , " may said
" i do n't think it presents any precedents , certainly not from a legal perspective
i think the case is ripe for review by the appellate courts , and based on clear law that has been laid out by the @entity261 , a decision like this should not stand
" oiling on @entity265 reservations @entity266 , another environmental defense attorney , agrees with may that this is a one - off case because of the " situational " facts involved
" nuisance cases are very fact - specific , and because they are fact - specific , the results in one would not have implications for others , " @entity266 said
regardless , the @entity61 say they feel vindicated by the six - person jury 's decision after what they describe as a six - year nightmare of nonstop health issues
they 're now living at their ranch again and say that since @entity87 has put units on their well sites to clean the air -- and the well closest to them has been shut down -- they are feeling better
" with that being down , we 're better about staying here
now with this lawsuit being over , the curious question is whether they are going to shut this back on
that will determine if we have to move again
i do n't trust this company , " @entity2 said
asked about the prospect of a drawn - out appeals process , she says they 're ready for a fight and quotes one of her favorite musicians , @entity297 : " i stand my ground , and i wo n't back down
" " i am very pleased with the verdict
this was justice that was served not only for us , but for every family in the world who has suffered from health effects and the negligence from this type of industry , " she said
perhaps surprisingly to some , @entity2 says she 's not opposed to the work oil companies do
she simply wants them to do their business responsibly , she said
" we are not anti-fracking or anti-drilling
my goodness , we live in @entity65
keep it in the pipes , and if you have a leak or spill , report it and be respectful to your neighbors
if you are going to put this stuff in close proximity to homes , be respectful and careful
