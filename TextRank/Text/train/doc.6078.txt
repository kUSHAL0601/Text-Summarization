-- @entity2 , the influential evangelical leader of the christian ministry @entity3 , has stepped down as board chairman , he announced friday
@entity2 is expected to stay in his public role as an advocate for socially conservative issues
during a meeting with employees , @entity2 , 72 , said the move means he will no longer be involved with the administrative side of the organization , according to spokesman @entity13
but @entity2 's public role is n't expected to change
he 'll still appear on his daily radio broadcast and as an advocate for socially conservative issues , @entity13 said
" there wo n't be a whole lot of difference , " the spokesman said
" you 'll still hear him on the radio
you 'll still see him on the networks like @entity0 with @entity24
" he said to the staff today , ' i 've got more to say -- i 'm not ready to stop fighting for the things i 've fought for for the past 32 years
' " founded in 1977 , @entity3 is a nonprofit organization devoted to what it considers @entity30 family values , with @entity2 's daily program geared largely toward advice on parenting from a religious perspective
but in recent years the ministry , like @entity2 himself , has become more active in promoting social and political views
last year , @entity2 caused a huge political stir when he announced he " can not and will not " vote for @entity41 nominee sen. @entity40
he later changed his tune , after @entity40 's pick of @entity45 gov. @entity44 as his running mate , calling her selection " one of the most exciting days of my life , " on the syndicated @entity50
@entity2 has gained widespread attention again with his criticisms of a 2006 speech by now - president @entity54 on his religious views
he accused @entity54 of " deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the @entity57 to fit his own worldview , his own confused theology
" that led to a backlash
a group of ministers started an online petition , @entity2 does n't speak for me , that drew more than 12,000 signatures
@entity69 , pastor of @entity70 , @entity72 ' @entity71 , led that effort
" dr. @entity2 has made a tremendous contribution to the spiritual and social fiber of this country
i 've always said that and will continue to say it although , obviously , we have not always agreed , " @entity69 said friday
" the fabric of the evangelical community here in @entity83 is very strong
one or two disagreements here and there are surely not going to cause the community to tear apart at the fringes
" @entity2 has spoken out loudly against abortion rights and gay marriage and even weighed in on the @entity91 fantasy series , with a statement on the group 's web site denouncing the books ' " trend toward witchcraft and @entity98 ideology
" " he built his media empire around , sort of , parenting and family issues and he has since used his audience and his media presence to push a political agenda , " said @entity100 , a senior fellow with the liberal @entity101 , which advocates , among other things , for the separation of church and state
" in the last several election cycles , he 's constantly complained that the @entity41 is n't far enough to the right and sort of has a habit of saying he 's going to take his followers and walk if they do n't do more to push his agenda , " @entity100 said
@entity3 says its broadcasts reach more than 220 million people in 155 countries
its newsletter , in which @entity2 will continue to write , goes to 1.6 million people
@entity2 's announcement that he and his wife , @entity123 chairwoman @entity122 , are stepping down from the board of directors comes six years after he resigned as the ministry 's executive director
" one of the common errors of founder - presidents is to hold the reins of leadership too long , thereby preventing the next generation from being prepared for executive authority ... , " @entity2 said in a written release
" @entity138 letting go is difficult after three decades of intensive labor , it is the wise thing to do
" @entity100 , whose group has been critical of what it calls an " assault on @entity83 ' liberties " by @entity3 , said it 's unclear how influential the group will be when @entity2 is no longer its public face
while @entity2 is the personality that drives the ministry , @entity3 has a vast communication and fundraising infrastructure that could continue to make it a player in social and political issues for years to come , he said
in the meantime , @entity100 said , he does n't expect @entity2 's influence to wane because of the behind - the - scenes changes
" he 's still a rock star among conservative religious activists , " he said .
