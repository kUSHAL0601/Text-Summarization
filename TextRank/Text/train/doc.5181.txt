-- @entity2 prosecutors said friday that they are closing a criminal investigation of champion cyclist @entity4 without filing charges that he used performance - enhancing drugs
a statement from the @entity10 attorney in @entity11 said the seven - time @entity13 winner will not be charged , but did not explain the reasons for the decision
@entity4 has consistently denied doping
he was accused of using performance - enhancing drugs by other riders , but never failed a drug test
late friday , he released a statement in which he said he was " gratified " to learn that prosecutors are closing their investigation
" it is the right decision and i commend them for reaching it
i look forward to continuing my life as a father , a competitor and an advocate in the fight against cancer without this distraction , " @entity4 said
prosecutors called witnesses to a federal grand jury in @entity11 as they investigated the case , but they apparently determined that they lacked evidence to bring a charge
in may 2011 , @entity4 once again denied claims from a former teammate that he used drugs during his cycling career
@entity4 has been dogged by allegations of drugs abuse in recent years with compatriot @entity46 -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 @entity13 resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year
@entity4 came out fighting once again in may , in the face of fresh allegations made on the @entity53 " @entity52 " show by another @entity10 @entity55
on his @entity57 page , @entity4 said at the time : " i have had a 20 - year career , 500 drug controls worldwide , in and out of competition , and never a failed test
" in the @entity53 interview , @entity55 -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw @entity4 use blood boosting substance @entity66 in 1999 , the year of his first @entity13 victory
" i saw it in his refrigerator , " @entity55 told the @entity10 news program
" i saw him inject it more than one time like we all did , like i did many , many times
" @entity55 added : " @entity4 took what we all took -- the majority of the peloton took
there was @entity66 , testosterone , blood transfusions
" meanwhile , @entity4 's lawyer @entity80 blasted the " @entity52 " report , releasing a statement saying : " @entity55 is actively seeking to make money by writing a book
" he has completely changed the story he has always told before so that he could get himself on " 60 minutes " and increase his chances with publishers
" @entity80 continued : " @entity88 and a hunger for publicity can not change the facts : @entity4 is the most tested athlete in the history of sports : he has passed nearly 500 tests over 20 years of competition
