-- authorities conducting autopsies on a family of four found dead in in their home in eastern @entity6 said preliminary autopsy results showed that the family may have died from carbon monoxide inhalation , police said friday
the four -- a couple in their late 20s , their 4 - year - old son and their 3 - year - old daughter -- were found dead thursday afternoon , said police in the city of @entity16
police had been summoned to the house after the man 's co-workers became concerned that he had not gone to work for several days , said police chief @entity20
inside , officers found the four bodies but no indication of foul play , he said
family members told police they had last been in contact with the family tuesday , when he complained that he was feeling sick and nauseated , @entity20 said
according the @entity29 , each year , nearly 500 people die in the @entity31 from carbon monoxide poisoning , and as many as 20,000 visit emergency rooms for exposure from poorly maintained heating systems and gas - powered generators
" dangers from poorly maintained heating systems are really going to be the number one cause of carbon monoxide poisonings in the @entity31 , " dr. @entity38 said on a @entity29 online video
" @entity29 recommends that all homes have carbon monoxide detectors , " @entity38 said
" i think it 's a great investment
it 's particularly important that you have carbon monoxide detectors near where people sleep at night
the worst location for a carbon monoxide detector is in the box without a battery , " he said .
