@entity0 -- if you commute using one of the 10 most clogged highways in the @entity5 , you could ride a bicycle to work faster than you could drive , according to a new study that evaluates the countless hours drivers waste in gridlock on roadways each year
by using gps - equipped vehicles to record commuting experiences on the nation 's roads , analysts studied traffic from a database containing approximately 100 million vehicles including taxis , airport shuttles , service delivery vans , long haul trucks and passenger cars in 2011
a 13 - mile stretch of the @entity25 outside @entity26 ranked as the most traffic - choked freeway in the nation
but drivers in @entity31 spent the most time in traffic , averaging 58 hours a year stuck in stop - and - go traffic
researchers found urban areas are actually seeing traffic congestion decrease at a significant rate nationwide for the first time since 2008
seventy of the country 's @entity41 most populated cities showed a drop in traffic congestion last year
the study was commissioned by @entity46 , a software company based in @entity47 , @entity0 , that provides traffic - and driver - related mobile apps and online services
among the study 's findings : -- overall , there was a 30 % drop in traffic congestion nationwide , but it came with a cost
due in part to weak employment conditions and higher fuel prices , there are fewer drivers heading to the office , and those who do drive are driving less , the study found
-- last year , only 890,000 of the 2.6 million new jobs were in urban areas , according to the research
-- in cities such as @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , @entity72 , research showed improved jobless numbers led to busier roadways
-- eight of the 10 worst stretches of road for average travel time and delays were in @entity80 or @entity26
-- on average , @entity5 spend around 40 hours per year behind the wheel in commuter bottlenecks
-- both the best and worst weekday times to be on the road occur on fridays
between 6 and 7 in the morning is the best commute time ; 5 - 6 p.m. is the pits
-- the worst morning commute is on tuesday
so when 's the best time to be on the road ? the research says monday
" people tend to take a little more time getting to the office " on mondays , said @entity46 communications chief @entity91
" also , when people take a long three - day weekend , it 's often on monday , " the 10 cities with the worst commutes , including hours spent in gridlocked traffic and worst 15 - minute traffic intervals , were : -- @entity31 : 58 hours ; 5:15 - 5:30 p.m. tuesday
