" i had very low expectations for ' @entity7 's ' performance , " says the leading man - turned - director
" i just hoped that over time people would find the movie
also , being at a place in my life and my career where i know what i 'm trying to do , it 's different than being 26
when you 're younger and have the early success that i had — it sounds like the worst @entity41 cliche — but i did n't have anyone to share it with
i do n't mean i wanted someone to sit by the fire with
but when you have a family and children , you kind of see yourself reflected in them
i want to make the kinds of movies that my kids are proud of
i have higher standards , in a way , for them
