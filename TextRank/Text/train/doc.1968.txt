president @entity2 has signed a covert directive authorizing @entity1 support for @entity6 rebels battling president @entity8 's forces , @entity1 officials told @entity9 on wednesday
the secret order , referred to as an intelligence " finding , " allows for clandestine support by the @entity13 and other agencies
it was unclear when the president signed the authorization for @entity6 , but the sources said it was within the past several months
@entity9 inside @entity6 the @entity2 administration has said it will step up its assistance to the opposition in the wake of last month 's failure by the @entity25 to agree on tougher sanctions against @entity8 's regime
exactly what type of support the finding authorizes is also unclear
the @entity2 administration has ruled out arming the rebels for now , providing only nonlethal assistance , such as communications equipment
last week , the @entity34 approved a license allowing the @entity36 to provide direct financial assistance to the @entity38
the @entity40 - based representative of the @entity38 is allowed to conduct financial transactions on the rebel group 's behalf but is not allowed to send military equipment
during the war in @entity46 , @entity2 signed a similar directive authorizing covert assistance for rebels in the battle against @entity46 leader @entity51
the @entity2 administration has resisted arming the opposition , in part , because @entity1 officials do n't know enough about the rebels
@entity55 to army : restore order to @entity6 @entity1 officials have told @entity9 that @entity40 is cooperating with countries that are arming the rebels , including @entity60 and @entity61 , to help find groups worthy of aid
diplomatic sources have also said the @entity1 is providing intelligence on @entity6 troop movements , which is then passed to rebel groups
foreign policy experts on wednesday urged the @entity2 administration to increase its support of the armed opposition
testifying before the @entity73 , @entity71 of the @entity72 argued the @entity1 should start arming the @entity6 opposition , but only under the right conditions
" at this point , given the direction of the conflict , i think that what we need to do is assess which groups could we and should we arm at what point , and make that decision , " @entity71 told the @entity73 panel
" i think that we 're actually at that decision , given where the conflict is going
" @entity87 of the @entity88 agreed
" the time has come to consider and pick those groups that are most consistent with our interest and our vision for the future and begin to advantage them in terms of the internal politics , by providing assistance , including perhaps money as well as arms and advice , " @entity87 said
@entity6 rebels hold pro-government prisoners @entity104 , a former @entity1 ambassador to @entity105 now with the @entity106 , recommended arming the opposition , but in a " wise way
" " we need to do it in a way that , first of all , we understand who we 're supporting and what their intentions are , " @entity104 said
the @entity116 said wednesday the @entity1 has set aside $ 25 million for " nonlethal " assistance to the @entity6 opposition , with another $ 64 million in humanitarian assistance for the @entity6 people
the humanitarian aid , which includes funding for the @entity124 , the @entity125 and other aid agencies , helps support the tens of thousands of refugees streaming across @entity6 's borders to neighboring @entity129 and @entity130
