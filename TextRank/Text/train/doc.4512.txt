-- @entity1 says he is n't famous anymore , but actually he 's rarely been in a brighter spotlight
for the past several weeks , the 27 - year - old actor has gotten more than his fair share of publicity thanks to a rash of bizarre behavior , from his reaction to allegations of plagiarism to his recent stunts at the @entity12 , where @entity14 's " @entity13 -- volume 1 " premiered sunday
at a news conference to promote the sexually explicit film , @entity1 answered just one question before abruptly walking out of the room 10 minutes after the event began
according to reporters present in @entity21 , @entity1 was asked to describe what it 's like to do a movie that includes so many sex scenes
in response , the former child star quoted @entity29 soccer player @entity28 : " when the seagulls follow the trawler , it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea
" as the room tried to make sense of his answer , @entity1 made his exit
and that was just the prelude
later on at the " @entity13 " premiere , @entity1 showed up on the red carpet wearing a tuxedo and a paper bag over his head
as if that was n't eye - catching enough , the mask , which was outfitted with two holes for his eyes , had " @entity51 " scrawled on it in black marker
to @entity1 's fans , that line is all too familiar
he 's tweeted the phrase , in all caps , every day since january 20
making this situation even more curious are the series of events that led up to his " not famous " proclamation
in december , @entity1 was hit with allegations that he plagiarized author @entity65 ' work for his short film , " @entity67 , " and the actor soon copped to using @entity70 ' art without proper credit
" i f * * * * d up , " he said at the time in a tweeted statement
" in my excitement and @entity75 Â© as an amateur filmmaker , i got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation ... i 'm embarrassed that i failed to credit @ danielclowes for his original graphic novella @entity82 , which served as my inspiration ... i was truly moved by his piece of work & i knew that it would make a poignant & relevant short
i apologize to all who assumed i wrote it
" a few days after that statement , however , @entity1 started taking the concept to extremes
he began responding to the vitriol online with more plagiarism , borrowing from mea culpas by @entity98 's @entity97 , @entity100 deputy prime minister @entity99 and even " @entity13 " director von trier
in january , @entity1 literally took his apologies to a higher level , hiring an airplane to sky write " i am sorry @entity65 " in @entity106
before anyone could figure out what @entity1 was really up to -- there were rumors that his strangeness was actually performance art -- he announced that he was retiring
" in light of the recent attacks against my artistic integrity , i am retiring from all public life , " he said on january 10
" my love goes out to those who have supported me
" of course , it appears that @entity1 has a very different definition of what it means to be retired
not only is the actor still as publicly visible as ever , but he 's also still accepting movie roles
the former " @entity126 " actor has been cast alongside @entity127 in " @entity128
