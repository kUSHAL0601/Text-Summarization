-- if the figures for childhood obesity in the @entity9 were not shocking enough -- prompting first lady @entity1 to set up a nationwide program to tackle the epidemic -- the statistics among the @entity6 community are yet more sobering
nearly 50 % of indigenous children are classed as obese , and on current projections they could be the first generation not to outlive their parents
urgent action is clearly needed and @entity1 has started her " @entity16 " initiative -- but help is also at hand from a former golfer who was once talked of in the same breath as his " dear friend " @entity22 and remains a hero in his @entity6 community
@entity25 is bringing the same competitive fervor which made him one of the sport 's hottest young prospects to a charitable foundation which focuses on tackling these health problems
" one in two @entity6 children expect to develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime , so it is vital that effective strategies are available for all our communities , " @entity25 told @entity0
@entity25 , a roommate of @entity22 at @entity40 , won four @entity42 events before the age of 28 and achieved the " holy grail " of golf -- a round of 59 in a professional event
but a debilitating back injury put paid to his hopes of building on that early promise and he now devotes his time to his @entity53 foundation as well as working as a golf analyst for an @entity9 network
' generational trauma ' a @entity57 on his father 's side , while his mother is from the @entity61 , @entity25 is fiercely loyal to his upbringing and cultural identity
he is not afraid to speak out on equality issues -- he has gone on public record to criticize the @entity67 franchise @entity66 for its " offensive " name
@entity25 was alarmed by the team 's custom of having @entity71 dressed up in traditional clothing and regalia performing at games
it all touches a raw nerve for the 41 - year - old , who believes that what happened in the past -- and our society 's attitude to it -- is having a direct impact on today 's generation of @entity86 , with shocking consequences
" historically speaking , communities that have endured genocide suffer from generational trauma which leads to social issues , poor education , poor health outcomes , high crime and lots of addiction , " he said
" these are problems in the @entity6 community and we are at the very beginning of the fight
" his foundation was established in 2005 with the initial goal of introducing @entity6 youngsters from the greater @entity106 area to golf , in a program headed by his father , @entity25 other sports such as soccer were also introduced
but as the program expanded , the emphasis became those endemic health problems which blight his community
" something which started as simply golf and then soccer for kids is now an evidence based health and wellness program , " he said
funding the fight @entity25 's skills acquired as an economics major at @entity40 have been put to good use with the foundation
" i have tried to assign business principles to every aspect of our work , " he revealed
" we keep score and , if we are not hitting our targets , we change
i do n't see why non-profits should not be accountable for ever dollar invested
" to use a golf adage , we shoot for a 59 with some programs which carry a very high risk , but mix those with others where we know we are guaranteed a return on our investment
it 's a good mix. " @entity25 has used his contacts in golf , @entity22 included , to promote a yearly charity tournament , the @entity147 , which has raised over $ 4 million for the foundation
woods had to skip this year 's tournament at the @entity151 in @entity152 with a back injury , but spectators were treated to his replacement @entity156 , @entity25 , @entity157 and @entity158 beating an internationals team which included former masters champion @entity160 and former world no. 1 @entity161
for the flamboyant and crowd - pleasing @entity157 , the event and the cause has added significance as he is one - quarter @entity57
" his grandmother has become friends with my father because they are both of @entity57 descent , " @entity25 said
" i became aware of what @entity157 was doing from his high school days and he has brought a lot of flair to the game
" he is a very good - looking young man , with the colorful clothes , his unique swing , and he has created a lot of interest
" learning lessons for all his promise , @entity157 still has some way to match @entity25 's achievements , which as well as his @entity42 wins and the storied 59 in a @entity186 event , also included a place on the 2000 @entity189 team
but like his friend @entity22 , @entity25 has also made the headlines for the wrong reasons
in january 2000 , he was arrested for driving under the influence in @entity106 , his second offense of its type and sentenced to a year in jail , but with all but seven days suspended
@entity25 makes no attempt to duck his responsibilities -- raising the issue before being asked a direct question by @entity0
" i was aware there were certain expectations as a role model , and when you get arrested for drunk driving , i felt like i let down a lot of people , " he said
" but i learned from those mistakes and a lot of times failure is what drives you to success down the road
" i made a mistake , i served my time in jail and did n't try to sidestep it
" it is a measure of his determination that @entity25 went on to achieve two @entity42 wins later that year and make that @entity189 appearance , pairing with @entity22 as the @entity9 won against the international team
but sadly , it was to prove the peak of his career , which began as a three - time @entity227 at @entity40 with @entity22 , but petered out due to problems emanating from a herniated disc in his back
a number of comebacks and attempts to regain his full @entity42 card were ultimately frustrated and , having turned his talents to broadcasting , @entity25 gained a full - time position with @entity147 and the @entity238 earlier this year
" i play fine and take part in a couple of smaller events throughout the year , but playing 25 tournaments at the highest level each year is not possible , " he said
loyalty to his community and to his friends is a constant theme in @entity25 's life -- he stood by @entity22 when the 14 - time major champion was in self - imposed exile , with sponsors deserting him and supporters hard to find
@entity25 was there for @entity22 -- embracing him warmly -- when he made his february 2010 televised confession of extra marital affairs , and behind the microphone he has celebrated his return to the top of the world rankings three years later
@entity22 has returned that favor with his support for @entity53 , drawing the crowds in the 2012 tournament , which helped to place added focus on the foundation 's crucial work
it is now working with the @entity267 ( @entity267 ) , which provides for more than two million @entity86 , and the collaboration was developed in support of the initiative started by @entity1
her " let 's move in @entity272 " program seeks to improve the health of native youth through exercise
" this unprecedented partnership between the @entity1 administration , the @entity267 , and the @entity282 demonstrates the critical importance of leveraging partnerships and resources to tackle the health crisis facing @entity6 children , " @entity25 told his foundation 's website
so exciting times ahead for his program , but he is aware of the immense challenges it faces
" a lot of the tribal leaders are starting to support or work and acknowledge the dangers are young people are in , " @entity25 said
" it 's all about taking personal responsibility for your own life and to make something of yourself
" cracking the code @entity25 has lived up to those ideals with a strong work ethic in his family -- drilled into him by his father -- and backed up by no little flair through the generations
his grandfather , who died before he was born , was one of a select band of " @entity309 " recruited by the @entity9 military during @entity311 to use the @entity57 language as a basis for a secret communications code , which was never cracked by the @entity315 or the @entity316
thanks to his own hard work and talent , @entity25 was set firmly on the course to stardom from his college days
but if he does harbor any regrets about not being able to follow through on his early promise to win majors like @entity22 , @entity25 does not show it as he talks with passion about his foundation 's goals and hopes for the future
" i love this work , just as i loved trying to hit a ball onto the fairway , " he said .
