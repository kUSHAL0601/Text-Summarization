-- @entity1 appointed a normalization committee on tuesday aimed at reforming the currently suspended @entity3 and @entity4 ( @entity5 )
the @entity5 was banned from international football and continental club competition on april 1 after it failed to amend its three - headed presidency , which saw a @entity3 , a @entity9 and a @entity10 all perform the role at the head of the organization
the split in the presidency reflects the political make - up of the former @entity19 republic and mirrors the nature of the domestic presidency , which since the end of the @entity3 war in 1995 has rotated every eight months to a leader from one of the three separate ethnic groups
but football 's governing body and the organization in charge of @entity31 , @entity32 , require the @entity5 to provide a single figurehead
six stakeholders will make up the committee , two from each ethnic background , with the honorary president of the @entity39 association taking an advisory role
@entity3 and @entity41 hit with international ban " the @entity45 has decided to appoint a normalization committee in order to solve the problems faced by the @entity5 , " read a statement of @entity1 's official web site
" a six - person normalization committee made up of football personalities from @entity3 has been established and put in place with immediate effect
" the newly - instated group will be charged with severing all ties to the previous regime , which @entity1 claimed had led taken " some major financial risks , which may even lead to bankruptcy due to its debts towards the tax authorities
" national team coach @entity60 , whose team currently sit fourth in @entity62 , will remain suspended from competitive matches until @entity1 and @entity32 statutes have been adopted by the @entity5
the normalization committee 's first responsibility will be to call a general assembly before may 26 , before electing new representatives by no later than november 30
after the ballot , the committee would hand over responsibility for football in @entity3 to the elected parties
as the situation stands , @entity75 's squad will be unable to fulfill their next qualifying fixture against @entity78 on june 3 .
