@entity0 can now add " painter " to his resume after the former neighborhood watchman purportedly listed an original painting on @entity4
the 18 - by - 24 - inch canvas features a blue , waving @entity9 flag with the words , " @entity11 , one nation , with liberty and justice for all " emblazoned across it
the auction was posted monday at a starting bid of 99 cents and is scheduled to end saturday
as of tuesday night , 108 bids were logged for the painting , ratcheting the price up to $ 110,100
the next bid would top $ 110,200
@entity0 's brother , @entity21 , confirmed that @entity0 painted the piece
" everyone has been asking what i have been doing with myself
i found a creative , way to express myself , my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences , " the item description reads
" my art work allows me to reflect , providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors
" @entity0 appears to respond directly to questions sent about the item
" just wanted to tell you we all love you and stand behind you
you have so many people on your side i hope you know that ! " a commenter wrote on the @entity4 page
" thank you so much for the words of kindness and support , " reads the answer
" i do know how many great @entity9 are still here , i run into at least 3 - 5 a day that go out of their way to tell me the same
" photos were added to the auction , including one of a grinning , flannel - clad @entity0 holding the painting
the listing states the piece will be sent via expedited shipping from @entity59 , @entity60
no returns or exchanges are allowed , it says
one individual appears to have retracted a bid of $ 99,666 on monday
@entity0 has been in and out of the spotlight since his july acquittal in the fatal shooting of 17 - year - old @entity69 in 2012
last week , @entity60 prosecutors said they would not charge @entity0 after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend in november resulted in his arrest
previously , he was stopped several times for speeding
@entity0 told a judge last month he had $ 150 to his name and was $ 2.5 million in debt .
