-- in multiple 911 calls shortly before he was killed , a man said he was being chased by an enraged motorist -- right up to when he was apparently run off the road in @entity6 and then shot to death , police said friday
@entity8 , 28 , was driving home to @entity10 along @entity11 early last saturday when he was shot multiple times and killed in @entity13
so far , there is no indication that @entity8 initiated the incident or provoked the shooter , @entity15 capt. @entity14 told reporters friday
@entity8 may have first encountered the shooter on @entity23 in @entity24 and traveled between 13 and 15 miles , with the gunman in pursuit , before being forced off the road just beyond the @entity6 state line , authorities said
@entity14 said @entity8 called 911 from @entity24 and @entity6 , but he declined to provide details
authorities have not released the contents of those 911 calls , citing the ongoing investigation
a task force made up of @entity24 , @entity6 and @entity36 state police , as well as @entity38 agents , is seeking help from the public and operators of body shops in finding a " dark colored " @entity44 pickup with damage on the driver 's side from ramming into @entity8 's car
" how concerned are we that it 'll happen again ? " @entity14 asked
" we obviously have an individual out there who was so incensed that he continued to pursue mr. @entity8 and took it to that next step
he murdered an individual for whatever slight that he perceived
will this person do it again ? we do n't know
we do n't want to take that chance
" the @entity10 resident ended up shot multiple times , a death that authorities have ruled a homicide
anyone with information is asked to call @entity68 at 800 - 472 - 8477
investigators initially believed the same motorist may have been behind another road rage shooting eight hours earlier and 56 miles northeast , but @entity14 said friday that the two crimes do not appear to be related
@entity73 , @entity8 's uncle , told @entity0 this week that the family " wants justice before someone else gets hurt
" the victim 's father , @entity77 , said he learned about his son 's death when police arrived at his door saturday
" i ca n't begin to tell you what it 's like to hear that , " he said
" it 's not right
" he went to @entity6 on tuesday to collect his son 's personal belongings
his son , he said , was a " great guy and a very easy kid to raise
" " he cared for everyone around him , " he said
" he was a rugged kid , extremely sensitive
" @entity8 worked at his father 's construction business
he said he hoped to meet his son 's killer
