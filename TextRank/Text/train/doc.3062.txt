-- forces loyal to embattled @entity3 strongman @entity2 launched a new attack on the rebel - held city of @entity7 on wednesday , with anti-government forces reporting intense shelling from three sides of the city
thousands of government troops attacked around 6 a.m. ( 11 p.m. tuesday et ) , with 13 rebels reported dead by evening
@entity15 , a rebel fighter wounded in wednesday 's fighting , accused government troops of infiltrating rebel lines in cars bearing rebel flags
dr. @entity21 , a spokesman for @entity7 's @entity23 hospital , said it was the bloodiest day in a week in the besieged city
more than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed since the fighting began there in february , including 686 registered residents of the city , he said
rebel fighters returning from the front lines reported that their defenses were holding up under the onslaught , however
the assault followed a day of intense bombardment of @entity3 's capital by the @entity39 alliance , which intervened in the conflict in march under a @entity42 mandate to protect civilians as @entity2 tried to crush the revolt against him
@entity3 's government said 60 missiles struck the capital city , killing at least 31 people , including a number of civilians , and wounding dozens more
@entity39 secretary general @entity51 reiterated wednesday that the alliance is doing all it can to avoid civilian casualties
but he told reporters from allied headquarters in @entity55 , @entity56 , that @entity39 could continue the airstrikes " for as long as it takes to bring this crisis to an early conclusion
" @entity51 said @entity39 bombing has saved lives in @entity3 , and that the alliance has the resources to extend its military mission for another 90 days past the end of june
it is time to start planning for what to do after @entity2 's departure " because @entity2 's reign of terror is coming to an end , " he said
pressed by reporters on why airstrikes would be able to dislodge @entity2 when " the history of the last 30 years " shows that air attacks alone do not win wars , @entity51 offered no clear answer , saying only , " we have no intentions to put troops on the ground
" for his part , even as @entity39 airstrikes bombarded his @entity81 compound , @entity2 vowed tuesday that " we will not surrender
" " i am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me , " @entity2 said in a live audio broadcast on state television
" but my soul is in @entity89 's hand
we will not think about death or life
we will think about the call of duty
" the @entity2 compound was under " intensive continuous bombardment , " according to state tv , which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed
but government spokesman @entity98 said the allied campaign " is failing miserably
" " no one has the right to shape @entity3 's future except for @entity3 , " he said
@entity98 said tuesday 's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and the revolution compound , which are military barracks near @entity2 's @entity108 compound
the spokesman said attacks tuesday and wednesday hit state television buildings , killing two people and wounding 16
" we did not target or hit the @entity3 broadcast facilities
what we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown @entity81 , " the alliance said
" the story coming from @entity3 officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster 's building is bogus
" @entity0 's @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 contributed to this report .
