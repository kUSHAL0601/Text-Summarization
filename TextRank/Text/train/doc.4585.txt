-- @entity1 will host the @entity2 in june and july , and @entity4 's gleaming new @entity3 is one of the two semifinal venues for the quadrennial soccer championship
@entity4 sits at sea level at the foot of @entity10 on the @entity11
its most significant historical landmark may be the notorious @entity14 prison
@entity15 , @entity0 's bureau chief in @entity16 spent the early part of his life in @entity4 before moving overseas
" i try to get back to the ' @entity4 ' as often as i can , " @entity15 said
where can you get the best view of the city ? @entity4 is blessed with amazing views -- you can either see the ocean , the iconic mountain or what is called the @entity28 from most areas
just take your pick depending on the weather and wind
the most stunning is always from the top of @entity10 on a clear day or atop @entity34 looking down at the @entity28
from both spots you can see @entity37 's prison , @entity14 , and get a real sense of being at the tip of @entity1
further south and you are in @entity41
which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion ? @entity4 is @entity1 's gourmet hotspot as the best vineyards this country offers are within an hour 's drive
staying in @entity4 , my favorite special occasion restaurant is @entity52 at the @entity54 winery
there is also a more casual @entity56 at the winery ideal for a lazy lunch and wine sampling
if in the wine country , my personal favorite is @entity62 in @entity63
this restaurant continues to receive awards as one of the best in the world
for a more relaxed dinner or lunch , try @entity71 in @entity72
just sit and watch the sun set over the @entity74 while enjoying local seafood and white wine
does n't get better than this
where is the best place to people watch ? if you want to look at tourists go to the @entity83
but if you want to see the locals , with all their blemishes , hang out at @entity87 waterfront or @entity88 in the city
what is your favorite neighborhood ? anywhere within the @entity28
the mountain always looms behind and the sea in front
@entity96 's in @entity97 is a great neighborhood spot for lunch and people watching
how do tourists stick out and what 's the best way to blend in ? they are unprepared for @entity4 's changing weather
winter is cold , rainy and windy
summer evenings can be brisk and chilly
so always come with a good variety of clothes
otherwise you might be that tourist freezing in his flip - flops , t - shirts and shorts
what 's the biggest misconception about your city ? that somehow @entity1 is backwards
@entity4 has the most amazing contemporary art scene and some of the greatest modern designers
it is a hub of creativity
do n't just get stuck buying cheap tribal masks
instead , go to @entity122 and explore the original designs at the @entity124 , @entity125 or @entity127 studios
where do you go to relax ? @entity130 and @entity131 just around the corner
there are many botanical gardens but nothing quite like @entity130
if you just want to walk , have a picnic , listen to a concert or just enjoy life in the southern tip of @entity1 , this is the place
what essential thing should visitors see / experience if they only have a few hours ? go for a drive and really enjoy the majestic scenery that the city offers
from the airport drive through the city , enjoy the mountain looming over it and head over to @entity149
with the @entity74 on your right drive past @entity152 and then all the way to @entity87
now you are looking at the @entity154
from there take the inland route through @entity131 -- a suburb that is home to some of @entity1 's oldest vineyards
what 's the biggest tourist trap ? is there a " tourist trap " that 's actually worth seeing ? the @entity83 is just another shopping mall but in an amazing location
however , you need to go there to take the ferry to @entity14
visiting the prison on this island where @entity37 spent many years is a must to understanding where this country has come from
just make sure you book ahead of time
where was your most memorable meal ? at the @entity177 at the @entity179 wine estate in @entity63
every meal was matched to one of their wines and the lunch lasted for hours
i ca n't quite remember what was paired with our desert or receiving the bill but it a memorable meal nonetheless
where 's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town ? go to one of the great restaurants and then head home to enjoy one of the cities many boutique hotels
my personal favorite is a small bed and breakfast , run by a @entity205 couple , called twentytwo
sitting in the hip lounge for a nightcap after a dinner is special
are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try ? the local wines
@entity214 has always been one of my favorite vineyards as they consistently deliver great quality
also , it is always a sentimental visit for me as i grew up nearby
what is a good local souvenir ? if you want a really memorable souvenir that is n't a wooden giraffe , go for good local design such as a @entity124 ostrich feather lamp or @entity228 chair
a great place to find other locally produced art is the @entity232 project by the city
they can direct you to the unique local designers .
