@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's military has rescued 18 hostages held by militants in its oil - rich @entity8 region , a military spokesman said monday

the first group -- nine @entity14 and five @entity1 -- were released on saturday , while four @entity15 were released on sunday , according to col. @entity16 , spokesman for the @entity1 military 's joint task force
@entity1 's military began clearing the western @entity8 region last week , its first major operation against the @entity12 , an armed militant group that demands a better distribution of the country 's oil wealth
both the @entity1 military and the militants have said the ongoing fighting has resulted in a high number of casualties
as many as 1,000 have been killed , according to @entity29 , a spokesman for the @entity30 which represents the region 's largest ethnic group
however , aid groups and journalists have been unable to verify that figure
" we want the international community to know that we are getting rid of criminals and terrorists in our communities so foreigners who come here to work and invest are safe , " @entity16 said
four villages near the militants ' camps have been destroyed in the fighting , @entity29 said
however , the military spokesman stressed that @entity1 forces are not targeting civilians , blaming such attacks on the militants
" we are not attacking villages -- just ( militant ) camps , " @entity16 said
on friday , @entity12 declared " an all - out war " on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians
it is not the first declaration of war by @entity12 , which demands that more of @entity1 's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those the militants consider corrupt politicians
the militant group declared war against the government in september for what it said were unprovoked attacks
at that time , @entity12 destroyed several oil facilities , forcing @entity1 to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day , or 40 percent
the recent violence -- which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage - taking -- has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of @entity1 , @entity80 's largest producer
@entity12 has threatened to blockade oil vessels , and has warned oil companies in the region to leave and " cease oil production until further notice
" the militant group said friday the country 's armed forces conducted " indiscriminate aerial bombardment on the defenseless civilians in the @entity92 area of @entity93
" it said the strikes were punishment " for the humiliating defeat " of the army in raids on two militant camps wednesday
" casualties are mostly women , children and the elderly who could not get away quickly into the bush or high sea , " the militant group said
the military says it is responding to the militants ' attacks on troops , hijackings of vessels , and threats to innocents , such as the " expatriates who were given ultimatum to leave the region by the militants
" it characterized the various claims by the militants as " propaganda
" " we are not at war with any individuals or groups in the region , " @entity16 said
" ours is to protect lives and property and also to rid the region of criminals who hide under the guise of struggle agenda to perpetrate crime
" @entity2 's @entity134 contributed to this report .
