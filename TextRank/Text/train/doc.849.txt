-- in the largely male - dominated world of the motorsport , @entity3 super bike racer @entity1 is an anomaly
" they still ca n't seem to grasp the concept that ' hey listen , we are as good as you , " laughs the 26 - year - old @entity8 native
" we 're all there to achieve the same goal : get to the checkered flag , and beat you
" so far , @entity18 ' ambition has served her in good stead
she is currently the first @entity3 woman to compete at the @entity21 on a 1000 cc motorbike
that first taste despite her many accomplishments , @entity18 ' introduction to bike riding was n't smooth
she actually crashed in her first race at the @entity28
but then , she 'd only learned how to ride the week before
still , she was n't put off by the accident -- which fortunately only resulted in a few scrapes
" it was actually hilarious because the first race went amazing
i loved it , " she recalls
" i came back to the pit and was like ' oh my first crash , look at my scratches ! ' " @entity18 was less fortunate in 2007 , when she crashed into a tire wall during a race that nearly ended it all
" it was my first race for the season and my mum was very nervous , " recalls @entity18
" the tire wall is there for safety , but unfortunately i tried to protect my bike
so it was kind of like : tire wall , me , bike and i was just lying there
" the titanium woman as a result of that accident , @entity18 fractured her neck , ribs , sternum and hand
when she was rushed to the intensive care unit , doctors also found blood in her lungs
she needed a lot of patching up
" i 've got titanium all over my body , " she concedes
during that time , she admits she started to rethink her career
" i said to my parents : ' no way , i do n't want to go through this again , ' " she says
when her doctor came in to explain one of her surgeries , however , she found she could n't focus on his words
" @entity73 came on the tv , so i said to him , ' just wait , i want to watch this
' " despite the seriousness of her crash , @entity18 found her passion for the sport was too strong to let her quit
" you forget about what you 've gone through and you just kind of want to go back to it , especially when you have n't done what you want to do yet , " she says
helping the next generation of riders today , @entity18 is back on her super bike and soaring up the ranks
she 's competing at the national level
this year , she debuted in the @entity92 championship series , and won third place at the @entity94 in march
she is also trying to open the sport up to women
her ambition is to one day manage a team that includes more speed - racing femmes
" there are a lot of young women in racing at the moment at a regional level
i want to grow them , " she admits .
