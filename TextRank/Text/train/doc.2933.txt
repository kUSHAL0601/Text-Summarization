@entity3 , @entity4 -- " that match is the main event in the first round
you know that and i know that
" @entity9 is rarely wrong , and those words in his final press briefing on the eve of the 40th @entity13 proved the @entity15 captain remains a shrewd judge
he was referring to a clash involving @entity18 , for whom center stage was clear thanks to a stellar season that helped him double his major tally to four , and the enforced absence of @entity24
but despite cruising into the biennial battle between @entity28 and the @entity15 in supreme form , the world 's premier golfer met his match in a wily campaigner who is still in great shape on the course and razor sharp off it
and after a titanic tussle that went right to the final blow after a full five hours on the course at @entity39 , it was n't @entity18 who was smiling
by describing @entity42 's career as " being in the back nine , " the @entity40 clearly stirred something in the 44 - year - old , who felt the need to respond with a close range jab of his own
answering a question about togetherness in the @entity15 camp , ' @entity42 ' referenced an ongoing court battle between @entity18 and his former management company , which counts his @entity13 teammate @entity55 as both client and shareholder
it added an extra layer of spice to their face off in friday morning 's fourballs , the two ably flanked by the other half of their current bromances -- @entity68 's @entity67 and 2011 @entity70 winner @entity69
as both groups made their way onto the first tee to a cacophony of noise , it was @entity18 and @entity67 that drank in the warmth of not just an early @entity4 sun , but also a vociferous crowd
" you 've got @entity87 , we 've got little @entity88 , " sang a jubilant crowd , gathered in their thousands , in between energetic chants of ' @entity28 , @entity28
' " @entity18 , playing in only his third @entity13 , had spoken of embracing his role as the continent 's on - course talisman , reflecting his emerging status in the pantheon of golfing superstars
his 2014 campaign came to life almost the minute he 'd announced his engagement to tennis star @entity99 was off
that same may week , he won the @entity101 's flagship event — the @entity102
that kickstarted a resurgence in form as he collected the @entity107 crown — his first — the @entity108 , then the final major of the year , the @entity70
after whacking his tee shot over 300 yards down the first fairway , the ball almost carrying even further by the roars that chased it , @entity18 matched @entity69 's birdie to get the match off to a rapid start
and when @entity67 holed an unlikely bunker shot on the fourth hole to help @entity28 take a one - shot lead , the pair that had lobbied @entity28 captain @entity122 so hard to be matched together offered the enormous galleries an inevitable fist pump
read more : more than just a game @entity18 , paired with @entity55 in all but one of his group matches in the previous two @entity13 contests , had grown even closer to @entity67 as the two went head - to - head for major honors during the @entity132 's summer months
they were clearly at ease as they traversed the swales and hollows of the centenary course at @entity39 , helping read each other 's putts , fist - bumping good shots , and consoling each other after poor ones
" look how far he 's hit the ball , " remarked one spectator to his friend as @entity18 thrashed a driver off the seventh
" i doubt i 'd reach that in three
" but their momentum petered out around the turn , as the other brothers in arms wrested back the initiative
@entity42 and @entity69 won all three of their pairs matches at the @entity157 and for good reason
a full 16 years may separate the two but they dovetail neatly , cajoling and carousing in equal measure
after @entity69 leveled matters with a birdie on seven , @entity42 edged them ahead on the gargantuan ninth — weighing in at 618 yards — after a fine bunker shot went close
when @entity69 holed his birdie putt on 10 , it was the @entity15 pair with a pep in their step , @entity67 and @entity18 trudging behind , buried in conversation
" @entity178 , believe ! " urged one fan bedecked in a @entity173 flag , and that belief grew when the pair were gifted a hole on 11 , winning it in par -- the ultimate no - no in fourball competition
@entity18 had been quiet , but now he came to life
two birdies in three holes , set up by accurate , powerful driving off the tee , swung the seesaw towards the blue corner once again
but @entity69 found the green on 16 in two well - struck hits and drained an eagle putt to level the contest , now stretching towards its fifth hour as a blustery wind whipped round the @entity193
all flat up the 18th , the final fourball match on the course now commanded a gallery that had swelled to maybe 10,000 or more -- spectators clad in an assortment of colors scrambling up banks and standing on tiptoes in the hope of a clear sight of the stars
and while the quality of golf on the last was average by the group 's high standards , bunkers and rough fully embraced , that only added to the intrigue
chances came and went , leaving the stage clear for @entity213 to tap home , silence the majority of the crowd and maintain his unbeaten record in the company of @entity69
@entity18 removed his cap , shook hands with his victors , and trudged off the side of the green
there was barely time to throw a few platitudes towards the press and wolf down some lunch , before the world @entity228 was teeing it up again in the foursomes , @entity67 once more at his side
