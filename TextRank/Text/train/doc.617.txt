@entity0 -- a contentious crowd of @entity4 shareholders showed up tuesday for their first meeting since the march tsunami to grill company executives about the future of the embattled company , as well as nuclear energy in @entity11
but in the end , they rejected a motion for the company to abandon nuclear power , according to the @entity11 news agency @entity16 , despite plenty of opposition
" i am against the idea of the board of directors ' decision to maintain the nuclear plants
i am here to see that the right decision is taken , " said @entity25 , as she waited in line to get into the meeting
" the world is moving in that direction and i do n't think @entity4 can resist that forever , " she said , referring to anti-nuclear movements in nations like @entity32
@entity32 's government formally approved a plan this month to close all the country 's nuclear power plants by 2022
more than 9,000 people attended the @entity4 meeting , which lasted six hours
both numbers were record highs , @entity16 said
wrapped in a white @entity46 protective suit and mask , similar to the suits worn by members of the clean - up crews at @entity52 power plant , @entity44 was urging a general vote in @entity11
protesters , including several activists from the environmental group @entity56 , held up a banner that called @entity4 " the worst ever polluting company
" they called out to the shareholders : " you can change things , get @entity4 to dismantle their nuclear plants
" many of the shareholders had never been to a board meeting before
but with @entity4 stocks in freefall -- they are worth about a tenth of their pre-tsunami value -- the shareholders wanted to have their say about plans for the company in which they had invested
more than three months after the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , @entity4 is still struggling to control the crisis at @entity52 , the worst nuclear accident since @entity78 in 1986
three of the reactors experienced full meltdowns and continue to spew radiation
recent efforts to decontaminate radioactive water that accumulated in the plant were halted because of continuing technical troubles .
