-- the bid process has been by far the most controversial that @entity2 has ever overseen
its decision to decide the fate of both the 2018 and 2022 bids at the same time has been widely criticized for encouraging vote collusion between bids -- an accusation @entity2 deny
but it was the revelations by the @entity14 newspaper the @entity13 that has marred the process
undercover journalists secretly filmed two members of @entity2 's then 24 - strong executive committee allegedly offering to sell their votes
@entity20 of @entity21 and @entity22 of @entity23 were both suspended by @entity2 's ethics panel following the revelations , reducing the voting number to 22
the same ethics panel also cleared the @entity27 2022 and the @entity30 - @entity29 2018 bid from colluding to vote for each other , allegations that had been made following the @entity13 investigation
another investigation by the @entity14 press , closer to the bid date , has made further uncomfortable accusations about three other @entity2 members
last monday the @entity39 alleged that @entity41 , president of the @entity42 , @entity43 , president of the @entity45 and @entity46 , head of the @entity48 football association , all took bribes during the 1990s
the finding by @entity2 is just the latest chapter in the ongoing story of the @entity54 bidding process which crescendos with the vote on thursday
