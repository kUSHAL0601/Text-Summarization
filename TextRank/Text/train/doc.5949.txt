-- a camera pans slowly over a row of children partly under a sheet , their eyes closed , their skin looking sallow
a man behind them , crazy with anger , shouts , " stop lying to us ! stop lying ! where did all these children go ? where is this regime ... that is killing us ? " chemical weapons , " he screams , holding his head
" we were hit with chemical weapons ! " inside a medical area , it 's chaos
footage shows people carrying limp bodies , some haphazardly covered in sheets , others splayed , nearly nude , on the floor
a man is on his back , staring blankly upward , his chest convulsing violently
others hold tissues to their mouth , appearing to gag
these were some of the videos posted online that opposition activists in @entity39 say show that the government has used chemical weapons in the countryside outside its capital @entity44
the allegations come as a @entity47 group arrived in @entity39 this week to determine whether either side in the conflict is using chemical weapons
hours after the videos were reported on across international news , @entity47 @entity52 ban ki - moon 's spokesperson issued a statement saying that he was " shocked " by the reports
the @entity47 mission is " fully engaged in the investigation process " and the team , which began work monday , " is in discussions " with the @entity39 government , " the statement read
" the @entity52 reiterates that any use of chemical weapons by any side under any circumstances would violate international humanitarian law
" @entity39 activists have been pushing since march 2011 to oust president @entity70
@entity0 could not immediately verify where or when the videos were recorded , and could not authenticate the number killed or injured
the war has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions , according to the @entity47
there have been repeated allegations that chemical weapons were being used during the course of the conflict
on wednesday @entity82 's government denied the allegations , calling them " completely baseless " on @entity39 's state - run media
initially @entity39 opposition groups claimed that hundreds were killed wednesday , but as the day wore on , the number went up -- more than 1,300 people , according to the opposition @entity89 and the @entity90
the council is an umbrella group of anti-regime activists
a senior @entity94 administration official said the @entity95 had no official confirmation that chemical weapons were used in recent attacks in @entity39
" if true , it would be further evidence of unconscionable brutality by a desperate man and a desperate regime , " the official said
the @entity105 released a statement about the allegations saying that the @entity95 is " deeply concerned by reports " that chemical weapons were used " and that officials are " working urgently to gather additional information
" " the @entity95 strongly condemns any and all use of chemical weapons , " it reads
" those responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable
today , we are formally requesting that the @entity47 urgently investigate this new allegation
" the @entity95 urged that the @entity47 team be given " immediate access to witnesses and affected individuals , and have the ability to examine and collect physical evidence without any interference or manipulation from the @entity39 government
" if the @entity39 government has nothing to hide and is truly committed to an impartial and credible investigation of chemical weapons use in @entity39 , it will facilitate the @entity47 team 's immediate and unfettered access to this site
" " we are aware of the reports ( of chemical weapons ) , and we are trying to find out more , " @entity47 spokesman @entity135 said wednesday
the alleged attacks took place in eastern and western @entity140 , rebel strongholds that the regime has been desperately trying to take back for more than a year
they do n't want rebels pushing into the capital
" the inspectors will not come , " said a resident who did n't want his name used
" if they wanted to come , they would have come a long time ago
" the @entity70 regime determines where the inspectors go , and they will not let them go there
there is already a siege around eastern @entity140 from the @entity70 regime
" @entity39 strikes refugee camp in northern @entity156 @entity158 officials , meanwhile , dismissed the claims of chemical weapons as a " provocation planned in advance , " @entity158 @entity164 spokesman @entity163 told @entity166 news agency
" the fact that agenda - driven regional mass media have begun an aggressive attack at once , as if on command , laying all the responsibility on the government , draws attention , " the reports quotes @entity163 saying in a statement wednesday
" the fact that the criminal action near @entity44 was carried out just when the mission of @entity47 experts to investigate the statements on possible chemical weapons use there has successfully begun its work in @entity39 points to this , " according to the report
hundreds reported dead the injured started streaming in shortly after predawn prayers , said dr. @entity188 at a field hospital in @entity190 , east of @entity44
forty of the 200 people brought to the field hospital died , @entity188 said
a man who referred to himself as a volunteer first responder , @entity195 , said he heard rockets unlike any he 'd heard before
he went to @entity197 , the closest area to him that was hit
over a few hours , his vision blurred , and eventually he lost vision and felt paralyzed , he said
@entity195 said he was with a doctor at a field hospital in @entity203 who reported 300 people dead and 500 wounded
the symptoms , he said , included unconsciousness , foaming from the nose and mouth , constricted pupils , fast heartbeat and difficulty breathing
people died of asphyxiation , he said
@entity70 is all smiles on his new @entity217 account countries express concern @entity221 foreign secretary @entity220 called on the @entity39 government to give access to the @entity47 team
" i am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people , including children , have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel - held areas near @entity44 , " he said
" these reports are uncorroborated and we are urgently seeking more information
but it is clear that if they are verified , it would mark a shocking escalation in the use of chemical weapons in @entity39
" the @entity240 said it did n't have independent confirmation that an attack took place as rebels claim , but it said those responsible for the alleged chemical weapons attack " will be held accountable
" " @entity249 also calls for light to be shed on the alleged use of chemical weapons in the attacks , " the ministry said
in denying the use of chemical weapons , a @entity39 government spokesman said the reports were an " attempt to divert the @entity47 chemical weapons investigation commission away from carrying out its duties , " the state - run @entity254 reported
separately , information minister @entity265 was quoted by @entity254 as saying that the government did not and would not use such weapons -- in the case they even exist
" everything that has been said is absurd , primitive , illogical and fabricated , " he said on state tv
" what we say is what we mean : there is no use of such things ( chemical weapons ) at all , at least not by the @entity39 army or the @entity39 state , and it 's easy to prove and it is not that complicated
" chemical weapons frightful , relatively inexpensive fingerpointing on both sides in june , the @entity105 said @entity70 's forces had crossed a " red line " by using chemical weapons , including the nerve agent sarin gas , against rebel forces
this prompted the @entity95 government to begin providing military support to opposition fighters , despite its earlier reluctance
@entity39 's government , meanwhile , has claimed rebel fighters have used chemical weapons as well
that includes a march incident in @entity300 in the northern province of @entity302 , according to state media
opposition officials have said rebels do n't have access to chemical weapons or the missiles needed to use them in an attack , while other rebel leaders said @entity39 troops fired " chemical rockets " at civilians and opposition forces
the government has agreed to arrangements " essential for cooperation to ensure the proper , safe and efficient conduct of the mission , " the @entity47 secretary - general 's office said last week
@entity300 will be one of the three incidents that @entity47 inspectors will look into , a @entity47 official said in late july
the opposition @entity326 called on @entity327 on wednesday " to apply all pressure within his powers to pressure the @entity39 regime , " according to a statement on @entity329
" we assure the world that silence and inaction in the face of such gross and large - scale war crimes , committed in this instance by the @entity39 regime , will only embolden the criminals to continue in this path
the international community is thus complicit in these crimes because of its polirazation , silence and inability to work on a settlement that would lead to the end of the daily bloodshed in @entity39 , " it said
@entity39 refugees stream into @entity353 @entity0 's @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 and @entity361 contributed to this report .
