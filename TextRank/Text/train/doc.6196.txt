-- it 's hard to know what 's real and what 's fake inside the worlds @entity5 creates
that rusted @entity7 - like structure in the above photo ? that 's a real - life playground in the @entity11 neighborhood of @entity12
the monolithic roller coaster behind it ? a product of @entity5 's @entity17 animation skills
fascinating ways people try to leave their mark on the world in his recent @entity23 , @entity5 , a @entity11 designer and creative director , has created a @entity25 fantasy world , filled with tottering skyscrapers made of refuse from a bygone era
each of his images is the result of multiple photographs layered together with computer - generated illustrations
@entity5 had been amassing a collection of photographs taken in some of the most down - and - out neighborhoods of @entity11
" i had been photographing places and environments for a while with no particular agenda or plan for them , " he says
he 'll take a tire from one , a metal container from another , the sky from a different photograph and then construct an illustrated architectural structure in the middle of it
pointed commentary the series is part study in @entity55 architecture , part deep commentary on life in the country
in one image you see a @entity62 - style home ( illustrated ) , often considered to be a mark of wealth , set amongst gravel and a tattered , old sofa
in another you see an illustrated monument - like structure constructed from corrugated iron in the middle of a rubble - strewn field
@entity5 has turned this corrugated iron , which is often used to build shacks , into a thing of grand beauty
context is key to really appreciating @entity5 's work
people around the world pose with everything they eat in a day at its most basic , the series addresses the idea of empowerment , and what it means in to gain it and lose it in @entity55
as a creative director who often finds himself working with corporations that shill an empty , unattainable idea of success , con / struct was a way to spark a conversation
" there 's an enormous gap between the realities in impoverished areas and what success actually equates to , " he says
the ambiguous relationship to reality is what makes @entity5 's work so fascinating
you know deep down that what you 're looking at is n't actually there , but the images do make you wonder : what if it were ? " it 's a mash of references that are real , but they become quite fictional in the end , " he says
" i 'd like people to look at it and ask themselves some kind of question
is it real or is it not ? what does it mean if it 's real or if it is n't ? that 's where it becomes really interesting
