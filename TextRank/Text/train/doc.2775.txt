@entity12 later flew to @entity13 , where she discussed @entity11 , human rights and economic ties
in her first visit to the central @entity20 country of @entity1 , she also addressed concerns about human rights and the need to bring more economic opportunities during a town hall meeting earlier in the day
@entity12 and president @entity32 " talked about our work to improve @entity1 's security , particularly along the border with @entity11 , and to combat drug trafficking , " @entity12 told reporters saturday
she praised @entity1 's progress in stopping human traffickers who force women and children to work in cotton fields without pay
but @entity12 said the country still faces important challenges
" @entity45 citizens deserve the opportunity to receive a decent education , own land , practice whatever religion they choose , enjoy a free and independent media , and participate equally in the political process , " @entity12 said at the town hall meeting , sponsored by the @entity43

@entity1 is one of the poorest countries in the region and was embroiled in civil war until 1997
it shares a 1,400 - kilometer border with @entity11 , " large parts of which are quite porous , " making the country vulnerable to extremists , a senior state department official said
" @entity94 holds the potential to help spur growth , create jobs , invigorate the private sector , and integrate @entity1 into the @entity100 and @entity101 economy , " @entity12 said

" @entity12 said the @entity4 is working with the @entity43 to support @entity109 in building an integrated energy grid along the @entity45 - @entity11 border
