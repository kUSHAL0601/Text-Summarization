-- it was supposed to be a couple 's little getaway , on a little plane , from @entity5 to the @entity7 coast
it turned into a tragedy
the saga of the single - engine @entity11 also turned into an international incident , spurring both the @entity14 and @entity15 to dispatch fighter jets to trail the plane after it went radio silent
so what happened ? why might a plane 's crew go unresponsive for over four hours , drifting southward over the @entity14 mainland , the @entity23 and eventually into the @entity24 as it did ? the @entity26 , or @entity26 , tweeted it might have been a case of hypoxia , a condition that sets in when a person does n't get enough oxygen -- as can happen if there 's an airflow problem high in the sky
what is hypoxia ? the best clues , so far , lie in what @entity14 fighter jet pilots saw as they looked into the aircraft : the pilot slumped over and the windows frosted over
then there was the radio communication , which the @entity46 says ended around 10 a.m. et. at that time , the plane was somewhere above @entity48 , @entity49 , about 600 miles south of the @entity51 , @entity5 , airport it left from around 8:45 a.m. destined for @entity53 , @entity7
the pilot asks to descend to 18,000 feet because " we have an indication that is not correct in the plane , " according to a stream of that transmission posted on @entity60
the air traffic controller told the pilot to " stand by , " then to proceed to 25,000 feet as he works on clearing the plane to go lower
the conversation continues off - and - on for over four minutes , though it 's largely one - sided : the pilot is n't clear in his remarks , nor does he ever declare any sort of emergency
at one point , he simply repeats his call sign twice when the controller asks if he heard the request to drop down to 20,000 feet
data indicates the plane did n't drop
it cruised for hours some 25,000 - feet above the ground
until sometime before 2:15 p.m. , that is , by which point estimates suggested the fuel would have run out
the aircraft , by then , had slowed considerably -- down to 176 knots ( 200 mph ) , from a consistent 308 knots for most of its flight
and it stopped altogether after crashing 14 miles off @entity88 's northeast coast
@entity91 , @entity90 ' children ' devastated ' the watery crash spurred @entity88 and the @entity14 to swiftly dispatch government aircraft to the scene
by early evening , @entity88 authorities had found an oil slick in the prime search area that -- at that point -- was the only possible sign of the downed aircraft , according to maj. @entity101 of the @entity102
this differs from earlier reports that a " wreckage field " had been spotted
" ( the search ) is fairly unpredictable given the size of the area and given the conditions out there , " said @entity101 , who said the operation would stop at nightfall before resuming saturday morning with assistance from a @entity109 cutter
" it 's very difficult to say what we will be able to recover and when
" as they searched , the @entity119 family of @entity51 , @entity5 , mourned
the @entity109 issued a statement indicating there were " three people reportedly aboard " the plane
yet @entity125 , the family spokesman and also the @entity90 ' nephew , said he believed the couple were the only people on the plane , with @entity119 flying the couple toward their vacation home in @entity7
while there was no official announcement immediately on the fate of those on the plane , the @entity90 ' children said in a statement they were " devastated by the tragic and sudden loss of our parents
" politicians in @entity5 hailed the couple for their business and charitable endeavors , with gov. @entity144 calling them " innovative and generous people who were committed to revitalizing downtown @entity51 and making the city they loved a better place for all
" @entity119 co-founded @entity150 in 1970 , a year after graduating from @entity151
according to his official bio , the company owns and manages more than 50 properties totaling over 9 million square feet in the @entity51 area
@entity156 founded @entity157 , a 100 - employee company that has an outlet store and makes " two national retail catalogs mailed to 35 million people annually , " according to its website
a post on @entity163 , which is produced in conjunction with the @entity166 's business school , notes that she ran the @entity167 , did whitewater rafting and learned how to fly a plane -- all in addition to raising three children and building her business
the @entity90 ' children acknowledged late friday afternoon that they " too are waiting for answers
" as they do , they took the chance to remember their parents and to express appreciation to those who were quick to offer condolences
" they loved and appreciated the opportunity to help build the community of @entity51 , and we thank everyone in the community for their expressions of support , " the children said
@entity14 , @entity15 fighter jets trail aircraft while authorities do n't know everything that went on inside the plane , including what caused it to crash , they have spoken about what they did in response
the government response started with those air traffic control communications -- and the alarming lack thereof
the unresponsiveness spurred @entity26 to dispatch two @entity204 fighter jets set from @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity207 , to investigate
@entity26 said another pair of fighter jets out of @entity210 , @entity7 -- f - 15s -- took over around 11:30 a.m. and escorted the plane as it continued south past the @entity14 mainland
the @entity14 fighter jets broke off their pursuit 12 miles off @entity15 , at which point the @entity217 plane was still cruising at about 25,000 feet
a @entity15 fighter jet took over trailing the aircraft as it flew near that @entity24 island , according to @entity26
their longstanding public enmity notwithstanding , @entity15 was cooperating fully with the @entity14 on the matter and did not consider the plane 's movement a violation of its airspace , according to a @entity15 source involved in conversations between the two nations
the @entity15 government even let the @entity109 's c - 130 aircraft go through its airspace and also gave permission for @entity14 " military aircraft , if necessary , " according to an official statement
but none of these efforts , from either of these countries , could do anything about the doomed @entity217 aircraft before it dropped off radar -- according to the flight tracking site , @entity244 -- at 2:11 p.m. both @entity90 knew how to fly , although @entity245 said @entity156 's ability to fly legally may have lapsed
the plane itself was owned by @entity119 's company , @entity150
it was built by the @entity252 manufacturer @entity251 and powered by one @entity254 engine
