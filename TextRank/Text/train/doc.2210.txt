-- @entity1 and @entity2 may have won the small matter of 30 grand slam singles titles between them but for the most famous couple in tennis their olympic gold medals are the most cherished moments of legendary playing careers
@entity1 won singles gold for @entity13 when tennis was an exhibition event in @entity16 in 1984 then followed it up with " official " gold at @entity18 four years years later
@entity2 topped the podium for the @entity20 at the @entity21 in 1996 and in an exclusive interview for @entity0 's @entity23 leaves no doubt where it stands in his list of achievements
" being on that podium was a boyhood dream , " he said
" the medal around the neck , the national anthem , tears in my eyes
it 's an out of body experience
" @entity1 's 1988 triumph was even more significant because it came in the same year she won all four grand slam tournaments
sports illustrated first coined the phrase " @entity39 " and it stuck
unique experience @entity1 can also wax lyrical about the uniqueness of the @entity44 experience
" to me this was bigger than a grand slam , it was more special , " the 43 - year - old said
" it 's a different feeling , it 's very unique and definitely more special
" given she was only 19 at the time , @entity1 's achievements are all the more remarkable
when she arrived in @entity52 she was feeling the effects of an arduous season , not to mention a grueling three - set victory over @entity56 of @entity57 in the @entity59 final
tsonga makes @entity44 tennis history after marathon match " i was a bit tired emotionally , probably physically as well , " @entity1 said
" i just remember arriving at the airport and all the attention that i was getting , i just think i was n't quite prepared for it at that point
" but @entity1 was able to concentrate on the task in hand and it was @entity56 who was again her victim in the singles final , this time in straight sets
the @entity13 also won a bronze in the women 's doubles and completed a full set of @entity44 medals after losing the gold medal match against @entity80 of the @entity20 on the clay of @entity82 in the @entity83
home soil @entity2 was only 18 at the time of the @entity86 and he also missed @entity82
but inspired by his father @entity87 , who had boxed for @entity88 at the 1948 and @entity89 -- losing in the early rounds both times -- @entity2 was determined to take his chance on home soil
" for me to be playing for my country and on top of it to be playing to achieve what my father had hoped for but had not accomplished in his @entity44 experience , i just felt like i was playing for something larger than just me , " said the @entity20 , now 42
@entity2 had endured a generally below - par year by his high standards and it was to prove a tough battle for gold , but as the memories flooded back he reeled off in quick succession how he did it
" @entity107 , 7 - 6 7 - 6
@entity108 , 6 - 3 6 - 4
@entity109 ( @entity110 ) , i was down a set and a break and beat him 6 - 3 in the third
he served for the match at 5 - 4 in the third and i ended up beating him 7 - 5 in the third
@entity116 , who i beat in two rough sets , 7 - 6 6 - 4
" playing in 102 degrees fahrenheit with high humidity at @entity120 , @entity2 made light of the conditions to dispatch the @entity123 -- a two - time @entity124 champion -- in straight sets
he openly shed tears of joy during the medal ceremony that followed
" i remember being on that podium and i remember that feeling of seeing it so many times over the years , what someone might be feeling when that gold medal is put round their neck , " @entity2 said
" @entity136 came to my eyes and my father was in the crowd so i was enjoying it on so many levels
" @entity44 disappointment while her future husband was winning gold , @entity1 had the disappointment of sitting out the @entity21 with a knee injury she aggravated while winning her seventh @entity148 title earlier in the summer
while other top players had often been lukewarm about having tennis in the @entity44 , @entity1 was almost evangelical in her support , feeding off her incredible experiences in @entity16 , where as a 15 - year - old she first made her golden mark in that exhibition event
four years later @entity1 enthusiastically embraced the true spirit of the games
" i stayed in the village for quite a few days until it got too loud and noisy and then i had to move back to the hotel , " she said
@entity161 crashes out of @entity148 " i was out at the boxing , i went to see some of the track and field , some of the swimming competitions , so i was really trying to take it all in , but also trying to play
" to get through the first few rounds and then playing for the gold medal was extraordinary
" by the time the 2000 olympics in @entity171 came around , @entity1 had retired from tennis and a year later she married @entity2
they now have two children , @entity175 and @entity176
@entity2 continued playing until 2006 , winning his final two grand slam titles at the @entity178 in 2001 and 2003
it was his @entity124 triumph in 1999 that enabled @entity2 to complete his own " @entity181 " -- one of only two men , @entity179 is the other -- to win all the four majors and @entity44 gold
proud parents as proud parents -- on a nominated " professions day " once a year -- @entity2 and @entity1 visit the @entity190 school where they send their children to talk about their careers
" we bring some trophies and all the children just want to take that gold medal , they want to hold it , they want to touch it
' is it real gold ? ' they ask , " @entity2 said
so who will win that " real gold " when @entity44 tennis comes to @entity148 , just 20 days after the finish of the @entity148 , won by @entity206 ? " i look at the favorites being @entity209 and @entity206 , " @entity2 predicted
as he speaks it is clear that he is envious of the current generation of greats getting the chance to have a double dose of glory at @entity148
" it 's our masters , it 's our @entity218 , it 's our pillar , the one if you could win one , most athletes , most tennis players would tell you , separate from the @entity44 , that @entity148 is the one they want to win , " he said
" so you combine that with the @entity44 , that 's got to be sensory overload
i do n't know even how to put that into perspective of what that 's going to feel like
" @entity206 , should he repeat his @entity148 heroics , would also complete the " @entity181 " but @entity1 's record of winning them all in one year may never be equaled
big highlight with three different winners of women 's grand slams this season it will certainly stand for another four years
" i think this is a big highlight of anybody 's career and i 'm pretty sure for anybody that you ask it 's a main goal , " @entity1 said
@entity244 has already spoken of her desire to win a third @entity246 in the women 's doubles with her elder sister @entity161
after her fifth @entity148 victory last month , the @entity20 is a hot favorite to double up -- as @entity161 did in 2000
meanwhile tennis ' golden couple will surely be keeping a keen eye on the action , finding time in between their busy schedule -- with their respective foundations and charities -- not to mention a busy family life with two very active children
" a lot of different interests , very active
they keep us on our toes , " said @entity1
" we 're professional babysitters , " joked @entity2
" the best job in the world , " his wife chimed in .
