are the media reveling in the @entity2 scandal just a bit too much ? the question sort of answers itself
journalists are secretly grateful to the former four - star general for rescuing us from six weeks of sober coverage about the fiscal cliff
not that anyone wants to plunge over the cliff , but daily reports on @entity14 negotiations with @entity15 are no one 's idea of a wild time
so let 's face it : we are wallowing in the tawdriness of this tale
but are the media losing perspective -- and rushing to judgment ? let 's concede up front that the story is inherently fascinating
a general with a walk - on - water reputation abruptly quits the @entity32 and admits an extramarital affair
his mistress turns out to be his admiring biographer , who hawked her book all over television
watch : an orgy of media advice on getting away with an affair then we learn that she triggered an @entity44 probe by sending what were perceived as harassing e-mails to a military volunteer in @entity48 -- and that a friendly @entity44 agent allegedly sent that woman shirtless photos
all of which was a prelude to the reports that gen. @entity55 , who in his spare time is running the war in @entity58 , exchanged up to 30,000 e-mails with said @entity48 woman
see ? it 's hard to keep up
the military sex saga has all the earmarks of a sizzling soap opera
but let 's take a step back
a couple of steps , in fact
those 30,000 e-mails initially described by sources as " flirtatious " ? unnamed defense officials put out the word the next day that there were far fewer -- maybe a few hundred , one told the @entity76 -- and that there was " no affair " between @entity55 and @entity79 , the @entity48 activist
or perhaps they were " overly flirtatious , " anonymous @entity81 officials told the @entity82 , and there were 30,000 pages but some just contained a single sentence
and @entity55 may have called @entity79 " sweetheart " in the e-mails , reports the @entity88
watch : media mistakes murky in @entity2 sex scandal as for the e-mails from @entity93 , @entity2 ' biographer , to @entity79 , i 've seen them described as everything from threatening to harassing to chastising @entity79 for acting like a " seductress " toward @entity2
again , we do n't really know
what about the notion that @entity93 was terribly indiscreet in her relationship with @entity2 ? her ghostwriter , the @entity76 's @entity101 , says he was " clueless " about any affair
there is , to be sure , a practical problem here
the principals are n't talking much
new information and insinuations tend to trickle out through friends , associates and officials - speaking - on - background , which leaves a sizable void that has sometimes been filled by speculation
nor have journalists covered themselves with glory by staking out the women 's homes
@entity79 has called local police asking for " diplomatic protection " against the media mob that has camped out near her residence , according to the @entity124 station in @entity125
what , exactly , did she do to warrant this treatment ? watch : @entity127 retreats from piece on b - schools with hottest women now we come to the heart of the matter
@entity2 , who has risked his life and been wounded as a soldier , showed bad judgment and fooled around
that 's not exactly an aberration in the highest levels of politics
perhaps you recall the name @entity143 , now a global statesman
so what is driving the story ? why has the press devoted far more attention to @entity2 ' personal life than , say , his agency 's role in the fatal attack in @entity153 ? our culture tends to put generals on a pedestal , and none more so than @entity2 , who courted journalists assiduously and received favorable coverage in return
the mighty media machine turned @entity2 into a household name , and now his image is crumbling beneath the weight of that machine
the fame he sought is being used against him
if the secretary of commerce gets caught carrying on with a smitten young woman , it 's a two - day story
some commentators who opposed @entity2 ' role in @entity176 's surge in @entity177 are using his fall from grace to settle scores
and do n't ignore the pop - culture element , swirling around this question : if the nation 's top spy ca n't keep an affair secret , who can ? but we have reached the point where the enormity of the media spectacle far exceeds the news value of the revelation that one of @entity194 's top military leaders was also a flawed human being
