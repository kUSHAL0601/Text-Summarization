a @entity2 footballer 's girlfriend could face a fine for her furious @entity5 tirade filled with the f - word
shortly after @entity9 's @entity8 lineup was announced tuesday , @entity10 -- the girlfriend of player @entity12 -- took to social media to express her displeasure that he was n't on the roster
" f * * * @entity9 and f * * * deschamps ! what a s * * * manager , " the 26 - year - old @entity19 model posted on her @entity5 account
" they are idiots ! we all know what you meant ! f * * * the national team and that stupid coach ! @entity12 is a great player , " she tweeted
@entity10 later apologized for her comments , saying they were not " aimed at the nation as a whole
" but coach @entity33 filed a civil lawsuit against her friday , charging that she publicly insulted him
@entity36 ' lawyer , @entity35 , told @entity37 that the lawsuit was filed due to the " seriousness of her comments
" the @entity41 said it supports @entity33 ' decision to file the suit
" the unanimous reaction confirms that all of @entity9 condemns these insults , " the @entity41 said on its website
deschamps defended his decision to leave the 26 - year - old midfielder off the squad , telling reporters this week that @entity12 " is a quality player , but his performance on the @entity2 national team is not at the same level as that at ( his @entity59 club ) @entity58
" @entity12 was handed a three - match ban after swearing at a reporter following @entity9 's loss to @entity63 in the 2012 @entity64
he was more circumspect this time , tweeting about his omission : " that 's life
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
