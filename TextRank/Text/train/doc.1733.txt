@entity0 -- a former employee of the @entity3 was sentenced thursday to 18 months in prison for stealing rare recordings from the government to sell on the @entity7
@entity8 , 67 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , pleaded guilty in october to an eight - year scheme to embezzle historic recordings donated to the government in order to peddle them on @entity16
among the items @entity8 took was an original master copy of an interview with baseball great @entity20 conducted while he was quail hunting in @entity23 on december 10 , 1937
@entity8 sold it on @entity16 in september 2010 for a paltry $ 34.74
law enforcement agents later recovered the audio recording , which was still in a paper sleeve marked with the number 2172 , its @entity3 number
@entity8 stole numerous other items , including @entity32 's eyewitness report of the 1937 @entity34 disaster , a september 1924 transcontinental defense test phone call and the first network television broadcast of the @entity37 in 1948
investigators seized sound recordings during a search of @entity8 's home in 2010
the government said 4,806 of those items were taken from the @entity3
" these items were entrusted to the @entity3 to be used by all citizens , not to be auctioned for personal profit to the highest bidder , " said @entity43 , the @entity44 in @entity10
the federal judge in @entity8 's case said losses from the scheme are calculated at $ 83,238
another hearing will be held on the matter of restitution
@entity8 worked at the @entity3 from 1969 until june 2010
the government said that in the 1970s @entity8 handled donations of more than 3,000 sound recordings made by a former radio engineer for @entity59 , @entity60 and the @entity62 radio networks
that former radio engineer , @entity63 , told the @entity64 he saw the listing for the @entity20 hunting recording when he was searching the internet in september 2010
@entity63 said he almost bought the item , but realized it was a recording he had donated to the archives years before
" it was @entity20 , and he certainly should have gotten a lot more than 34 bucks for it -- even if @entity20 is blowing his nose , people will buy it , " @entity63 told the newspaper
@entity63 , a radio historian and collector , assisted law enforcement in its investigation of the stolen recordings .
