-- @entity3 rep. @entity2 , recovering from a gunshot wound to the head suffered january 8 , is regaining part of her ability to speak and recently asked for toast while having breakfast , staffers said wednesday
spokesman @entity10 would not divulge what else @entity2 has said , other than that she has spoken other words " within the last few days
" " it 's very good news , " he said
@entity2 chief of staff @entity18 told @entity0 affiliate @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , that the congresswoman made the toast request while eating yogurt and oatmeal monday
" i said ' absolutely
' " " it 's just one of many good days that she 's had , " said @entity18 , adding @entity2 is progressing in speech , physical and occupational therapy every day
like at @entity30 in @entity20 , @entity2 is befriending the @entity32 medical staff and is appreciative of the support she is getting , @entity18 told @entity19
she smiles when you walk in the room
she offers you a hug or a pat on the shoulder
" the chief of staff declined to comment on whether @entity2 understands what happened the day of the shooting , saying that revealing that information should be up to the congresswoman and her husband , capt. @entity45
@entity46 said @entity2 undergoes six hours of therapy each day , which includes " very aggressive speech therapy
" @entity2 is at @entity51 rehabilitation hospital in @entity32
she was moved there late last month from @entity30 in @entity20 , where she was taken after the shooting at a " @entity54 on your corner " event at a @entity20 supermarket
six people were killed in the incident ; @entity2 was among 13 injured
authorities have said they believe @entity2 was targeted in the shooting
a 22 - year - old suspect , @entity63 , is facing federal charges
@entity2 ' office said she actually spoke her first words before wednesday morning , but has been speaking more since then
" the reason for choosing this rehab facility is because of their track record , " @entity46 said
" they are doing a fabulous job and working with her language and speech exercise and the physical therapy part of it
" @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity76 called it " a very important development " for @entity2
he noted that @entity2 was able to follow commands just after the shooting
one of her doctors told @entity82 was able to squeeze his hand when he asked her to just after her arrival at the hospital
doctors have also said she has been following commands -- important , @entity76 said , because it shows the ability to understand speech and then execute the command
but speaking herself " obviously indicates her ability to communicate is there , " he said -- meaning she can understand speech and also express herself
" it means a lot in terms of one 's overall brain recovery , " @entity76 said
@entity2 was shot in the left side of her brain , where major language centers are housed
@entity45 told the @entity104 last week that he was able to be in @entity105 to speak because her condition " continues to improve
every day she gets a little bit better , and the neurosurgeons and neurologists tell me that 's a great sign
the slope of that curve is very important
" through much of her recovery , doctors said @entity2 was unable to speak because of a breathing tube in her neck
doctors at @entity30 had said they believed she was trying to mouth words
@entity45 resumed training monday as commander of the space shuttle @entity122 's upcoming mission
he announced friday his plan to return to his crew and resume training , saying @entity2 is making progress in speech , occupational and physical therapy
@entity45 spent the days after the shooting at his wife 's hospital bedside , and @entity133 had named a backup shuttle commander for the mission in case he could n't return in time
but @entity45 last week underwent a simulated week of training in @entity32 , where @entity2 is in the rehabilitation hospital , and @entity133 officials said they were confident that @entity45 would be able to resume command of the mission
@entity45 told reporters on friday that he expects @entity2 to witness @entity122 's launch , scheduled for april 19
with @entity133 planning to retire the shuttle fleet , this is expected to be @entity122 's last mission
@entity46 said that @entity2 " fully understands " that her husband is flying the shuttle in april and is supportive of the decision
" i have every intention for her to be at the launch , " @entity45 said
@entity0 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report
