@entity0 , @entity1 -- growing up in @entity1 , @entity3 watched many of his peers succumb to drugs , gangs and crime
" kids here are forced to grow up in a very harsh environment filled with violence , " he said
reeling from decades of civil war , @entity1 continues to be plagued by poverty and violence
according to the @entity16 , the country has the fifth - worst homicide rate
@entity3 became a teacher in his hometown , and he found that many of his students were struggling with the same issues his generation had faced
" their parents had no jobs ; their families were disintegrating
they had no hope or motivation , " he said
so , at 23 and with his parent 's blessing , @entity3 turned part of his family 's home into a community center
in 2006 , he began tutoring and mentoring a handful of kids after school
@entity39 spread quickly , and children from all over the community joined the group
today , his program offers free classes , tutoring and meals , as well as low - cost medical care
his nonprofit , @entity49 -- which translates to the @entity50 -- has helped more than 1,000 children
" i created a safe place for them to realize that they actually can change bad aspects in their lives and their community , " said @entity3 , now 30
" i wanted to give them a better present in order to attain a brighter future
" finding hope at home @entity64 has become a haven in a region where young people are in desperate need of opportunity and protection
an unprecedented number of children from @entity73 have made the treacherous journey to the @entity75 to flee violence and poverty in their countries
since october , more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors from @entity1 , @entity81 and @entity82 have been caught crossing the @entity75 border
some 37 % are from @entity1 -- more than any other country , according to the @entity85
" these families are in desperate situations
they have no money and no hope for a better future for their children , " @entity3 said
despite this harsh reality , @entity3 believes his country can rebuild itself from within
but for the young people to help do that , he says , they need resources and support
" in a violent country , the only weapon we can have is love , " he said
" these kids are already powerful , but they do n't know that yet
" to that end , @entity64 offers productive activities for people 3 to 18 , all aimed at giving them the tools they need to transform their families and their communities
a generation of peacemakers @entity3 ' program takes place in the entire front portion of his family 's home as well as another building down the block
at the main center , painted with colorful murals and quotes , children are exposed to a number of creative outlets
they take classes in dance , music , photography , theater and juggling and often put on performances for each other
" these classes are to show kids that they can pursue their own passions in order to improve their lives , " @entity3 said
leadership seminars teach the children about social , political and cultural issues
they learn the importance of moral courage , social justice and self - expression
they also explore ways to reduce violence
" we are raising them to be the future leaders of @entity1 , " @entity3 said
the group 's feeding program provides a nutritious meal to more than 100 children each day
for many of them , it is the only meal they will have all day , says @entity3
@entity64 also runs a medical clinic that provides basic health services to more than 1,500 people each year
and the organization is in the process of building its own school , where more than 250 students will attend preschool through sixth grade

i want to inspire these kids , " he said
" they are the ones in charge of writing the new history in @entity1
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity176 website and see how to help .
