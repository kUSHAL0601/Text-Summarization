@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 pensioner @entity3 was " only 72 " when she left the @entity4 in 1986 to be closer to her family in @entity6
at the time , she was receiving the full @entity4 pension of just over £ 38 ( $ 58 ) a week
twenty - four years later , she is still receiving the same amount , and after a @entity9 ruling tuesday she is not likely to receive any more
" you know this is n't about me , " the 96 - year - old told @entity2 on the phone from her home in @entity6
" it 's about the @entity4 government 's deception and dishonesty
our contributions were deducted from source with the clear understanding that we would get a full pension on retirement , but somewhere along the lines they changed the rule
in my book , in our book , they 're guilty of both fraud and deception
" @entity31 is one of more than half a million @entity4 expatriates living in countries including @entity6 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , whose pensions are not linked to inflation
on tuesday , the @entity9 ruled by a majority of 11 to six that the @entity4 government had not breached their human rights by failing to " up - rate " their pensions to bring them into line with the cost of living
under @entity4 rules , pensioners in a number of countries who do not have reciprocal agreements with the @entity4 receive the same pension they were entitled to in the year they left @entity4
people who emigrated before retirement age receive the amount they would have received at retirement age in the @entity4
in @entity4 , men qualify for a pension at 65 , women at 60
a @entity4 expatriate who retires to @entity35 , for example , receives less money each week than if they had contributed the same amount during their working life and then emigrated to @entity66 , @entity67 , the @entity68 , the @entity69 , or one of more than 40 countries which do have reciprocal @entity4 agreements
@entity72 moved to @entity34 at the age of 23 after @entity75 in her 80s , she receives a @entity4 pension of just £ 2 ( $ 3 ) a week
" the exchange rate is ten to one
then the bank takes charges you see
no , you ca n't survive
a loaf of bread is ten rand
i get around 20 rand a week
so it 's really not worth bothering about , " she said
aging expatriates who have seen their pensions dwindle due to inflation and the falling value of the pound have been campaigning for change
the first court case was brought against the @entity4 government in 2002 by @entity95 , a @entity4 resident who moved to @entity34 in 1989
according to court documents , she receives a basic state pension of £ 67.50 ( $ 103 ) -- £ 14.55 ( $ 22 ) less than she would have received if her pension was index - linked
after failing to make her case in the @entity4 @entity100 , she took her claim to the @entity102 and then the @entity103
many saw this week 's ruling in the @entity9 as the last legal avenue for recourse , but they are reluctant to give up the fight
" i do n't think we 're going to make it the end of the road , " said @entity109 , director of @entity4 parliamentary affairs for the @entity111
" certainly i think we 're going to mobilize public opinion with the new parliament , " he added , referring to the upcoming @entity4 election expected on may 6
the vice president of the @entity119 , @entity120 said : " now it is up to the people still working or living in @entity4 to tell their government that they will no longer stand for this injustice
by paying increases in some countries and withholding them in others , the @entity4 government severely limits our freedom of choice regarding where we can retire
" it is estimated that around 250,000 @entity4 pensioners living in @entity35 are affected by the @entity4 policy
" this is a devastating result and it will affect the lives of many @entity4 expat pensioners
the living standards of many will only continue to decline , " said @entity137 , chairman of @entity138 in @entity35 , who says one elderly woman there receives less than £ 7 ( $ 10 ) a week after moving to the country in 1974
in a short statement , the @entity4 @entity144 said it had noted that the court found in favor of the government
" we do not therefore plan to make any changes to the current arrangements , which allow for the exportability and up rating of @entity4 state pensions
" @entity3 is still angry
not only for herself , she says , but for the pensioners in @entity4 who may now be reluctant to leave
" there are many very lonely people we know in the @entity4 who would give anything to come to @entity6 to join their families but they do n't take that risk , " she said
a former nurse , @entity31 worked part - time during and after @entity165 to ensure she could continue to support her three sons should anything happen to her husband
he was injured but lived for another 26 years after the war ended
a few years after his death , @entity31 remarried
only after losing her second husband in the mid- 1980s did she move to join her family in @entity6
she sold her home when prices were low but she says it did n't take long before her capital was eroded and she was relying on her @entity4 pension for basic needs
" it finished up with my family , not exactly subsidizing me with money , but buying big things for me , " she said
" i 'm 96 now
i 've been fortunate ; @entity6 has been good to me
i 've been in subsidized housing for 20 years but it should n't be that way
" if her pension was indexed @entity31 would be receiving £ 82 ( $ 125 ) a week , more than twice as much as she does now
" we 'd be lucky the way things are going now if we get a dollar for a pound
so , £ 82 would be a darn sight better
