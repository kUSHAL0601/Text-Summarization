@entity0 , @entity1 -- the optimism once held by many @entity4 has been " beaten out " of them amid a lagging economy , threat of terrorism and two ongoing wars , according to a professor at @entity10
" all of those things ... have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be , " says @entity11 , a @entity12 citizen who teaches @entity4 history
@entity11 recently wrote about what he describes as " @entity4 the miserable " -- the mood swing he has seen in his 30 years in the @entity4 -- for @entity18 , a @entity12 magazine
read the professor 's full essay @entity11 spoke with @entity2 about his perspective
below is a transcript of that conversation , which has been edited : @entity2 : how would you describe the change in @entity4 since you first came to @entity4 ? @entity11 : the change is this : i do n't get the same sense of intense self confidence as i used to feel when i first came to @entity4 , even though that was a period that 's usually remembered as a pretty grim time -- the @entity32 years when there was a lot of stagnation and inflation and a general feeling of malaise
even so , to me , it seemed incredibly energetic here
people in @entity4 worked much , much harder than they did in @entity12
they had faith in progress
and there was this feeling of being intensely wide awake for the first time
but now , i think some of that optimism has been beaten out
counter : why there 's reason for optimism it 's been a very tough 10 years since 2001 , has n't it ? the attack on the @entity56 , the growing fear of terrorism , the difficulty of prevailing in the wars , obviously , more recently the recession
all of those things , collectively , have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be
@entity2 : do you attribute it to a change in @entity4 mentality or are we exposed to an array of different beliefs through the ever - expanding media landscape ? @entity11 : it 's certainly true there are far more media than there used to be ... that devote a lot of time to people who are dissatisfied
in other words , if somebody 's happy , that is n't news
it 's certainly news when they become dissatisfied in some way or they have some kind of problem to deal with
in that sense , i suppose there 's an inherent bias in favor of bad news
but i think it 's more than that
i 've spent most of the last 30 years in the company of academics , who also tend to be pessimistic people
they tend to have very high ideals for @entity4
when they see it does n't live up to its ideals , it makes them disappointed and sometimes embittered
so it may be that , if i spent more time with less educated people , i would n't have this sense quite so acutely
i think that 's quite possible
@entity2 : you write : " the decline of @entity4 confidence is n't just a temporary blip on the screen brought on by the recession
" elaborate on that for me
@entity11 : even before this recession began , i guess it was in october and november 2008 when things really started to go bad
already by then , i was having a feeling that the general national optimism was less emphatic than it used to be
in the first five or six years of the last decade , there was this feeling that things were going wrong , particularly that the wars were grinding on interminably and that it was very difficult to prevail
it was n't the same kind of decisive conflict as @entity129 where you 're fighting against a nation - state and you can clearly detect when you 're winning
the dispersal of the enemy and the very shadowy character of terrorism tends to be very depressing to confront
you have to maintain a high degree of vigilance and sometimes you have to take comfort in thinking what 's extraordinary is what did n't happen ; there was n't another major attack
that does n't feel like a victory
... that kind of thing is what i was attentive to when i was writing this story
@entity2 : if we are in this funk as you describe , is there anything wrong with that ? and how do we emerge from it ? @entity11 : the one thing i 've always admired about @entity4 is their willingness to be self - critical
i do think you could take the view that the very fact that so many @entity4 are willing to scrutinize their own behavior and their nation 's behavior is a sign that they do have these high ideals and they want to live up to them
so in that sense , you can take an optimistic view , even of pessimism -- that sooner or later , the sheer attention to it is going to cause people to recover
but i do think there are generational trends in @entity4 life
people who were brought up in the 1930s during the @entity180 -- the image of it stayed with them for a lifetime
... in the same way , i expect the kids who have grown up in the last few years are also going to carry the marks of this with them through life
they 'll come into conflict with their own children who have different generational experiences
it 's impossible at this stage to say what 's going to happen next
... but it certainly is true studying the @entity4 past , you can see how various traumatic events through the nation 's history leave a long - term impression on the people themselves
@entity2 : you kind of hint about this in your piece : maybe you 're just going through a midlife crisis and that 's why you might have this view
@entity11 : i think that 's possible , but i think i 'm describing something more real than that
my job is to study the @entity4 people in the past ; but also to some extent in the present
i really do feel this kind of change has come about
but you ca n't quantify it
you ca n't say 8 out of 10 people are optimistic -- or at least if you try to you 're really giving a false sense of definiteness
so what i 'm trying to do is capture a mood and compare it to a mood that i saw previously
... i still feel there 's an enormous amount of hope and potential and capability here , so i do n't share the feeling of gloom , which i see in the people around me
@entity2 : describe the " @entity239 " analogy for me ? @entity11 : the plot [ of " avatar " ] is kind of incredibly depressing
the corporation is at the center of this planet
first of all , they have invaded the planet
and now they 're sort of stomping on the homeland of the blue people who live there
and really the picture it gives you of @entity4 is incredibly depressing
it shows @entity4 to be greedy and incredibly violent and intolerant , and they have n't got time for this anthropological experiment that 's going on
but obviously , the hero is one of the @entity4
he 's clearly an outsider
... the main part of the story is a condemnation of @entity4 and its values
i was surprised how few reviewers said this picture is a grotesque distortion of what we 're really like
@entity2 : have you started receiving hate mail yet : hey , @entity270 , get the hell out of our country ? @entity11 : no , not at all
... it certainly is n't meant to be an attack on @entity4 ; quite the opposite
as i say , i 'm very , very pro-american
@entity2 : any final thoughts ? @entity11 : to me , coming from @entity12 , one thing that is so inspiring about the @entity4 is people really believe in human equality and they really take it seriously and they try to make it a reality
when i was growing up in @entity12 , nobody talked about equality
it 's a very hierarchical society in @entity12 , and everyone has their own place within the hierarchy and others are below them -- and then , what you 've got to do is stay in your place
so it felt very liberating for me to come to @entity4
although obviously , this is n't a society where everybody is equal in practice
but at least this is a place where everybody tries hard to make sure that every kid really does have the opportunities to make the most of their own abilities
and that 's a great thing
there have n't been many societies in the entire history of the world that have been like that .
