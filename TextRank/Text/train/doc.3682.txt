a @entity1 man who spent 15 years on death row for a murder he did not commit was released friday from prison in an exoneration brought about by the @entity6
" it 's been a long journey , " @entity7 , 38 , said during a news conference with his lawyers
" it 's people like y'all who give people like us a chance
" @entity7 , who was convicted after falsely confessing to having raped and murdered his 14 - year - old step - cousin , said he hopes law enforcement will learn from his case
" make sure you have the right person before you start a process of executing someone , " he said
" because it costs a lot of money to go back and look at all of these cases again
if it 's done right the first time , you should n't have to do that
" @entity7 described as " surreal " his walk earlier in the day out of @entity33
" it 's not something you can prepare yourself for , because you 've been living in those conditions for so long
" asked how he felt , @entity7 did not hesitate
" free , " he said
" former inmate exonerated in rape case joins pro football team initially , he said , he felt like giving up , but resisted the temptation
" the minute you give up completely is the minute you die , " he said
" @entity7 said that he was looking forward to " peace and quiet ... just concentrating on putting my life back together and moving forward
" his court - ordered release came after dna and other evidence exonerated him
@entity49 district attorney @entity48 agreed with @entity7 's lawyers that he had confessed to something he did not do
@entity48 " joined the @entity6 and @entity7 's other counsel in agreeing to overturn @entity7 's conviction and death sentence after his confession to police was determined to be false , " the district attorney said in a statement
" this is a damn good day at the office , " said @entity60 , director of the @entity61 , who has represented @entity7 since 1998
the case points to the need to abolish the death penalty , she said
" it does n't make us safer ; it makes the pain of murder worse ; and if we ca n't figure out how to have a death penalty that does n't put innocent men on death row and innocent women on death row across the country , then we do n't deserve to have it
it is a human rights violation
we need to end it now
" @entity7 was convicted of killing his relative , @entity83 , whose body was found on july 20 , 1996 , a day after she left her apartment to go to a nearby supermarket
more than 2,000 wrongfully convicted people exonerated in 23 years , researchers say he was among a number of people who were interviewed by police
after some nine hours of interrogation , " he provided an apparent confession to raping and murdering the victim , " the @entity61 said in a news release
primarily on that basis , @entity7 was convicted and sentenced to death in october 1997 , it said
a decade later , his legal team gave evidence to the district attorney of @entity7 's innocence and an investigation -- which wound up involving hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of dna testing , forensic evidence and interviews -- got under way
" the probe confirmed that @entity7 's confession was false in every significant aspect , " the @entity61 said
since 2000 , six people have been released from @entity1 's death row after being exonerated ; in that time , three people have been executed , it said
" what we were doing was searching for the truth , " said @entity113 , co-director of the @entity6 , which is affiliated with @entity115 's @entity114
" we hope that justice is done and we find the person who really committed the crime
" he said @entity7 was the 300th person exonerated through dna testing
asked what might have led @entity7 to confess , @entity113 said , " that is something that we 're studying and is part of the lessons to be learned here
that 's not one of the things that i think is probably appropriate for us to discuss at the moment
" the case points to the need for police to videotape interrogations , according to @entity113
had that been done in this case , " we would n't be sitting here today , " @entity113 said
" it 's a simple thing to do and it 's sweeping the country
