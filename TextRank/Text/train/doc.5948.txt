the hunt is still on for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in raids last week
the suspected key link between senior @entity9 operatives in @entity10 and the @entity6 terrorist cell , @entity6 - @entity13 @entity9 fighter @entity12 , is still at large , a senior @entity6 counterterrorism official said
@entity12 's last known location was believed to be @entity16 , the official said
from @entity17 to @entity18 and back : @entity20 's nightmare as @entity6 's search continues , other @entity20 nations are also moving in on suspected @entity24 cells amid concerns heightened by the terror attacks in @entity27 two weeks ago
here 's a look at the latest developments : - police in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 raided 13 properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight , police in the @entity32 capital said tuesday
most of the action was directed at a group connected to a mosque in the district of @entity44
the overnight raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday , identified as @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity34 police said
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to @entity9
some 200 police officers were involved in the raids at 13 sites across three @entity32 states
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes , but had contact with @entity49 and @entity50 there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in @entity32
five @entity6 nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week 's raids , federal prosecutor @entity66 said
the terror cell was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers , he said
@entity6 counterterrorism agencies say they suspect that the ringleader of the cell is @entity12 , the senior @entity6 counterterrorism official said
@entity12 is also known as @entity81 and @entity82 , the official said
according to @entity83 , a reporter at the @entity6 newspaper @entity84 who tracks @entity6 foreign fighters in @entity10 for the blog " emmejihad , " @entity12 is a 27 - year - old from the @entity90 district of @entity91 who traveled to @entity10 in january 2014 and joined @entity9 soon afterward
the two gunmen killed in one of the raids , in the city of @entity97 , are @entity6 of @entity99 descent from the same @entity91 district
they were in phone contact with an @entity9 ringleader in @entity16 , who @entity6 authorities believe was probably abaaoud
but @entity6 authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an @entity107 suspect arrested in @entity16 over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and @entity9
that 33 - year - old suspect was wanted in @entity6 on charges of terrorist activity , @entity16 police said monday
@entity6 is requesting an extradition
one suspect survived the police raid in @entity97 , named as @entity117
he was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack , among other charges , said his attorney , @entity127
but @entity127 said his client was not involved in any terrorism ; he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
five men -- purportedly @entity134 of @entity136 origin -- were arrested in southern @entity137 overnight while planning an act of terrorism , according to @entity137 media reports tuesday

new surveillance video obtained by @entity1 shows @entity177 and his partner @entity198 outside a @entity178 institution in @entity27
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the @entity27 attacks says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple was carrying out surveillance of possible targets for several months before @entity177 launched his attack against the kosher supermarket
@entity215 mayor @entity214 visited the scene of the siege tuesday , and he added flowers to a mound of bouquets , candles and handwritten tributes to those killed
