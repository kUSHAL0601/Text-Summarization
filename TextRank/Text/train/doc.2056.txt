-- since the @entity2 were launched in 2000 , the world has made tremendous gains in reducing new hiv infections and helping people with @entity6 to live longer and healthier lives
for a long time , efforts to ensure that a pregnant woman living with @entity6 would not pass the virus to her child -- during pregnancy , at childbirth , or during breastfeeding -- have lagged behind the promise of technology
but now we can say confidently that with the right efforts , we can reduce new hiv infections among children to zero , even within the short time remaining until the @entity2 are concluded at the end of 2015
during the upcoming meeting of leaders at the @entity29 , the world 's governments , ngos and the private sector should take an important step toward reaching the goal of zero new hiv infections among children
this can be achieved by deploying a new generation of community health workers ( @entity37 ) who will not only help to fight @entity39 but also bring other kinds of health care to the communities they are serving
@entity44 , @entity46 's @entity45 , many businesses and @entity25 have joined forces with @entity50 governments in the 1 million @entity51 to deploy this large number of @entity37 across @entity50 by the end of 2015
although we 've known for more than a decade that transmission of @entity6 from a pregnant woman to her child can be stopped through appropriate interventions -- including timely access to antiretroviral medicines -- the practical challenges to eliminating new infections are substantial
most women in low - income countries give birth at home , without medical assistance , and usually without the benefit of prenatal care
one key to overcoming these challenges is to ensure that trained health care professionals are on hand to provide prenatal and delivery support , even in the poorest villages
the @entity75 and @entity44 are doing just that by building a network of health workers , supported with training , new technology , a supply chain of antiretrovirals and other key inputs , and professional supervision at the level of clinics and hospitals
today , teams of trained health workers across the @entity89 complement the nurses and midwives in a structured health care system that is providing pregnant women with not only services to prevent @entity6 transmission , but comprehensive services including prenatal care , counseling for hiv - positive women , access to antiretrovirals and professional follow - up care for newborns
the telecoms industry is also playing a new and historic role
in the @entity107 system , the health workers are equipped with smartphones
with better technology , community health workers are now accessing real - time emergency guidance , making calls for ambulances in emergencies , maintaining digital health records for each household and more
with community - based care , the @entity37 are able to expand services to reach more women and newborns
for example , in the @entity75 of @entity121 in @entity122 , nearly all pregnant women are receiving @entity6 counseling and testing , compared with fewer than half in 2008
children who do become infected with @entity6 are diagnosed earlier and given timely access to @entity6 treatment , care and support
the community health workers are also playing a growing role in identifying bottlenecks and implementing solutions by engaging decision makers from local to national levels
challenges such as low acceptance of @entity6 counseling and testing , commodity stock - outs and infant feeding issues are being identified and addressed with local responses
next week as heads of state and global leaders gather at the @entity146 , @entity44 , the @entity75 and partners in the telecoms industry and beyond will seize the opportunity to make a push for zero new hiv infections among children , and for the 1 million @entity37 in @entity50 who can help make the goal a reality
on september 28 , we will also join 60,000 people on the @entity158 of @entity160 's @entity159 for @entity161 -- along with many millions more watching from around the world -- to issue a global appeal for these historic objectives
we believe that the world will rise to the occasion
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 and @entity170 .
