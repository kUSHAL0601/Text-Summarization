-- if you 've cast @entity3 as either an " @entity7 " runner - up , pop - country musician or both -- it 's time to re-evaluate
last week she released her third album , " @entity9 , " an 11 - song set of traditional country music reflecting the potent ballad style of classic stars like @entity14 and @entity15 as well as a rowdy side on a few numbers
but it 's " @entity20 " that finds @entity3 at her best : she 's sad and vulnerable throughout
anyone that knows the story of her strained relationship with her mother can hear the emotion wrapped up in this number
@entity3 's voice always worked in her pop - oriented prior albums , but with " @entity9 " she sounds wise beyond her 25 years , both in lyric and voice
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity3 about her new album , ditching a pop sound and writing with @entity35
@entity0 : the new record is called " @entity9
" should we infer this is your most potent batch of songs to date ? @entity3 : ( @entity41
) i guess you could say that
i 'm so proud of this record
i 've never worked harder on anything like i did this
i branched out , wrote with different song writers ; people i never thought in a million years that would write with me
i just really got to take my time and really go back to the roots of country music and show who influenced me growing up
i 'm happy that i had the freedom to sprinkle a little bit of that through the record
@entity0 : who are these people you were obsessed with when you were growing up ? @entity3 : i loved @entity14 , i love @entity61 and @entity15
i do n't know if it was the fact that their music felt so real and all of their songs came from a real place in their life
i feel like we were all raised the same
@entity0 : you had a rather rough upbringing
how much of that experience informs your work these days ? songs like " @entity76 " and " @entity20 " stand out
@entity3 : i 'd definitely say that my life is on this record
when my husband ( country musician @entity81 ) and i sat down and wrote " @entity20 , " there were no intentions of it to ever be heard or go into the studio to record it
i do n't really think about that when i sit down and write about what i 'm going through
i did n't write that song for anybody else but me i guess
sometimes it 's ok to do things for yourself every now and then
a couple of our songwriting friends heard it and they really encouraged me to think about trying to get it on the record
it 's one of those things that just kind of happened and there was no plan for it except for me to find closure
@entity0 : " @entity9 " has shifted to this more traditional sound
sometimes , it 's back - bar stomp , other times it 's these sleepy , pedal steel ballads
did you grow tired of the pop - oriented sound ? @entity3 : i never wanted to be a pop singer
i 've never wanted to be
i 've always wanted to make records like this
the first thing i ever said when i went into the @entity117 building was " i love @entity15 , i love @entity14 , i love @entity61
" look , times are tough for record companies and i get that they have a formula and have to play certain things safe
me not being an established artist ... they ca n't afford to take certain risks
i know who i am now , better
i was 19 when i got in line for " @entity7
" nobody knows who they are at 19 ; you 're not supposed to
i did this whole thing backwards
you come off a show like " idol " and you 're a celebrity , but for what ? you do n't have a song on the radio , you do n't have an album out
you 've been singing cover songs and you have n't done anything really
you have to develop backwards as an artist
become a celebrity first and figure out " what kind of artist am i and where do i belong ? " @entity0 : how does your writing go these days ? @entity3 : i just write about whatever i feel like that day
i do n't ever sit down with a plan
( @entity150 ) @entity149 told me -- and i never had anyone say this to me before -- she said " you speak in lyrics
" and i said " huh ? " she said " you speak in lyrics
" the first time we ever wrote , she 's writing down everything i 'm saying
i do n't know how to write about anything else but what 's going on
i ca n't just go in and make some bulls * * * up
i ca n't do that
it has to come from a real place or i ca n't write it
@entity0 : a couple of years ago , you penned a tune called " @entity171 " with @entity35
have you all talked about doing anything more together ? @entity3 : no we have n't
it 's been five years ago ... it feels like
we wrote that when we were out on tour with @entity176 and it seems like so long ago
but no , we have n't written since then
but even there , i stormed on our bus and i was upset about a boy and we just ended up writing about it
no intentions of writing , just talking and we started playing
@entity184 thought anyone would hear it
@entity0 : that seems to be a theme with you
write something you do n't think anyone 's going to hear , then release it
maybe one day i can release and album called " @entity195 " and it has all the song 's i 've written that nobody 's heard .
