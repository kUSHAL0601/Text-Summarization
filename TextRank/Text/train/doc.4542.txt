-- you feel worse by the hour
your joints ache ; your head feels heavy ; you ca n't stop coughing
you 're freezing , even as your temperature keeps climbing , and your stomach is upset
face it : you have the flu
now what do you do ? most flu patients should not go to an emergency room , said dr. @entity13 , internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at @entity16 in @entity17
they will likely be sent home , as there is very little that can be done for them
a fever as high as 103 degrees @entity25 is common for the flu , he said
patients with normal flu symptoms should get a lot of rest and take painkillers to help with muscle aches , @entity13 said
and while you might not believe it today ( or tomorrow , or the next day ) , " in five to seven days , you 're going to be feeling yourself again , " he promised
better flu vaccine on the horizon but there are scenarios in which going to a hospital is necessary
if a patient is short of breath or ca n't keep fluids down because of nausea , these are signs of a problem that needs immediate attention , @entity13 said
excessive vomiting or sweating from fever can lead to dehydration , which is serious and requires treatment
the antiviral medications @entity53 ( oseltamivir ) and @entity55 ( zanamivir ) can reduce the severity of symptoms and the length of illness , but the drug has to be taken within 48 hours of the first appearance of symptoms -- you know , the " i will not get sick " phase -- to be most effective
antiviral treatment is recommended mostly for people at a higher risk of flu complications
that would include people younger than 2 or older than 64 ; those with chronic diseases ; patients with suppressed immune systems ; and people of @entity79 or @entity78 heritage , according to the @entity80
it wo n't help to take @entity53 or @entity55 as a preventative , because they are designed to treat symptoms , @entity13 said
all they are likely to do for a healthy person is cause an upset stomach
getting a flu shot while you 're healthy wo n't give you 100 % protection , but it is your best bet
