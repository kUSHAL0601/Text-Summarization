-- @entity2 warlord @entity1 and his struggling militia are poaching elephant ivory across @entity5 to get funds for weapons , ammunition and food , a report says
@entity1 is wanted by the @entity11 for alleged war crimes
he is accused of recruiting underage boys as fighters and girls as sex slaves , and is the subject of a massive manhunt aided by @entity20 special forces
his militia , the @entity21 , has been butchering elephants for years , according to a report released tuesday by various groups , including the @entity25 and the @entity26
" @entity29 investments are needed to combat the @entity21 across @entity5 , " said co-author @entity27 , an @entity25 field researcher
" governments in @entity31 and elsewhere who fail to regulate the illegal ivory trade share responsibility for atrocities committed by the @entity21 and other armed groups engaged in poaching
" the report includes accounts by former captives , who say that the militia trades ivory with customers who land in the vast forest in helicopters
@entity20 offers $ 5 million for information leading to @entity1 @entity5 's elephants are facing higher risks as demand for ivory grows in @entity31
over the last decade , conservationists say poachers have reduced @entity5 's forest elephant population by 62 % , threatening the magnificent mammals with eventual extinction
unlike decades past when poachers across the continent ran down elephants using spears , attackers are now highly organized and armed with sophisticated weapons
in northern @entity64 , heavily armed poachers are known to swoop in on horseback in the vast forests
the vast @entity67 in the @entity68 is one of the areas mostly targeted by the militia , the report said
@entity1 and his militia are wanted men
the @entity20 is offering $ 5 million for information leading to the arrest , transfer or conviction of three top leaders of the @entity21 , including @entity1
a small number of @entity20 special forces are advising and assisting regional military efforts to hunt him down .
