@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 lauded the @entity5 @entity4 takeover tuesday night , but shied away from endorsing sen. @entity6 to lead the new majority
the @entity8 @entity5 declined to say whether he would vote for @entity9 -- the current @entity4 minority leader -- to become the @entity4 majority leader
" that 'll be a decision for the conference to make and that 'll be decided next week , " @entity2 told @entity1 's @entity11 twice on @entity1
" tonight what i 'm focused on is the results of this election , which is a resounding @entity5 majority , " @entity2 said
it 's not the first time that @entity2 , a tea party favorite and potential 2016 presidential contender , has skirted the question , also declining to pledge his loyalty to @entity9 in an interview with the @entity27 published sunday
but @entity2 did say that @entity28 are " frustrated with what 's happening in @entity0
" and @entity9 might just be the face of that @entity5 establishment , having served in @entity32 for the past three decades
" now the responsibility falls on us to lead with a positive , bold , optimistic , pro-jobs agenda and i hope that we see @entity5 unite , " @entity2 said
" i think a lot of voters are skeptical of politicians in both parties and i very much hope that my party can validate and earn the trust that 's been placed in us and that we can stand up , listen to the people
" @entity2 also said he believes @entity5 will be willing to work with @entity44 " if the president is willing to work with us
" and @entity2 said @entity5 need to pass legislation to repeal @entity48 , though he conceded that @entity44 would " almost surely " veto full repeal
