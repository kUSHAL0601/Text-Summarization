-- @entity2 officials discounted an e-mailed threat to the upcoming @entity4 in the @entity6 city of @entity7 on wednesday , but the reported warning raised new concerns about security at the events
@entity2 organizing committees in the @entity13 and several @entity15 countries got an e-mailed warning of a terrorist attack against visitors to @entity7 , where president @entity20 's government has mounted a massive security effort to protect the events
" the @entity24 takes security very seriously and passes on any credible information to the relevant security services , " @entity24 spokeswoman @entity23 told @entity0
but the e-mail received by the national organizations " contains no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public , " she said
at least two countries , @entity35 and @entity36 , reported receiving e-mails in @entity38 that warned about threats to their citizens and @entity2 athletes
the @entity2 committees for @entity43 and @entity44 also confirmed that they had received the e-mail
others said the warnings had been forwarded to them from other countries or the @entity24
the e-mail received in @entity36 suggested that " there might be a terrorist attack against nationals of @entity36 and the @entity36 team , and that members of the team may be blown up , " @entity49 , director for international relations for @entity36 's @entity51 , told @entity0
@entity49 said the @entity59 had shared the letter with the organizers of the @entity62 as well as the @entity24
@entity36 's counterterrorism agency was analyzing the e-mail , but @entity36 does not intend to change its plans to attend the @entity66 in @entity7 , @entity49 said
the @entity68 also received the message and sent it " to the appropriate authorities , " committee chief @entity67 said
" the safety and security of @entity74 is our top priority , " he said in a written statement
" as is always the case , we are working with the @entity13 @entity78 , the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other @entity13 traveling to @entity7 are safe
" @entity83 : huge security buildup the warnings come as @entity6 authorities are clamping down on suspected @entity88 militants in the region surrounding @entity7 , a resort city on the @entity91 coast
@entity6 has been battling a low - level @entity93 insurgency in the @entity95 region for more than a decade , and militants have vowed to strike at the @entity4
among those hunted by @entity6 security forces are three women suspected of being " black widows " -- a group of women who have carried out high - profile suicide bombings after government forces killed their insurgent husbands
police have handed out fliers with the women 's names and pictures to hotels in @entity112 , a southwestern @entity6 town through which the @entity114 relay was due to pass wednesday , and in the @entity7 area
in an interview set to air wednesday on @entity0 's " @entity120 " program , @entity6 prime minister @entity83 said " there are always some threats " to public events , " not only this country , but also in others
" but @entity6 authorities are aware of those threats and are planning accordingly , he said
" i am referring to the mobilization , buildup , of police forces , and a huge number of policemen will watch the progress of the @entity66 , " @entity83 said
over the weekend , as @entity20 told reporters that his government has a " perfect understanding " of the threat and how to stop it , a video posted online warned that insurgents had " a present " for @entity2 visitors
' well - fortified ' @entity13 rep. @entity142 , chairman of the @entity143 , told @entity0 's " @entity145 " show from @entity146 that there were no guarantees when it comes to safety , but the security operation in @entity7 " is the most impressive and well - fortified that we 've ever seen in @entity2 history
" @entity142 , who has been in @entity7 to assess the security situation , said cooperation between @entity13 and @entity6 security teams was good , but there was room for greater intelligence sharing
the @entity6 " have been not quite as candid with us , " he said
" i think we could help them a great deal if they would open up information sharing more to us
" @entity166 agents are now going to @entity7 to work with their @entity6 counterparts on counterterrorism efforts , @entity142 said
amid the concerns , the top @entity13 military officer discussed sharing high - tech equipment to counter improvised bombs with his @entity6 counterpart tuesday , a @entity170 spokesman told @entity0
the matter came up " on an exploratory level " in a meeting between gen. @entity179 , the chairman of the @entity181 , and @entity6 gen. @entity182 , said col. @entity183 , a @entity179 spokesman
@entity142 said president @entity184 had also spoken with @entity20 about the issue
a tight security cordon is in place around @entity7 , the @entity189 congressman said , but it 's hard to be sure that no hidden threat exists
" the problem is , how many of these ' black widows ' ... came into this area before the ring of steel came up ? " he said
" we also know that one of these black widows actually was able to penetrate the ring in the @entity7 area
" @entity6 has deployed huge numbers of security officials , @entity142 said , " but it only takes one suicide bomber to get in to cause a real problem
" ' @entity205 ' @entity142 said it was likely that insurgents would carry out more bombings on softer targets outside @entity7 , like those that hit a train station and trolley bus in the southern city of @entity214 at the end of last year
" they know the eyes of the world are on these @entity4 , and what better way to make a statement , " he said
besides @entity13 security officers deployed through the diplomatic security service , @entity2 teams themselves are also hiring private security teams , he said
" my concern is the 10,000 to 15,000 americans who will be at these games and our @entity2 team itself being protected from these potential suicide bombers , " he said
" it 's very eerie when you go into @entity7 to see the mountains and to think about these black widows , as they call them , who 've had their spouses killed by the @entity237 ( intelligence agency ) , now retaliating through suicide bombing
" however , the @entity239 itself is " very well fortified , " @entity142 said , and there 's an impressive show of force on the ground
" we are all very hopeful these will be safe and protected games , " he said
the radical extremists in the region are historically more interested in targeting @entity6 than the @entity13 , he added
@entity250 : ' tremendous security ' former @entity252 mayor @entity250 , who 's involved in the planning for the @entity254 in @entity255 , told " @entity145 " that it was " too late " to reconsider the decision to hold the @entity4 in @entity7
" when you look back on it , it 's awfully close to one of the worst situations in the world in terms of terrorism , exportation of terrorism , " he said
but , at the same time , " it happens to be in a country that has tremendous security
" @entity250 said he was familiar with the @entity4 held in @entity271 , @entity272 , only months after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks
those games were almost canceled , he said , and had " an enormous amount of security
" as for @entity7 , @entity6 has " devoted more resources to security than frankly i 've ever seen , " @entity250 said
" in retrospect , could you have picked a place that 's safer ? i guess you could ... ( but ) the minute you hold the @entity4 in a place , whether it 's @entity271 or it 's @entity255 or it 's @entity283 , you have actually brought all the world 's problems to you , " he said
" so yes , @entity7 is dangerous because it 's close to the @entity95
however , the minute you have an @entity4 , every one of these causes gets attracted to you and you got ta have enormous security
" @entity0 's @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 contributed to this report .
