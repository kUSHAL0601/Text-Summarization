the 23 - year - old is now in a @entity17 jail ; he has pleaded not guilty to murder charges
the information in a document filed in @entity8 -- as detailed by @entity29 , @entity8 , police spokeswoman @entity30 -- may help authorities as they build their case against @entity0 as the triggerman
nearly 1,500 miles from the crime scene , @entity29 is where @entity36 turned himself into authorities on june 28 after seeing news reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for him
he was charged the next day with being an accessory after the fact of murder

the document was part of a search warrant executed at a @entity59 home
this detail comes out the same day that , following a judge 's orders , @entity17 authorities released a number of documents pertaining to the 27 - year - old @entity2 's death
among other details , these documents explain authorities ' account of an interaction with @entity0 at his southeast @entity17 home after @entity2 's death but before the football player 's arrest
@entity0 at one point told police that he did n't remember specifically when he last saw @entity2
later in the conversation , he " became argumentative " with two police officers questioning him , then went in his home and got a business card for his lawyer to give to them
" we informed mr. @entity0 that this was a death investigation , " the document states
" mr. @entity0 slammed the door and relocked it behind him
" mr. @entity0 did not ask the officers whose death was being investigated
mr. @entity0 's demeanor did not indicate any concern for the death of any person
" by contrast , when police first told @entity0 's fiancee about the death of @entity2 , who her sister was dating , " she immediately began to cry
" judge orders @entity0 case evidence documents to be released according to the same court document , the same woman told authorities that she and @entity0 went out to dinner for @entity104 , then she went to bed while her fiance was out all night
police say that , at one point , @entity0 called the woman and told her " his sports agent said she should not speak with us and that she should request to speak with her attorney , " a document states
documents also reveal details , some of them previously disclosed , of @entity2 's texts on the day he was killed
one of them , sent at 12:22 a.m. on june 17 to @entity0 's cell phone , reads : " we still on
" about three hours later , a man who works at @entity123 -- a medical device manufacturer with a facility in @entity16 , near where @entity2 's body was found -- told police he was taking a break in his car when he heard " three gunshots and ( a ) car door slamming
" a different affidavit for a search warrant features three black - and - white photos from a home surveillance camera that show @entity0 and two other men
the three men leave the garage of the @entity16 home around 1 a.m. , the document states
the video shows them returning to the same residence around 3:26 a.m. , including @entity0 going to - and - from the basement on " several different occasions
