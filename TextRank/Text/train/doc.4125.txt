@entity1 , @entity0 -- -- @entity4 president @entity3 lashed out at @entity5 and warned the @entity6 against pushing for new sanctions on his country a news conference on the sidelines of an @entity12 security summit here tuesday
a key item on the agenda at the summit is last week 's @entity5 raid on an aid flotilla in the @entity19
@entity3 said the confrontation revealed @entity5 's " devilish " nature
" it showed violence and hatred and war - mongering attitudes , " he said at the news conference
" the devilish sound of the uncultured @entity28 was coming out from their deceit
... they were holding up the flag of the devil itself
" the raid led to the deaths of nine people , all @entity0 citizens -- including one @entity37
@entity0 is urging @entity5 to accept an international probe into the incident
@entity3 congratulated @entity0 , which has been in a war of words with @entity5 following the raid , for its response
@entity5 's envoy to @entity0 later walked out on an @entity3 speech at the conference
ambassador @entity47 walked out in protest when @entity3 started criticizing the " zionist regime , " said @entity50 , a spokesman for the @entity5 embassy in @entity52
both @entity5 and @entity4 are members of @entity54 ( @entity54 )
@entity3 and @entity55 did appear together in a group photo of delegates to the conference , along with dozens of other attendees
" beleaguered " was how one @entity61 diplomat described @entity55 's disposition during tuesday 's meeting
host country @entity0 , once @entity5 's close @entity65 ally , has called on member countries to condemn @entity5 's raid on the aid convoy
the incident has pushed @entity0 to side with @entity5 's enemies @entity4 and @entity71 , in harshly condemning the jewish state
@entity74 , which is also a member of @entity54 , condemned the attack as well , prime minister @entity73 said in remarks carried on @entity74 state tv
" generally speaking , such actions against civilian vessels are unacceptable , " @entity73 said
" the fact that they were conducted in neutral waters raises many questions , and the incident must be thoroughly investigated
we are sorry for the victims of the incident , and we hope nothing of this kind will happen again
" @entity4 's nuclear program has been another major topic at the summit
the @entity6 expects to bring a new resolution on increased sanctions against @entity4 over its nuclear program to a vote in the @entity99 @entity98 this week
a draft resolution saying @entity4 had failed to meet international requirements and @entity99 resolutions was circulating at the world body on tuesday
@entity2 obtained a copy from a @entity61 diplomat
the resolution -- which could still be changed before it comes to a vote -- is set to call for tighter restrictions on people , companies and organizations , including the @entity112
the targets of the sanctions are still being worked out , the diplomat said
by calling for a resolution instead of sitting down for talks with @entity4 , the @entity6 is " gravely mistaken , " @entity3 said
" within the framework of respect and justice , we 're ready to negotiate with everyone
anyone who is going to resort to the language of force and aggression , the response is clear , " he said
@entity3 went on to commend @entity0 and @entity128 for recently negotiating a deal with @entity4 on a uranium enrichment swap
" the initiative marked the beginning of a new path -- the beginning of an end to unilateralism in the world , " he said
the @entity6 , he added , missed an opportunity by not embracing the deal
@entity73 said sanctions against @entity4 should not be " excessive , or put the @entity4 leadership , and above all the @entity4 people , in a false position that would put obstacles in the way of @entity4 's peaceful nuclear energy development
" asked whether the raid on the flotilla last week will change the way countries vote in the @entity98 , @entity3 said the raid will actually change many things
for @entity5 , he said , " it has actually rung the final countdown for its existence
it shows that it has no room in the region and no one is ready to live alongside it
actually , no country in the world recognizes it , and you know that the @entity164 regime is the backbone of the dictatorial world order
" in fact , many countries recognize @entity5
he added , " maybe at the @entity98 , it will impact temporarily
the @entity164 regime , with what it has done , it actually stopped its possibility to exist in the region anymore
" @entity2 's @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .
