@entity0 -- on a recent friday , i stepped into a place i had n't been in years
" oh , wow ! " @entity4 , my longtime hair stylist , said as i entered the salon
he 's been cutting my hair for a decade , but he had n't seen me in about 26 months
chuckling at his reaction , i thought back to the dozen times over the previous year that my good friend , @entity9 , had told me he was going in for a trim and i asked him to assure @entity4 i had n't fired him
i slipped into the black chair and watched in the mirror as @entity4 carefully separated my bouffant into about 15 ponytails an inch or two above my scalp
the mildly uncomfortable hair - pulling process was the requisite for @entity19 , a charity that manufactures wigs for youngsters with illnesses
have you donated your hair to charity ? tell us your story before i get into how @entity4 lopped off 13 inches of my hair , let me explain how i came to acquire the mop atop my head
my mum passed last may
a few months before she bravely marched on , i was visiting her at her @entity32 , @entity33 , home , where she was essentially bedridden
she noted my hair was getting long
" i 've never seen your curls like this , " she said , reaching up and taking one of the corkscrews in her fingers
why have you never grown it out before ? " the answer was simple : pops would have skewered me
a hippie or woman my father had died a few years earlier , but he had instilled in me since my teen years that certain things do n't belong on boys , long hair among them
another no - no was earrings
i vividly recall being shamed into removing the one i acquired in high school over spring break in @entity56 , @entity57
it rested in my lobe for only a week , but pop 's constant harassment those seven days -- primarily manifested in accusations that i had turned into a hippie or a woman -- eventually convinced me to extract the cubic zirconia stud
there are only so many times you can hear your father joke , " i 'm heading to the store
you need anything ? skirts ? tampons ? " when mum passed , it had been a while since my last haircut
it was already getting long for my taste
why i went another year without cutting it , i am not sure
maybe it was cathartic , or perhaps it was because mum said she liked it
maybe i was just getting back at dad for making me take out the earring when all the cool kids had one
i just let it grow , and gravity eventually pulled the corkscrews past my shoulders
problems ensued , issues i had never faced before
my hair would get caught in things like the recliner and my laptop
if i rested sunglasses on my dome , the curls stubbornly entangled the nosepiece
when eating on patios , the wind would blow the locks into my mouth alongside a forkful of food , an awkward ( and kinda gross ) sensation to say the least
on vacation in @entity111 several weeks back , it became too much
the humidity left me drenched
i could n't cool off
my hair kept falling into my eyes
i emerged from a swim in the ocean looking like @entity116
i tried putting it in a ponytail , something for which i had previously never found cause in life
it provided relief from the heat , but if you put me in a pastel leisure suit i could 've doubled for a drug lord on " @entity128
" not really the look i was going for
the hair had to go
i mentioned this to friends , who had mixed responses
some had grown accustomed to the shaggy locks ; others had been praying i 'd get a trim
one suggested i donate my hair
my first reaction : " who the hell would want my hair ? " shorn for a cause a little research yielded many takers : charities that collect the hair to make wigs for the terminally ill , namely cancer patients whose radiation or chemotherapy treatments had caused their hair to fall out
sufferers of alopecia and trichotillomania also receive the wigs
some of the groups crafting hairpieces include @entity157 , @entity158 for kids , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164
i wo n't purport to have done my journalistic due diligence on which organization is " the best
" i 'm sure they all have merits , despite the lack of diversity in naming them
i chose wigs 4 kids because it focuses on children , had great reviews , spends 80 % of its budget on programs and its website features a charming before - and - after photo gallery of wig recipients
their smiles were so much wider in the pictures where they showed off their new hair than in the photos depicting them bald
the resplendent grins reminded me of a charity my pal helps organize here in @entity0 , the @entity191
the group takes musicians to children 's hospitals , not only to play music but also to let the kids join in -- singing , songwriting , strumming axes , banging on drums
the little rock stars are giddy when they get their chance on the mic
wigs and drums may not seem as important as efforts to , say , find cures to the diseases ailing these youngsters , but until cures are found , there is more to treatment than palliative care
self - esteem can go a long way in a youngster 's fight to survive , providing her / him with the necessary confidence to believe the battle is a winnable one
innocent as they often may be , kids can be cruel
we 're all familiar with the schoolyard clique or bully that picks on the kid who 's smaller or different in some way
as @entity231 notes , illness can further isolate a child
so while a wig may seem like a small gesture , being able to scamper across a baseball field or twinkle - toe across a dance studio -- without worrying about your hairpiece falling off or your baldness making you an outcast -- that can be an enormous deal
it 's a chance to earn acceptance , to show you 're a lot like everyone else , no matter what ails you
most importantly , it 's a chance to be a kid when a dastardly disease is doing its best to make you grow old faster than you 'd like
chop and a snip that 's what compelled me to finally call @entity4
i did n't have any @entity257 connection to my hair so it was a fairly emotionless ordeal , though we both had good laughs as he finished up the ponytailing process
a cup of gin and juice and some melanin , and i would 've made a decent @entity266
@entity4 felt it wise to document the look in digital imagery
i was sure the pictures would never see the light of day , but i 've found myself sharing them with friends who were all too willing to join me in laughing at myself
@entity4 finished by carefully scissoring off each ponytail and laying it on a table so it could be prepared for shipping
when he was done , he exclaimed with surprise , " did you know these were under here ? ! " thinking i had a rash or perhaps birds nesting in the ' fro , i nervously replied , " no ! what ? " " these chops , " he said , laughing
i confessed to knowing about the sideburns , though i had n't given them much thought as they 'd been obscured for months
i told him he could go ahead and cut them off
he declined , saying they " square up " my face
i still do n't know what that means , but i assumed from his tone it 's a good thing
in all , it took about 90 minutes to get me seriously streamlined
i got the double - take all last week from co-workers who were surprised to see me show up monday with a buzzcut and sideburns
some mocked me , asking if i 'd lost a bet or expressing relief i no longer looked like a @entity305
me , i 'm much cooler now , which is important considering the sweltering @entity0 summer is almost upon us
i 'm also pleased that my 26 - month grooming experiment served some purpose other than catharsis , if that 's what it was
i 'll even go so far as to thank our weekend homepage editor for convincing me to write in the dreaded first person so we could educate people about donating ' dos to organizations aiming to normalize a few challenging lives
but this will probably ( read , most definitely ) be my last foray into writing about hair
if you 'll excuse me , i 'll go back to writing about hard news , sports and hip - hop now .
