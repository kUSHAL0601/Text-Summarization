@entity0 -- a @entity3 court friday sentenced two @entity5 servicemen to prison for a rape committed last year while they were on duty at a @entity5 military base in @entity10
the @entity11 handed down a sentence of 10 years to navy seaman @entity13 and nine years to petty officer @entity14 for raping a @entity3 woman after attacking her in a parking lot
the rape occurred in october 2012
at the time , both men were visiting from @entity19 in @entity20
after their arrests , lt. gen. @entity21 , commander of @entity5 forces in @entity3 , put troops at @entity10 's @entity25 on a curfew and apologized to the victim
the curfew restricts military personnel to the base , a personal home or hotel between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. the incident has prompted a women 's group in @entity10 to call for more restrictions on what @entity5 military personnel can do when they are off - base
violent crimes , especially rapes , by @entity5 troops in @entity3 have divided the two countries for decades
the issue came to a peak in 1995 when a sailor and two @entity46 -- both @entity5 -- were convicted of raping a 12 - year - old girl
tens of thousands of @entity49 took to the streets at the time , demanding that the @entity5 leave the island south of @entity3 's main islands
in that case , the @entity5 military at first declined to turn over the suspects to @entity3 authorities
but in the most recent case , the suspects were in @entity3 custody almost immediately
the alleged attack took place two months after a @entity46 was arrested , accused of assaulting and molesting a woman in @entity63 , the capital of @entity10
relations between the @entity5 military and @entity49 have already been stressed over the @entity46 ' deployment of @entity69 tilt - rotor aircraft to a base on the island
some residents are concerned because the @entity69 has had a reputation for crashing
the @entity75 community has long been against the presence of the @entity5 military , which has announced that thousands of @entity46 will be moved to a base in @entity78
