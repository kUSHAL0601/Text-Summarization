@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 disappeared in @entity1 for more than two months before he allegedly tried to bring down a @entity5 jet with explosives concealed in his underwear
investigators want to know if , during that time , he heeded the call to prayer coming from the hills above @entity1 's capital , where an @entity14 university headed by a fiery cleric has helped the country earn its reputation as an incubator of extremism
the students who pray at @entity22 now , two weeks after that failed @entity24 attack , say the school has been made a scapegoat , and that what @entity3 is accused of having done is wrong
" it 's against @entity14 , " one says
" the thoughts in their heads go against @entity14 , " says another
@entity3 's alleged attempt to ignite explosives as the jet approached @entity34 , @entity35 , resulted in a fire on his lap -- and serious burns -- before passengers and flight crew subdued him and put out the flames
@entity43 's leader is @entity44 , a provocative cleric with a flaming red beard
the @entity46 considers him a terrorist , accused in 2004 of supplying weapons to @entity49
but in @entity1 , @entity50 is a free and influential man
@entity52 denied @entity2 's request for an interview but allowed the network to tape at the school he 's built from the ground up since the early 1990s
every year , thousands of @entity14 students from @entity1 , @entity60 and around the world are cocooned in @entity44 's compound , where they study their faith and are instilled with a strident defense of that faith
last year , @entity44 made a public plea to recruit millions of young men to fight jihad against @entity70
but the students say they do n't think @entity3 was ever at the school , and investigators do n't appear to have come to ask
@entity1 authorities , it seems , have taken a hands - off approach to the university
" to my knowledge , no security , no investigation teams came here , " political science professor @entity78 said
" nobody thought that @entity3 was here
" in @entity1 , @entity22 is highly respected and its leader admired , making it difficult for investigators to find out for sure if the christmas day bombing suspect was ever there .
