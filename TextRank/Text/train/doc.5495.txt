-- my dad told me real men do n't hit women
he believed that because men were physically stronger and mentally tougher , men had the obligation to shield women from harm
i did n't buy the mentally tougher part , but i did embrace the idea that men were born with a kind of wonderful genetic code that made it impossible for them to pummel any woman , least of all a woman they cherished
i believed this all the way through grade school and high school
i believed it until my college boyfriend , in a jealous rage , threw me against the wall and knocked me out
it only happened once , but i remember how it felt
i always thought i was a physically strong woman , but i could not defend myself against a man who outweighed me by 70 pounds
which brings me to star running back @entity26
when video emerged of the @entity29 player dragging his unconscious @entity31 Â© e from an elevator , i thought the whole world would be horrified
i thought the @entity34 would come down hard on @entity26
@entity26 indicted on assault charge i was wrong
@entity26 will sit out two games and pay a fine
it reportedly will cost the multimillionaire athlete $ 529,411.24
the @entity29 ' head coach , @entity40 , summed it up this way on @entity42 : " it 's not a big deal
it 's just part of the process
we said from the beginning that the circumstances would determine the consequences
there are consequences when you make a mistake like that
he 's a heck of a guy
he 's done everything right since
he 's going to have to pay a consequence
" ( in may , @entity26 pleaded not guilty to one count of third - degree aggravated assault and was accepted into a pretrial program for first offenders
) plus , come on ! the guy went to counseling and married his victim , for goodness sake
say what ? in a wonderfully headlined post , " the @entity76 is eight times worse than beating a woman unconscious , " the website sports.mic contrasted @entity26 's situation with that of @entity73 , a wide receiver for the @entity74 , who " is facing a 16 - game suspension ... for testing positive for marijuana ... " actually this strange kind of " justice " meted out by @entity34 commissioner @entity83 does n't bother me as much as what the @entity29 posted on their @entity87 feed
according to whoever tweets for the @entity29 , @entity92 herself " deeply regrets the role she played the night of the incident
" perhaps the new mrs. @entity92 really does feel that way , but the @entity29 ' " helpful " tweet is as tone deaf as @entity40 's @entity26 " made a mistake / he 's a heck of a guy " comment
@entity101 , director of legal services for the @entity103 to end @entity104 , says , " when it comes to ... professional sports , unfortunately we 're still in a male - dominant society
" a girlfriend or a wife , she says , " has to bend themselves down , bend herself lower , and make her partner and her love interest shine a little brighter
" even when her manly , wealthy , successful husband is clearly wrong
put more bluntly , take the blame , honey , you probably deserved it
i do n't say that lightly
after my boyfriend knocked me out , i expected my friends to rally around me
" he 's such a nice guy , " they told me in disbelief
" you must have made him really mad
you say some mean stuff
" @entity42 's @entity131 played the role of my callous former friends on his show , " @entity135
" he assured his audience that , personally , " as a man raised by women , " he knows full well there 's never an " excuse to put your hands on a woman , " except , that is , when you must
@entity131 blathered , " we also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation
" in other words , ladies , do n't provoke your man or he 'll deck you
@entity131 's colleague -- and my new hero -- @entity155 tweeted , " i 'm thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend ... i 'd hate to think what i 'd be asking for by doing so
" @entity131 tried to apologize , but the damage was done
perhaps the @entity34 will try to apologize too , but again , the damage is done
so , mr. @entity83 , a few facts for you to ponder for the future : according to @entity164 , one in four women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime
one - third of female homicide victims are killed by their current or former partner
according to the @entity173 , boys who witness domestic abuse are twice as likely to abuse their own partners and children when they become adults
it 's why i thank @entity179 every day i married a man whose father was as old - fashioned as mine
@entity182 taught his sons a slightly different version , though
@entity185 said , " a man who hits a woman never hits a man
" are you listening , mr. @entity83 ?
