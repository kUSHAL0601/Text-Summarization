-- a @entity2 fugitive is in police custody , nabbed 14 years after and more than 1,600 miles from where authorities say he gunned down a man in cold blood
@entity8 , 37 , was arrested thursday in @entity9 , according to a news release issued saturday by the @entity11
according to a website run by @entity15 's provincial government , in august 1997 @entity8 and an accomplice lured @entity16 to a sandpit in the @entity18 in the western part of the province between @entity21 and @entity22
there , @entity2 authorities allege that @entity8 used a .22 - caliber firearm and shot @entity16 several times in the head
the victim 's body was buried and was n't discovered until september 2001
the accomplice was eventually arrested , but the primary suspect -- @entity8 -- remained at large
he was spotted in @entity31 in 2009 , the @entity11 said in its statement , citing the @entity34 homicide squad
but he fled before he could be definitively identified and arrested
last april , @entity2 's @entity36 branch requested fresh assistance from their @entity39 counterparts , based in @entity40 , for help in tracking down @entity8
investigators determined a month later that he had eluded capture " by assembling a complex labyrinth of intentional disinformation , telephone numbers , addresses , financial accounts and postal boxes in @entity2 and the @entity39 , " according to the @entity11 statement
the @entity51 notes on its website that the 5 - foot - 9 , 155 - pound man assumed a host of aliases over the years , including @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60
besides first - degree murder , @entity8 is accused in @entity2 of fraud , arson , narcotics trafficking , conspiracy and weapons - related offenses
he is also wanted in @entity68 , @entity69 , on a felony fugitive warrant and on three counts of obtaining money under false pretenses
" the arrest of @entity8 shows that , no matter how far this fugitive ran , he could n't escape the coordinated , international effort to apprehend him , " said @entity74 , from the @entity11 's investigative division , in a statement .
