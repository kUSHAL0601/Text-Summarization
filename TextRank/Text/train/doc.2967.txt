pope @entity0 called for a cease - fire in the @entity2 before sunday 's angelus prayer and said his meeting in june with the presidents of @entity6 and the @entity7 was not a waste of time
" i exhort to all the interested parties and to all of those who have political responsibility at the local and international level to not give up the prayer , nor any effort to cease any hostility and reach the desired peace for the good of all , " the @entity0 said , according to a @entity11 translation
he spoke in @entity21 , from the window of his apartment above @entity24
in june , @entity7 president @entity25 and @entity6 president @entity26 committed themselves to the quest for peace during a visit to the @entity31
it was the first time the @entity0 had hosted a prayer gathering of two leaders engaged in conflict
" someone could think that such a meeting took place in vain
instead no , because prayer helps us in not letting evil win nor resigning ourselves to violence and hatred take over dialogue and reconciliation , " the pontiff said sunday
the angelus is a traditional prayer given sundays at noon following a short sermon from the @entity0
hostilities between @entity6 and @entity7 militants escalated this month after the killing of three @entity6 teenagers and a @entity7 teen
neither @entity56 nor @entity6 appears to be backing down
since monday , scores of people in @entity60 have been killed , the @entity57 has said
though some @entity6 have been wounded , none has been killed by the rockets fired by @entity56 and other militant groups in @entity60
@entity6 drops leaflets warning @entity60 residents to evacuate ahead of airstrikes fearing daughter 's @entity60 border wedding
