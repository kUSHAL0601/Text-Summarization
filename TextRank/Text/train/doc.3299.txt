-- the @entity1 finalized new federal standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants wednesday , a move being praised by environmentalists but criticized by others , who predict lost jobs and a strain on the nation 's power grid
@entity1 administrator @entity16 , at an event at the @entity14 in @entity15 , announced that for the first time @entity20 coal and oil - fired power plant operators must limit their emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants
" i am glad to be here to mark the finalization of a clean air rule that has been 20 years in the making , and is now ready to start improving our health , protecting our children , and cleaning up our air , " @entity24 said
" under the @entity34 these standards will require @entity20 power plants to put in place proven and widely available pollution control technologies to cut harmful emissions of mercury , arsenic , chromium , nickel and acid gases
in and of itself , this is a great victory for public health , especially for the health of our children
" @entity1 rules in place since the 1990s target acid rain and smog - forming chemicals emitting from power plants , but not mercury , a neurotoxin known to damage developing fetuses and children
@entity58 panel examining how chemicals in daily life affect kids ' health despite federal limits on emissions of mercury from other sources , such as waste incinerators , there have been no limits on coal - fired power plants , which the @entity1 says constitute the single largest source of mercury emissions
" these standards rank among the three or four most significant environmental achievements in the @entity1 's history , " said @entity73 , clean air director of the @entity74
" this rule making represents a generational achievement
" the new regulations are among the most wide - reaching to come from the @entity1 during @entity82 's administration
they include separate limits for mercury emissions , acid gasses , and other pollutants from several metals
opinion : we must stop allowing mercury pollution specifically , the @entity1 will impose numerical emission limits for all existing and future coal plants and propose a range of " widely available , technical and economically reasonable practices , technologies , and compliance strategies , " to meet the new demands
according to an @entity1 analysis , the larger economic benefits of the reduced pollution will more than pay for the short - term clean - up costs
the @entity1 also predicts more jobs will be created than lost as power plants invest million of dollars in upgrades
it also estimates the new regulations , by reducing people 's exposure to these toxins , will prevent 11,000 premature deaths each year and trim health costs
" @entity1 estimates that for every dollar spent to reduce pollution from power plants , the @entity20 public will see up to $ 9 in health benefits
the total health and economic benefits of this standard are estimated to be as much as $ 90 billion annually , " the agency said in a news release
but the @entity1 also acknowledges the regulations will result in increased power grid strain : by its estimate , 14.7 gigawatts of power supply will be eliminated from the @entity20 power grid when the rules take effect by 2015
that figure -- enough to power well over 10 million @entity20 households -- is overly optimistic , according to other industry analyses
several industry groups and some republicans also disagree about the economic impact the new regulations will have
@entity140 and @entity141 , chairmen of the @entity137 and subcommittee on regulatory affairs , respectively , sent a letter to the @entity143 earlier this week claiming the " @entity1 has failed to perform a proper analysis of the rule 's impact on job creation " and " consider the rule 's impact on grid reliability
" the new rules have also made their way to the @entity133 presidential campaign trail , with @entity154 recently predicting increased brownouts during the summer and @entity156 declaring the @entity1 is a " job - killing " agency
and the @entity20 @entity158 , a group traditionally sympathetic to @entity133 , has aired ads urging listeners not to " let the @entity1 turn out the lights on the @entity20 economy
" but the @entity82 administration has found an ally in @entity166 mayor @entity165 , who argued in a recent op - ed for the @entity168 that the new standards are gravely needed
" we can stop this , " @entity165 wrote of mercury poisoning
" we can spare children this tragic injustice and the pain it brings their families
we can spare adults from losing years off their lives
and we can spare taxpayers the enormous health care costs that come with mercury - related - illnesses
" environmentalists , who earlier his fall were outraged with @entity82 over his refusal to push for ozone emission standards the @entity1 supported , are also strongly on board
" this bold new announcement means less contaminated fish -- and more protections for kids who are at risk of developing learning disabilities and other problems that have been linked to mercury poisoning , " the @entity191 said in an e-mail to @entity0
" this is a big public health victory , 20 years in the making
it 's one of the most important anti-pollution measures in recent memory
" @entity204 , director of the @entity205 , said , " as a mom , i 'm especially excited to know that millions of mothers and babies will now be protected from mercury poisoning
we all teach our kids the simple rule that if you make a mess you should clean it up -- and now polluters will have to follow that same rule
" the new rule requires that the vast majority of mercury contained in coal be captured and prevented from releasing into the air when burned for energy , and would require operators to shut down or upgrade the least efficient power plants
power plant operators have three years to comply with the new standards , but plant operators may be granted additional time to install the necessary emissions improvement technologies if they are able to demonstrated a valid need
once airborne , mercury enters bodies of water through precipitation , becomes methylmercury , and accumulates in the food chain
the @entity1 and the @entity237 jointly recommend that pregnant women and young children limit their consumption of fish and shellfish to two meals a week because of the methylmercury contamination
@entity0 's @entity245 contributed to this report .
