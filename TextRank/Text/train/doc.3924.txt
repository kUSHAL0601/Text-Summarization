students aboard the stricken @entity3 ferry had to use rising water levels to float out of their cabins after the ship listed , survivors told a @entity8 court monday
at least 294 people died -- including hundreds of high school students on a field trip -- when the @entity3 capsized off @entity8 's southwestern coast april 16
the ship had been carrying 476 passengers and crew , and divers are still searching for 10 people
the ferry 's captain , @entity17 , is on trial , accused of murder , along with three of his crew
twelve other members of the crew have been indicted on charges of abandonment and violating a ship safety act
it has been alleged that the crew did not use available resources , such as life rafts , life vests and announcements , to evacuate passengers
instead , passengers were told to stay where they were , according to officials
six student survivors testified monday at a court in their hometown of @entity40
their identities can not be published
the second student to testify said she heard an announcement asking those on board to put on life jackets and remain on the ferry
the student told the court that she did not hear any announcement from the ship or coast guards telling passengers to leave the ship
she said the ferry listed to the extent that the windows were on the ground and the door was on the ceiling in her cabin
as water came in , their class leader suggested that because they were in life jackets they could float to the door
they eventually were able to escape , walking on the hallway
the fifth student said that she considered trying to escape once the ferry began listing , but did not because she heard the announcement asking passengers to stay put
she said the lights then went out and she saw that the window was completely covered in water
she escaped when the water rose and she was able to float to the door
students already in the hallway dragged her outside
another student described the scene in the hallway as she lined up to exit
she said a strong current was in the water and about half the students with her were swept away
the student said she could see coast guards near the emergency exit , but she never saw them enter the ship
after the students ' testimony , the court heard from another survivor , who was in a wheelchair and wearing a hospital gown
he described how he had managed to get himself near the information desk when the ferry had started to tilt
the man said the students had been panicking and a female crew member announced that " everyone should stay put , the ferry is in danger , and that the rescue will be there soon
" he said he thought she was trying to calm the students
the man said that he had asked the crew member to contact the captain , but that the captain had not responded when she tried to reach him on a walkie - talkie the female crew member announced again that everyone should stay put and that help would arrive soon , he said , and later told students to put on their life jackets the man broke down crying as he described watching people slide as the boat tilted about 40 or 50 degrees
tense trial opening in june the students arrived at the @entity40 courthouse under a heavy police presence monday , with lines of officers surrounding the building
at the trial 's opening june 10 in @entity139 , victims ' relatives yelled and screamed at those on trial upon seeing them for the first time
investigators have said a vast amount of cargo -- more than double the ferry 's limit -- and the failure to tie it down properly were partly responsible for the @entity3 's capsizing
at the trial 's opening , the prosecution accused the ferry 's owner , @entity157 , of putting profit above all else by overloading the @entity3
it said the cargo was badly secured , meaning the crew was also culpable
prosecutors said the crew members could have carried out a far more effective rescue operation
in june , @entity17 's attorney told the court that the captain had been helming the ship for only six days , he was the last rescued of all the crew members and he was n't in charge of loading cargo
if convicted of murder , @entity17 and his fellow accused could face the death penalty , although it has been nearly two decades since capital punishment was carried out in @entity8
