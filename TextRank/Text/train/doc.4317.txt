opening statements begin tuesday in the trial of @entity4 's parents in a case growing increasingly controversial after reports that a @entity8 judge had the media removed from his courtroom
exactly what happened is unclear , as @entity12 reported that its reporter , a citizen journalist and two television reporters were escorted out of the courtroom by a @entity18 deputy who said she was following state court judge @entity20 's order and offered no further explanation
however , the @entity23 ' attorney , @entity22 , said that only @entity0 affiliate @entity24 had its reporter booted from the courtroom
@entity24 had no reporting to that effect on its website , nor did @entity0 affiliate @entity29
a clerk in @entity20 's office referred questions to @entity34 clerk @entity33 , who had not returned messages as of late tuesday afternoon
@entity20 , a judge from @entity36 , is presiding over the case after @entity39 judges recused themselves from all proceedings involving the @entity23 in order to maintain fairness
@entity4 's mother and father , along with five other relatives , are in court on misdemeanor charges related to a 2013 protest
jury selection wrapped up monday , and opening statements were scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. tuesday
one black juror and five whites compose the six - man jury , @entity24 reported
the alternate is also black , the station said
the " @entity56 7 , " as the defendants are known , each face a charge of interference with government property for allegedly blocking the entrance to the @entity63 in @entity64 and blocking access to the security checkpoint inside the building
the demonstration was planned after @entity4 's parents became frustrated with the lack of information they had received from local investigators regarding their son , who was found dead inside a rolled gym mat at his @entity77 high school in january 2013 , @entity22 said
footage published on @entity79 shows authorities arresting family members who held hands , blocking a door to the courthouse
another video posted to a @entity4 tribute page on @entity87 shows family members later , inside the courthouse , joining hands in front of the checkpoint
the family and others can be heard chanting , " no justice , no peace , " as officers step in to arrest them
the relatives were arrested and released on bond in the april 25 , 2013 , incident , @entity22 said
" it was n't until seven days after that protest that the @entity102 released the investigative file of the teen 's death , " @entity22 said
all seven have pleaded not guilty
upon her release from jail , the same evening she was arrested , @entity107 told @entity24 , " i 'm going to be right back out at the courthouse in the morning , ready to do it all over again , until we get justice
" each of the seven family members could face up to a year in prison , a $ 1,000 fine , or both
there are no plans to entertain any potential plea deals , @entity22 said
in may 2013 , the @entity18 announced it was closing its investigation into @entity4 's death after determining @entity4 , 17 , slipped into the mat while reaching for a shoe and got stuck
an autopsy completed by the @entity126 concluded @entity4 died of accidental positional asphyxia
months later , a pathologist hired by the @entity23 conducted a second autopsy , found evidence of " unexplained , apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma " to the 17 - year - old 's neck and concluded the death was a homicide
in october 2013 , the @entity136 attorney for the @entity137 , @entity138 , launched a federal investigation , which is ongoing
@entity4 's parents , who have been steadfast in their claim that their son 's death was no accident , filed a wide - ranging $ 100 million lawsuit this month , alleging former classmates beat their son to death inside the high school gym
the suit names 37 people , mostly members of local law enforcement , plus the city of @entity64 as defendants
" we know who killed him
we just have to prove it , " @entity107 said
@entity0 's @entity159 contributed to this report .
