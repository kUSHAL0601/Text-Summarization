-- @entity2 's @entity1 showed just why she 's the @entity3 champion by claiming victory at the women 's super-combined event at the @entity8 in @entity9 friday
the 28 - year - old , who started in fourth position after the opening downhill run , made up the 0.20 second deficit before clocking a fastest time of two minutes 39.92 seconds
@entity1 edged out @entity15 's @entity14 with home favorite @entity16 pulling off the fastest slalom run to claim bronze , despite finishing a second off the leader
@entity21 faces races against time " i arrived here hoping for a medal , no matter what color , " @entity1 told reporters
" i 've been lacking confidence this winter
i was n't favorite coming here and i did n't really feel comfortable in today 's slalom
" knowing @entity14 's form , i said to myself , ' okay , second place is already a very good result '
now i am extremely happy
" the home support at @entity34 had hoped defending world champion @entity35 would shine on the big stage , but the 23 - year - old failed to make one gate high up the course
" i wanted to take risks but it can happen that you straddle a gate , " @entity35 told reporters
" it can also happen if i do n't take any risks
straddling is just a timing problem , it 's hard to navigate , and even more so if you do n't train slalom often
" ski champ @entity21 injures knee @entity15 's @entity14 , who clinched her second medal and 20th podium of the season following her gold in the @entity58 , was left frustrated with her performance
" i held back and showed too much respect , " she told reporters
" my downhill was pretty good though
second place and a silver medal is still a super result
