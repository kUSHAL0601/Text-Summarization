-- @entity1 has finally broken its silence on the mysterious structure atop a barge floating in the @entity5
" @entity6 ... a floating data center ? a wild party boat ? a barge housing the last remaining dinosaur ? sadly , none of the above , " the company said in a statement e-mailed wednesday to @entity0 and other news outlets
" although it 's still early days and things may change , we 're exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology , " the statement continued
the barge , docked at a pier on @entity24 , houses a four - story structure made from shipping containers
speculation about its purpose has been swirling since discovery of the vessel -- and of three similar barges across the country -- first made headlines early last week
@entity1 's brief statement is consistent with a report last week by @entity0 affiliate @entity36 in @entity5 , which said the mystery barge would house a floating showroom for the company 's @entity40 connected eyewear and other products
@entity36 reported the barge structure will become one of a small fleet of luxury event spaces , complete with party decks , designed to be disassembled and transported via barge or train to other locations
the barges are an effort by @entity1 to upstage rival @entity53 's stylized retail stores , a source told @entity36
until now , @entity1 had declined to comment on the reports , contributing to an aura of secrecy that has cloaked the entire saga
the mystery barge has inspired jokes and at least one @entity63 parody account , @ @entity64 , which has more than 5,500 followers
a tweet from the account tuesday said
" no one raised an eyebrow when @entity70 built my ancestor back in 1973
it was another media frenzy out here today
sheesh ! " @entity40 , worn like regular glasses , has a small high - res display above the user 's right eye and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access e-mail , text messaging and other features .
