-- the @entity1 and @entity2 declared the @entity4 cleanup over in three states monday but will keep watching dozens of miles of @entity7 shoreline where oil still washes ashore
more than three years after the worst oil spill in @entity11 history erupted in the @entity12 , the coastlines of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have been returned to " as close to pre-spill conditions as possible , " said @entity18
@entity19 , a @entity19 spokeswoman
in @entity7 , however , 84 miles of coastline -- mostly barrier islands like @entity22 and @entity23 , about 90 miles south of @entity24 -- is still subject to cleanup , @entity19 said
those areas are still seeing tar balls and occasional mats of weather oil wash up on the beach regularly , particularly since @entity31 stirred up fresh oil from the seabed in late 2012
@entity19 said the decision was made when only small amounts of oil were being found by cleanup crews
those crews had " a very large footprint going on some very sensitive areas , " she said
" it begs the question of how much harm are we doing to the environment by walking in or driving @entity46 just for a small amount of oil , " she said
now , she said , the @entity1 will check out any reports of oil on the beaches , and @entity2 will continue to be required to clean up any oil that traces back to the @entity4 spill
but environmental groups quickly expressed concern that monday 's decision was premature
" we do n't want the nation to think this disaster is over when oil washes ashore somewhere along @entity15 's 53 miles of beach every day , " @entity57 , executive director of @entity58 , told @entity0
@entity57 said residents and tourists will now have to become " oil spotters " on the beaches
and the @entity68 said as many as 1 million barrels of oil from the disaster remained unaccounted for
" regardless of how our shorelines are monitored , @entity2 must be held accountable for the cleanup , " @entity72 , the head of the group 's @entity74 , said in a statement on the decision
" we can not just accept oiled material on our beaches and in our marshes as the ' new normal
' " the drill rig @entity4 exploded and sank in april 2010 , killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher from a @entity2 - owned well called @entity88 a mile underwater
it took three months to cap the well , and federal officials estimate nearly 5 million barrels of oil -- more than 200 million gallons -- poured into the @entity12 in that time
most of the oil is believed to have been eaten by hydrocarbon - munching microbes in the @entity12
but an undetermined portion settled to the floor of the @entity12 , and tar balls and tar mats are still turning up across the region
crews dug up a 450 - pound tar mat left behind by the spill in @entity105 , @entity16 , in early april , @entity19 said
@entity19 said the decision announced monday " is a transition , not an end
" " we 're going to maintain the proper staffing in order to address those episodic re-oiling instances , and it will be cleaned up , " she said
meanwhile , @entity2 spokesman @entity113 said the company is making " significant progress " in the remaining cleanup work in @entity7
@entity113 said the company still has about 85 workers from a contractor committed to the cleanup work there
in january , he said , crews drilled 14,000 holes in search of buried oil
only 3 % of those holes found enough oil to require cleanup , and that process is " nearly complete , " he said
work is also going on in the marshes of @entity131 , home to some of the worst - hit spots
" at @entity136 , we finally received permission to treat areas that had been set aside for treatment studies just a few months ago and are now progressing them through the final inspection process , " @entity113 told @entity0
and he said that the company will clean up any new oil that traces back to the blowout
" if people do receive these reports , the @entity1 will come and investigate , and if it 's found to be from @entity88 , @entity2 will respond , " he said
the disaster has cost @entity2 an estimated $ 32 billion to date , including $ 14 billion in cleanup costs
it 's also paid out nearly $ 8 billion in compensation to @entity151 residents , pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges and paid a $ 4 billion fine for the deaths on the rig
@entity0 's @entity156 and @entity157 contributed to this report .
