-- a @entity2 court that sentenced a journalist to 60 lashes for her work on a controversial television show has summoned a second woman affiliated with the tv station
the @entity2 information ministry said sunday that a @entity11 court has asked the second journalist to appear because of her work as a coordinator with the @entity15 the woman was set to appear on monday , but the hearing has been postponed because she is ill , said a ministry official , who could not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media
the show in question , " a thick @entity20 , " explores social taboos
in one episode , a @entity2 man , @entity23 , bragged about his sex life
@entity2 authorities put him on trial and sentenced him to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes
soon afterward , the court sentenced journalist @entity31 who worked as a coordinator and guest - booker for the show
in addition to the 60 lashes , @entity35 is banned for two years from traveling outside @entity2
while the charges against her include involvement in preparing the program , she was not involved in setting up the episode in which @entity23 appeared , said his lawyer @entity43
@entity43 said that @entity35 has opted not to appeal the court 's verdict
@entity43 does n't represent the journalist , but said he is keeping tabs on cases dealing with " a thick @entity20
" the lawyer is attempting to pursue an appeal for his client and get his case heard in a special court that only deals with media matters
@entity0 has attempted to get comments from @entity56 and her attorney
@entity23 , 32 , an airline employee and divorced father of four , spoke openly on the show about his sexual escapades , his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14
that episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative @entity2 , where sharia , or @entity70 law , is practiced
pre-marital sex is illegal , and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle
@entity2 authorities shut down @entity15 offices in @entity11 and @entity76 after the interview aired a few months ago
