@entity0 , @entity1 -- three of five @entity5 contractors detained in @entity0 have been ordered released by an @entity1 judge , because of insufficient evidence , a court spokesman said thursday
in a @entity2 exclusive , video shows @entity5 contractors taken into custody by @entity1 authorities
the other two other contractors remain in custody , according to judge @entity15 , a spokesman for @entity1 's @entity16
one of the men has been released on bond , the @entity5 @entity17 in @entity0 confirmed thursday
the embassy did not identify the man , who was released wednesday
however , a spokesman for his employer , @entity23 , said it was @entity25
@entity26 , @entity25 's wife , also confirmed his release
the contracting company said the release of the others has been delayed because of a procedural issue
@entity26 said her son , @entity33 , and @entity34 were to be released thursday morning , but it may take more time to release the other two , @entity36 and @entity37
but @entity15 said , without naming names , that two contractors were being held on charges involving " illegal substances " found on the men when they were taken into custody
those who have been released are not allowed to leave the country because of an ongoing investigation and the judge may want to question them again , according to @entity15
except for @entity36 , the detained contractors work for the @entity50 , @entity51 - based @entity23 , a security firm headed by the elder @entity25
an @entity1 judge decided earlier on wednesday that charges against the five contractors were not warranted and that they could be released , according to an @entity1 security source and a source close to the five
the sources requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case , in which the contractors have been detained since last week for reasons that remain unclear
the contractors initially had been told they were being held in connection with the may death of another contractor , @entity67 , said the source close to the five
but on monday , according to a judicial source , the men were told they were being held on suspicion of having unregistered weapons
still , they were asked about their activities around the time @entity67 was killed , and @entity1 government officials told @entity2 monday the five were detained as suspects in connection with @entity67 's slaying
@entity67 was found bound , blindfolded and fatally stabbed in a car in @entity0 's @entity78 on may 22
the 60 - year - old @entity80 , @entity81 , resident owned a construction company that operated in @entity1
the @entity78 is the high - security area in central @entity0 that contains the @entity5 embassy and key @entity1 government buildings
access to the area , formally known as the @entity88 , is tightly controlled
the five contractors were taken into custody on june 3 in a pre-dawn @entity78 raid by @entity1 and @entity5 personnel , the security source told @entity2 on sunday
during the raid , troops also confiscated weapons , the @entity1 security source said
three of the contractors were suspected of being directly involved in @entity67 's death , the @entity1 source said
a @entity5 @entity17 spokesman said the search was an @entity1 operation , but @entity105 representatives were present at the request of @entity1 authorities
the five were transferred to a prison within the @entity78 on friday
" after this murder inside the @entity78 , a joint investigation committee from @entity5 and @entity1 sides has been formed to investigate this incident , " @entity111 spokesman @entity110 told @entity2 , " and this committee managed to collect a number of indications that those five are linked to this murder
" @entity1 government spokesman @entity121 also said the men were detained based on information linking them to the @entity67 slaying
under @entity1 law , after a person is detained , an investigative judge questions the accused and assesses the evidence
the judge then decides whether there is sufficient evidence , and either refers the case to trial or dismisses it
the @entity1 source said the five had been held in a separate holding area and not with other @entity1 detainees , but spent time in a courtyard with other @entity1 detainees
a @entity5 @entity17 spokesman said consular officials had visited with them and " they appeared well
" the source close to the suspects said sunday that each of the five men insisted they had alibis that will clear them and they were eager to tell their stories to a judge
the @entity151 had known @entity67 for six years from their time in the @entity78 and " respected him , " @entity23 spokeswoman @entity152 told @entity2
@entity2 's @entity154 in @entity155 and @entity156 in @entity0 contributed to this report .
