@entity0 -- two sons of ousted @entity4 president @entity3 stood trial monday in a @entity0 criminal court on charges of insider stock trading , with prosecutors alleging they acquired millions illegally by using insider information about a bank sale
@entity12 and @entity13 allegedly gained the money through the 2007 sale of the @entity16
they stood trial with seven others , including the deputy chief executives of the bank
prosecutors told the court the defendants conspired to acquire illegal funds and 80 % of the bank 's shares
@entity29 illegally made nearly 500 million @entity4 pounds , or about $ 82 million , from the bank sale , prosecutors said
his brother , @entity32 , used insider information about the bank to gain 12 million @entity4 pounds , or about $ 1.9 million , authorities allege
the two " purposely withheld vital information on the sale of the bank from other share traders to implement their crime and violated the principles of transparency and equality between traders , " according to a statement from prosecutors
they are further accused of selling their shares to strategic partners at @entity49
@entity50 and @entity51 , @entity49 joint chief executive officers , are among the other defendants in the case
following monday 's proceedings , the trial was adjourned until september 8
the court denied a request by the @entity60 ' attorneys that they be released on bail
the attorneys had pointed out that the other seven defendants were freed on bail , but not allowed to travel
the travel ban remains in place , the court ruled
all nine of the defendants , including the @entity60 , deny the charges
@entity29 told the judge there was " no basis whatsoever to these accusations
" " unfortunately , these are all lies , " @entity13 said
" none of this happened
" @entity12 and @entity13 have been imprisoned since spring 2011
they were acquitted of corruption charges in another case last month
@entity49 is one of the @entity83 's most prominent investment companies , with branches in nine @entity86 countries
@entity49 released a statement last may saying its two executives acted properly in the acquisition of the @entity16 bank
the @entity91 took a nearly 100 % stake in the bank in november 2007
" the two chief executive officers had no personal interest , gain or any dealings or trading in the shares of the @entity16 , " @entity93 said , adding that the company has taken the necessary legal actions to defend them
the bank 's deputy chief executives are also accused of gaining " concealed " percentages and conducting dealings without informing the stock market authority publicly , which is against the laws of the @entity4 @entity108 and the stock market
@entity12 and @entity13 offered last month to pay a 2 billion - pound ( $ 330 million ) fine in reconciliation , but prosecutors denied the request , according to @entity113 , a spokesman for the general prosecutor
the prosecutor " insisted they plead guilty first , and all the defendants must also join them in this reconciliation effort , " he told @entity1
" only one other defendant offered to pay
" @entity3 , who led @entity4 for more than 30 years , was ousted by the @entity122 protests last year and was found guilty of charges relating to the killings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators during the revolution
the 84 - year - old is reportedly in declining health and was moved to a military hospital last month .
