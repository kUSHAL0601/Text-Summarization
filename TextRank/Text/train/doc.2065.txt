@entity0 has pulled out of the @entity2 , citing persistent concerns surrounding a wrist injury that has ravaged much of his past year
the @entity6 has struggled with wrist injuries since 2010 and had not played for over ten months
yet it appeared that @entity0 's injury jinx was behind him after reaching the quarter final of the @entity11 last week
but the former world number four decided that the year 's first grand slam had come too soon
" it 's a pity that i can not take part in such an important tournament , yet this is another episode in the long way to recovery , " @entity0 wrote on his @entity15 account
" i will follow the advice of my doctors and try to return as soon as possible
" @entity0 has slipped to 276 in the world rankings since injuring his left wrist in february 2014 , but has indicated that he aims to play again in march , possibly in @entity26 or at @entity27
" i appreciate the support that i received since i announced i was playing in @entity29 , " he added
" this year 's @entity2 has been hit by a series of exciting , big -- hitting players either pulling out injured or struggling to reach peak fitness before the tournament begins monday
@entity36 champion @entity35 pulled out at the start of the year , as did @entity39 @entity38 whilst @entity40 has complained that he is still feeling the effects of an operation to remove his appendix
the biggest uncertainly , however , concerns the fitness of @entity47 's @entity46
the teenage sensation arrived at @entity49 an unknown but reached the quarter final after beating @entity40 , announcing himself as one of the game 's most exciting young talents
@entity46 has been desperate to get fit for his first ' home ' grand slam since following his breakthrough season and had taken the past four months off to try and heal a persistent back injury that had cast doubt on his participation
last week it looked like he too might pull out but the 19 - year - old confirmed he will be in @entity62 monday
" i 'm obviously feeling it
it 's not 100 per cent
but , you know , i 'm good enough to compete , " @entity46 told the @entity65 on the eve of the tournament
" i 'm noticing improvements every day ... yeah , i think i 'm ready to compete
