-- going into the eighth season finale of " @entity3 , " @entity1 looks like the favorite against competitor @entity5
but should @entity1 even be on the show , since he has performed professionally in the national @entity8 tour of " @entity9 " ? former ' @entity3 ' runner - up @entity10 says it 's getting harder for the average person to get on the show
@entity10 , runner - up in the third season of " @entity3 , " spoke with @entity17 's @entity16 on @entity18 about whether or not an amateur stands a chance on the show
the following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity : @entity16 : what were the stipulations as to your past history before you joined " @entity3 " ? how much could you do before they 'd say , " you are n't an amateur anymore
you 're more of a professional " ? @entity10 : each contract for each show has gotten a little stronger and a little stronger
prior to me doing " @entity3 , " i had done things like theater , but at that point nowhere near on a professional level
the cool thing is they keep it fair by having little things in the contract about how you ca n't release a record nationally with a record label -- things like that
but people who have been signed prior can , of course , be on the show
@entity16 : do you think the " rags - to - riches " story is lost and we are going to get more and more people who have more and more experience ? @entity56 : i think people now realize that " @entity3 " is such a launching spot for anyone 's career
people that maybe would have not done it a few years ago , saying , " oh , i 'm too professional , " maybe take a little bit of a second glance at the show because they realize it 's such a launching pad
but i do think it 's a little harder for the everyday @entity68 to get in it
@entity16 : do you think @entity1 has an unfair advantage since he was an understudy for the @entity8 tour of " @entity9 " ? @entity56 : not really , because it 's all about performing
so it 's just about what you are doing at that exact moment up there on the " @entity3 " stage
i think @entity5 and @entity1 are just two totally different performers , but i think they are pretty even when it comes down to the end of the day .
