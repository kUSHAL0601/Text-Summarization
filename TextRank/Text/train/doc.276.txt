as international leaders express outrage over mass killings in @entity4 -- and lament the inability to pass a @entity7 resolution denouncing the @entity4 regime -- questions linger about the two countries behind the impasse
on saturday , @entity11 and @entity12 vetoed a draft resolution that would have demanded @entity4 president @entity14 stop the killing and answer calls aimed at finding a @entity4 - led solution to the 11 - month crisis
analysts say both @entity11 and @entity12 have their reasons to maintain good relations with @entity4
@entity12 is one of @entity4 's biggest arms suppliers
and @entity11 ranked as @entity4 's third - largest importer in 2010 , according to data from the @entity26
" @entity28 's renewed interest in @entity29 â€” the traditional terminus node of the ancient @entity31 ... indicates that @entity11 sees @entity4 as an important trading hub , " according to a 2010 report from the @entity34 , a @entity36 - based research and analysis institute
even as reports mounted that the @entity4 government was killing protesters en masse , the @entity11 foreign ministry issued a statement in august noting the " steady development " of friendly relations " over the past 50 years and more
" " @entity11 and @entity4 gave each other understanding and support on issues concerning each other 's core and major interests , " the statement said
" @entity11 showed consistent understanding and firm support for @entity4 's position on the @entity55 while @entity4 remained committed to the one @entity11 position and rendered @entity11 staunch support on matters related to @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and human rights
" last week , @entity11 's permanent representative to the @entity64 said the killing of innocent civilians must stop , but also said he is against " pushing through " a regime change
an earlier version of the @entity7 draft resolution called for @entity14 to step down and delegate his powers to his deputy , but that element was not in the draft voted on by members saturday
" @entity11 is of the view that the @entity4 people 's request for reform and safeguard of their interests should be respected , " @entity75 said tuesday , according to @entity11 's state - run @entity77 news agency
" it is imperative to put an immediate end to all violence in @entity4 and oppose and stop the killing of innocent civilians
" at the same time , an inclusive political process with a wide participation of all @entity4 parties must be started without delay to speed up reform and resolve differences and disputes peacefully through dialogue and consultations , " he said
@entity12 also has an economic interest in @entity4
the total value of @entity4 contracts with the @entity12 defense industry likely exceeds $ 4 billion , according to @entity101 , an adjunct fellow with the @entity102 and @entity103
he noted the @entity104 estimated the value of @entity12 arms sales to @entity4 at $ 162 million per year in both 2009 and 2010
@entity107 also signed a $ 550 million deal with @entity4 for combat training jets
@entity12 also leases a naval facility at the @entity4 port of @entity112 , giving the @entity12 navy its only direct access to the @entity115 , @entity101 said
as @entity117 leaders sought to pry @entity14 from power , @entity107 sent an aircraft - carrying missile cruiser to @entity4 waters in a show of support last month and shipped @entity4 troops a consignment of @entity127 cruise missiles , according to @entity128 , a professor of political science at the @entity130 , @entity131
speaking after the saturday vote , ambassadors from both @entity12 and @entity11 said they do support an end to the violence but felt the resolution did not address the crisis properly
@entity12 ambassador @entity138 said the text " did not adequately reflect the real state of affairs and sent an unbalanced signal " to the various sides in @entity4
he noted that the minister for foreign affairs will visit @entity29 to hold a meeting with @entity14 this week
@entity11 ambassador @entity75 called on all parties in @entity4 to restore order as soon as possible
but he said the text would have served only to " complicate the issue " and would " prejudge the result of dialogue
" @entity11 and @entity12 vetoed another @entity7 resolution in october that would have called for an immediate halt to the crackdown , which @entity64 officials have said resulted in an estimated 6,000 deaths since protests began nearly a year ago
with the @entity7 failing to approve a resolution , what happens next is unclear
but as the diplomatic stalemate continues , the death toll in @entity4 climbs even higher
the @entity161 , a network of opposition activists that organizes and documents protests , said the violence has killed more than 7,300 .
