-- @entity1 is the fast food of the @entity3 : easy , quick , satisfying and requiring minimal effort
and the new @entity6 smartphone interface is for people who live and breathe the social network above any other site or service , depending on it as a news source and communication hub
@entity6 is a free @entity15 app that makes some mild changes to a phone 's lock screen and home screen to deliver more @entity1 features
it 's available now in the @entity22 for select @entity15 phones and comes pre-installed on the new @entity25 phone , which we have been testing out
cover feed the most prominent feature of @entity6 is the cover feed
the phone 's lock screen displays a constant slideshow of friends ' photos and updates that will glide by anytime the device is awake
you can like or comment on a status update or image directly from this screen , tap and hold to get a better look at photos , and swipe to flip through the updates going back in time
even short statuses are given the full - screen treatment here , displayed on top of a grayed out timeline photo
tap on the small profile picture for a friend to go straight to their timeline , or tap on a link to open whatever video or article your friend has posted
for people who habitually check @entity1 on their phones , the cover feed combines time wasting with time saving
it 's like having a tv constantly on in the background -- your friend 's wedding photos , weather updates , political rants are turned into soothing white noise you can marginally pay attention to while doing other tasks
it 's difficult not to constantly glance at the updates as they go by , an interesting photo catching your eye in the background anytime you check the time or get a text message or other notification
unfortunately , that allure is n't limited to the phone 's owner
friends and family members were easily sucked in by my phone running @entity6 , automatically picking up the device and flipping through the photos
anytime your phone is visible and awake , say when you put it on the table at a business meeting or cafe , people can get a peek at your friend feed
this has the potential to get really awkward
unlike your own carefully crafted timeline , the feed of content coming from all @entity1 contacts is n't controlled
there are no settings to pick and choose whose updates show up , so alongside the cute baby and vacation photos from close friends are the uncomfortable drunken photos from a weekend birthday party , political rants from your uncle , weird viral photos you wish you could un-see
another downside is that it is way too easy to accidentally like a status or photo , which can get embarrassing
there are no ads on the cover feed , but they will be added at some point
for many , any enjoyment that comes from seeing photos and statuses effortlessly play on the phone 's screen could be negated as soon as an unwanted advertisement slips in
@entity132 to escape the slideshow , use the tiny circle with your profile photo located at the bottom of the lock screen
tap on your face and swipe it left to open @entity141 and communicate with your friends through the social network , bypassing text messages or phone calls
swipe right to open the most recently used app or up to go to the phone 's main app screen where more facebooking awaits
there is no place to swipe to take a photo or post a status update
camera shortcuts are common on most smartphone lock screens , and it seems like a curious omission seeing as how most people are taking those photos just to put them on @entity1 or @entity159
but its only one step away
the main app screen has three new buttons along the top for posting a status or photo or checking into a location on @entity1
swipe left or right to see the usual selection of @entity15 apps , which have suffered a bit of a demotion in the @entity6 world
chat heads the most clever and useful feature is @entity174 , which will show @entity1 messages from your friends ( along with a bubble showing their profile photo ) no matter what app you are using at the time
what makes the chat feature handy is that it does n't require you to go to another app to respond
you can reply right there without having to leave @entity188 or whatever app you happen to be using , even move the bubble around so it 's not blocking a certain part of the screen
being able to chat away while doing other things is a huge time saver and hopefully something that will be adopted by other operating systems
you do n't even need @entity6 to get this feature
the company has rolled out an update for its @entity15 app that adds chat heads , so you can multitask away on any @entity15 phone
a new update to the @entity1 app also adds @entity174 , but unfortunately it only works inside the app. these are n't revolutionary changes to the smartphone experience
for many it will be too simplified , too invasive , too annoying
but for a certain segment of internet users it could be a no - brainer update
@entity1 says is has over a billion active users , and that includes an extremely wide range of ages and levels of tech know - how
smartphone users check the social network 14 times a day , according to a recent survey by @entity224
there are many people who 's @entity3 interactions revolve almost entirely around @entity1 , which serves up their news and entertainment and acts as both an e-mail and chat program
for these facebook - centric people , a smartphone that caters to how they use the @entity3 will the the most natural upgrade in the world .
