-- her name was @entity3 , and you 've probably never heard of her
her heyday was a century ago
she was @entity7 and spent only a few years in the @entity8
her work -- what little of it has survived -- generally lives on in museum collections
but perhaps you should find out who she is
for @entity15 , who died in 1968 , was a pioneer in the film industry
she was the first female director
she was perhaps the first to create a narrative film
she was an innovator in storytelling and in business
@entity22 is trying to raise her profile
@entity24 and @entity25 , her colleague at the @entity28 design firm @entity27 , have created a @entity30 campaign to secure funding for a documentary on @entity15
the work - in - progress , called " @entity34 " -- after a common @entity15 acting instruction -- is attempting to raise $ 200,000
@entity24 was inspired by a special about female pioneers in cinema , which also included @entity39 and @entity40
" @entity41 stuck with me , " says @entity24
" and when it was over , i was surprised that i did n't hear ( more ) about her
" given her contributions to motion pictures , you 'd think @entity48 would have attracted more notice
she was present practically at the creation of the industry , joining @entity7 businessman @entity53 -- whose company was one of the first movie producers -- as a secretary in 1894
two years later , when she was just 23 , she helmed a one - reel short , " @entity58 " ( " @entity58 " )
she started her own company , @entity59 , in 1910 , and set up a state - of - the - art studio in @entity61 , @entity62 , two years later -- the first woman to own a studio
she oversaw more than 1,000 films , many noted for their pioneering use of light , composition and even synchronized sound
" she had a very important place in film history , " says @entity70 , a film scholar at @entity71 who specializes in the silent era
" she was more than just a filmmaker -- she also knew how to organize a production company and get her work out there
" @entity70 suspects that a combination of factors caused @entity15 to fall into anonymity
the business moved to @entity83 ; @entity48 never really made the move
at the same time , her husband , @entity85 , took control of @entity59 , and she eventually returned to @entity7 and divorced him
and there was also the matter of her sex
even 100 years later , women struggle for positions of power in @entity83 -- particularly behind the camera
it was big news three years ago when @entity97 won best director for " the @entity99 , " only the fourth woman to even be nominated in that category
it was a different atmosphere in the teens and early ' 20s , says @entity70
at the time a number of women were screenwriters and directors
but once the business started consolidating , women 's creative positions " dropped off drastically , " he says
even @entity40 , one of the most accomplished directors of the teens , was largely forgotten
indeed , from the beginning of the sound era in 1927 until the 1970s , about the only female directors of note in @entity83 were @entity118 and @entity119
in the case of @entity15 , says @entity24 , " maybe her experience and her accomplishments were something that worked a little bit against her
they did n't want people who knew too much
she kind of encompassed that
" though the film will make use of old stills and @entity48 's work , @entity24 and @entity129 want it to have a modern look , where -- thanks to computer effects -- the viewer will practically feel inside the frame
the two have the experience : as established creative directors , they 've produced sequences for such films as " @entity143 , " " 42 " and " the @entity144
" the trailer for " @entity34 " invites you into another time
a number of film luminaries have gotten behind " @entity154 's " @entity30 campaign , including @entity152 and @entity153 , but the campaign is still well short of its financial goal
( an faq explains that despite some stars ' participation , " this is not the type of project that gets traditional @entity83 funding , nor is it the type of film that qualifies for educational grants
" ) @entity24 is hopeful they 'll make it across the finish line
after all , just because she 's little known does n't mean that @entity3 is any less inspirational , says @entity24
" there 's an @entity41 in all of us , " she says
" this is a piece of history , but that 's not the story
the story is about a woman who saw the opportunity in a time where she had nothing but obstacles , and she went and did it
the message is , if you have a dream , and you visualize it , you can do it
