would sending weapons to @entity1 block @entity3 from grabbing territory and stem violence in the volatile region ? or would it fuel further conflict and destabilize @entity9 ? that 's a key issue @entity12 leaders are weighing
and even as they tried to present a unified front at a press briefing monday , it was clear that it 's an area where @entity19 president @entity18 and @entity21 chancellor @entity20 do n't quite see eye to eye
@entity18 said he has n't decided yet whether to send arms to @entity1 forces defending their country against @entity3 - backed separatists , and he has n't set a deadline for when he will
but he insists it 's an option that should be considered if diplomacy fails
any weapons the @entity19 sends would not be meant to help @entity1 defeat the @entity3 army in an all - out battle , @entity18 said
" our goal has not been for @entity1 to be equipped to carry out offensive operations , " he said , " but to simply defend itself
" @entity20 said @entity9 diplomats are making " one further effort " at negotiating a deal
a key step is in the works : a possible meeting wednesday between @entity3 president @entity43 and @entity1 president @entity44
" i 've always said i do n't see a military solution to this conflict , " she said
" we have to put all our efforts in bringing about a diplomatic solution
" both @entity18 and @entity20 stressed the importance of working together
" there may be some areas where there are tactical disagreements
but the broad principle that we have to stand up for ... the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty is one where we are completely unified , " he said
@entity12 leaders can not stand idly by " and simply allow the borders of @entity9 to be redrawn at the barrel of a gun , " @entity18 said
@entity20 said the strong alliance between @entity9 and the @entity19 would thrive despite any differences
@entity3 's incursions on @entity1 's borders , she said , are too dangerous for @entity9 to tolerate
" i can only say that if we give up on this principle of territorial integrity of countries , then we will not be able to maintain the peaceful order of @entity9 that we 've been able to achieve , " she said
of course , those borders have already been redrawn once in the conflict
last year , @entity1 and @entity19 officials say @entity3 flooded @entity78 with troops ahead of its widely disputed annexation of the territory
@entity3 has steadfastly denied accusations that it 's sending forces and weapons into @entity1
but top @entity12 and @entity1 leaders have said there is n't any doubt that @entity3 is behind surging violence and separatists ' efforts to take over territory in eastern @entity1
@entity20 in the middle of a @entity19 - @entity3 standoff representatives of @entity3 , @entity1 , @entity21 and @entity95 were making preparations monday for a planned meeting wednesday in @entity98 , @entity99 , to discuss efforts to reach a ceasefire
if those talks fail , @entity19 lawmakers will likely ratchet up pressure on @entity18 to send weapons to @entity1
but even that gathering , which could be a significant meeting between @entity43 and @entity44 , is n't set in stone
" we are planning for wednesday if we succeed in settling the various points that we have discussed so intensively over these last days , " @entity43 said sunday
the big challenge facing @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity20 and @entity95 president @entity111 is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick
a peace agreement was signed in september in @entity98
it called for a drawback of heavy weapons , self - rule in the eastern regions and a buffer zone to be set up along the @entity3 - @entity1 border
but the agreement quickly disintegrated , and the violence continued
the new plan envisions a much broader demilitarized zone to run along the current front lines
all the while , the crisis in @entity1 , which stemmed from a trade agreement , has killed more than 5,000 people , including many civilians
at least 224 civilians were killed in the final three weeks of january alone , the @entity133 high commissioner for human rights said
@entity2 's @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 reported and wrote from @entity138
@entity2 's @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity143 and journalist @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity1 , and @entity146 in @entity138 , contributed to this report .
