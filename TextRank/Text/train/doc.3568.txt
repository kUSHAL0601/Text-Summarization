-- three @entity3 students in @entity4 have been charged with racially bullying their black roommate by clamping a bicycle lock around his neck and decorating their four - bedroom suite with a @entity11 flag , @entity13 symbols , photos of @entity15 and a white board with a racial epithet , prosecutors said thursday
the three students -- @entity19 , 18 , of @entity20 ; @entity24 , 19 , of @entity25 ; and @entity26 , 18 , of @entity27 -- are charged with misdemeanor hate crime and battery , the @entity23 district attorney 's office said
neither the three students nor their attorneys could be immediately reached for comment
@entity19 was booked in the @entity33 on thursday , with bail set at $ 15,000
the defendants face a maximum sentence of one year in county jail if convicted , prosecutors said
the 17 - year - old roommate who was the alleged victim was n't named by prosecutors
he suffered a minor injury when he fought off the bike lock around his neck , prosecutors said
" i ca n't believe in the year 2013 that we 're talking about an @entity49 student being treated this way , " district attorney @entity45 told @entity0
" we 're taking this case very seriously
" the defendants are accused of nicknaming their black roommate " three - fifths , " an apparent reference to a @entity58 constitutional provision that counted slaves as " three - fifths of all other persons , " prosecutors said
when the @entity49 - @entity49 student objected to that name , the three roommates in the campus housing began calling him " @entity68 , " the prosecutor 's office said
the alleged harassment began in august and lasted through october , prosecutors said
are we too quick to cry ' bully ' ? @entity3 's president , @entity72 , said in a letter to the student body thursday that the three students have been suspended
" let me be clear : i am outraged and saddened by these allegations
they are utterly inconsistent with our long cherished history of tolerance , respect for diversity and personal civility , " @entity72 's letter said
members of the alleged victim 's family released a statement saying they were " deeply disturbed by the horrific behaviors that have taken place against our son
" " our immediate focus is his protection , " the family said
" we have taken a stand on this matter
our response prompted the community to be alerted of the appalling conduct of the students involved
" a total of eight men were living in the four - bedroom suite , but the remaining four students turned their back on the racial harassment , the prosecutor said
" the other four were aware of this ( but ) ... did not stand up " and allowed the harassment , @entity45 said
parents saw the @entity11 flag in the dorm suite and " the n - word scrawled on a white board , " @entity45 said
when friends become bullies at least one of the defendants tried to downplay the harassment , and the three defendants then wrote a note to the @entity49 - @entity49 roommate , asking him to join their group , @entity45 said
but the black roommate objected to the harassment and sometimes " barricaded " himself in his room , @entity45 said
" the young man in this case was terrorized
it was difficult for him to study , " @entity45 said
" he told them not to do this to him
" @entity72 said the university police immediately began investigating the allegations " the day our housing staff learned of the situation
" the same day the investigation began , two of the roommates were moved to other residence halls and placed in single rooms
" a third suite - mate , originally believed to be a bystander , was identified yesterday as an offender
we regret he was not removed from the victim 's suite before today , " @entity72 said
bullying among boys easily dismissed ? @entity0 's @entity152 contributed to this report .
