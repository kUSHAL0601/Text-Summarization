-- @entity3 billionaire @entity2 's dream of space travel that thousands of people can afford took a leap toward reality with the maiden flight of the world 's first commercial spacecraft over @entity12 's @entity11
@entity2 's company @entity13 announced monday that the @entity14 had successfully completed what it called a captive carry flight attached to a carrier plane
the spacecraft 's developer called it a " momentous day
" " the captive carry flight signifies the start of what we believe will be extremely exciting and successful spaceship flight test program , " said @entity20 , founder of @entity21 , which built the spacecraft
the @entity14 remained attached to its carrier aircraft for the duration of the 2 - hour , 54 - minute flight , reaching an altitude of 45,000 feet , according to a statement from @entity13
eventually , the 60 - foot long rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the @entity34 by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space
the test - flight program is expected to continue through 2011 , going first to a free glide and then to a powered flight before commercial flights begin
" seeing the finished spaceship in december was a major day for us but watching @entity14 fly for the first time really brings home what beautiful , ground - breaking vehicles @entity20 and his team have developed for us , " @entity2 said
" today was another major step along that road and a testament to @entity53 engineering and innovation , " he said
@entity13 has envisioned one flight a week , with six tourists aboard
each will pay $ 200,000 for the ride and train for at least three days before going
about 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list for seats
" what we want to be able to do is bring space travel down to a price range where hundreds of thousands of people would be able to experience space , and they never dreamed that [ they ] could , " @entity2 said last year
he has said he hopes the technology will lead to a new form of @entity34 travel , jetting people across oceans and continents faster through suborbital routes .
