more federal prisoners serving sentences for non-violent crimes can apply for clemency after the @entity4 announced new rules wednesday
deputy attorney general @entity6 announced that the department would broaden the criteria for clemency , a move that is expected to lead to thousands of prisoners -- most serving drug sentences -- filing applications to president @entity14 seeking to commute their sentences
the changes are part of a broader effort by the @entity14 administration to modify sentencing laws , allowing for use of rehabilitation and other alternatives to deal with non-violent drug offenders and those who previously faced tough mandatory minimum sentences
attorney general @entity27 previewed some of the changes monday by announcing plans to assign more lawyers to handle an anticipated flood of clemency requests
crack cocaine at heart of once - common sentencing disparity " we are launching this clemency initiative in order to quickly and effectively identify appropriate candidates , candidates who have a clean prison record , do not present a threat to public safety , and were sentenced under out - of - date laws that have since been changed , and are no longer seen as appropriate , " @entity6 said at a news conference
the clemency changes would be open to prisoners who have met a set of specific conditions : they must be low - level , non-violent offenders without a significant criminal history and must be serving a federal sentence that would likely be shorter if they were convicted today
they must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison , with no history of violence before or during their prison term
the pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort @entity27 calls " @entity64 , " which also seeks to remedy the once - common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine , based on guidelines first enacted by @entity70 more than 25 years ago
earlier : @entity27 seeks to cut mandatory minimum drug sentences of the more than 200,000 inmates in the federal prison system , some estimates show the new clemency criteria could apply to about 2,000 prisoners
but the number is likely to fall to perhaps hundreds after government lawyers review the applications
the @entity4 says it does n't know how many people will end up qualifying because it depends on the applications and how they fit the new criteria
the president has final authority to decide who gets clemency
@entity14 has been criticized by some civil rights groups for being stingy with his pardons and commutations
but many praised the @entity4 's decision as a good initial step , including a coalition of groups working on sentencing guidelines
the announcement " marks the beginning of the end of the age of mass incarceration , " said @entity96 , president of the @entity97
" we must seize this historic opportunity to start the process of remedying decades of cruel and unnecessarily harsh sentencing policies
" @entity6 also announced the appointment of @entity108 to lead the department 's @entity109 , which has come under fire for being slow to review a backlog of applications
@entity6 said the department was setting up an online application system and working with pro-bono attorneys who will assist prisoners in their applications
@entity119 , general counsel for the group @entity120 , which advocates for changes to drug sentencing laws , welcomed @entity6 's announcement
" the doors of the @entity109 have been closed to petitioners for too long
this announcement signals a truly welcome change ; the culture of ' no ' that has dominated that office is being transformed , " she said
the push to relax sentencing laws has the support of some conservative @entity135 lawmakers , who believe it is a way to reduce spending on federal prisons and to use alternatives to incarceration to deal with drug problems
however , lawmakers want the changes to be made through @entity70 rather than through the president 's executive power
" i hope president @entity14 is not seeking to change sentencing policy unilaterally
@entity70 , not the president , has authority to make sentencing policy
he should continue to work with @entity70 rather than once again going it alone , and i 'm willing to work with the president on these issues
" sen. @entity155 , @entity156 , said this week
@entity6 , in his remarks wednesday , said the issue is one of fairness
" older , stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under today 's laws erode people 's confidence in our criminal justice system , and i am confident that this initiative will go far to promote the most fundamental of @entity171 ideals -- equal justice under law , " @entity6 said
three years ago , @entity14 signed the @entity174 to address the larger issue of drug sentencing disparities
sentencing guidelines provided for a 100 - to - 1 ratio between the penalties for crack cocaine offenses versus those for powdered cocaine , but the fair sentencing law reduced the disparity to 18 - to - 1 .
