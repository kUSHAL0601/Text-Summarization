@entity0 , @entity1 -- months after a coup escalated chaos and violence in the @entity1 , the @entity3 on thursday unanimously approved the deployment of @entity9 and @entity10 forces there
the council also voted to impose an arms embargo on the nation , which is east of @entity14 and north of the @entity15
a representative of the @entity1 told the council the vote would " give reasons to hope for a new dawn " for the country 's embattled population
speaking after the vote , @entity24 ambassador to the @entity3 @entity25 said the @entity24 government was " deeply disturbed " by ongoing reports of brutality in the nation
" it is clear that urgent action is needed to save lives , " she said , adding that the crisis has affected nearly half the country 's population
the @entity3 resolution , put forward by @entity10 , authorizes an @entity39 - led peacekeeping force to intervene with the support of @entity10 forces to protect civilians , restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country
hours before the meeting , heavy gunfire erupted near the presidential palace in the capital of @entity50 , witnesses said
@entity51 , of @entity52 , told @entity2 that eight people were killed and 65 wounded in clashes in the city
the agency , also known as @entity52 , has 16 people helping at two hospitals where the wounded have been taken , it said in a statement
twenty are badly hurt , most with gunshot , machete or knife wounds
an official with the @entity9 - led peacekeeping force in the @entity1 , @entity67 , told @entity2 he had seen eight bodies in the street
he said he had been told there were more bodies near the @entity72
violence has raged in the country since a coalition of rebels ousted president @entity77 in march , the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence
@entity83 vigilante groups have formed to battle @entity84 , the predominantly @entity86 coalition behind the president 's ouster
multiple sources told @entity2 that the military commander of @entity84 , gen. @entity91 , was killed thursday in @entity50
his second - in - command , col. @entity93 , is now thought to be in charge
@entity67 said @entity84 is now back in control of the center of @entity50 and the situation there is quiet
fighting continues near the airport , however
members of @entity84 told @entity2 that at least 30 people had been killed in the clashes in @entity50 , men and women among them
@entity106 take refuge left uncontrolled , militia groups are uniting along religious lines , leading to fears of sectarian violence
the situation in @entity0 , a town about 185 miles north of @entity50 that is at the epicenter of displacement resulting from the violence , was extremely tense thursday
about 35,000 @entity106 have taken refuge in a catholic church compound there
the headquarters of the small regional peacekeeping mission told @entity2 that the second - in - command of @entity84 had given the militia permission to attack the compound
the mission has sent reinforcements in defensive positions around the church to protect civilians
a @entity2 team in the vicinity could hear sustained gunfire and rocket - propelled grenade fire that appeared to be directed at the church compound
there is no word yet of any casualties or damage suffered
speaking to @entity2 before reports of the death of @entity84 's commander emerged , @entity93 said that it was believed there were armed elements in the compound but that unless those inside moved against them , they would n't attack it
power , the @entity24 envoy , said the sectarian tension that has made the tens of thousands of @entity106 seek refuge in the church compound in @entity0 , while their @entity86 neighbors shelter in a mosque nearby , was a tragic result of the coup
" extremists on both sides , in an environment of lawlessness and an environment of state failure , have taken advantage of that vacuum and stoked animosities , " she said
the @entity164 said the @entity24 was " appalled by today 's reports of the murder of innocent women and children outside of @entity50 " and was working with its international partners to find the best way to stabilize the situation
" this horrifying account is the latest in a string of reports that illustrate the deteriorating humanitarian and security situation in the @entity1 that could lead to an escalation in violence and further atrocities , " the @entity164 statement said
an unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas too risky to access
@entity185 officials have warned that the violence between the @entity83 majority and @entity86 minority now in power could lead to genocide
more than 400,000 people -- nearly 10 % of the population -- have been internally displaced , according to the @entity185
" they are hiding in the bush without shelter , food , or drinking water , exposed to the weather and mosquitoes that carry malaria , the leading cause of death in the country , " @entity52 said in a statement
the group has operated in the country for years and is helping dispatch mobile units to take care of the wounded
@entity10 troops an @entity39 force is already in the nation , but rights group say it 's not enough to halt the escalating violence
last month , @entity10 pledged to send about 1,000 more troops to add to the 400 already there
the troops currently there are deployed to protect @entity10 nationals and help secure the airport in the capital , @entity10 said
sources in the @entity39 mission to the @entity1 said wednesday that more @entity10 troops are on their way to the nation
@entity10 's ambassador to the @entity185 , @entity227 , who holds the rotating presidency of the @entity3 , welcomed the body 's decision to intervene in what he said was a " forgotten crisis
" the @entity185 has suggested its peacekeeping force could eventually augment the @entity9 - led mission
@entity77 fled the country after the coup led by rebel leader @entity238
a transitional government is in place led by @entity238 , who was commander of the @entity84 rebels
but the country continues to be wracked by unrest and new elections have yet to be held
