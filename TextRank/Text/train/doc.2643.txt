-- hundreds of angry @entity1 demonstrated in the holy @entity3 city of @entity4 on thursday , protesting the use of foreign troops in the crackdown against anti-government protests in @entity9
this week , military forces from the @entity11 -- including @entity12 -- arrived in @entity9 to help the kingdom control a wave of anti-government protests , prompting the @entity17 administration and @entity20 @entity19 ban ki - moon to urge council members to act with restraint and to allow the citizens of @entity9 to demonstrate peacefully
although @entity9 's protesters are making primarily economic and political demands , there is a sectarian dimension : @entity9 's population is 70 % @entity3 ; the royal family is @entity30 , as is the royal family of @entity12
@entity12 recently has seen small demonstrations among its minority @entity3
in @entity4 , some protesters carried @entity3 flags as they condemned the brutal force wielded against @entity9 's predominantly @entity3 demonstrators
the @entity20 human rights chief and @entity39 issued statements thursday calling on the @entity9 government to halt the violence against its people
some of the @entity1 demonstrators held up banners reading , " no foreign troops in @entity9
" others shouted , " @entity48 ! leave @entity9 immediately , " referring to @entity12 troops
a similar protest was held in @entity51 thursday , and , during the parliamentary session , @entity30 and @entity3 lawmakers also condemned the foreign troops being employed in the crackdown
sunni parliamentary speaker @entity59 the violence against protesters could " potentially tear apart the social fabric of the country and in the region
" former prime minister @entity62 , a @entity3 , used stronger language during a speech to lawmakers , calling the use of foreign troops in @entity9 a " flagrant violation
" @entity30 make up the majority in the @entity70 world
@entity1 has seen its own share of clashes over anti-government demonstrations this year
since february , at least 20 @entity1 have been killed and hundreds have been wounded in protests across the country , part of a series of demonstrations that have swept across the @entity80 and parts of @entity82 this year , toppling the leaders of @entity84 and @entity85
the protests in @entity1 demanded economic progress , an end to corruption and basic services and freedoms
" many @entity1 protesters were killed and wounded when they only demanded some political reforms , " @entity92 , an @entity1 activist , told @entity0
" @entity95 knows what will happen to them if they demonstrate to topple this sectarian government
" the @entity20 expressed its concerns about violence used against protesters across the country
" while acknowledging the duty incumbent on the @entity1 authorities to ensure law and order in the country , the @entity20 in @entity1 notes with concern that several instances of human rights violations in relation to the demonstrations have been reported , " it said in a statement
" the reported violations include disproportionate use of force by @entity1 security forces that resulted in the death and injury of a number of citizens ; restrictions on the media and attacks on media organizations ; and arrests and detention of , in particular , journalists
" the @entity1 government was formed in december , nine months after an inconclusive national election
this is the second elected government in the nearly eight years after a @entity134 - led invasion toppled @entity135 .
