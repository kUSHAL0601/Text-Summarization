-- it 's known as the @entity2 , but @entity2 has taken a dizzying step toward being the @entity4 after the @entity5 unveiled a new glass floor
offering dramatic views of the 57 - meter ( 187 - foot ) drop from the 125 - year - old landmark 's first level , the transparent walkway has proved a hit with visitors lining up -- and lying down -- to take selfies
@entity2 's mayor , @entity15 , opened the new attraction , saying it would help bring back some magic to a city that 's been criticized for disappointing foreign visitors
" i hear that @entity2 has lost its shine and attractiveness , " she said
" it 's not true
" the new floor , she added , proved @entity26 could reinvent their city " without ruining our history
" it 's the latest in a series of glass floored walkways to open in prominent destinations around the world
these include @entity37 's @entity36 and the @entity38
@entity2 admits it needs to be friendlier @entity15 celebrated the opening with a series of multilingual tweets inviting tourists to " enjoy this breathtakingly high experience
" the glass floor is part of a $ 38.4 million renovation of the tower 's first floor that also includes shops , restaurants and a museum
new outward - curving safety barriers also allow better views over the city
until now , the tower 's somewhat gloomy " premier etage " has been one of its least - visited areas , with most of its 7 million annual visitors heading straight to higher levels
built by @entity64 , the @entity63 was completed in 1889 as part of a " @entity66 " celebrating the centenary of the @entity68
at 312 meters , it was the tallest building in the world until @entity72 's @entity71 overtook it in 1930
it was originally designed as a temporary attraction , but the decision was made to keep it as a permanent attraction -- and the @entity63 has never looked back
thanks to the glass floor though , it can now look down
