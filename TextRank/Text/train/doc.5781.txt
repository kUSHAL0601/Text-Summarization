@entity0 , @entity1 -- a retired @entity1 general whose movement launched an assault on @entity8 militias in @entity9 and demanded the suspension of parliament has called for a new council to take over the running of the country
@entity15 said wednesday that the @entity16 , the interim parliament , had failed the people and that its mismanagement of the country had turned @entity1 into " a state sponsor of terror ... and a hideout for terrorists
" he made his call for a new , civilian council to take its place during a televised news conference in @entity9
on sunday , armed men claiming allegiance to @entity30 's newly formed movement , known as the @entity31 , stormed parliament and announced they had suspended it
@entity15 said wednesday that since the parliament had refused to " fulfill the demands of the people , " he was asking the @entity35 to appoint a civilian council to lead the country , in the interests of political stability and security
this council , he said , would have three main tasks : appointing a caretaker emergency government , overseeing the upcoming parliamentary elections and handing over power to the new parliament
the country 's electoral commission announced that elections would be held next month , the state news agency @entity47 reported tuesday , in what seemed to be a move to try to ease tensions that drove @entity1 to the brink in recent days
@entity15 said his forces would secure the country during the transitional period and after that
the declared goal of the @entity31 is to eradicate @entity8 militants from @entity1 , including @entity60 -- the group blamed for the september 11 , 2012 deadly attack on the @entity63 consulate in @entity9
air force , navy chiefs back @entity15 's movement this week , @entity30 's so - called " @entity72 , " which he has described as an open - ended war on terrorism in @entity1 , seemed to gain more support from military units , officials and armed groups across the country
@entity15 's men last week launched a land and air offensive against the @entity9 bases of @entity60 and other @entity8 groups with ties to the government in @entity0
the resulting battle killed 75 people and wounded 141 more
the chiefs of staff of the @entity86 and the navy have announced they are endorsing @entity72
according to @entity47 , the headquarters of the chief of staff of the air force came under attack by unknown gunmen on tuesday night , a short while after the announcement was made
there were no reported casualties in the attack , but damage was caused and offices looted and ransacked
on wednesday morning , the navy chief survived an assassination attempt in @entity0 when a car with unknown assailants opened fire on his convoy
gen. @entity104 , his two guards and driver sustained minor injuries in the attack
those who oppose @entity30 , including the government and members of the @entity16 , have accused him of a " coup attempt
" his call for a " civilian " council to run the country appeared to be a response to these accusations , made amid much speculation about his political ambitions
asked whether his movement was receiving support from @entity122 @entity121 or any other country , @entity15 said they were depending only on " @entity125 and the @entity1 people
" some see @entity15 's campaign as an opportunistic strategy capitalizing on @entity1 ' growing discontent with a weak central government and the deteriorating security situation in the country
@entity15 was once a general in the @entity1 army under dictator @entity134 but had a falling out with him and emigrated to the @entity63 , where he lived for almost 20 years
he returned in 2011 to participate in the revolution to overthrow @entity134
he has since criticized the government for not getting a grip on violence , particularly from @entity8 groups
reflecting the continuing state of lawlessness and chaos , explosions and gunfire echoed across the capital in the early hours of wednesday
eyewitnesses said a number of rockets hit areas in southern and eastern @entity0
however , it was not clear who was involved in the attacks or whether there were casualties in what appeared to be inter-militia fighting , something not uncommon in the city .
