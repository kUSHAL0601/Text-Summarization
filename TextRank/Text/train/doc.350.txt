-- as @entity2 begins her legal career , she has not only her own expectations to live up to , but those of a generation : she has just become @entity8 's first female lawyer
after three years of petitioning the @entity9 , @entity10 , 25 , has finally received her registration to practice as a trainee lawyer , the first woman to do so
" people tell me i 'm a pioneer and i feel i need to live up to what they expect of me , " says @entity10
" there 's a great sense of responsibility
from now on , people will look at everything i do
" @entity10 , who decided on a legal career while preparing for university , graduated from @entity24 in @entity25 in 2010 and expected to be able to practice as a lawyer immediately
but much to her frustration , she has spent three years in a professional no - man 's land , able to work as " legal consultant " but not officially recognized as a lawyer
universities in @entity8 began taking female law students in 2005 and the first graduates completed their studies in 2008
but the optimism soon wore off when female graduates found themselves unable to gain registration to practice
many of @entity10 's classmates , frustrated by the lack of progress in @entity8 , left the country to work abroad
but @entity10 stayed in her hometown of @entity25 and continued to apply for registration
in the meantime , some of her contemporaries began an online campaign to push for change , including a @entity58 group called " i am a lawyer , " a @entity47 campaign and @entity49 videos from women arguing their right to practice
in october last year , after accepting a petition with 3,000 signatures submitted by a group of female law graduates , @entity60 announced that women would be allowed to register as lawyers
however , the @entity9 still was n't processing applications from women
" i kept on following up , but they would n't give me an answer either way , " says @entity10
a friend and vocal campaigner , @entity74 , then wrote a newspaper article in which she pleaded with @entity60 to intervene
@entity74 had been one of @entity8 's first batch of female law graduates in 2008 , but had gone to the @entity78 to practice after becoming disillusioned with the situation at home
" i wrote about how depressing the situation was , saying here we were , many of us working for federal courts outside the @entity84 , because we had no future inside it , " says @entity10 - @entity74 two days later , the @entity9 announced they would start accepting applications and soon afterwards @entity10 's application was granted
now working as a trainee lawyer and due to qualify fully in two years , @entity10 hopes to pursue a career in family law to help other @entity8 women
" many women really need to talk to female lawyers , and i want to help those women to get their rights , " she says
@entity10 knows the path ahead wo n't always be smooth
" the social aspect is a very considerable one , for society to accept women lawyers , it 's something new , " she says
" it will be also challenging for the judiciary system to deal with female lawyers , but i think we can overcome these hardships if we prove ourselves as competent lawyers
" @entity109 , a @entity110 researcher for @entity111 , agrees that challenges remain for female lawyers
" @entity8 judges have a lot of leeway , and can remove a lawyer from a case , " says @entity109
" she might face judges rejecting her counsel or not allowing her to speak , particularly if that judge is conservative and does n't want women to speak in court
" other female lawyers are now following in @entity10 's footsteps and gaining registration , although exact numbers are unclear
for @entity10 , being able to pursue a legal career at home was well worth the wait
" success is a nice feeling , especially when it comes after tribulation , " she says .
