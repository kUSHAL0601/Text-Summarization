-- the @entity1 tried mightily to wade through a cloud of bureaucratic regulations monday over setting clear air standards , a high - stakes environmental and economic fight pitting the @entity8 administration against a coalition of states and utilities
the justices on monday heard six separate appeals , which were consolidated into more than 100 minutes of often dense oral arguments
a ruling is expected by june
at issue is narrow , but potentially far - reaching -- whether the @entity19 can tighten emissions standards for " stationary " greenhouse gas sources , such as power plants , in what the administration says is an effort to stem the effects of climate change and global warming
in the larger political sphere , this issue could be major test of executive authority , with many conservative groups painting president @entity8 as misusing his power and ignoring the will of the legislature
@entity8 just last week announced new executive rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses
the @entity38 said ongoing stalemates on @entity40 prompted the president to act
@entity41 in @entity42 and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing the @entity48 health reform law , a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization , and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally - married same - sex couples for federal purposes
the high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal @entity57
the @entity1 , in 2007 , affirmed the conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases -- including carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide emissions -- are an air pollutant , but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles
a range of business groups say the agency then improperly extended its regulatory authority to stationary sources
they worry the unchecked , expanded rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools , small businesses , and shopping malls
defining " air pollutant " within the context of greenhouse gases -- and the ability of the @entity19 to exercise its rulemaking authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- took up much of the courtroom debate
justice @entity89 said the half - dozen parties opposing the @entity19 can not even agree on defining an " air pollutant " for regulatory purposes " that to me is the quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give deference to the " @entity19 , said @entity89
" so if your side ca n't even come to one interpretation , why should n't we defer to the agency ? " but justice @entity102 , who could prove the court 's decisive fifth vote , bluntly addressed @entity106 solicitor general @entity105
" i have to say in reading the brief for the states and reading your brief , i could n't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position , " he said
@entity113 and 16 other the states in the @entity115 and @entity116 were among the parties whose cases are under review by the high court
the justices had previously rejected three other related appeals , including one from @entity124 -- broader challenges to the @entity19 's power over carbon emissions
a coalition of 15 states backs the @entity38
some progressive groups worry the conservative majority @entity1 has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years , and could rule in this case against the administration
but an outcome in this his case was not clear from the arguments
" we have to think about it , along the parameter of separation of powers and whether the way in which the agency has perceived it here has arrogated an exceptional and troubling degree of discretion to design its own climate change program , " @entity139 , the attorney representing the private groups bringing suit , told the court
justice @entity154 , the most vocal backer of the administration , said the @entity156 was originally passed and amended before a clear understanding of the effect greenhouses gases were having on the planet
she said the @entity19 made a careful determination that they were different from pollution sources that cause breathing and other health problems , such as smog , and could apply different monitoring standards
" what 's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable , and the agency has essentially picked one , " said @entity154
" it said : ' look , we 're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants
instead , we 're going to fudge the numbers
' and why is n't that the more reasonable of the two things to do ? " she asked
@entity105 made clear the stakes in his oral presentation , telling the court that greenhouse gas emissions are " an urgent environmental " issue
" it 's the gravest environmental problem that we face now as far as @entity19 's judgment , and it is one that gets worse with the passage of time , " he said
but some justices questioned the agency 's reach
" are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which @entity19 has the authority to change the statutory thresholds ? " asked justice @entity196
" could it do this for another pollutant , something other than any of the greenhouse gases ? " after @entity102 and chief justice @entity206 pressed the point , @entity105 suggested the @entity19 could broaden its discretionary authority , absent a specific congressional mandate
this is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term
the justices in december heard arguments over the @entity19 's ability to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state , requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions
a ruling in that case is still pending
many business groups hope the conservative majority will limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas , which the @entity230 and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation
the cases argued monday are @entity235 v. @entity19 ( 12 - 1272 ) ; @entity113 v. @entity19 ( 12 - 1269 ) ; @entity236 v. @entity19 ( 12 - 1268 ) ; @entity237 on @entity238 v. @entity19 ( 12 - 1254 ) ; @entity239 v. @entity19 ( 12 - 1248 ) ; and @entity240 v. @entity19 ( 12 - 1146 ) .
