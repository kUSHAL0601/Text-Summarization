-- federal authorities say they 've cracked an international gambling ring calling itself @entity3 , whose customers would place bets with bookies , by phone and online and -- if they lost -- risked paying a painful price
authorities allege in the indictment , which was filed in the @entity13 for @entity14 , that the illicit gambling company curried a " violent reputation " for its use of " intimidation , threats and violence
" in addition to the @entity24 - headquartered organization itself , 18 individuals face racketeering and illegal gambling charges , states the indictment
the former is punishable by up to 20 years in prison , while the latter charge carries a maximum five - year prison sentence
fifteen of those individuals were arrested earlier wednesday in @entity14 ; @entity33 , @entity34 ; and @entity35 , @entity24 , the @entity36 for @entity14 said in a press release
authorities took @entity39 , one of the alleged ringleaders , into custody wednesday night , said @entity36 's office spokesman @entity42
at that time , two other people -- @entity44 and @entity45 -- remained at large , @entity42 said
" criminal enterprises like ' @entity3 ' and their @entity55 based ' bookmakers ' prey on gambling addictions of their betting customers , wreaking havoc on people 's lives and the lives of family members , " @entity46 , special agent in charge of the @entity50 's @entity49 office , said in a press release
brothers @entity39 and @entity64 , originally from @entity14 , set up @entity65 in @entity66 in 2002 , according to @entity66 public documents cited in @entity55 authorities ' probable cause statement
the company moved its headquarters six years later to @entity24 , where the @entity72 had family , though its customers were in @entity14 and elsewhere
over the past decade , customers were invited to place bets on sporting events -- from @entity79 games to mixed - martial arts fights -- either through a system of bookies , by calling a toll - free phone number or through personal accounts set up on two internet sites
macho sports employed phone operators , bookies , " sub-bookies , " runners and collectors to deliver winnings and collect debts from customers , @entity55 authorities explained
the probable cause statement features excerpts of several phone wiretaps
in one , a bookie openly worries that he might get arrested , to which @entity39 replies , " it 's not that easy
" the bookie responds , " yeah , but you 're 8,000 miles away
" people involved in @entity3 spoke about gambling - debt collectors ' sometimes violent tactics
@entity39 , for instance , referred to one who he said " kidnaps people , strikes them with a gun , and he 's walking the streets
" the federal complaint claims that proceeds were laundered " by inducing customers to pay their gambling losses to various entities that appeared to be unrelated to @entity3 , such as check - cashing businesses
@entity0 's @entity121 contributed to this report .
