-- digital gifts may be tough to wrap
but they can be more convenient for both givers and recipients
an album from @entity6 or a @entity8 e-book from @entity9 have become viable gift options for shoppers , especially on the eve of a holiday or for people living far away
digital items can be purchased with a few clicks and delivered instantly
and because they do n't need to be shipped , they 're environmentally friendly
revenue from some virtual goods , including games and applications , will reach $ 2.9 billion next year , according to research firm @entity23
once you add digital music downloads , which research firm @entity27 says will rake in $ 6.3 billion this year , and online video streaming through services such as @entity30 and @entity31 , the market becomes quite large
gift cards are always a popular alternative , but for people who would rather give a specific present , many of the big digital retailers are providing ways to send downloads via e-mail
about a quarter of holiday shoppers plan to buy virtual gifts this year , according to a research report from e-commerce provider @entity45
children may find themselves running to check their e-mail on christmas morning or each night of @entity48
@entity49 : through its @entity6 program on a computer , @entity49 lets you give apps , music , movies and tv shows to be sent to someone 's e-mail address or to be printed as a certificate at home
click the down arrow beside the " buy " button on an item in the @entity64 and then click on " @entity65
" the @entity6 or @entity67 buttons on @entity49 's mobile devices also have this feature tucked at the bottom of each listing
@entity49 does not let shoppers send e-books as gifts via ibooks , however
@entity9 : the online retailer has " give as a gift " buttons located under the " buy " buttons all over @entity8 books and mp3 music in its store
@entity9 launched the feature last holiday season
the songs are in a standard format that can be played on many music players , and the books can be viewed using the apps @entity9 offers for phones , tablets and computers , as well as in a computer 's web browser
@entity9 does not seem to let shoppers gift apps , like those for the new @entity98 tablet
but children using their parents @entity8 tablets wo n't have a tough time racking up the charges thanks to the devices ' deep integration with the @entity9 store
@entity107 : the bookseller 's @entity108 covers both apps and e-books for the @entity113 tablets and e-readers
the retailer lets recipients exchange unwanted gifts -- say , the full " @entity120 " series -- for store credit
@entity121 : the computing giant sells apps , e-books , movie rentals and music downloads in the @entity127
but it does not allow customers to purchase them and have them delivered as gifts , a @entity121 spokesman said
others : popular web media services , including @entity30 and @entity134 , sell subscriptions that can be given as gifts
hot music streaming service @entity138 offers this in parts of @entity142 but not yet in the @entity143 , a spokeswoman said
so in short , stockings may be lighter this year
but inboxes may be fuller .
