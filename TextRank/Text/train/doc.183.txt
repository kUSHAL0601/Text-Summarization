" age before beauty " goes the old adage , but in the advertising industry the opposite has always seemed to be the case
young , fresh faced women were chosen as the poster girls for brands selling products to make women look and feel young again , or maintain that ever essential ' youthful glow '
but now it seems that fashion and cosmetics companies in particular are moving towards a somewhat older group of models
at 80 years old , author @entity19 was announced as the new face of @entity21 for @entity22 and is the subject of a new photography show - and she is not the first older woman to have been chosen by big brands
she joins other older models including @entity28 ( 69 ) and @entity29 ( 76 ) for @entity30 , @entity31 ( 71 ) for @entity32 and @entity33 ( 69 ) who became the face of @entity36 lipstick late last year
hiring older models has been de rigueur lately with @entity38 , 47 , having continued success as the face of @entity41 , but that does not mean she is not feeling the pressure
" by @entity47 standards , i guess i 've already taken a big risk in not having had a facelift , " @entity38 told the @entity45 's @entity44
" i 've told @entity41 that i want to be an ageing model -- so they have to keep me for at least five more years until i 'm over 50
" eschewing plastic surgery , @entity38 has her own methods of looking young ; " it 's about non-grasping , non-hoarding , cleaning out your closet , dusting out your mind and letting go of the things that weigh you down mentally and emotionally
" award - winning photographer @entity61 has her own ideas about why its important to see images of older women : " in my own lifetime i have witnessed a profound shift : from little girls imagining their future as marriage and children to the now total belief from childhood that a woman will grow up to have a career outside the home
" " it is more important than ever to see the important women from all fields in our society and hear their voices of experience
" honey 's recent exhibition at @entity87 house , 100 leading ladies , aimed to transform the perception of what is possible for women to achieve in their lives
100 older @entity45 women were photographed honey in settings that inspire them and interviewed by former @entity98 journalist @entity97 , the results were all compiled into a book , published by @entity100 which was launched in tandem with the @entity103 exhibition
" @entity106 " is showing from february 12 - march 21 at @entity104 , 521 west 23rd street , @entity105 13 of the women featured in the book can be seen in the gallery above
