-- @entity2 's bid for a record fourth @entity4 final title began with a 2 - 1 victory over neighbors @entity7 in @entity8 on tuesday , thanks to a late goalkeeping error by the defending champions ' @entity11
@entity11 completely misjudged a dipping free - kick from out on the left by @entity14 , which bounced in front of him and appeared to go through his legs in the 84th minute
one of the fiercest rivalries in world football produced a relatively low - key affair , with the booking received by @entity7 substitute @entity22 that led to the goal being the only yellow card brandished by @entity26 referee @entity25
@entity2 made the worst possible start in the long - awaited pivotal match in @entity29 when conceding the opening goal against the run of play in the 12th minute
an ominous sign ahead of the @entity34 ? @entity7 skipper @entity35 , the player of the tournament four years ago after netting the only goal of the final against @entity39 , was credited with the score after ramming the ball home from right on the line after @entity45 's header back across the box appeared to be heading in anyway
however , @entity2 leveled three minutes before halftime when @entity48 beat the offside trap to collect @entity51 's clever pass into the penalty area and beat goalkeeper @entity11 for his ninth international goal
pitch warfare : @entity2 take on @entity7 the @entity55 could not make their dominance count until @entity11 's mistake , with @entity48 coming closest to scoring shortly before that lapse when he hit the sidenetting
@entity60 was barely half - full for a match between nations at war from 1980 - 88 , with a brief period of silence before the kickoff in honor of the77 people who died in @entity2 after a plane crash on sunday
" when these two teams play each other there 's so much rivalry and history , so it 's very difficult to get the players to concentrate and focus on football and it becomes a fighting game , " @entity2 coach @entity70 said in quotes reported by the @entity73 news agency
" i was very happy my players were able to concentrate and could get this very special three points
" @entity85 and the @entity86 earlier kicked off the @entity29 schedule with a 0 - 0 draw at the @entity89 in match between teams ranked 105th and 108th in the world respectively
captain @entity93 missed an eighth - minute penalty for the @entity95 , who qualified for the @entity97 but lost all three matches , after @entity99 fouled @entity101 - based striker @entity100
five football matches that changed the world the @entity109 side , runners - up when hosts in 1996 , went on to dominate the game after @entity93 's spotkick hit the bar but could not beat goalkeeper @entity111
the @entity86 had won their only previous @entity4 encounter in 1992 -- the communist country 's last @entity4 appearance , and second since it began in 1956
" we did n't play well
it was our first match and the players showed about 80 % of their skills , " said @entity85 coach @entity115 , who took over from @entity116 after the @entity34
" after failing the penalty shot , it became psychologically tough for our players as they became nervous
" @entity8 welcomes half the world meanwhile , @entity39 have brought back @entity124 for a fifth stint as national coach ahead of thursday 's second group b clash with @entity128
@entity130 's @entity129 was sacked after the shock 2 - 1 defeat by @entity133 on sunday
@entity129 replaced @entity124 in 2009 when the @entity134 failed to qualify for last year 's @entity34 .
