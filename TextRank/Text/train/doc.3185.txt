-- the mystery of @entity3 's whereabouts deepened friday after the @entity5 leader appeared to have missed a ceremony to pay tribute to his late father and grandfather on what is an important national anniversary
@entity3 's name was absent from the list of attendees at the @entity15 in @entity16 on the 69th anniversary of the @entity18 , issued by state news agency @entity19 on friday
the @entity18 , founded in 1945 , is @entity5 's political party and is considered one of the country 's most crucial institutions alongside the military
according to @entity19 , flowers were presented at the shrine in @entity3 's name , but the most senior official to attend was @entity27 , @entity5 's second most important leader , who recently attended the closing ceremony of the 17th @entity29 in @entity30
@entity3 has n't been seen in public since he reportedly attended a concert with his wife on september 3
it 's his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010 , said @entity37 , a website devoted to analyzing @entity5
analysts are puzzled and speculation is running rampant about why @entity3 has been out of the public eye
state media attempted to explain his absence by saying @entity3 was experiencing " discomfort
" he had been seen hobbling earlier in the summer , prompting theories ranging from weight gain to gout
there have also been questions about the possible meaning behind his absence : is he genuinely sick , or are there machinations within the @entity5 power circle ? is @entity3 's sister in charge ? @entity5 as @entity57 test " whenever someone does n't show up in the public , we tend to speculate something of a power struggle , " said @entity58 , author of " @entity59
" because not much is known about @entity5 's internal politics , observers scrutinize public functions and ceremonies to see who appears and who does not
" we 're always operating on this incomplete info , " said @entity71 , a @entity5 observer who created the website @entity73 , which is critical of the regime
drawing conclusions about what 's happening in @entity5 has been likened to a @entity57 test -- it 's a reflection of the views of whoever is drawing the conclusions , rather than an informed analysis based on facts
and the facts in the reclusive country are murky at best
" people have a tendency to see the things they want to see , " @entity71 said
" we should default to skepticism
" opinion : why @entity3 is probably still in charge @entity30 official : @entity3 probably near hospital @entity30 's defense minister told reporters in @entity97 on friday that he " has reason to believe that @entity3 is probably staying in one of his homes " near an exclusive hospital in @entity5 's capital , @entity16 , with his wife and sister
the facility named by the official , @entity108 hospital , is known to be an exclusive facility catering to high - ranking members of @entity5 's ruling party
it was n't immediately clear why the defense minister said he thought @entity3 was staying near the hospital
@entity116 officials downplay @entity3 's absence senior officials in @entity116 president @entity120 's administration said friday they believe there 's no indication that @entity3 has been sidelined or is in very bad health
while they acknowledge there is little information available , the officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said @entity3 is believed to have non-life - threatening medical problems , citing the limping seen this summer
" he is overweight , smokes and drinks heavily and does n't do any exercise , " one senior @entity116 official said
" he ca n't be in good shape , but there is no indication of serious trouble in terms of health or stability
" with @entity3 out of sight , @entity5 top brass visit @entity30 the sources downplayed @entity3 's absence at friday 's tribute and said there was nothing to substantiate speculation that other members of the regime had marginalized him
" we do n't believe fundamentally there is anything afoot , " a second senior @entity116 official said
" there is nothing affecting our policy choices in any way
" the officials noted that previous @entity5 leaders @entity159 and @entity160 disappeared for long stretches of time , only to re-emerge and cast aside rumors about their leadership
" it 's a dictatorship , " the second @entity116 official said " but it gets them attention and makes the ultimate big reveal that much more newsworthy
" @entity5 's diplomacy efforts with its top leader missing in action , @entity5 has extended its diplomatic efforts with the outside world
one of its officials said the regime was ready to restart the six - party nuclear talks , which include @entity177 , the @entity116 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity30
it has also reached out to the @entity181 and @entity30
high - ranking @entity16 officials visited @entity30 on saturday , but just days later , the two countries were exchanging fire at a disputed maritime demarcation line
@entity186 exchange fire the mixed messages reflect @entity16 's " state of constant and ever - shifting cost - benefit calculation to maximize its national self interests , " said @entity3 , founder of the @entity192
" every move @entity5 makes is a negotiation attempt to see which states will accede and offer something of value in exchange for some level of stability
this has and always will be @entity5 's dominant negotiation strategy
" longest absence @entity3 made only one official appearance in september
this has happened only once before , in september 2010 , and that was the month in which @entity3 made his first official public appearance alongside his father at @entity15 , @entity37 said
before this absence , his longest disappearance from public view as @entity212 was a 24 - day period between june 7 and july 1 , 2012
his second longest absence ever was for 29 days between july 28 and august 27 , 2011 -- while his father was still alive , @entity37 said
@entity3 's sole public appearance in september was at a @entity217 concert at @entity16 's @entity218 , reported by state media on september 4
he was accompanied by his wife , @entity221 , his sister @entity222 and several top officials including @entity27
@entity0 's @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 and journalist @entity230 contributed to this report .
