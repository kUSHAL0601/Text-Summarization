-- after days of pleading with drug company executives , @entity2 's parents got what they 'd been praying for : a chance to get medicine that could help their son survive
the @entity10 pharmaceutical company said tuesday that the ailing 7 - year - old will receive medicine that doctors hope will help him when he becomes the first patient in a new trial set to start wednesday
@entity17 , @entity2 's father , said he got the call from @entity10 president @entity19 about a half hour before the public announcement was made
" it was wonderful , " @entity2 said
" in an emotional @entity25 post , mother @entity23 praised the company 's decision
" glory to @entity29 ! " she wrote
" they are releasing the drug for @entity2 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " the company had previously denied calls from the 7 - year - old 's family to give him the drug , brincidofovir , arguing that spending the time to help @entity2 and others like him would slow down efforts to get the drug on the market
@entity2 's story drew national attention as his parents and supporters pushed the company to change its mind in online and media campaigns
@entity0 told @entity2 's story sunday night , describing his parents ' desperate pleas for help from @entity10
@entity2 's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old
over the years , cancer turned up in his thymus , lung , and bone marrow , and each time @entity2 beat it
but a bone marrow transplant left @entity2 without much of an immune system , and in february doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body
now he 's in critical condition in an intensive care unit as the virus ravages his body
@entity2 is in heart and kidney failure
he vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil
his doctors at @entity74 in @entity75 had also been pushing for the company to provide the drug
in a statement tuesday , the hospital said it expected to receive the medication within 48 hours , but noted that its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established for use in children
" it is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation , " the hospital said
" @entity74 will continue to pursue state - of - the - art treatment for @entity2 and all of our patients
we are grateful for the efforts of @entity10 , the @entity93 and many others who worked to achieve this outcome
we ask that you continue to keep @entity2 and his family in your thoughts
" an @entity93 policy known as " compassionate use " allows someone with a serious or life - threatening disease to ask a drug company for an experimental drug
though it 's called compassionate use , sometimes it feels anything but compassionate
companies often say yes : the @entity93 approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013
but pharmaceutical companies often say no , as @entity10 did at first to @entity2
@entity19 previously told @entity0 he would n't back down from his decision not to give @entity2 the drug
he said tuesday that he hopes the new @entity93 - approved study will help other patients as well
" i 'm happy for @entity2 and i 'm happy for many patients , " @entity19 said
" we 've come up with a way of helping not just @entity2 , but helping other patients in need , and there are many
" over the past two years , the company has received more than 80 requests for compassionate use of brincidofovir from patients like @entity2 , according to @entity19
@entity17 hailed @entity19 as a hero
" he 's a super man
he worked diligently on behalf of everybody , " @entity2 said
" his integrity was unquestioned
" a facebook page dedicated to the online campaign to help @entity2 get the medicine posted a thank - you message to supporters tuesday night
" thank you to every member of @entity136
the world has heard you and because of you @entity2 and many others will have the opportunity to receive @entity140 ( @entity140 ) the life saving antiviral drug made by @entity10
" in cancer drug battle , both sides appeal to ethics @entity0 's @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 contributed to this report .
