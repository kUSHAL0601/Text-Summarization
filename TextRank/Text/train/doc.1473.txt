-- for the first time since his release , @entity2 dissident @entity1 is telling the world about the 10 years he spent behind bars as a critic of the @entity8
the oil magnate , who backed an opposition party , had been in prison since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud
he was due for release next year , but president @entity16 signed an amnesty decree for him friday
in his first television interview , the former @entity19 oil tycoon told @entity0 's @entity21 there were no conditions for his release
" mr. @entity16 , on a number of times , publicly said that he was ready to consider the question of my pardoning -- but i had to say i was guilty for that , " @entity1 said during the interview in @entity25
" that was an unacceptable condition for me
" @entity2 has faced international criticism for its treatment of @entity1 , once @entity2 's richest man
countries such as the @entity36 have accused @entity2 of selective prosecution and abuse of the legal system
@entity1 made a fortune in the years following the collapse of the @entity42 and used the wealth of his @entity19 oil company to enter @entity2 opposition politics
he has said his prosecution was part of a @entity8 campaign to destroy him and take control of the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s
while in prison , @entity1 said , he was stabbed in the face
" when i was stabbed with a knife i was lucky -- he tried to get to my eye but he got my nose , " he said
" as a result , the dentist who was there -- someone who was also a plastic surgeon -- carried out an operation on me , which means it was virtually not noticeable
" @entity16 's decision to pardon @entity1 , who was supposed to be released next august , is seen by many as an effort to improve the country 's image before it hosts the @entity69 in @entity70 in february
officials say @entity1 was released on humanitarian grounds because his mother is ill. when asked whether he forgives @entity16 , the former political rival replied , " i would put it differently , perhaps
i do n't think that revenge would be any rational behavior
and something that is rational behavior i can always deal with
" ' not interested in a fight for power ' speaking at a press conference at the @entity82 on sunday , @entity1 thanked those who stood by him and aided in his release
he said he was still thinking about his future plans
" i do not intend to be involved in political activity
... i intend to be involved in social activities , " he said , adding he also did not intend to go back into business
" i am not interested in a fight for power
" @entity1 said many political prisoners remain behind bars in @entity2 and urged @entity94 politicians to keep that in mind when they meet @entity16
" you should not see me as a symbol that there are no political prisoners left in @entity2 , " @entity1 said
" i am a symbol that the efforts of civil society may lead to the release of people whose release was not expected by anyone
" @entity0 's @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report .
