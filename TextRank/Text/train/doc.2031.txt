-- the world 's population is expected to hit 7 billion around october 31 and one @entity4 demographer says that number would have come a lot sooner had it not been for @entity4 's " one - child policy
" @entity7 , a professor at @entity8 , says but for @entity4 's population policy , the world 's 7 billionth baby would have been born five years earlier
" @entity4 's population would now be around 1.7 billion had it not been for the family planning policy , " said @entity7
" and the world 's population would have hit seven billion in 2006
" @entity4 holds the largest population on earth with 1.34 billion people , but will not for long , as the fertility level has been declining for years
since the @entity4 government adopted its so - called " family planning policy " three decades ago , @entity4 has limited couples to one child , with few exceptions
those who broke the rule were slapped with heavy fines or were forced to abort pregnancies
since 1979 , experts at the @entity29 of @entity4 say , the policy has prevented more than 400 million births in the country
why was the draconian policy necessary ? proponents rationalized it as an emergency measure to curb the large number of births expected from the baby boomers of the 1960s
" it was designed in 1979 to be a temporary one that required the ' sacrifice of two or three generations , ' as they put it then , " says @entity40 , who served as the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) representative and senior adviser on population in @entity4 from 1984 to 1990
" it was meant to be implemented until the annual population growth rate reached replacement levels , or 1.5 children per woman of reproductive age
" the @entity58 demographer says supporters of the policy now cite the double - digit economic growth rate since 1979 as the so - called " demographic dividend
" @entity40 explains : " if population control had not been enforced , @entity4 would most likely be economically and socially worse off today
" the population policy might have also helped girls and women get ahead , as a survey by the @entity68 and the @entity69 found
but the policy has also brought about a list of unintended socio - economic consequences
@entity4 's one - child policy has been blamed for abuses , including female infanticide and forced abortions and sterilizations
@entity4 traditionally prefer boys over girls because they are seen as more able to provide for the family and carry on the family line
as a result , the practice of aborting female fetuses or abandoning infant girls still continues today in rural areas
this remains a sensitive topic in @entity4 , poignantly depicted in @entity90 's " frog , " a novel about a midwife in rural @entity4 and her experiences with forced abortions and sterilizations
@entity95 recently won @entity4 's prestigious @entity97 literary award -- a potential indication that @entity4 has become more open to talking about the issue
@entity4 is now facing a lopsided sex ratio in infants and young children
according to the @entity104 , for every 100 @entity4 girls born , there are about 123 boys
the global norm is about 100 to 103 - 106
at that rate , @entity4 is likely to have some 30 million unmarried men by 2020
the unusually rapid decline in fertility has also produced a rapidly aging population
two decades ago , demographers say , the share of @entity4 's population aged 60 and above was only 7.6 %
that has risen to 10.5 % , according to @entity4 's 2000 census , and has now reached around 12 % , or 167 million
by 2025 , demographers predict , one in five @entity4 who live in urban areas will be 60 or older
by 2050 , there would be only 1.6 working - age adults for every person aged 60 and above
that means a heavy dependency ratio
in 10 years , the 20 - 24 age population is expected to comprise of only half of today 's 124 million
experts say this could cripple the health care and social insurance system with fewer young people taking care of the aging population
if the government does not change its policies , experts say , @entity4 's population could become old before it becomes rich
the high cost of the one - child policy is felt deeply by @entity142 resident @entity141 , an only - child daughter of a college professor and shopping mall manager
@entity141 , 22 , says she was blessed with all the attention and resources showered at her from childhood
still , she says , she had a mostly lonely childhood
" i used to cut myself on my wrist after being yelled at by my mom and dad because i did n't know who i should talk to or turn to , " she says
" i was like that for almost two years , but i am very tough so i made it through
" " i hate to say it but the one - child policy should partly be blamed for some social issues of youth today , " she adds
" it 's been a ridiculous government interference on family issues
" she wished she had a brother or a sister to share all the attention
" i am the only one there , so all their energy goes to me , " she says
" they care of no one else but me , and live vicariously through me , because they can count on no one else
parents ' love could multiply if there are more kids in the family , but if you are the only one , you get only one piece of cake , not a whole bakery
" @entity58 demographer @entity40 says the @entity4 authorities are aware of these unintended consequences of their population policies and are committed to dealing with the situation
" it is anticipated that @entity4 's strict population control program will most likely be relaxed as the objective situation changes , " he said
for @entity141 's parents , however , such a relaxation of policy may come too late
" my parents have often expressed regret , " she says
" they said they should have had another kid regardless of how much the [ government ] fined back then
