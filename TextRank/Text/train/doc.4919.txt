-- fifty years ago @entity1 was the " @entity2 , " a newly independent republic with a thriving economy , a functioning democracy and splendid national parks
it was the place to take a safari holiday -- floating down the crocodile - flanked @entity9 , fishing on @entity12 , wandering among the elephant herds of @entity14 or listening to the roar of mighty @entity16
with films like " @entity18 " shot on location there , @entity1 was also a @entity22 darling
then all hell broke loose
four decades of violence , political turmoil and economic collapse that started with the bloodthirsty reign of @entity29 ( the self - proclaimed @entity30 , @entity31 of the @entity32 and @entity33 ) and ended with the religious psychopath @entity35 and his @entity36
and it was n't just the people who suffered : @entity1 's animal populations declined precipitously during the troubles as the various ragtag guerrilla groups feasted on wild game
yet @entity1 is bouncing back
having banished the last of the warlords and kick started its economy , the country is drawing tourists again , a rising star in the safari world
it 's a trickle at present -- the high - end travelers and backpackers who are always the early adopters -- and there are very real concerns about the country 's recently imposed anti-gay laws , which threaten life imprisonment for " violators
" but safari operators say they 're already gearing up for more visitors in years to come
according to the tourist board , almost 1.2 million tourists came to @entity1 last year [ 2013 ] , an increase of 50 % over five years
" @entity1 sadly underwent much turmoil and upheaval from the 1970s onwards , " says @entity64 , director of the @entity65 , which includes @entity66 and several of the nation 's top wildlife lodges
expelled from the country as a child during @entity29 's purge of @entity75 - @entity74 , @entity64 and his family had to rebuild their business from the ground up when they returned in the 1980s
" we have had peace and stability for over a decade and the country has indeed emerged from this past void in terms of tourism to become an interesting and discerning destination
" the offering compared to the neighboring countries is unique , individual and nebulous -- and that in itself is perhaps part of the explanation of the recent increasing interest
" incredible variety what @entity1 lacks in volume ( it 's about the same size as @entity98 or @entity99 ) it more than makes up with variety , an incredible array of landscapes that range from the snowcapped @entity103 and the @entity104 to the semi-desert northeast and water - spangled lake district
with more than 1.6 million people , @entity107 is one of the fastest growing cities on the continent
nearby @entity112 , set on a peninsula stretching into @entity12 , is about as laid back as it gets in @entity115
despite 40 years as a food source for rebel groups , @entity1 's wildlife has made a miraculous recovery
@entity14 nurtures healthy populations of elephant , lion , hippo and other large mammals , and is a major stop on the migratory bird route up the @entity127
home to 13 different primate species , @entity128 is one of the best places in @entity115 to see chimpanzees in the wild
@entity134 is flush with hippo , crocodile and other animals that live in or near the water
the holy grail of @entity1 wildlife watching is @entity141 , where roughly half of the world 's mountain gorillas reside
living up to its " impenetrable " tag , the forest can only be accessed on foot , often up and over steep mountain ranges
" @entity104 's gorilla population is around 400 and growing , " says dr @entity149 , founder of @entity150 , which promotes the coexistence of gorillas , humans and other wildlife in @entity115
" this is thanks to increased protection , the elimination of almost all poaching and the fact that we have been able to show local communities how saving the gorillas is beneficial to local health and the local economy
" get intimate with gorillas @entity66 and other outfitters have pioneered a number of " up close and personal " animal encounters during which visitors can tag along on scientific field trips or accompany experts into the bush
dr @entity149 , for instance , leads a four - day " intimate gorilla experience " that includes finding gorilla nests , collecting their dung and then analyzing that dung in a field laboratory
in @entity14 , tourists can spend the day tracking lions with a researcher from the @entity184 , learning how telemetry works and venturing off road into parts of the park vehicles are normally verboten
@entity1 has its own attractions
@entity112 is renowned for its popular weekend beach clubs , like a little slice of the @entity192 on the shores of @entity12
@entity107 's sights range from the recently rebuilt royal tombs to a humungous mosque built by @entity198 strongman @entity197 and the ghoulish torture chamber of @entity29 on the grounds of @entity201
the capital is also known for its vibrant nightlife , which runs a gamut from down and dirty dance clubs to sophisticated jazz venues
@entity1 has also become an adventure sports hub
several outfitters offer whitewater rafting and kayaking trips down the @entity9 , past snoozing crocodiles and snorting hippos
@entity214 in @entity215 offers an adrenalin - packed plunge ( 44 meters ) into the world 's longest river
you can also board surf down rapids , whoosh down rivers on jetboats and organize sports fishing trips to catch the river monster of @entity115 -- nile perch that can grow up to 200 kilograms
investment opportunities investment in @entity1 has soared in recent years
last year , the country rose into the ranks of the top 10 african nations for foreign direct investment
@entity231 is one of the largest sources of new investment
@entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 are other leading investors , and through its recent purchase of @entity242 , the @entity240 - based @entity239 now has prime hotel properties in @entity107 and @entity112
travel infrastructure has also improved markedly
as late as 2006 , there were no international airlines serving @entity247 , the nation 's aviation gateway
now the lakeside terminal hosts 17 international carriers , including direct flights from @entity253 on @entity254 , @entity255 on @entity256 and @entity257 on @entity258
passenger traffic through @entity112 is increasing at an average of more than 10 % per annum
@entity1 is n't quite back to being the " @entity2 " but it 's definitely headed in the right direction
" @entity1 lost a whole generation of tourism talent and workers during the civil wars , " says @entity262 , who took over a ceo of @entity264 earlier this year [ 2014 ]
" that mayhem cost us everything in terms of human capital
but we are a resilient people
we have suffered and we are now back on our feet
" @entity262 feels the public and private sectors need to join forces in developing skilled workers in the tourism sector
and he says that @entity1 needs to think outside the box when it comes to creating new experiences and attractions
among his ideas are island resorts and sailing regattas on @entity12 , encouraging domestic tourism so that @entity74 discover their own country , and promoting @entity107 with its myriad music clubs as the nightlife capital of @entity291
there are also socio - political challenges to overcome
foremost is a series of laws banning homosexual behavior
rubber stamped by the @entity74 @entity300 last december , the latest regulation calls for severe punishment ( including life in prison ) for violators
virgin boss @entity305 is among those who have called for a travel boycott of @entity1 in the wake of the new legislation
and in june [ 2014 ] , the @entity240 government announced limited sanctions against @entity1 because of the law
the jury is still out on whether or not the anti-homosexuality laws are actively impacting lgbt rights in @entity1
" it certainly has n't affected me , " says a @entity107 businessman who lives with his gay partner
" and i do n't think it 's had much impact on the gay community as a whole
" he still admits to anxiety about how the laws might be applied in future
" but for now , that 's been my experience in @entity1
" @entity328 is a freelance travel , business and entertainment writer based out of @entity332
he traveled through @entity115 in 2013 .
