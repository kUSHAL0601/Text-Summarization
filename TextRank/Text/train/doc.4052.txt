@entity0 -- @entity3 's president @entity2 announced his resignation friday following a series of scandals that prompted calls for him to step down
the @entity3 presidency is a largely ceremonial office , but @entity2 's resignation is seen as a blow to chancellor @entity12 , who supported his candidacy as president
however , it is unlikely to impact @entity3 's handling of the eurozone debt crisis , @entity18 , a senior economist at @entity20 , told @entity1
in a brief televised statement , @entity12 said she accepted @entity2 's resignation with the " utmost respect and deepest personal regret
" @entity2 had put the interests of the general public to the fore in deciding to resign , @entity12 said
in a separate televised statement , @entity2 said @entity3 " needs a president who can devote himself completely to national and international challenges " -- and one who commands the trust of a wide majority of citizens
" the developments of the past days and weeks have shown that this trust and therefore confidence in my ability to serve have been adversely affected , " he said
" for this reason , it is no longer possible for me to continue in my role as president
" the scandal involves alleged political favors and financial impropriety while he was state premier of @entity46
the @entity48 prosecutor 's office called thursday for the government to waive the president 's immunity from prosecution , in light of the evidence it had gathered
" following extensive analyses of new documents and the evaluation of further media reports , the @entity58 now has sufficient factual evidence and therefore grounds for initial suspicion of receiving bribes or being granted advantages , " it said in a statement
" ( @entity68 ) therefore proposes to the president of the @entity3 @entity70 that immunity for the federal president be waived
" the @entity48 prosecutors are investigating @entity74 , a @entity3 film producer , alongside @entity2
at the center of the issue is a story -- first reported on by the @entity3 tabloid @entity78 in mid-december last year -- that @entity2 received a low interest , â ‚ ¬ 500,000 ( $ 649,000 ) private loan from the wife of a wealthy friend while still governor of @entity46
this was followed by intense criticism when it emerged that @entity2 had attempted to prevent the paper from publishing the story
trying to put a lid on any negative media coverage , @entity2 left an angry message on the answering machine of @entity78 's editor - in - chief @entity93 before it reported on the loan
although @entity2 eventually apologized to @entity93 , the former president has always maintained that he did nothing wrong throughout the course of the scandals -- something he reiterated during his resignation speech
" i have always behaved legally correctly in the offices i held , " he said
" i have made mistakes , but i was always honest
" @entity12 said @entity2 's presidency would be remembered for his efforts to promote a modern , tolerant @entity3
she added : " with his resignation , president @entity2 reiterated his conviction that he always behaved legally correctly in office and in service to the people of our country
i express my utmost respect for this position
" the members of her governing coalition would now discuss who should stand for election in his place , she said , in consultation with other political parties
@entity12 had been due to meet @entity123 prime minister @entity122 in @entity124 to discuss the eurozone crisis but canceled the trip amid the political storm over @entity2 , who belongs to her party
however , @entity18 said that @entity2 's resignation should not have any direct impact on @entity3 's handling of the eurozone crisis in the short term , given his almost entirely ceremonial role
" even if it is the highest official office in @entity3 , he has no say at all in the government 's policy toward the crisis , " @entity18 said
however , in the medium term the @entity2 affair could weaken @entity12 's position in domestic politics , he said , which could affect her ability to win parliamentary votes on the eurozone 's bailout fund , the @entity148 , and a second bailout package for @entity150
@entity12 has not had involvement in any of the scandals
but @entity2 's departure comes within two years of the resignation of his predecessor , @entity155 , who was also backed by @entity12 -- raises a question mark over her judgment , @entity18 added
@entity12 's decision to liaise with the @entity159 and the @entity160 on finding a replacement for @entity2 is a break from her earlier stance in 2010 , when she insisted on @entity2 as successor to @entity155 , who resigned following controversial comments in which he suggested military deployments were vital to @entity3 's economic success
the chairman of the @entity159 ( @entity169 ) , @entity168 , said @entity2 's decision had been long overdue
" @entity3 needs a new beginning , " he said
" i 'm assuming that the leaders of the @entity173 and federal chancellor @entity12 wo n't for the third time be selecting a new candidate with purely partisan motives
they have to include all political parties in their discussions to find a consensus candidate
" the @entity160 ' parliamentary leaders , @entity182 and @entity183 , said they were " relieved that @entity2 has finally unburdened the country from agonizing debate with his resignation
" @entity2 , who was the state premier of @entity46 for seven years , was one of @entity12 's biggest rivals within the @entity189 before being elected to the presidency in 2010
it took three rounds of voting in the @entity194 , or @entity3 parliament , before he won enough backing from lawmakers to assume the role
@entity3 presidents are elected by the @entity200 , comprised of parliament members
@entity2 was born in @entity202 , @entity46 , in june 1959 and went on to become a lawyer , according to the official website of the presidency
he first entered local politics as a member of the @entity173 party in 1986 and was elected to @entity46 's parliament in 1994
he was chosen as state premiere by lawmakers in his party following elections in 2003
he was the 10th president to serve in the @entity3
he has been married twice and has two children of his own and a stepson
@entity1 's @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .
