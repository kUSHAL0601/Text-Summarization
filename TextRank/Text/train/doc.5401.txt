@entity1 and @entity2 safety officials asked regulators on thursday for new rules to prevent rail accidents like the one that decimated the @entity9 town of @entity10 last july
the @entity11 and the @entity12 say the growing use of trains to ship highly volatile crude oil is endangering communities in both countries
" the large - scale shipment of crude oil by rail simply did n't exist 10 years ago , and our safety regulations need to catch up with this new reality , " @entity11 chairman @entity18 said in a statement
" while this energy boom is good for business , the people and the environment along rail corridors must be protected from harm
" forty - seven @entity10 residents died and the town 's center destroyed when an unattended train hauling oil descended down a grade , derailed , and erupted in fire
the @entity1 and @entity2 safety agencies that investigate accidents issued an unprecedented joint recommendation calling for a series of new rules
crude oil shipment by rail has increased over 400 % since 2005 , the @entity11 said , citing figures from the @entity44
the growth has been spurred by increased drilling in the @entity48 region of @entity49 , @entity50 and adjoining provinces in @entity2
@entity2 safety officials still have not ruled on the cause of the @entity54
but they have said the highly volatile oil in tanker cars was improperly described in shipping documents as a less flammable substance
the petroleum cruel oil was a hazardous " @entity62 , @entity63 " product , but was shipped as a " @entity63 " product , investigators said
the misidentification explains in part why the fuel ignited so quickly after the derailment , authorities said
but investigators have not said whether the shipping error was intentional or inadvertent , and suggested it was unlikely the error made a difference since both types of fuel -- @entity76 -- are shipped in the same class 111 tank cars
following the @entity10 catastrophe , the @entity78 and the @entity79 issued a safety advisory and announced an operation to conduct unannounced inspections and testing of crude oil that shipped by rail
but the @entity11 said it " remains concerned the practice of mischaracterizing the packing groups of crude oil shipments may allow shippers to avoid " security requirements
the @entity11 is recommending that rail and hazardous materials safety agencies require expanded planning for railroads to avoid populated areas when shipping petroleum products when possible
it is also wants an audit program to ensure railroads have adequate capabilities to respond to " worst - case discharges " of products carried on a train
and it asks the government to audit shippers and railroads to ensure they are properly classifying hazardous materials and have adequate safety and security plans in place
the @entity11 and its @entity2 counterpart issued the safety recommendations jointly because railroad companies routinely operate crude oil unit trains in both countries and across the border .
