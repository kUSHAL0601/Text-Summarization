-- rocker @entity1 found himself being investigated by the @entity2 after making this statement last weekend at the @entity4 : " if @entity5 becomes the president in november , i will either be dead or in jail by this time next year
" while i dismissed @entity1 's comments as just another idiotic statement by the person known as " the @entity1 , " others thought @entity1 may have violated the federal law that makes it a crime to threaten the president of the @entity17
@entity0 contributor @entity18 even wrote an article entitled " @entity1 should be in jail , " calling for the arrest of @entity1
however , @entity18 recognized that under the law as it stands , @entity1 would not , in fact , be imprisoned for the comment at issue
threats against the president of the @entity17 should not be tolerated , regardless of the president 's political affiliation
but while viscerally i may agree with those calling for @entity1 's arrest , they are absolutely and unequivocally wrong
( in full disclosure , i must reveal that i do have @entity1 's classic hit " @entity34 " in my @entity35 , but i still feel i can be objective in this matter
) @entity1 should not be prosecuted for two equally important reasons : he did not break the law , and we must be vigilant in protecting freedom of expression when it involves political subject matter
from a legal point of view , @entity1 's statement did not violate the controlling federal statute which provides that it 's a crime to make : " any threat to take the life of , to kidnap , or to inflict bodily harm upon the @entity50
" to violate this statute , a person must make a " true threat " as defined by the federal courts
however , @entity1 's words were ambiguous and did not objectively indicate a threat against the president
there 's little doubt @entity1 's statement would be considered by the courts as nothing more than " political hyperbole , " not a crime
furthermore , when considering this federal statute , our courts have been more protective of statements made at a political rally
@entity1 's comment was made at a political event -- the @entity4 convention , which parenthetically i must note was held in @entity73 , the city with the second highest rate of teens being killed by guns
the @entity2 met with @entity1 on thursday before his concert in @entity79 , and based on their discussions came to the same conclusion
they did not arrest him and announced the matter was resolved
after the meeting , @entity1 even praised the @entity2 agents with his statement : " @entity86 bless the good federal agents wherever they may be
" ( although if you think about his statement -- " wherever they may be " - he may have actually been mocking the agents he had just met
) in any event , @entity1 was free to play his concert that night and treat the audience to his greatest hit -- or maybe he has two -- i 'm only aware of the one song in my @entity35
not only was the @entity2 's decision legally sound , it was also absolutely needed to ensure we have open and candid discussion about our elected officials , even when the comments are as asinine as @entity1 's
our courts have uniformly held that no form of speech is entitled to greater constitutional protection than political speech
the @entity17 @entity106 offered these instructive words in 1969 , which courts have been employing ever since : " debate on public issues should be uninhibited , robust , and wide - open , and that it may well include vehement , caustic , and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials
" while the words @entity1 used regrettably contribute to the growing lack of civility in @entity17 political discourse , it was still political speech
it is for the good of our democracy that the @entity122 of the world -- and i truly hope there is only one -- can make even ugly and caustic statements about the president without fear of imprisonment
anything else could lead to a chilling effect on free expression which we can not and should not allow
( editor 's note : an earlier version of this article contained a statistic which the @entity2 has denied : a statement that threats against president @entity5 have jumped 400 % from those made against president @entity143
@entity144 said that is not correct
) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .
