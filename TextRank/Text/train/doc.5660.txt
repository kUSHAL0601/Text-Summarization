-- the @entity1 was falling apart
more specifically , says guitarist @entity2 , the band 's original master tapes were falling apart
" a bit like nitrate film , " he says in a phone interview from @entity6
except , instead of burning up , the oxide layers to such records as " @entity11 , " " @entity12 " and " @entity13 " were disintegrating
to save them and make proper digital masters , the tapes had to be baked in an industrial oven and transferred to other media
" it has been a bit of a restoration , " says @entity2
" i do n't think it was a moment too soon , because the tapes were rotting -- mold in the boxes and stuff
" but the ultimate result was worth it : spanking - new releases of the band 's catalog in a new boxed set called " @entity32
" the collection , which is shaped like a boombox , contains newly remastered versions of the group 's five official albums , as well as three cds of demos and singles , a dvd of video footage , a new edition of the " @entity44 " fanzine , and even some buttons for that classic 1979 look ( denim jacket not included )
the box will be released tuesday along with a 2 - cd best - of called " @entity50
" the band , of course , broke up long ago -- 1985 , two years after @entity2 was fired
though relations were soon repaired , there was never a reunion
@entity58 and lyricist @entity57 died in 2002
a year later the group was inducted into the @entity60
their legacy is indisputable -- and not just in the punk movement
indeed , calling the @entity1 a " punk band " is like calling the @entity65 a " merseybeat combo
" their music included dollops of rockabilly , reggae , country , rap , soul and jazz , a true mix of styles that made for some of the most exciting records and live shows of the rock ' n ' roll era
the boombox , says bassist @entity82 , symbolizes the way the four would share music and ideas
" when we would go out on tour , each member of the band had one of these boomboxes , so in a hotel room or backstage or on some street corner we could play music , " he recalls
" everybody was playing something
" @entity2 and @entity82 talked about the @entity1 's career in separate interviews with @entity0
the following has been edited and condensed
on their influences : @entity2 : the @entity105 groups over here -- the @entity65 , the @entity107 , the @entity108 , the who and the @entity110
i was lucky enough to grow up at the time when they were doing their most fantastic music
when you do music yourself , it 's interesting -- it 's like a two - way highway
you go back and find out what influenced the people you liked , so you 're going backwards , at the same time you 're in the present trying to do something
it led us back to so many @entity128 artists -- blues , soul and rock and roll
@entity82 : reggae and rockabilly
and mostly reggae , because that 's what i grew up on , and that 's the only music that seemed to me at that time that had something to say for itself
whereas @entity142 , progressive rock , it did n't speak to me
i could n't relate to it
on being labeled as a punk band : @entity82 : i do n't care about it
people are going to say what they want to say anyway
some people are going to say , ' they 're rubbish
' i do n't really care , because i know in my mind what we were
we initially started out as a punk band , but we evolved
we evolved into quite a magnificent rock and roll band , i daresay
@entity2 : we ca n't really deny that 's where we come from , but we always hoped to be more
a lot of our contemporaries , if they did make more than one record , they made the same record
and of the people i liked , i was really looking forward to their new record coming out , because i knew they were doing something different
i knew they were n't going to do the same thing every time
that was like a given with us
that was only natural -- i always knew we were never going to make the same record twice
on their fashion choices : @entity82 : that was my department , really
if you go see a band and they look amazing , you get really inspired
but if the band looks not very well - dressed , it 's hard to get inspired by the music
as our manager said , if somebody goes to see a band , and the audience is better dressed than the band , then why should the audience listen to what the band have to say ? there 's a like - minded thought process going on at this time anyway
we do n't want flares , we want straight - leg trousers
the whole world 's got flares
and everybody 's got long hair -- ( so ) we want short hair
it was very tribal , too
you had the mods , you had the rockers , you had skinheads , you had hippies , people were very defined by how they looked , and it reflected the music they liked , too
on " the only band that matters " : @entity2 : the record company came up with that ; it was n't us
we were n't like trying to blow our own trumpets
it was kind of a moniker and it stuck
every group wants to be the best group when you 're young
on becoming stars : @entity2 : i remember once , i was talking to @entity220 ( at a stadium show )
i said i know what " quadrophenia " means now , because if you look in one direction , you 're ignoring 50,000 people ! he just looked at me like i was mad
it was a big thing , but we had something we wanted to say , so it was interesting to see how we 'd get on in that environment
@entity82 : in the early days when we first started out in a hotel room , it was n't a great hotel room , but the hotel was better than where i lived
then as the journey continues you get more successful , suddenly the hotel rooms have one big bed in it rather than two narrow beds that you have to share
so it 's a gradual thing
when you do get to the point where you 're in the lap of luxury , it 's easy to lose contact with yourself and where you 're from
in some ways it 's not a bad thing that the @entity1 split up when they did , because we would have become " the only band that mattered " and very pompous
so maybe in some ways cutting your own throat was a good idea at the time
who knows what sort of people we would be now ? on writing songs with @entity57 : @entity2 : it started off as , " we need another song
" " ok , give us five minutes , " and we 'd go upstairs to rehearsals and bang something out
at the other end of the scale would be , i do n't want to see him , just post the lyrics through the post box
( sometimes ) he would sit at the typewriter and bang it out like a guy who worked at the newspaper , and he 'd pull it out of the typewriter and hand it across the table
it was always pretty quick
it usually comes naturally , especially with @entity57 's lyrics
even the tune was there sometimes
it was the words , really , and the music was kind of a vehicle for those words
on feeling @entity57 's presence while preparing " sound system : " @entity2 : yeah , it 's impossible not to
( because ) it was his words that carried the whole thing , or was the most important thing to it , i like to think he was with us
he 's definitely with us through his music , and somehow with us in spirit , as well
( sounds a little choked up ) i feel that , anyway
@entity82 : no. the reason i say that , is because it 's like each person in the band was an individual
we spent seven intense years working together , so you get a pretty good idea of how each other is
getting along : @entity2 : we became friends very soon after , that was the main thing
i 've had a great time these last couple years while we 've been putting this box together
it 's been wonderful to spend time with the guys , and have complete creative control over all our work
@entity82 : i see @entity2 and we do things
we went to a play once ( in which ) they wanted to use the song " @entity332
" they invited us to the play
what they did n't realize was that back when the record was being recorded me and @entity2 had like a two - hour argument in the studio about the bass sound
i said it needed to be not louder , but a bit deeper
so we went to see this play
and i heard the song being played back , and it sounded really tinny
and i turned to @entity2 and said , " i told you i was right ! " there 's no antagonism anymore
we 're sort of grown up now
we know that we were really fortunate to be working together at the time that we did .
