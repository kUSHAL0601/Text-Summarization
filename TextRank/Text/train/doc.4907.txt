-- sen. @entity1 said monday she had to hold her tongue when a male labor leader made comments about her post-pregnancy weight shortly after she began her career in @entity7
" i 've just had a baby , i 've just been appointed [ to the @entity12 ] , i have a lot to learn , so much on my plate , and this man basically says to me , ' you 're too fat to be elected statewide , ' " she said on @entity8 , a webcast
she did not name the labor leader
" at that moment , if i could have just disappeared , i would have , " she continued
" if i could have just melted in tears , i would have
but i had to just sit there and talk to him
i switched the subject ... i did n't hear a word he said , but i was n't in a place where i could tell him to go f * * * himself
" while promoting her book , " off the @entity32 , " the @entity26 senator from @entity27 has been vocal lately about remarks she and other women hear about their physical appearances
" a statement about a woman 's looks -- positive or negative -- can be very undermining to her credibility , " @entity1 said monday
" i want women to make their own judgments
" she has faced some criticism in recent weeks for not naming the individuals who have made such comments , as some of them have come from colleagues on @entity45 , she has said
" it 's not about any one insult or any one person , because that 's not why i shared the details
i specifically shared them because i want to talk about these broader challenges , " she said
" this happens to women all the time in every industry every day
" opinion : @entity1 's good call on ' fat ' comments
