@entity0 -- a @entity0 graffiti art exhibit that drew visitors throughout the world was painted over early tuesday morning despite efforts by artists and fans to keep the popular outdoor attraction open
the whitewashing of the renowned graffiti haven known as @entity11 , a hulking warehouse in the @entity13 section of @entity14 , appears to mark the end of legal efforts by supporters to save it and even a last - minute attempt to secure landmark status for the building
a federal judge last week denied an injunction to stop the razing of the building by developers @entity26 and @entity28 , the warehouse owners , who plan to transform the site into high - end condos
" i 've been learning a lot in this whole battle , " @entity33 , aka " @entity34 , " the 5 @entity11 art curator , told @entity1 affiliate @entity35
he added , " i guess i have a little less faith in the system
" @entity40 told @entity1 that he decided to paint over the walls now because the building will take several months to tear down , and he did n't want the artists ' work to be ruined in the process
" i had tears in my eyes this morning when we painted over it , " @entity28 said
" i have nothing but admiration for the work they 've done
" graffiti artists turn abandoned luxury liner into giant canvas @entity28 said the new buildings will have a " 60 - foot high wall " for the artists to paint on
he anticipates beginning the demolition in early 2014
the 5 @entity61 is a massive canvass where " aerosol artists from around the globe paint colorful pieces on the walls of a 200,000 - square - foot factory building , " according to its website
the exhibit has been featured in several music videos and documentaries
@ @entity74 , the official @entity73 handle for the exhibit , sent this out tuesday : " 5 @entity11 is gone , painted white overnight by the owner ... with police protection
" the exteriors walls of the warehouse chronicled decades of @entity0 graffiti art. @entity83 bids farewell to @entity0
