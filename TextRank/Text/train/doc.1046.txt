" @entity19 " and " @entity20 " wrote in to say both countries are large financial centers , while @entity13 from @entity14 got in touch via @entity16 to say that both countries have free trade economic areas
@entity2 's @entity21 explored these business connections with @entity6 's vice minister of foreign trade , @entity23 and @entity24 from the @entity7 's @entity25
@entity21 also spoke with @entity26 , @entity27 's travel editor this week to find out what connections he could find between the two
he plumped for a bird connection as both countries feature one on their national flags - the @entity7 has a falcon
@entity6 , a harpy eagle
" @entity39 , " " @entity40 " contacted @entity2 via the blog and @entity35 from @entity36 sent in an @entity16 to say that both countries are transport hubs
@entity6 's famous canal links the @entity43 and @entity42 and the @entity7 is home to the @entity44 -- the biggest in the @entity45 and the largest man - made harbor in the world
@entity49 is well known for its audacious building program , building a new skyline almost from scratch
but @entity3 viewer @entity53 , who lives in @entity49 , says that @entity6 also has many construction projects underway
two buildings in particular share an uncanny resemblance as @entity6 viewer , @entity55 pointed out

we also spoke to the young @entity63 fashion designer @entity71 , whose designs draw from his upbringing in the @entity45
