-- @entity1 scored the winner in a dramatic penalty shoot out as @entity4 beat @entity5 on saturday to win the @entity6 for the first time
the @entity9 striker coolly slotted home his kick to spark frenzied celebrations among his teammates and the @entity4 fans in @entity5 's @entity14
@entity15 had saved @entity17 's first penalty for @entity4 to give @entity5 the early advantage in the shootout , but @entity20 saved a weak @entity22 effort before @entity23 saw his penalty hit the post
the match had finished 1 - 1 after extra time , with @entity28 putting @entity5 ahead in the 83rd minute before @entity1 dramatically leveled with two minutes remaining
@entity29 then missed a penalty in the first half of extra time , setting up the dramatic shootout finale where the home side fluffed their lines to leave the @entity36 fans stunned
@entity4 's victory capped a remarkable spell for @entity39 since taking over as interim manager after the sacking of @entity42
abramovich triumphant he has led the west @entity45 side to the @entity46 and finally fulfilled the ambitions of the club 's @entity49 owner @entity48 in lifting @entity52 's top club prize
@entity48 has ploughed an estimated $ 1 billion into buying the players to turn @entity4 into a @entity55 power since buying the club in 2003 and gone through eight managers in that time , but the closest he had come to the @entity6 was a penalty shoot out loss to @entity60 in 2008
in the end , it was temporary option @entity39 who delivered the famous trophy , and despite also guiding the team to @entity46 glory , the @entity67 coach must wait to find out if he will be appointed on a permanent basis
@entity71 , suspended for the final after being sent off in the semifinal win over @entity74 , changed into his kit after the final whistle and collected the trophy from @entity52 president @entity78 with @entity79 , who was captain on the night
@entity79 paid tribute to @entity1 , whose goal rescued them in normal time before he applied the finishing touches to their triumph
" i ca n't believe it
the determination we 've shown ... we did n't play fantastic but the main man @entity90 dug us out of trouble there , " he told @entity87
" he 's a hero
without him we 're not here
he scores the goals in the big games
" that could be the @entity9 's last big goal for the club though
@entity1 , an early arrival under @entity48 's ownership for Â £ 24 million ( $ 38 million ) , is out of contract this summer and rumored to be considering a move to @entity103 club
threatening @entity5 playing in front of a crowd of 66,000 , @entity5 had always been the more threatening side throughout the match without carving out a string of clear cut chances
their best opportunities in the first half saw a shot from @entity29 deflected on to his own woodwork by @entity20 while @entity5 's top scorer @entity114 fired over just before the interval
@entity117 's effort , pushed aside by @entity15 , was the sole @entity4 effort of note
the second half followed the same pattern and just after the break @entity5 had the ball in the net through @entity124 , but it was ruled out for offside
fans v @entity127 : battle for @entity129 's soul @entity5 's pressure finally paid off with seven minutes to go as @entity131 crossed for @entity133 international midfielder @entity28 to head past @entity20
it looked all over for @entity4 but their never say die attitude , so evident in the semifinal win over @entity74 , came to the fore again
winning their first corner with only two minutes of normal time remaining , @entity17 's perfect delivery was met by @entity1 to head home at the near post
it was his 34th goal in the @entity6 and surely never more crucial
dramatic twist into extra time and another dramatic twist as goal hero @entity1 tripped @entity124 to concede a penalty , injuring the @entity150 international who played no further part in the final
@entity29 , playing against his old club , stepped up after a considerable delay and his weak effort was saved by @entity20
@entity124 's replacement @entity22 wasted another glorious opportunity in the second half of extra time , caught in two minds after a @entity162 cross
it summed up a frustrating night for @entity5 and their coach @entity164 , who said they paid for their failure to kill off @entity4
" we missed too many chances , " @entity164 told @entity166
" we played well overall and had the majority of possession
" but we did n't know how to exploit our many opportunities and you have to use them or you will be punished
" @entity5 had been bidding to win the @entity6 for the fifth time .
