@entity0 -- @entity3 officials said thursday evening they have " specific , credible but unconfirmed " information about a potential threat against the @entity3 coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks
" we have received credible information very recently about a possible plot directed at the homeland that seems to be focused on @entity14 and @entity0 , " a senior administration official told @entity1 @entity10 correspondent @entity9
the official said the plot was believed to involve three individuals , including a @entity3 citizen
@entity3 officials believed the threat was a vehicle laden with explosives , but " the intelligence picture is not completely formed , " the official said
" not enough is known about the potential operatives and their plotting
" the threat is believed to entail a vehicle bomb , but " we can not rule out other means , " a @entity3 official said
a senior law enforcement official involved in briefings about the matter told @entity1 justice department producer @entity32 that his best information is that the three individuals had not yet entered the @entity3
the information came in around noon wednesday , one official said
a senior federal law enforcement official intimately involved in counterterrorism efforts told @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity39 authorities " are n't sure if this is or real or just chatter
" the official confirmed the threat was vehicle - related
@entity14 mayor @entity45 told reporters thursday night that while additional police will be deployed around the city , " there 's no reason for any of the rest of us to change ... our daily routines
" gov. @entity54 urged residents to be cautious , but said " there is no reason to panic
" in @entity0 , local officials said the city has a robust plan in place and has been on heightened alert since september 1
" i want to urge all of our citizens ... to remain calm and let our law enforcement professionals do their job
at the same time , we ask people to remain vigilant , " mayor @entity68 said
" if you see something , say something
" unattended vehicles around key infrastructure will be towed , @entity0 metropolitan police chief @entity73 said
federal officials said they were taking the threat seriously , while evidently trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace during key events
" it 's accurate that there is specific , credible but unconfirmed threat information , " said @entity81 , spokesman for the @entity82
" as we always do before important dates like the anniversary of 9/11 , we will undoubtedly get more reporting in the coming days
sometimes this reporting is credible and warrants intense focus , other times it lacks credibility and is highly unlikely to be reflective of real plots under way
" regardless , we take all threat reporting seriously , and we have taken , and will continue to take , all steps necessary to mitigate any threats that arise
we continue to ask the @entity3 people to remain vigilant as we head into the weekend , " @entity81 said in a prepared statement
a @entity82 official , speaking on background , said , " we will continue to respond appropriately to protect the @entity3 people from an evolving threat picture in the coming days and beyond
this may include an increased law enforcement presence at airports and other transit hubs , land and sea ports of entry , federal buildings , and other high - profile and critical infrastructure locations
" the information originated from the tribal border area of @entity117 and @entity118 , a federal official told @entity1 producer @entity119
another source gave @entity1 conflicting information about possible details of the threat
rep. @entity124 , @entity125 - @entity14 , chairman of the @entity126 , said very specific details were made known to lawmakers about the threat
" many agencies are looking at this from every possible angle , " he said
but it is not known yet if the threat is real , he said , adding , " i would tell people now to go about their lives
there 's no need to panic
" a senior administration official with firsthand knowledge told @entity1 national security contributor @entity139 that although there is " specific , credible but unconfirmed threat information , " there are a lot of questions about this information -- " weird things
" a federal law enforcement official told @entity1 national correspondent @entity149 that the threat appears to go beyond intelligence gathered from @entity153 's compound after he was killed by @entity154
that information talked about aspirations to carry out an attack on @entity3 interests on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks
" the president was briefed , " a senior administration official said
" he directed that the intelligence community and the administration take all necessary steps to ensure vigilance
" earlier thursday , homeland security secretary @entity167 told reporters that intelligence officials had picked up " lots of chatter " on jihadi websites and elsewhere about the impending 10th anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks " and we 're taking it all seriously , " but nothing yet that warranted issuing a threat advisory
nonetheless , the department will be at a heightened level of readiness as the nation commemorates the anniversary , " staffing up " the @entity183 and other agencies , she said
@entity185 said it is not uncommon to see increased chatter before major events
" we know it 's an iconic day to @entity190 , in part because of what was found at the ( @entity153 ) compound
so we are preparing accordingly , " she said
" i do n't want to give those ( details ) out because i do n't want to tell the bad guys exactly what we 're doing , " @entity185 said
" but i think it 's fair to say that in addition to asking citizens to be vigilant and so forth , that we have ourselves leaned forward and have made sure that we are doing all that we can from the @entity82 perspective
" @entity1 's @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 also contributed to this report .
