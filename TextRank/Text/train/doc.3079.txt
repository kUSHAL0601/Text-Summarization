@entity0 -- the @entity3 recently purchased and destroyed thousands of copies of an @entity7 officer 's memoir in an effort to safeguard state secrets , a spokeswoman said saturday
" @entity3 decided to purchase copies of the first printing because they contained information which could cause damage to national security , " @entity3 spokeswoman lt. col. april @entity10 said
in a statement to @entity1 , @entity10 said defense officials observed the september 20 destruction of about 9,500 copies of @entity7 lt. col. @entity21 's new memoir " @entity22
" @entity21 says he was notified friday about the @entity3 's purchase
" the whole premise smacks of retaliation , " @entity21 told @entity1 on saturday
" someone buying 10,000 books to suppress a story in this digital age is ludicrous
" @entity21 's publisher , @entity30 , released a second printing of the book that it said had incorporated some changes the government had sought " while redacting other text he ( @entity21 ) was told was classified
" from single words and names to entire paragraphs , blacked out lines appear throughout the book 's 299 pages
@entity1 obtained a memo from the @entity44 dated august 6 in which lt. gen. @entity45 claims the @entity44 tried for nearly two months to get a copy of the manuscript
@entity45 said the @entity44 's investigation " identified significant classified information , the release of which i have determined could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to national security
" @entity45 said the manuscript contained secret activities of the @entity57 @entity56 , @entity58 and @entity59
@entity21 's lawyer , @entity60 , said earlier this month that the book was reviewed by @entity21 's military superiors prior to publication
" there was a green light from the @entity66 , " @entity60 told @entity1
but intelligence agencies apparently raised objections when they received copies of the book
the @entity3 contacted @entity30 in early august to convey its concerns over the release of the book
according to the publisher , at that time the first printings were just about to be shipped from its warehouse
@entity21 said he and the publisher worked hard " to make sure nothing in the book would be detrimental to national security
" " when you look at what they took out ( in the 2nd edition ) , it 's lunacy , " @entity21 said
the @entity3 says @entity21 should have sought wider clearance for the memoir
" he did clear it with @entity7 but not with the larger @entity7 and with @entity3 , " @entity3 spokesman col. @entity89 said earlier this month
" so he did not meet the requirements under @entity3 regulations for security review
" one of the book 's first lines reads , " here i was in @entity96 ( redaction ) my job : to run the @entity44 's operations out of ( redaction ) the hub for @entity57 operations in country
" in chapter 15 , titled " @entity107 , " 21 lines within the first two pages are blacked out
in the memoir , @entity21 recalls his time in @entity96 leading a black - ops team during the @entity112 administration
the @entity113 medal recipient told @entity1 he believes the @entity112 administraton 's biggest mistake during that time was misunderstanding the culture there
defense officials said they are in the process of reimbursing the publisher for the cost of the first printing and have not purchased copies of the redacted version
at least one seller on the online auction site @entity128 claiming to have a first - edition printing is selling it for an asking price of nearly $ 2,000
the listed retail price for the second printing is $ 25.99 .
