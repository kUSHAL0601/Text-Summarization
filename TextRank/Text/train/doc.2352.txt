-- rebels in the @entity4 -- who took over numerous towns and threatened to overrun the capital -- will be part of a unity government under that nation 's embattled president , a government spokesman said friday
the apparent deal would appear to end violence that began last month , when the @entity15 rebel coalition launched an offensive as they demanded president @entity17 step down after accusing him of reneging on a peace deal
as the insurgency advanced in the nation 's north and neared the capital of @entity23 , @entity17 urged the international community , including the @entity25 and @entity26 , to help fend off the rebellion
he also engaged in peace negotiations , including those this week involving the @entity15 and opposition party leaders in @entity32 's capital , @entity33
these talks ended friday with an agreement to form a " government of national unity " headed by @entity17 , said @entity37 , a spokesman for the @entity4 's decentralization and territorial administration ministry
" @entity15 rebels and ... opposition ( party ) leaders agreed to select the prime minister , " said @entity37 , who added that there will be new legislative elections in a year
@entity17 , the soon - to - be named prime minister and @entity49 members can not run in the next election , said @entity51 , a special representative of the @entity53 secretary - general
the rebels want 400 @entity56 troops deployed to the @entity4 to " withdraw progressively , " @entity37 said
@entity56 president @entity57 announced sunday that his nation 's troops would " assist with capacity building " of the @entity4 's military , which was then fighting a still vibrant insurgency
the new government and the other changes were expected imminently
a cease - fire -- expanding on one that @entity37 , earlier friday , said would be in effect for a week -- goes into effect " within 72 hours " of the parties signing the deal , said @entity51
" we are hopeful that the agreements that have been signed today in @entity33 will contain the immediate flare - up and will calm the situation ... and enable us to recalibrate the disarmament process , " @entity51 said from @entity71 , where the @entity53 is based
at the same time , the @entity53 official warned the lack of introspection -- and corrective action -- regarding why past agreements were n't fully implemented " may lead to another meltdown a few years down the line
" this sentiment was echoed by the office of @entity87 foreign affairs representative @entity86
" such an agreement is the first step out of the crisis , " @entity89 's office said
" to be sustainable , the normalization and stabilization of the country in the longer term requires the underlying causes of the outbreak of recurrent conflicts in the @entity4 to be addressed in a consensual way by all stakeholders
" the deal comes after fits and starts in the peace process in recent weeks , which were marked by fighting interspersed by indications both sides were open to dialogue
for instance , @entity37 said rebel fighters attacked two towns last saturday -- a few days before their leaders were set to join @entity17 , as well as the presidents of @entity32 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and the @entity117 , in @entity33
@entity0 was unable to confirm government claims about the occupation of the towns
as the government scrambled to put down the rebellion , @entity122 representative @entity121 said " reliable sources " had told his @entity53 agency " that children are newly being recruited " by rebel groups and pro-government militias
armed groups were forcing people younger than 18 to fight , carry supplies and serve as sex slaves , the agency said last friday
about 300,000 children have been affected by the rebellion , including family separation , sexual violence , displacement and lack of access to education and health facilities , the agency said
@entity0 's @entity144 contributed to this report .
