the 119 acres of @entity1 lie blanketed by the season 's first snowfall
a hush fills the air ; the only sound is the wind blowing accumulated snow , like confectioners ' sugar , off the branches of nearly bare trees
i enter through the gate on @entity15 and @entity16 , thinking back to a decidedly different day in late august
the sun was bright and hot for late summer
the verdant oaks and elms soared to the sky
i have written down the grave i am seeking : section 10 , @entity24 , @entity25
inside the cemetery office , i inquire how to find this particular grave in this vast space
an employee looks at the number scribbled in my reporter 's notebook
" i look at him , not knowing at first what to make of his reaction
from behind the counter , he whips out a photocopied flier
" you 're looking for @entity40 , right ? " i nod , yes , and glance at the flier
it 's a cemetery map
i see @entity40 's name and a hand - drawn line pointing to the lot where he is buried
the fliers became necessary because so many visitors asked the same question i did
several have already been here today , says the man behind the counter
i head down @entity53 to the intersection of @entity55 , just as the man instructed
i see why a marked map is necessary
there are rows and rows of graves
the sections are not marked , and the headstones are low and not that distinctive
i am searching for something that says his name : @entity40
such a common name , i think
how many @entity67 do i know ? at least six that i can recall in an instant
but i can not find him
i study the flier , fluttering in the frigid wind , and discern that he is somewhere between others whose names are marked on the map
then , i see the footprints , fresh on the snow
the rest of the field is pristine , but there has been a flurry of foot traffic here
i follow the footprints to a small bouquet of plastic flowers , red and purple , planted in the ground
there is not yet a headstone at @entity40 's grave
i stand where @entity40 's parents wailed as their son 's casket was lowered on august 25 into a copper vault
sixteen days before , he had been shot dead by @entity99 police officer @entity99
one minute , the 18 - year - old stood 6 feet 4
the next , he fell to the ground on @entity103
his blood colored the dull asphalt
he lay there for four hours
photos of his body on social media heightened the anger over a police officer 's killing of an unarmed black teenager
what # @entity99 stands for we all know what happened in the days and weeks afterward
what a contrast there is between those days and this one
a tale of two streets in @entity99 a black hearse carried @entity40 's gold and black casket through the streets of @entity129 on that late august day
a white horse - drawn wagon delivered him to his final resting place
a photograph taken after everyone was gone shows a spot in the field where grass was disturbed and the dirt turned and showered with a burst of red and white roses
now nothing remains but the plastic flowers
almost three long months have passed
it 's her @entity99 -- and it 's not all black and white what would @entity40 think if he could see what is happening in his name today ? perhaps he would approve of the demands for justice and calls for reform
but how would he feel about the violent protests ? about the way his hometown , just a few miles from here , waits with fear and anxiety for a grand jury decision ? his name was so ordinary
his headstone , i presume , will make it a tiny bit less so : @entity162
that 's what the copper vault said
but through death , his life turned out to be anything but ordinary
@entity162 's exit from this world unleashed a seething anger and sparked a new conversation about an age - old problem
some people believe him to be a thug who shoved the clerk at the @entity177 and then stole @entity179 cigars
some people believe he provoked @entity99 , the police officer
but those who make the pilgrimage to his grave site , i imagine , see him another way
as a loving son , a brother
or perhaps as a hero , a martyr of sorts
i wonder what else his headstone might say
standing at his grave , i feel the cold invade my bones
i get back in my rental car and leave the quiet of @entity1 to return to the storm of @entity99
follow @entity201 's @entity200 on @entity202 .
