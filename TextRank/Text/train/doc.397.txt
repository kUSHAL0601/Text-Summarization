-- a fatal explosion last month in downtown @entity2 , @entity3 , was caused by the accidental ignition of natural gas vapors that had accumulated inside a popular restaurant , according to a report from a joint city - federal task force issued wednesday
an employee for a contractor laying cable hit a 2 - inch gas line with an underground boring machine late on the afternoon of february 19
the explosion occurred about an hour later , killing one person and injuring at least 15 others
at that time , authorities did not know what had caused the leaking gas to ignite , according to @entity19 , chief operating officer of @entity20
wednesday 's report -- from the @entity2 fire and police departments as well as the federal @entity24 -- answers that question
after the gas line nearby was ruptured , firefighters asked employees at @entity30 's restaurant " to put the flames out on the candles , stove and hot water heater " inside , said the report
when queried after the blast by investigators , the restaurant 's manager acknowledged the initial request and said workers " only put the candles out and turned the stove off , but did not turn out the pilot lights for the stove or hot water heater , " according to the report
the report also shed light on how one woman , a civilian , died after getting trapped when the restaurant 's roof collapsed
at one point , flames extended more than 100 feet from the building 's roof
the contractor , @entity56 , did not have a permit for the excavation , assistant city manager @entity55 said days after the explosion
authorities were alerted a short time after the gas line was hit
city firefighters responded to the scene but left a short time later after being told by the utility company that everything was under control , mayor @entity62 said
a @entity20 employee showed up about 20 minutes after the initial call and , after some initial readings on gas - measuring devices , called for backup , @entity19 said
the utility 's employees then went into businesses asking people to leave and brought in excavating equipment to try to vent the pipe
but while @entity30 's restaurant closed early due to a natural gas smell , hostess @entity80 and other employees were n't in a rush to leave , unaware of the danger they were in
then , @entity80 told @entity0 affiliate @entity87 , " @entity88 and everything was black
