@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's king ordered the release of a number of prisoners and closed cases against several @entity11 leaders accused of plotting against the kingdom , the country 's state news agency said early tuesday
@entity13 named the leaders during a national unity speech last year , leading to the arrest of several of them and the exile of several others who were out of the country at the time
the announcement clears the way for the return of @entity25 , leader of @entity1 's largest opposition party , the @entity26
@entity25 said he planned to arrive in @entity0 tuesday evening -- amid early speculation that he would be arrested
" i know that thousands will be waiting for me , " said @entity25 , who said he planned to give a speech in @entity1 on tuesday about the importance of national unity
thousands more people moved into @entity32 on monday , a presence that has taken on an air of permanence since government forces retreated on saturday and demonstrators reoccupied the symbolic location
tents , some of them outfitted with furniture and occupied by entire families , dot the square
the mass protests planned for tuesday in support of calls for political reforms and other concessions and coincided with @entity25 's return
. " if the people want a new system in a constitutional kingdom , i will be with them , " he said
" if the people just want to change the regime , i will also be standing beside them
" @entity25 , who has been living abroad , had previously been detained by the government for campaigning for more democratic rights in the island monarchy
in september , @entity1 said it requested @entity57 -- the world 's largest international police organization -- to help in arresting @entity25 , who the government accused of a terrorist plot to destroy state buildings and of planning a coup
but the king 's decision closed the books on the case against @entity25 , giving him the freedom to return without fear of arrest
meanwhile , fallout from last week 's violent protests continues
a 20 - year - old protester in @entity1 , who was shot in the head on friday , has died , hospital sources said monday
@entity76 was advancing toward the @entity32 with other demonstrators when security forces opened fire
prior to @entity76 's death , about 10 protesters were thought to have died in five days of protests , but opposition activists say dozens more are unaccounted for
@entity1 canceled its participation in a @entity86 auto race that had been scheduled to begin march 11
testing for the race had been scheduled to start march 3 , and protest organizers had threatened to disrupt the event
the race apparently will be rescheduled , but no date has been selected , race officials said
in announcing the decision , crown prince @entity92 said , " we felt it was important for the country to focus on immediate issues of national interest and leave the hosting of @entity1 's @entity86 race to a later date
" the country hopes to host the race " in the very near future , according to @entity103 , chairman of the @entity104
state television on monday broadcast images of pro-government demonstrators who gathered near a mosque in the capital city , holding flags and chanting slogans including " long live the king
" also on monday , @entity113 's downgraded @entity1 's credit rating by one step and advised investors that it believes continued protests could result in a further degradation of the country 's ability to meet its financial obligations
" we expect the demonstrations that have taken place over the past month will persist , " the agency wrote
protesters initially took to the streets of @entity0 last week to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy
but some are now calling for the removal of the royal family , which has led the @entity134 state since the 18th century
young members of the country 's @entity11 majority have staged violent protests in recent years to complain about discrimination , unemployment and corruption , issues they say the country 's @entity144 rulers have done little to address
the @entity146 says authorities launched a clampdown on dissent in late 2010
it accused the government of torturing some human rights activists .
