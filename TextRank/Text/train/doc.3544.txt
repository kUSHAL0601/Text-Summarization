-- i remember a chalk line drawn on blacktop by a group of kids at recess when i was young
the message was clear : this is the line you do not cross
if you stepped over it , you would face the wrath of those kids in whatever game we were playing
now turn that line crimson and color it toxic
this is the adult version of " do not cross
" this is the infamous red line
we first heard about it in terms of @entity22 a year ago
president @entity23 said that the use of chemical weapons by @entity22 president @entity26 would cross a " red line " that would have " enormous consequences
" as chemical weapons were deployed in @entity22 in august , @entity23 's tripwire was triggered
then @entity23 told reporters : " @entity31 , i did n't set a red line
the world set a red line
" when @entity23 says " the world " did it , he was indicating that much of the world long ago decided chemical weapons were an abhorrent thing to unleash in war
more than 160 countries signed a treaty attesting to this view
but why has " the world set " this one line in the blacktop , and not others ? the @entity49 and its allies ignore the violation of treaties all the time
they ignore the use of other terrible weapons in global conflicts daily
as someone who grew up wondering why we intervened in @entity60 but not @entity61 , as someone who directs a project on rape in war , i want to know : how do we decide what suffering matters enough to get a red line ? at the @entity70 's @entity69 project , we 've been keeping a live crowdmap of sexualized violence in @entity22
i 've personally reported multiple stories of rape in which women were hung by their wrists or burned
we 've also documented how hundreds of thousands of women have been raped in 16 years of fighting in the @entity78
yet @entity79 is not debating whether to intervene in @entity78
it is not struggling over what to do about the rape and torture of women and men in @entity22 or anywhere else
why ? here 's one gut - wrenching answer : " people divide their understanding of militarized violence into normal and not normal , acceptable and not acceptable , " says @entity89 , executive director of women 's human rights organization @entity90
@entity89 argues that violence against women has been " normalized , " especially in @entity97
" world leaders , like representatives in @entity79 , have turned a blind eye to the violence in @entity78 for a simple reason : it does not disturb their preconceived notions about where violence is normal , " she says
if this statement makes my heart hurt , i 'm not sure i can imagine what it means to the people of @entity78
i spoke to @entity113 , the founder of @entity114
she conceived of the @entity115 , which empowers survivors of sexualized violence , and built it with the women of @entity78
just returned from there , @entity113 says she witnessed a kind of dismay about the recent @entity49 response to @entity22 's use of chemical weapons
" although the @entity78 i spoke to felt great empathy for the @entity22 , they felt confused by the @entity49 's immediate and overwhelming reaction when -- after 16 years and 8 million people dead -- they have been waiting and demanding that the @entity49 stop supporting @entity61 , " she says
@entity113 and others have long argued that the @entity49 reconsider its relationship with @entity61 , which they say supports the rebel militia @entity134 , one of the main perpetrators of atrocities in @entity78
they are pushing for the opposite of military intervention -- they want a political intervention based on human rights violations
" for how many years have we been banging on the doors of the @entity146 , saying thousands and thousands of women have been raped ? " she asks
unlike the obvious effects of chemical weapons use , the fallout of rape is often invisible : it does n't always leave marks , and it is so heavily stigmatized we do n't see how it psychologically , and physically , tears women apart
with chemical weapons , gases seep in an indiscriminate cloud and infect whoever is in their path
they 've been called " weapons of mass destruction in slow motion , " says @entity166 , director of the @entity167 at the @entity168
@entity166 argues that " the goal is to have a world in which people do n't settle for disputes with violence , " but he recognizes that " we 're a way off " from such a day
" we still need to prevent a world that uses the very worst weapons , " he says
but " worst " is subjective
" there 's a hierarchy of sensation around weaponry , " @entity113 says
" but in my mind chemical weapons and mass rape are both weapons of mass destruction
" you could argue that the @entity49 gets involved in wars based on careful geopolitics
you could argue , as many do , that the @entity49 intervened in @entity60 because there was a politically viable solution on the table
you could say we stayed out of @entity61 because it was " messy
" it 's a nasty kind of calculus , this business of deciding the red line of intervention , of what kind of pain matters most
ultimately , however , it may not be as complicated as it first appears
" do the people at risk matter to the people in power ? " @entity89 asks
" does intervention serve the political aims of the powerful ? in that calculation , human rights fall far behind
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .
