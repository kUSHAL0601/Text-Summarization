-- ahead of her @entity2 halftime show , singer @entity4 promised there would be no " wardrobe malfunction
" what she did n't guarantee was no obscene gestures
rapper @entity11 provided a middle finger salute to network cameras sunday night during the 12 - minute extravaganza , when she joined @entity4 during a performance of the latter 's new single , " @entity10 '
" the apologies from the @entity19 and the broadcaster , @entity21 , came quickly -- they blamed each other
" there was a failure in @entity21 's delay system , " said @entity23 , the league 's vice president of communications
" the obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate , very disappointing , and we apologize to our fans
" " the @entity19 hired the talent and produced the halftime show , " @entity21 said
" our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers
" the episode was reminiscent of the @entity38 when singer @entity40 's nipple was briefly exposed during a performance with singer @entity42
the infamous " wardrobe malfunction " episode , as it came to be known , prompted the @entity45 to fine broadcaster @entity46 $ 550,000
in november , a divided 3rd @entity48 ruled the @entity45 improperly punished the network
since then , the @entity19 has maintained tight control over the show 's production
after the @entity55 - @entity42 showstopper , the halftime show largely relied on classic rock artists such as @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity61 and @entity60
fast forward to sunday when the @entity62 were again playing in the big game , just as in 2004
@entity11 , along with @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , joined @entity4 as she treated fans to a greatest hits medley that included " @entity69 , " " music " and " @entity71
" the " spontaneous gesture , " as @entity21 called it , came during a performance of @entity4 's latest single
@entity11 not only flipped her middle finger but uttered , " i do n't give a sh * t. " a source close to @entity11 said the rapper " was nervous and not thinking , and adrenaline took over
" " it was n't meant as a gesture or statement of any kind , " said the source , who is not authorized to speak on the record
" she feels horrible for putting @entity4 in that position
" the @entity87 , a nonprofit group that advocates for family friendly programming , blamed the mishap on both @entity21 and the @entity19
" they chose a lineup full of performers who have based their careers on shock , profanity and titillation , " the group 's president , @entity90 , said in a statement
" instead of preventing indecent material , they enabled it
" @entity4 did not issue a comment
but on @entity105 , where the halftime show generated 8,000 tweets per second , the reaction was swift and mixed
" what was that singer m.i.a. thinking ? ! flipping off @entity112 during halftime ca n't be a good career move , " @entity110 of @entity111 tweeted
but @entity115 of @entity116 was less concerned
" can we all stop pretending # @entity11 flipping the @entity118 during the halftime show is offensive in 2012 ? " he asked
said @entity55 , editor in chief of the music magazine paste : " @entity11 did n't flip us all off
she just had a middle finger malfunction
" @entity0 's @entity123 contributed to this report
