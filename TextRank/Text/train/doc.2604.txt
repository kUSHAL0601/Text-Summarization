@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the @entity5 conflict further escalates , refugees continue to cross borders to seek safety in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity1 , @entity10 and @entity11
according to the @entity16 , the number of @entity5 who have registered as refugees -- or are being assisted in these countries -- now exceeds 540,000 , with an increase of over 140,000 during the past six weeks alone
i recently traveled to eastern @entity1 to work with @entity19 and assist the refugees who have fled their homes in @entity5
it was a cold , foggy day with a constant downpour of icy rain
when we crossed the mountains into the @entity0 , the rain turned to a wet snow and a hard wind lashed at us the entire day
@entity1 continues to host the largest @entity5 refugee community , with over 170,000 refugees -- and they continue to stream across the border
more than 13,000 have arrived in @entity1 over the past several days as the fighting and airstrikes in @entity5 have intensified
we met tired and scared families getting off trucks after their 24 - hour escape from @entity5
mothers told me accounts of hearing explosions and leaving by foot at dusk , saying they could n't see the scene in the dark to describe it , but they could smell and feel the dust from the explosions
the kids were scared and many were holding back a flood of tears
the freezing , slushy rain made the situation more desperate and urgent
the refugee situation here is different to what we see in most other countries
almost all the refugees in @entity1 are in host families or self - made tents constructed from scrap materials such as dismantled billboards
the colorful toothpaste and food advertisements that have been turned into shelters make for a strange sight
they are scattered across the country in over 540 locations
there are no official refugee camps like you find in @entity9 and @entity10 , which makes providing assistance even more challenging
the families are arriving in the snow and bitter cold conditions
they are carrying plastic bags with the few items they could bring with them as they fled the violence in their country
it seems everywhere you look you see refugees standing out in the street , in the mud , with their plastic bags
most of them have nowhere to go , so we are providing them with temporary shelter in a training center until they can find another place
@entity5 refugees face brutal winter with inadequate shelter and food the majority of the refugees in @entity1 are staying with host families
the refugees often pay rent to the families that allow them to stay , or they offer labor in exchange for lodging
in some cases there are as many as six refugee families staying with one host family
each refugee family , typically eight people , is crowded into one room that serves as their kitchen , living area , bathroom and sleeping quarters
in the homes where we are working the electricity is out , the roofs are leaking , the wind whips through the flimsy windows and doors , and it is freezing cold
families huddle together around a small stove , struggling to stay warm at night as the temperature plummets to below -10c in this region
@entity134 , a 19 - year old refugee who fled her home in @entity5 by foot , now lives with her family in the attic of a host home
@entity134 told me : " we are not able to get warm either by day or by night
the walls are always damp and it is freezing
" in one room i visited , there were two families who had just arrived
they were given a storage room to sleep in -- there were no windows , no electricity and just a plastic sheet on the cold , damp cement floor
the mothers were unpacking blankets from grain sacks they had used as suitcases when they fled
the fathers were assembling an oil stove improvised out of a metal barrel
kids were trying to help their parents
everyone was silently working in the dark
i could see they had just endured a horrible experience and had n't even collected their thoughts
they had made it out of @entity5 , through the battle
they had found shelter for the night -- and that 's as far as they were in their mind
when i asked them what was next , they truly did not know
they only hoped they would be provided some humanitarian assistance while they sat out the fighting
despite these dire conditions , refugee families offered me tea or to share their dinner
out of politeness , they told me it was ok to not remove my shoes as i walked in to their rooms
this is almost unheard of in this culture but a politeness offered to the guest foreigner
my shoes were muddy and wet from the day and there was no way i could accept their kind offer
envoy says 2013 could bring 100,000 deaths in @entity5 as the @entity5 refugee crisis begins its second winter , @entity1 host households are struggling to cope with the burden of increased expenditures , decreased living space , and an ever - increasing need for more food , fuel and basic living necessities
most communities hosting @entity5 refugees are the poorest in @entity1 with very weak economies that can not support such a large number of guests for a long period of time
the majority of the refugees left their homes initially believing they would soon return
however , as the violence continues , their resources are dwindling or already gone
refugees who came in the summer months , did not come prepared to endure the harsh winter
@entity225 , a 14 - year old refugee who came to @entity1 two months ago told me : " the problem is that i only have my summer clothes here
it is so cold now and there is no way to get warm
" heaters , blankets , warm clothing and heating fuel are some of the most pressing needs for the winter months , in addition to food , shelter and mattresses
in @entity0 , @entity19 has distributed hygiene kits , tablets to purify water , buckets and jerry cans to refugees
@entity19 will be distributing over 6,000 winter clothes and over 4,000 vouchers for winter clothes in @entity0 this month
@entity19 is also providing psychosocial support services to children and adolescents in the region , and has reached over 2,000 beneficiaries to date
the amount of assistance needed here is overwhelming
the @entity16 estimates that if fighting in @entity5 continues the refugee figure could reach 1.1 million by june 2013
funding is short and is hampering our ability , and our peer humanitarian organizations , to provide the support these refugees so desperately need
at the end of the day , i left with a lump in my throat
we saw many tears and a vacuum of feeling from fathers who knew they had just walked away from every worldly possession they owned -- knowing it was lost to the war
but i ca n't say i felt desperate or hopeless
i am an optimist and have to be in order to do this job
