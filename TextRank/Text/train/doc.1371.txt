the country is in your hands
that 's what the speaker of @entity6 's @entity5 reportedly told @entity8 the day he was named to replace prime minister @entity9
a @entity11 lawmaker then shook @entity8 's hand
" may @entity14 help you , " he told him , according to the @entity13
he will likely need all the help he can get
@entity8 will inherit the political reins of a country deeply divided along sectarian lines , a split that has aided a brutal campaign by extremist @entity23 fighters with the @entity24 in @entity6 and @entity25 , which refers to itself as the @entity24
so who is the man that world leaders , diplomats and @entity6 hope can hold the country together ? on paper , @entity8 politically resembles the man he will replace
like @entity9 , he is a member of the @entity33 , one of the country 's biggest @entity11 political blocs
like the man he 'll take over from , his power base is with @entity6 's majority @entity11
and just like him , he was forced into exile by @entity42 and he returned to @entity6 after the @entity23 dictator was toppled in the @entity45 - led 2003 invasion
but that 's where the similarities likely end
@entity8 is viewed as a moderate and has shown more of a willingness to compromise than @entity9 , @entity51 , an @entity6 specialist at @entity52 , told the @entity53
" he is very engaging , articulate and direct , " @entity51 told the @entity55 network
@entity8 was born in @entity56 in 1952 , according to his website
a long - time member of the @entity33 -- he is said to have joined as a teenager -- he was one of thousands of prominent @entity6 who left the country during @entity42 's rule
@entity8 left to study abroad after receiving a bachelor 's degree in 1975 , and stayed away as @entity42 tightened his grip on the country
two of his brothers were not so lucky ; they were executed in 1982 for belonging to the @entity33
the following year , the regime canceled @entity8 's passport
@entity8 spent many years in @entity55 , where he received a doctorate in electrical engineering at the @entity71
his father , who had been a prominent @entity6 official , was accused of insufficient loyalty to the regime and was forced to retire in 1979
he moved to @entity55 and lived there until his death
after @entity42 was ousted , @entity8 returned to @entity6 in 2003 and became communications minister in the interim government , where his language skills and international contacts proved valuable
according to his biography , he was put in charge of ridding the northern @entity6 city of @entity83 of @entity84 in 2005 , and successfully brought tribes together in doing so
it may prove to have been useful experience ; @entity83 is now under the control of @entity89
in interviews in recent weeks , he has stressed the need for unity and compromise in the face of a common enemy , saying all groups had been weakened in the face of the militant threat
he has argued fervently against the division of @entity6 and said he is open to help from @entity101 , where many @entity33 members lived in exile
@entity9 will continue to serve as the country 's caretaker prime minister -- as well as its top military commander -- until @entity8 forms a new government
why does the @entity45 intervene militarily in @entity6 but not in @entity25 ? after the rescue : a @entity111 family 's harrowing flight to escape @entity89 @entity113 neighbors joined @entity89 slaughter , escaped @entity111 says
