-- it 's often proclaimed that " behind a strong man there is a strong woman " -- and in the case of @entity8 's prime minister and his wife , the saying seems to be true
@entity10 , the wife of @entity8 leader @entity11 , has been a champion for female rights in @entity8 for more than two decades now
a teacher by profession , @entity11 established a women 's voting league in 1991 and became known as the face of defiance during her country 's one - party regime
she is also one of the first women to head a major corporation in the @entity25 nation
" it 's good to be a wife , but it 's good to be an educated wife
being a wife , it 's just not a position of subordination -- it 's a position of strength , " she says
" and i make him [ @entity11 ] stronger by being strong
" @entity11 opened up to @entity0 's @entity36 about the role of women in @entity8 and her life as the wife of the country 's prime minister
an edited version of the interview follows
@entity0 : what do you enjoy the most in your role as the wife of @entity8 's prime minister ? @entity10 : meeting with the people , particularly meeting with the young women in schools and colleges , i enjoy being with them
the most rewarding thing that i find is that when i go out in schools and in colleges , and i mentor the girls and i see how they respond to mentorship
i do n't only mentor the girls , i also mentor the girls , their parents and the community and i see the response
i find that really rewarding
@entity0 : what do you think is the changing role for women in @entity8 now ? @entity68 : women are taking up positions of responsibility , particularly in leadership -- political leadership , administrative leadership and all sorts of leadership
and that changing role is coming as a result of education
the other thing is that there is also a really large number of young bright women who are not able to pay school fees , who are not able to advance in education
and i look for means and ways to help them so that they can at least get the education

that does n't sound like the easiest business
how did you do this ? @entity68 : the work is different because it is heavy duty work but i do enjoy it , like teaching
in teaching you start with young girls and you take them and in the end they become young women
and you see the development , in the end you see the work , the result of your work
similarly , when you take raw materials and you cut it and you roll it and you weld it and you do this and in the end you see a beautiful cylinder standing on the other end , it is very rewarding
when you are satisfied with what you are doing and when you are in charge of what you are doing , you are powerful
and power is the nature of the game
the women must be powerful and they must remain strong
@entity0 : your husband spent most of the 1980s jailed by president @entity136 's government
how hard was it on you ? @entity68 : it was very hard on me -- at that time i had three children , my eldest was nine years old then i had a five - year - old and a three - year - old
now i was still a teacher in high school and i loved my job , i did it diligently and i enjoyed doing it
but then there were challenges because for all those years , i became like a political widow without a husband and my children had to go to school , they had to leave and so forth
i was not prepared to take care of the children alone and so this thing came to me as a surprise
but then i had to mature very quickly and know how to balance my life , how to be able to do my job and still bring up the children , single - handledly for those 10 years

it was never peaceful time
and in the process sometimes i would be arrested and thrown in the cell and remained there for a weekend
@entity0 : you 've said , " you must love yourself before someone else does
" what are you really trying to tell women ? @entity68 : when i say " you must love yourself before someone else does , " that 's self esteem
now if you love yourself , you want the best for yourself
you take care of your self and then others will see that and come and join you
do n't wait for someone to tell you how good you are , how strong , even how beautiful you are
you must know yourself that : " i 'm beautiful , i 'm knowledgeable , i 'm strong , i can do it ! join me to help me do it
" but do n't wait for somebody to tell you because when you wait for people to tell you , then they 'll take advantage of you because they 'll think that they 've made you
but make them understand that you make yourself
and after you 've made yourself , then others can come to join you to make you stronger
@entity0 : that does n't detract from being a fantastic wife , does it ? you can be both
@entity68 : it 's good to be a wife , but it 's good to be an educated wife
being a wife , it 's just not a position of subordination -- it 's a position of strength
and i 'd like to show them the best way to be a wife
you 're a wife , i 'm a wife of a prime minister and he loves me to death anyway
and i make him stronger by being strong .
