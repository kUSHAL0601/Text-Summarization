-- @entity1 has every reason in the world not to want to talk about it
but talk he does in the new documentary , " client no. 9 : the @entity7 of @entity1 " opening friday in limited release
the film is directed by @entity10 , whose work has included acclaimed documentaries " @entity13 : the @entity14 " and " @entity15
" " @entity20 " traces the prostitution scandal that ended @entity1 's term as governor of @entity19 in 2008
@entity10 interviews several of the people who became adversaries of @entity1 in the wake of his attempts to reform both @entity26 and @entity27 as well as one of the women @entity1 allegedly saw on multiple occasions
@entity1 recently spoke with @entity0 about why he participated in the film , his thoughts on the theory that there was a conspiracy to topple him from power and what he has learned in the wake of the scandal
@entity0 : let 's start with the obvious question of why did you agree to participate in the documentary ? @entity1 : i thought it would help with getting the facts out and i thought that [ @entity10 ] was interested in doing a straightforward recitation of facts and i thought that i could lend insight
@entity0 : did you have any hesitation at all about dredging the whole thing up again ? @entity1 : if you begin with the premise that he was making the movie , it just seemed to me to make more sense to participate and present the facts as i saw them
@entity0 : what did you think of the film ? @entity1 : i 'm neither a film critic nor in this case the best person to pass judgment , but i thought it was a fair story
@entity0 : i 'm sure you would rather move on in your life , but what is it like to watch this situation play out again on the big screen and know that filmgoers will do the same ? @entity1 : look , you go on with your life and you learn to do what you are interested in and focus on what you are doing
you realize that other things will be going on but they are not the things i am focusing on
@entity0 : the film , or at least the trailer , makes it appear that there was this whole conspiracy [ by @entity26 titans ] to bring you down
what are your thoughts about that ? @entity1 : what i 've said throughout this is that i resigned because i thought it was the appropriate step to take in the context of what i had done , whether there were other things going on or what others were focused on
@entity0 : how were you approached about being in the film ? @entity1 : honestly , i ca n't remember
i presume i got an e-mail or a phone call
i 'm sure @entity10 knows somebody i know and someone said , " hey they are doing a documentary on your life and is n't that a nice thing to hear ? " one way or another i ended up on the phone with @entity10 and we chatted
i think there were several conversations that finally resulted in agreeing to sit down with him
he 's someone whose resume speaks for itself
he 's someone who makes serious movies and does n't dabble in the world of the scurrilous and shadows
he makes serious movies and he 's won some serious awards
@entity0 : did you have any rules going in about things you would n't discuss ? @entity1 : i do n't recall that there were any ground rules
@entity0 : how does it feel to be " infamous " ? @entity1 : oh , i do n't know
i think i 'm many different things to many different people
@entity0 : why did you want to be a part of your @entity0 show " @entity127 ? " @entity1 : it is great fun
it is an effort to bring a smart debate and conversation to the air every night at 8 o'clock rather than a linear , sort of ideologically driven presentation that other networks have and i say that with a great deal of respect for what they put on the air and admiration for how they do it
but this is an effort to give the viewer both sides of the debate
@entity0 : now that the scandal is over , you 've moved on and you have a new show , what do you feel like you have learned ? @entity1 : life is peaks and valleys
i think we all are aware of that and it 's better to be at a peak , but often you learn more in the valley
you go forward trying to do what you care about and taking care of the people you care about
it 's not very complicated
@entity0 : you say it 's not very complicated , but from the outside looking in it seems a bit complicated
@entity1 : the principles are easily stated
it 's more complicated to live them in life , but to state the principles is n't that complicated
@entity0 : what do you hope people take away from this film ? @entity1 : certainly i hope they appreciate that when i was in government we did what mattered for the public on views that seemed important then , but i think have become even more important , and the sense that we fought awfully hard for the public both as attorney general and governor and focused on what was important
i saw the rough cut and what they showed at the film festivals
i do n't know how much it differs from the final version , but i think some of that certainly came through in the movie and i hope [ viewers ] do take that away with them .
