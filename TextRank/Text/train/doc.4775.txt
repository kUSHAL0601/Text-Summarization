@entity2 @entity1 prosecutors have started a second attempt to convict a man of terrorism after he was caught with bomb - making directions , in a highly unusual case being heard partly in secret
the man , @entity10 , was found guilty last year of having details of how to make a bomb , but a jury failed to reach a decision on the more serious charge of plotting a terror attack
a new jury was selected tuesday , and prosecutor @entity18 began the state 's second try
@entity10 was arrested in october 2013 and found to have the address of a property belonging to former @entity1 prime minister @entity23 and his wife , @entity18 told the jury
he also had the instructions for how to make a bomb on an sd card concealed between his phone and its case , @entity18 said
@entity10 does not need to have planned a specific attack or had a target in mind to be guilty of plotting terror , the prosecutor told the jury
the case is extremely unusual in that the media and public will be barred from hearing some of the evidence
a select group of 10 journalists will be allowed to hear other parts of the trial , but must leave their notes in court
the rest of the trial is open to the public
the trial could last for several months
@entity2 terror suspect recording : ' terrorist ' is a great word
