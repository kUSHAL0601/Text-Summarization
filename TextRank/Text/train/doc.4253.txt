former vice president @entity0 called a @entity3 panel 's report on @entity5 interrogation tactics during @entity7 's administration is " deeply flawed " and a " terrible piece of work
" " the report 's full of crap , " he said in an interview with @entity11 on wednesday evening
@entity7 's @entity15 vice president insisted that the @entity17 's rough tactics -- which the report said included mock executions , beatings , " rectal rehydration " and feeding , sleep deprivation and more -- helped the @entity5 " catch the bastards who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11
" " it did in fact produce actionable intelligence that was vital in the success of keeping the country safe from further attacks , " he said
asked specifically about the rectal rehydration instance detailed in the report , @entity0 said : " i do n't know anything about that specific instance -- i ca n't speak to that
" he also said he had n't actually read the report
its full 6,000 pages have n't been released , but a lengthy summary was issued tuesday
@entity0 said he 'd " seen parts of it
i read summaries of it
" contrary to the report 's conclusion that @entity7 did n't know the extent of the @entity17 's efforts , @entity0 said the president was involved in discussions about the interrogation techniques , and that @entity7 even pointed out some of those conversations in a book he wrote after leaving office
he said he has no regrets about the tactics used after the sept. 11 , 2001 , @entity60 attacks
" i think what needed to be done was done , " @entity0 said
" i think we were perfectly justified in doing it
and i 'd do it again in a minute
" opinion : what @entity0 gets wrong on torture
