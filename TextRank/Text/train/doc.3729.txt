-- starting monday , students at the @entity3 will be getting an unapproved vaccine scientists hope will stop a meningococcal disease outbreak there , the university said
the @entity8 pharmaceutical company @entity7 already has approval for its vaccine @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14
it is not approved for use in the @entity17
in this case , the @entity18 had to grant special permission for its use at @entity3
the @entity18 granted special permission to use the vaccine at @entity24 last december to fight an unrelated outbreak there
meningitis b outbreaks are rare but deadly , according to the @entity28
in 2012 , there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis ; some 160 of those were group b , the agency said
there were eight confirmed cases at @entity24 and four @entity3 students were confirmed as sick with meningococcal disease , which can cause meningitis or blood infections
one case at @entity3 was so advanced , doctors had to remove a student 's lower legs in november
@entity45 had been a promising lacrosse and soccer player
after his operation his parents asked the @entity18 to pick up the pace on @entity52 's approval
" we hope that @entity45 's horrific illness brings increased awareness and rapid approval by the @entity18 of the vaccine " for the type b strain , @entity53 said
there are vaccines approved in the @entity17 for other types of meningitis , but group b is the strain that does " pack the most powerful punch , " the @entity28 said
college students are especially vulnerable
students who drink a lot of alcohol can be particularly susceptible to catching it
dorms are the perfect breeding grounds for an outbreak
@entity74 spreads through coughing , sneezing , and kissing
it can also spread when people forget to wash their hands or clothes , or among people who drink out of the same cup
@entity81 is tricky since students who catch it may first think they have the flu
it starts with flu - like symptoms : fever , headache , stiff necks , vomiting and delirium
if the bacteria spread to the protective tissue around the spinal cord and brain , known as the meninges , patients can suffer hearing loss , permanent neurological damage and even death
the @entity28 sent a team of scientists to @entity3 to study the outbreak in december
fortunately , scientists said , a meningitis b outbreak moves slowly than others
" it smolders , " said dr. @entity106 , the chief of the @entity28 's meningitis branch
" you have a bit more time to get everything in place
" @entity52 will be offered to some 20,000 students at @entity3
more than 5,000 were vaccinated at @entity24 and they are currently getting a second dose which is necessary for full immunity
@entity7 says it is seeking @entity17 license for the vaccine 's use in all adolescents and young adults which they say would " enable immediate response to future outbreaks , " according to its press release
" these recent outbreaks remind us how unpredictable the disease can be , " said @entity126 , division head for @entity127
his company has submitted successful test results from 8,000 vaccinations of adults , children , adolescents and infants
that test data was used for vaccine approval in other countries
" we will continue to work with the @entity18 to pursue a potential license for @entity52 in the @entity17 to help fulfill this public health need , " @entity126 said .
