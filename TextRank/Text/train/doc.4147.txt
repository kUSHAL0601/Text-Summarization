-- where does @entity2 's off - kilter comic vision come from ? turns out the answer may be " @entity5
" @entity2 was born in @entity6 , but moved to his father 's native @entity5 at age one -- he and his family did n't move back to the @entity10 until he was seven or so
how @entity2 became the darkest , funniest comedian in @entity10 " coming here and observing @entity10 as an outsider made me an observing person , " @entity2 tells senior writer @entity13 in the new issue of @entity0
" i grew up in @entity18 and did n't get the accent , and one of the reasons is that i started in @entity22 , " he continued
" i was a little kid , so all i had to do was completely reject my @entity22 and my @entity5 past , which is a whole lot easier because i 'm white with red hair
i had the help of a whole nation of people just accepting that i 'm white
" on the cover : the dirty wisdom of @entity2 " race does n't mean what it used to in @entity10 anymore , " he continues
" it just does n't
@entity35 's black , but he 's not black the way people used to define that
is black your experience or the color of your skin ? my experience is as a @entity5 immigrant , more so than someone like @entity48
but he 'll be treated as an immigrant
my abuelita , my grandmother , did n't speak @entity55
my whole family on my dad 's side is in @entity5
i wo n't ever be called that or treated that way , but it was my experience
