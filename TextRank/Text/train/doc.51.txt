@entity0 -- a hearing into whether a @entity4 cleric who has been described as " more radical than @entity5 " can avoid deportation from @entity7 to stand trial in @entity9 began wednesday in @entity0
@entity7 has been trying to deport @entity10 for years , but his legal appeals have kept him in the @entity7
he is accused of funding terrorist groups and is said to have inspired one of the 9/11 hijackers
profile : @entity10 : the preacher at the eye of the storm in january , the @entity17 blocked @entity7 from sending him to @entity9 because of fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at the trial planned by the @entity23 country
@entity7 then launched a round of negotiations with @entity9 in order to deal with the court 's concerns and arrested @entity10 again on april 17
the following month , the @entity17 rejected an appeal by his lawyers to avoid deportation
the decision set the stage for the latest hearing in front of the @entity36 , which will hear three witnesses in person
the hearing is expected to last several days
the high court judge who manages the commission is likely to give his ruling a few weeks after the appeal concludes , a court official said
a significant portion of the hearing will be closed to the media and sometimes also to @entity10 's defense team , because matters of national security are to be discussed
who is @entity10 ? also known as @entity10 , @entity10 is a militant @entity52 preacher who has been held in high - security @entity7 jails for more than six years

counter-terrorism sources said @entity10 was a big influence on @entity69 , the @entity9 who would emerge as @entity72 's leader in @entity73
what is he accused of ? the @entity7 government says @entity10 raised money for terrorist groups , including organizations linked to former @entity72 leader @entity5 , and has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups
@entity10 has denied the allegations against him
why is he wanted in @entity9 ? in 2000 , @entity9 convicted him in absentia for a plot to bomb tourists in the country to celebrate the new millennium
he was also convicted for his role in two terrorist attacks in the country in 1998

why is he fighting deportation ? @entity10 has said deportation would put him at risk of torture and lengthy pretrial detention
lawyers presenting his appeal question whether the evidence against him in the two cases he faces in @entity9 is sound , or whether it has come from someone who was tortured and is therefore tainted
they also question whether @entity10 can expect a fair trial in @entity9
when did he arrive in the @entity7 ? using a forged @entity103 passport , @entity10 arrived in the @entity7 in 1993 and sought asylum for himself , his wife and their three children , according to court documents
he said @entity9 authorities had tortured him
the @entity7 government recognized him as a refugee and allowed him to stay in the country until 1998
@entity10 applied to stay indefinitely , but while his application was pending , a @entity9 court convicted him in absentia of the terrorism charges
what does he preach ? as a preacher in @entity0 mosques , @entity10 gained a militant following
in 1999 , he allegedly sought to justify the killing of @entity122 , including children , and attacking @entity65
in 2001 , three days after the 9/11 attacks in the @entity65 , @entity10 preached that the attacks were part of a global struggle between @entity128 and @entity4 , and were a response to @entity65 's unjust policies
in another sermon , he sought to justify the killing by a muslim of a " nonbeliever " for the sake of @entity4
writing in @entity137 in 2006 , @entity136 quotes a @entity139 journalist who had met @entity10 in the early 1990s
@entity140 said " @entity10 had struck him as far more radical than @entity5 ... influenced by @entity141 , the puritanical , fundamentalist strain of @entity4
" has he been convicted of a crime in @entity7 ? he was first detained in the @entity7 in 2002 under sweeping anti-terror legislation enacted after 9/11 -- along with dozens of other @entity146 militants
he was released briefly in 2005 after the repeal of the law
later that year , @entity7 authorities ordered his renewed detention under the @entity151
no evidence has been produced in a @entity7 court to suggest he was involved with specific @entity72 conspiracies
as one popular tweet puts it : " @entity10 has not even been convicted of a parking offense in @entity7
" why not ? two reasons
authorities say they are unwilling to produce evidence in open court that might prove some operational or direct link to terrorism for fear of compromising intelligence sources
second , it is notoriously difficult to prove a crime has been committed by the use of words that influence others ' actions
who is the other cleric recently extradited from @entity7 ? radical @entity4 cleric @entity174 , just extradited from @entity7 to the @entity65 , pleaded not guilty tuesday to 11 counts of terrorism
his hearing in a @entity65 court came after he lost a lengthy legal battle to avoid extradition to the @entity65 from @entity0
@entity181 has called the 9/11 attacks on the @entity183 " a towering day in history " and described @entity5 as " a good guy and a hero
" the charges against @entity174 include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 @entity191 in @entity192 , and conspiring with others to establish an @entity195 training camp in rural @entity196 in 1999
if convicted , @entity174 could be sentenced to life in prison
@entity1 's @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .
