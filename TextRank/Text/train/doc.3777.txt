@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 lawmakers wednesday approved a package of austerity measures demanded by international lenders , despite protests outside @entity8 as they were voting , in a move that should clear the way for an emergency loan to @entity1
@entity0 riot police fired round after round of tear gas to keep small crowds of protesters away from @entity8 in the run - up to the vote and as lawmakers one by one said " yes " or " no. " the vote was 155 to 138 in the 300 - seat house , with five voting " present " and two abstaining
crowds outside @entity8 swelled as the vote took place , but both sides showed some restraint , with police and demonstrators eyeing each other warily rather than wading into the melee
before the vote , small numbers of demonstrators hurled stones at police , chanted , waved @entity0 flags and set small fires to protest the austerity measures , which include new taxes and job cuts
at least 19 police officers were injured wednesday , police said
dozens of people have gone to hospitals with breathing problems , police said
@entity43 , the president of the @entity44 , called on police to " stop using chemicals before we mourn any victims
" a second key vote is due in the @entity0 parliament thursday on how the five - year austerity package will be implemented
@entity52 chancellor @entity53 called wednesday 's passage of the austerity measures " really good news , " @entity52 government spokesman @entity51 said on @entity57
@entity59 chairman @entity58 also welcomed the news , saying the " way is now clear " for @entity1 to receive the fifth instalment of a huge bailout loan from @entity64 countries and the @entity65
@entity0 has debt payments coming due in @entity67 and needs the $ 17 billion in emergency funds to be able to pay them -- but lenders , including the @entity65 and @entity64 , had demanded that it approve the austerity measures in order to get the loan
@entity75 and international lenders agreed last year to give @entity0 a $ 156 billion bailout package as its deficit soared , but were threatening to hold up an installment of $ 17 billion due soon
a default by @entity0 would send shock waves through the @entity75 banking sector and potentially dent global economic confidence
@entity58 said in a statement from @entity84 : " i 'm very happy and relieved that the @entity0 @entity8 followed the government and voted in favour of a new program of structural reforms and budgetary adjustment
" unions oppose the austerity package , but its backers say it is essential to the stability of the @entity0 economy , the euro , and the global financial system
riot police clashed with stone - throwing demonstrators tuesday ahead of the vote , firing tear gas to disperse protesters during riots that left 30 police officers and one demonstrator injured
the two - day general strike is continuing on wednesday , with members of three major unions planning to march on @entity8 after the vote
the 48 - hour general strike kicked off early tuesday , hobbling most of @entity0 's transportation systems but freeing workers to participate in demonstrations
transportation disruptions took place on land , on sea and in the air
air traffic controllers periodically stopped work and flight traffic , according to their union
@entity124 also disrupted sea travel in the maritime nation , which encompasses many islands
the @entity0 government hopes for a second bailout package to stay afloat , but that , too , depended on its passing the austerity measures before @entity8 on wednesday
protesters lament that the cuts are being carried out on the backs of those who can afford it least
