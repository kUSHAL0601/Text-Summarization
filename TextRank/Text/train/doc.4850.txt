i never realized that the conservative media were so eye - poppingly powerful
so mighty , in fact , that liberal politicians ca n't seem to stop talking about how they are running roughshod over the country
my response : can we please stop the whining ? the latest to rant about the right is @entity9
the former vice president told @entity11 that president @entity12 had been cautious , and when the @entity14 anchor asked whether there was " a very hostile environment for progressive ideas , " @entity9 had his culprit ready : " @entity19 and right - wing talk radio
in @entity22 there 's an old saying if you see a turtle on a fence post you can be pretty sure it did n't get there by itself
and the fact that we have 24/7 propaganda masquerading as news , it does have an impact
" watch : why @entity38 's @entity37 hopes are an empty vault ok , @entity9 does n't like @entity19
so he started what he hoped would be a liberal counterweight in @entity42 , spent millions on such stars as @entity44 , and ... the channel flopped
it was such a failure that he just sold it to @entity47 for an estimated personal take of $ 100 million
leave aside the obvious contradiction of a climate change crusader selling to a network largely financed by the petrodollar kingdom of @entity53
whatever you think of @entity57 , @entity55 's network has been a financial success and @entity42 was anything but
is n't that the free market at work ? watch : the media 's gushing send - off for @entity65 @entity12 often invokes the conservative media , most recently in an interview with @entity68
asked about working with @entity70 in his second term , the president said : " one of the biggest factors is going to be how the media shapes debates
if a @entity70 member of @entity77 is not punished on @entity19 or by @entity78 for working with a @entity79 on a bill of common interest , then you 'll see more of them doing it
" now it 's true that @entity19 or @entity78 can boost or batter any lawmaker , and that they can help drive a controversy into the broader mainstream media
but we 're talking here about the president of the @entity91
he has an army , a navy and a bunch of nuclear weapons , not to mention an ability to command the airwaves at a moment 's notice
and he 's complaining about a cable channel and a radio talk - show host ? @entity78 later offered this response : " if @entity19 and i are the only thing keeping the @entity70 from caving to @entity12 on every issue , i 'm not paid enough
" watch : does @entity106 have a future after @entity19 ? i have been through this before
it was on my " @entity112 " program , in the fall of 2009 , that the @entity114 declared war on @entity19
@entity116 , then the @entity114 communications director , called @entity19 " the communications arm of the @entity70 " and said , " it is not really a news network anymore
" the resulting furor gave @entity19 months of fodder and was widely judged a tactical misstep that if anything elevated the network 's role
there are times when many @entity19 programs , including in the nonopinion hours , appear to be on a jihad against the administration
and these days , @entity133 can be counted on to defend the @entity134 almost around the clock
but let 's face it : these are cable channels with relatively modest audiences , and their impact is sometimes exaggerated inside the @entity142 echo chamber
after all , @entity12 handily won re-election despite the best efforts of @entity145 and @entity78
watch : @entity146 censors company 's vulgar name what liberals sometimes forget is that the conservative media took root because many @entity91 felt the fourth estate was too left - wing
@entity154 , @entity155 , @entity14 , @entity156 , the @entity146 and the @entity157 all strive for fairness , in my view , but there is little question that they have a social and cultural outlook that leans to the left
collectively , they have far more weight than @entity19 , talk radio and @entity167 editorial page
right - wing pundits make a convenient foil , but at times @entity12 seems to magnify their importance
after all , he 's got the biggest bully pulpit of all .
