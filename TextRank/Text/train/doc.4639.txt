-- @entity1 has been killing civilians and international powers have failed to intervene
the @entity4 has killed people with drones and listened in on private communications in the name of national security
@entity10 has passed laws that target gays and lesbians
these are some of the trends in 2013 that @entity16 ( @entity16 ) cited in its annual account of human rights records around the world on tuesday
in a 667 - page report , the @entity21 - based group highlighted key human rights issues in more than 90 countries , drawing on events through november
@entity16 executive director @entity26 presented the account , the 24th of its kind , at a press conference in @entity31
below are some of the issues in focus
@entity1 @entity16 deplored international powers for failing in their responsibility to protect civilians in @entity1 after almost three years of civil war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives
a day before international negotiations begin in @entity43 , the group contrasted the handling of the conflict with the reaction of the international community in other countries such as @entity49 and @entity50
it said " the unchecked slaughter of civilians in @entity1 elicited global horror and outrage but not enough to convince world leaders to exert the pressure needed to stop it
" it accused @entity10 and @entity58 of using their vetoes at the @entity62 @entity61 to shield the government of @entity1 president @entity64 from strong international action , such as an arms embargo or referral to the @entity68
" despite a swiftly rising death toll and horrific abuses , @entity10 and @entity58 neutered the @entity61 and enabled the killing of @entity1 civilians by both sides , " @entity26 said in a statement
" as the @entity77 peace talks begin , with uncertain prospects of success , they should n't become the latest excuse to avoid action to protect @entity1 civilians
this requires real pressure to stop the killing and allow the delivery of the humanitarian aid they need to survive
" a team of internationally renowned war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts has found " direct evidence " of " systematic torture and killing " by @entity64 's regime , the lawyers on the team have said in a new report
@entity97 the @entity16 report also highlighted alleged abuses in struggling democracies , calling @entity97 the " most glaring " example of " abusive majoritarianism
" the report criticized the government of the country 's first democratically elected president , @entity105 , which it said ruled " in a manner that left secular and minority groups fearing exclusion in an @entity111 - dominated government "
in the wake of @entity105 's military - backed ouster in july , the interim government of @entity113 had launched what @entity16 said was the " worst repression that @entity97 has known in decades , including by killing hundreds of @entity119 protesters
" " for the second time since the fall of ( former leader @entity123 ) @entity123 in february 2011 , a government is in power with little apparent inclination to limit itself by respecting basic rights , " @entity16 said
authorities have cracked down on the @entity119 since @entity105 's ouster , rounding up the movement 's leaders and making membership illegal
@entity97 passes a new constitution @entity4 president @entity134 's record on national security issues came under fire from @entity16 -- from the continued existence of the detention center in @entity139 to what the group called the unlawful killing of civilians through drone attacks in countries such as @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148
another major topic concerned the revelations of " virtually unchecked mass electronic surveillance " by the @entity4 made public by fugitive and former @entity154 contractor @entity152
while @entity16 credited @entity134 for appointing a panel to recommend reforms , it questioned " whether any of these recommendations will be acted on
" in a speech on friday , @entity134 unveiled new guidance for gathering intelligence as well as reforms intended to balance what he called the nation 's vital security needs with concerns over privacy and civil liberties
@entity16 expressed concern other governments , including those will a poor rights record , could follow the @entity4 example in surveillance , forcing " user data to stay within their own borders , setting up the potential for increased internet censorship
" in addition , the group chided @entity181 for attempting to prosecute @entity152 under the @entity182 , noting that this had allowed @entity10 , which has offered @entity152 temporary sanctuary , to " recast itself as a champion of privacy rights
" what @entity134 changed at the @entity154 @entity10 @entity16 highlighted " homophobic rhetoric , including by officials , and rising homophobic violence " in @entity10 , which last year passed a law that bans even discussion of homosexuality anywhere that children might hear it
the legislation , which president @entity197 signed in june , gives authorities the power to impose fines as well as detain and deport foreigners who are deemed to have breached the law
@entity197 says gays ' can feel safe ' at the games " vigilante groups , consisting of radical nationalists , and neo-nazis , lure men or boys to meetings , accuse them of being gay , humiliate and beat them , and post videos of the proceedings on social media , " @entity16 said in the report
" a few investigations were launched , but have not yet resulted in effective prosecution
" authorities in @entity10 , which will host the @entity219 in @entity220 next month , have also continued the crackdown on civil society and government critics that began in 2012 , it said
enforcement of the " foreign agents " law in 2013 led to an unprecedented , nationwide inspection campaign of hundreds of nongovernmental organizations and court cases , it said
@entity16 dismissed @entity197 's decision late last year to free jailed activists from the punk band @entity234 and environmental group @entity235 , as well as @entity237 critic @entity236 as attempts to avoid international criticism ahead of the @entity219
" the effect was largely to highlight the arbitrariness " of mr. @entity197 's government , the report said
@entity58 while it announced the abolition of " the abusive administrative detention system @entity251 , relaxation of the one - child policy , and plans to improve the delivery of justice , ( @entity58 's new leadership ) has yet to embark on fundamental reforms that adequately respond to the public 's increased demands for justice and accountability , " @entity16 said
the group said it was particularly concerned about the arrests of activists who have campaigned for officials to publicly disclose their assets despite the government 's declared crackdown on graft
other areas of concern include a government campaign to stifle online rumors , and repressive policies in the restive ethnic minority regions of @entity272 and @entity273 , it said
@entity16 said international pressure on @entity58 over its human rights situation was " inconsistent " last year , saying that some countries , such as @entity277 and @entity278 , had toned down criticism in summits with the @entity58 leadership
" @entity58 is home to more than a billion people and is a major global power , so how the rest of the world addresses its human rights situation is more vital than ever , " @entity283 director @entity282 said in a statement
@entity58 has consistently defended its human rights record and lambasted foreign groups which criticize it .
