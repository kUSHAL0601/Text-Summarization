-- i was happy to return to @entity2 , this beautiful city which i have visited several times
twenty years after the first @entity5 , i came to @entity2 , like many people from all over the world , to put the world on a different pathway -- one leading to sustainable development
but , the leaders gathered here came without an intergenerational vision and they failed to rise to the challenge ; they did not break their ties with the old ways of doing things -- ways that are proved to be unsustainable and inequitable

unfortunately these voices were not incorporated into the declaration text and many leave for home frustrated and angry
i urge those who are disappointed by the lack of urgency and commitment to channel their frustration positively to work on a parallel pathway to fill the gaps left by the @entity2 text and to deliver the futures we all need
more : @entity2 +20 summit must not ignore rapid population growth i had the pleasure of participating in numerous events during the conference where we discussed the role of women 's empowerment in sustainable development , the importance of making real progress on food and nutrition security and the need to improve access to sustainable energy for the poorest
underlying all of these discussions was the importance of upholding human rights and not backsliding on any existing commitments , while striving for a more equitable world
the @entity2 declaration does set some important processes in train , like developing @entity83 , which address all three dimensions of sustainable development : environmental , social and economic
these should be action oriented , aspirational and measurable , so that they complement the @entity88
likewise , processes have been established to strengthen environmental governance at the international level and to make progress on financing for sustainable development

however , it worries me that negotiations revealed a desire by some to step back from established commitments and principles
the restating of these commitments is therefore considered a success , only because these principles and values were under threat
more seriously , the backsliding on reproductive rights -- first established in 1994 at the @entity114 and reiterated at the @entity115 -- is simply not acceptable , as highlighted by numerous women leaders in their statements to the @entity5
more : the elephant in the room at @entity5 arising from the failure of political leadership here in @entity2 , our hope is that people everywhere will accept that we all have to take responsibility and mobilize ourselves
helped by social media and easier communication across the globe , we can make sure that the world we pass on to our children and grandchildren is safe , equitable , prosperous and sustainable
i was encouraged as i listened to many heads of state at the summit , who stressed their desire for a more concrete outcome
but this desire came too late : they should have engaged earlier in the process , they could have seized the moment and given stronger leadership
this possibility of a once in a generation moment passed us by and we will regret it
happily the lack of political leadership was countered by the incredible vitality , determination and commitment of civil society -- from young people , women , trade unions , grassroots communities , faith - based organizations and the private sector
the legacy of @entity2 will not just be the text of the @entity163 hopefully it will be the mobilization of people to build the future they desire
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .
