-- the @entity3 and its allies are n't " blind " or " stupid " when it comes to negotiations with @entity7 , @entity2 's top diplomat said sunday after nuclear talks with the @entity10 republic broke up without an agreement
" we are absolutely determined that this would be a good deal , or there 'll be no deal , " secretary of state @entity12 told @entity18 's " @entity17
" " this is a new overture , and it has to be put to the test very , very carefully , " he added
but @entity23 's prime minister cheered the failure of the talks , saying the agreement reportedly on the table would have been a " jackpot " for @entity7
@entity7 's president , meanwhile , tried to reassure his parliament that he wo n't trade away @entity32 's ability to produce nuclear fuel in any agreement to lift international sanctions
after two days of foreign minister - level talks , negotiations between @entity7 and the five @entity37 members plus @entity38 ended in @entity40 , @entity41 , early sunday
the @entity43 's foreign policy chief , @entity42 , told reporters , " a lot of concrete progress has been achieved , but some differences remain
" negotiations are set to resume november 20 , with @entity48 and @entity7 foreign minister @entity49 attending
" i think we are all on the same wavelength , and that 's important , " @entity49 said
" and that gives us the impetus to go forward
" @entity7 insists its aims are peaceful @entity7 has refused @entity37 demands to halt its production of enriched uranium , which can be used to power nuclear reactors or in extremely high concentrations , to make an atomic bomb
it insists it wants to build civilian power plants , but @entity64 powers and @entity23 accuse it of harboring ambitions for a nuclear weapon
@entity37 inspectors reported in 2011 that they could no longer verify the @entity7 program was strictly peaceful
@entity7 's refusal to stop enriching uranium has led to sanctions that have crippled its economy , slashing its crude oil exports and triggering widespread inflation at home
but president @entity76 , whose overtures to the @entity79 since taking office in august raised hopes of a deal , said sunday that @entity32 has its own " red lines " that his government wo n't cross
" the rights of the @entity7 nation and national interests are our red lines , and those rights include nuclear rights within the framework of international law , as well as enrichment on @entity7 soil , " @entity76 told lawmakers , according to the semi-official @entity86 news agency
but nonproliferation expert @entity98 told @entity0 's " @entity101 " that the outlines of a deal appear clear , and he expected one would be clinched " very soon
" " we 've seen some remarkable developments over the last couple days , including the normalization of @entity3 and @entity7 dialogue , " @entity98 said
" we now take it for granted that the secretary of state should talk to @entity7 's foreign minister , but that had n't happened in 34 years until last september
" what 's on the table in talks two senior @entity3 administration officials said that in the proposal on the table , @entity7 would agree to stop enriching uranium to a concentration of 20 % -- well above the level needed to fuel a nuclear power plant , though still far below what 's needed to produce a nuclear weapon
@entity32 would render most of its existing stockpile of 20 % enriched uranium unusable under the proposal
in addition , it would agree not to use its advanced @entity125 centrifuges , which can operate five times faster than older models used in its enrichment plants
and it would n't activate a heavy - water reactor at @entity130 , which can be used to produce plutonium
that 's a demand that @entity133 in particular insisted upon , @entity133 foreign minister @entity132 said
@entity7 's nuclear capabilities the officials said that in return , the @entity138 powers of the @entity3 , @entity139 , @entity133 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity38 would unfreeze some @entity7 assets held in banks overseas and consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold , precious metals and petrochemicals
other sweeteners were also under consideration , they said
one of the officials said the deal was designed to delay the point at which @entity7 could develop a nuclear weapon while providing temporary , reversible sanctions relief
but @entity132 told radio station @entity156 on saturday that while @entity157 wanted a deal , it would n't agree to a " fool 's game " -- and that the proposal on the table at that time was unsatisfactory
" thank @entity163 for @entity133 , " @entity3 sen. @entity164 , a leading @entity165 who is pushing for another round of sanctions on @entity7 , told @entity0 's " @entity169
" the @entity171 chairman of the @entity172 , @entity173 sen. @entity170 , told @entity175 's " @entity174 " that the @entity3 " ca n't want the deal more than @entity7
" @entity164 : new sanctions on @entity7 needed and @entity23 prime minister @entity177 , who had criticized the negotiations last week , told @entity180 's " @entity179 " that @entity7 should have to dismantle its existing centrifuges and the @entity130 reactor as part of any agreement
" @entity7 gives practically nothing , and it gets a hell of a lot
that 's not a good deal , " @entity177 said
he said other @entity191 states shared his opinion
" and you know , when you have the @entity191 and @entity23 speaking in one voice -- it does n't happen very often -- i think it 's worth paying attention to
" @entity12 : we know what we 're doing @entity12 told @entity18 that critics are underestimating the negotiators
" some of the most serious and capable , expert people in our government , who have spent a lifetime dealing both with @entity7 as well as with nuclear weapon and nuclear armament and proliferation , are engaged in our negotiation
we are not blind , and i do n't think we 're stupid , " @entity12 said
" i think we have a pretty strong sense of how to measure whether or not we are acting in the interests of our country and of the globe , and particularly of our allies like @entity23 and @entity216 states and others in the region
" the @entity220 dispatched a top @entity12 deputy , @entity222 @entity221 , to @entity223 to discuss the @entity40 talks with @entity23 officials , a senior @entity220 official told reporters on condition of anonymity
for years , international leaders have been fearful of the instability a nuclear - armed @entity7 could bring to the @entity231
those fears , for example , include the possibility of a pre-emptive @entity23 strike that could spark a broader conflict
in the past , @entity7 has threatened @entity23 with military attack
they also include concerns that an @entity7 bomb could spur other countries in the region to seek nuclear weapons of their own , leading to a spiraling arms race in the region
@entity23 is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons , though it has never declared itself to be a nuclear power
@entity0 's @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report .
