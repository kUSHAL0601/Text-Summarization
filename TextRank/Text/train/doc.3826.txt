-- throughout high school , @entity1 felt ashamed about being overweight
it was n't just his hefty size that depressed him , but the distance he felt growing between him and some of his closest friends
over four years , he watched as his friends steadily left him out of conversations , gave him the cold shoulder at school , and then started excluding him altogether from their friday night outings around @entity14 , @entity15
he was crushed , spending many evenings alone , feeling rejected
standing at 5 feet 7 inches , @entity1 hit his peak weight at 405 pounds when he was 19
" i would go home and ask my mom why this was happening to me , but i knew it was because of my weight , " he said
" when i would go out with my mom to pick up groceries or shopping , i would wait in the car because i was so embarrassed
" when he started @entity26 , he continued to struggle with those feelings
" i was having suicidal thoughts because of my weight
i even wrote a letter about it that my mom found , and she broke down crying , " he said
" i was tired of everything , tired of people laughing at me , tired of being overweight , tired of being treated differently , " he said
" i thought about committing suicide , but i did n't want to leave my mother by herself
" after discovering the letter in his bedroom , his mom said she knew something had to change
" i saw how depressed he was getting , and that 's what hurt me the most , " said his mother , @entity39
but she was not going to let him struggle on his own
she had recently lost more than 100 pounds after a scare from her cardiologist who said she was on the verge of having a heart attack because of her weight
that experience made her believe her son could lose the weight , too
" he was a junk - aholic , as i was
he had a sweet tooth
he was a snacker -- cakes , cookies , soda , chips , " she said
she was convinced that all her son needed was some guidance about moderation
but @entity1 just wanted the weight off
he came to her after many tearful nights and asked if he could get gastric bypass surgery
" i needed a change , " he said
as an employee at @entity71 's call center , his mother knew about the school 's wellness program @entity72 , which offers a 12 - month weight - loss program for employees and their family members
she wanted her son to lose weight , but she also wanted him to try natural methods before committing to surgery
so she made him a proposition : enroll in the program and try to lose weight naturally for the first few months
if that method failed , they would consider surgery
when he started in the program in july 2011 , his goal was to lose 40 pounds to qualify for gastric bypass surgery
at the start of the program , he was paired with a coach and a dietitian
@entity92 , a registered nurse and dietitian , helped him devise a plan to meet his weight - loss goals , which included cutting back on sweetened beverages , eating more fruits and vegetables , and being mindful of portion sizes
he regimented his diet , eating three meals a day and two healthy snacks in between his meals
@entity92 also encouraged @entity1 to get a gym membership
@entity1 had never worked out
he had played a few pickup games of basketball in middle school , but it was never strenuous
he was nervous and excited for the new experience , but a part of him was sure it was n't going to work
he held on to the hope that if he lost just a few pounds , it would be enough to convince his mom that he could do the gastric bypass surgery
as @entity1 started working out on the elliptical machine , walking on the treadmill and eating smaller portions , he saw big changes quickly
in the first week , he lost seven pounds
after a few weeks , he started walking 45 to 50 minutes every day on the treadmill with the incline set to high , at a speed that was almost a jog
after three months , he had dropped 40 pounds , and the urge to have surgery also dissipated
he was now spending two hours a day at the gym
" he became a changed person , " @entity92 said
he was like , ' i can do this
' i think that is so important for people , to have that confidence that they can succeed
" the salty and sweet snacks were traded in for healthy meals such as grilled chicken and brown rice for lunch and mostly grilled vegetables for dinner
@entity1 re-evaluated the way he approached food , choosing items such as whole grains and lean proteins to sustain his workouts , not high - calorie sweets to satisfy his cravings
" he just had to go to someone who could say , ' you can eat what you want , but in moderation , ' " his mother said
after completing the program in december 2012 , @entity1 was down to 280 pounds -- a loss of 125 pounds
but he wanted to be leaner
he started lifting weights on his own
whenever he came across a piece of gym equipment he was unsure about , he asked a gym staff member to show him how to use it
he discovered he liked lifting weights
" i liked the leg press
i never tried it , and i learned it works out your hamstrings and quads
when i starting incorporating it into my workouts , i saw improvements in my thighs , " he said
the added resistance helped him drop another 100 pounds within a year
in two years , he had managed to bring his weight down to 180 pounds , exceeding all his weight - loss expectations
now , happy with his weight , he continues to work out every day
he focuses on building muscle , not losing weight
he does cardio for 15 to 20 minutes and then puts energy toward sculpting his muscles by lifting weights and changing his fitness routine
the 23 - year - old even has a job that requires him to be fit
he works at a @entity184 warehouse and is on his feet lifting heavy boxes several hours a day
" if i did n't lose weight , i would n't be able to do this job , " he said
" there are people who work with me who look like they are fit , but they ca n't lift like i can
it really makes me want to keep staying in shape
" and his social life ? it took a dramatic turn for the better
he has new friends , and a few old ones who stuck by him while he was struggling with his weight
they get together weekly as a group and hang out
sometimes , he even runs into old classmates who shunned him when he was overweight
" now they ( say ) they are proud of me for losing weight , and that i am an inspiration , " he said
after losing 225 pounds , he said the biggest lesson he learned was not to lose sight of who he was under all that weight
" your life will change , but you do n't have to change , " he said
" you can look at things differently , but do n't change who you are just because you changed physically
... remember who was there for you and who stayed with you
