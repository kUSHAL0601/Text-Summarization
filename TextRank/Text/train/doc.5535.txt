@entity0 , @entity1 -- he did n't lose any friends or family on that tuesday in september of 2001 , but @entity6 achieved infamy that day , watching two of his flight school students commit murder as they steered two hijacked passenger jets into the @entity12 towers
today , he celebrates the death of @entity15 leader @entity14
" i wish i killed him , " he told @entity2
" like a lot of people , i wish i was the one
and bravo to everyone who was behind this
the head of the snake is gone
" @entity6 says he 's spent the past 10 years wondering why two terrorists would choose his @entity26 , @entity1 , flight school to practice for the day that will go down in @entity29 history as one of its greatest tragedies
now @entity14 may be gone , but the pain is not
" to realize he 's not there anymore takes some time ... it 's a deep emotion for me , " @entity6 said
" i do n't have that closure yet
i feel like it is buried
but it is fine and perfect that he 's out of the picture
" @entity42 ' life has been turned upside down ever since it became known that @entity43 and @entity44 came to his school , @entity45 , to get their multi-engine commercial pilot licenses in the summer of 2000
a year later , @entity43 piloted @entity47 into the north tower of the @entity12 and shortly after , @entity44 steered @entity49 into the south tower
@entity6 wrote a book about it , " @entity53 , " he says the title pretty much sums up the last 10 years of his life , filled with threats , forced to sell his business
" guilty by association is meant as a phrase to mean banks wo n't borrow you money
i ca n't get a job because i 'm related to 9/11 , " he claimed
and now , with the death of @entity14 , @entity6 is emotionally encouraged , but it 's only part of the healing
" ten years with this emotion , do you think it 's over in one day ? " he asked
" they want a scapegoat ... when i met people and they found out i was affiliated with this , they turned their back
" @entity6 no longer has a flight school
he was not able to secure financing , he believes , because of his ties to the 9/11 tragedy
he went into the swimming pool business for a while and today he runs a cellular phone business
he says that while the event remains heavy on his mind , he does not feel responsible
" is the grocery store responsible for keeping them alive , because they bought groceries there ? this is life
we 're all caught up in this , " he said
@entity6 says that both @entity43 and @entity44 never displayed any behaviors that would have labeled them as terrorists
at one point , he says , the two men were on the verge of being kicked out of the school because they did not appear to be taking their training seriously and were too busy fooling around and not listening to their instructors
they had to be warned , and went on to become average students , @entity6 said
" @entity104 was a more likable person
he laughed and joked , " said @entity6
" my employees called @entity43 ' dead man walking
' he had a white face and no emotions and was a nasty person , very unfriendly , " @entity6 told @entity2
the two future terrorists went on to pass the @entity113 commercial pilot 's test and were granted their licenses
" i did n't know what they were about to do , " @entity6 said
" i do n't feel guilty at all
i could n't do nothing about it
" i wish i could be a hero
i think about this often
why me ? but that 's fate
you ca n't turn away from fate , i guess
