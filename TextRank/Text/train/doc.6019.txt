@entity0 , @entity1 -- anyone who visits @entity0 would be struck by the resilience of its people , many of whom lost everything -- family , friends , homes -- when @entity13 battered the central @entity1 a year ago
but imagine if you were them for a moment : you 're told another storm , almost as powerful , is now heading for you
it 's a horrifying prospect
interactive : see the latest satellite and path of the storm this is a population used to frequent tropical storms and that was one of the problems in november 2013
so many people thought they could ride out the storm but did n't account for the deadly floodwaters from the storm surge that followed
and what followed has been well documented -- entire communities flattened and decomposing bodies strewn along the side of roads
a death toll that eventually exceeded 5,000 of this country 's most impoverished souls
nearly everyone here lost someone
barely 12 months later and the people of @entity0 , a name that will be forever associated with this disaster , have only started to recover , with many schools and homes rebuilt , businesses reopened and the scars of lost relatives and friends beginning to heal
the current storm in question -- @entity53 -- may not yet hit @entity0 , such is the chilling unpredictability of these weather systems , but the prospect of another massive storm so soon after @entity13 is enough to alarm people here
and that has spurred many to act
" i heard about the new storm on television , " @entity60 , a young mother , told @entity2 from outside her modest home on the edge of a dirt road into @entity0
" it scared me , i remembered last year , " she added
as she cradled her weeks - old son , she told us that her family would be evacuating and spending the next couple of nights in a hotel
" we have to hide somewhere to be safe
" last year , she said they did n't understand the dangers of a storm surge because the government had n't warned them
@entity60 's home was completely destroyed by @entity13
her new one -- little more than a rickety wooden shack -- took six months to complete , and only after they managed to get financial assistance from one of the many ngos and foundations active in the region
while the safety of her family was the priority , she appeared resigned to losing her second home
all they can do is tie down the corrugated iron roof
asked whether she 'd consider leaving @entity0 for good , her sister , @entity91 , interjected : " no , this is where we grew up
we 've been living here for almost 30 years , so it 's hard for us to leave somewhere and start a new life
" unfortunately , many of the homes of @entity0 's poorest rebuilt in the wake of @entity13 are little more than shanty - like structures located in areas extremely vulnerable to flooding and storm surges
the local government initially tried to ban them from these areas , but they eventually relented , such was the pressure to build new homes in the wake of @entity13
at one school on the outskirts of @entity0 , hundreds of families sought shelter in a school , setting up makeshift camps along corridors outside classrooms labeled " science lab " or " @entity120 , " and inside a massive sports hall
this is one of more than 60 evacuation centers dotted around the area
as we walked into the sports hall , we were greeted by hundreds of smiling faces -- mainly children , who clearly viewed this as an adventure
one middle - aged woman told us she 'd brought all 13 of her children along with her
another young mother said her husband insisted they leave their home despite the threat of losing their possessions to opportunist looters
she said memories of the @entity13 prompted them to look for somewhere safe to shelter
as we moved towards the @entity146 neighborhood , one of the worst - hit areas of @entity0 last year , the scars of @entity13 were evident , a single palm tree stood defiantly on the beach alongside a group of wrecked wooden shacks -- once the homes of entire families
this is a particularly poor neighborhood that sits along the water 's edge
many residents like @entity160 , 40 , have opted to evacuate too , though the police reportedly have orders to arrest anyone who ignores compulsory evacuation orders for this area anyway
with the incongruous sight of a young boy surfing in the background , @entity160 told us he and his family were inside when the waves started to lash their home during last year 's storm surge
" we were lucky , because the water made a hole in our wall that created a pocket for the water to pass through and not collapse it , " he said
" we managed to get to the second floor -- if it was n't for that hole , it would have collapsed and we 'd have been swept away
" and now we pray that this new storm just disappears
" while there 's a very real fear that last year could happen again , the situation in @entity0 is calm
the police and military are deployed here alongside an impressive number of foreign @entity188 and even soldiers from @entity191 's military
the feared run on supplies does n't seem to have materialized -- yet
while some businesses have boarded up and closed , others , including gas stations , do n't have long queues of people anxious to stock up .
