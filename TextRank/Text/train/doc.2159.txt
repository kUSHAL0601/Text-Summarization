the father of one of the two @entity3 women whose bodies were found in an upscale @entity6 apartment at the weekend has called for his daughter 's killer to be executed
police discovered the decomposing body of @entity11 , 25 , on saturday stuffed in a suitcase on the balcony of a 31st - floor apartment in @entity15 , a popular @entity6 nightlife district
another woman , @entity18 , 29 , was found on the floor of the apartment with her throat slashed
@entity23 's father , @entity22 , says his daughter 's killer deserves to die
" i demand that he gets the death penalty , " @entity22 told @entity26 affiliate @entity25 on tuesday
" if not , i can not accept it
he has already taken my daughter 's life , so he has to pay with his life
" but his demand will almost certainly go unfulfilled ; @entity6 abolished capital punishment more than two decades ago
@entity36 , a 29 - year - old @entity37 investment banker who lived in the apartment , has been charged with two counts of murder over the killings of the two women
he declined to enter a plea to the charges in a court appearance monday
father ' very shocked ' in documents submitted to the court , police say they believe @entity23 was killed on october 27 , five days before her body was found
@entity18 is thought to have been killed on saturday , the same day that police say @entity36 called them to the apartment
the @entity3 consulate in @entity6 said @entity23 may have entered @entity6 on october 4 and had permission to stay there until monday
she was from the @entity3 city of @entity56 , where her father and other family members are mourning her shocking death
@entity22 held two framed photos his daughter as he talked to @entity25 in the family 's yellow bungalow in @entity56
he told the news agency @entity64 that one of @entity23 's acquaintances in @entity6 told the family what had happened
" we were informed by telephone that our daughter was murdered , " @entity64 quoted him as saying
" i was very shocked , especially when i was informed that it was hard to identify the body
" families want remains repatriated @entity22 told @entity64 that @entity23 had first gone to @entity6 in 2011 to work as a domestic helper and then returned to @entity3 in 2013
she went back to @entity6 on two occasions after that , he said
the families of both victims have requested that the remains of the two women be returned to @entity3 for burial , @entity78 , a spokesman for the country 's @entity79 said wednesday
@entity3 authorities are working on repatriating the remains as soon as possible , he said , cautioning that it would take time
" i want her to be buried in @entity3 , " @entity22 told @entity64
@entity36 , who recently left his job with @entity91 , remains in custody until his next court appearance on november 10 .
