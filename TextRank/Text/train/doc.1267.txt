@entity0 -- @entity4 authorities were investigating wednesday after finding the dismembered bodies of 15 people inside two vehicles on a highway in western @entity0 , state media reported
investigators were working to determine the ages , genders and identities of the victims , @entity10 state attorney general @entity9 said
the bodies , found in two vehicles on a highway between the cities of @entity20 and @entity21 , could be connected with the kidnapping of 12 people in a nearby municipality , @entity16 said , according to the state - run @entity26 news agency
the discovery occurred more than five months after authorities found 26 bodies in three vehicles near a monument on one of @entity20 's main avenues
@entity10 state has seen an increase in violence since 2008 , as clashes increase between drug cartels over trafficking routes and local drug sales
several weeks after the bodies were found in november , state prosecutors said they had arrested three men who masterminded those killings
the suspects , they said , were members of the @entity48 cartel , which is allied with the @entity49 and fighting for territory in the region with the powerful @entity47
more than 47,000 people have been killed in drug - related violence since @entity4 president @entity54 announced a crackdown on cartels in december 2006 , according to government statistics
but brutal cartel killings have been less common in @entity20 , @entity0 's second-most populous city
