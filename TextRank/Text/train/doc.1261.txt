-- the peace of mind @entity2 sought for herself and her children when she left @entity5 nearly two decades ago was shattered outside @entity6 on wednesday morning
" it was total chaos , " @entity2 said
" the kids were n't sure if they were supposed to stay in school or leave
they were n't letting anybody in and told us to stay back
there were ambulances running past us
i was able to see a lot of the parents that i know who have children in the high school
" the middle school sits across a field from the @entity25 high school where a stabbing spree injured 21 people , authorities said
a suspect , 16 - year - old sophomore @entity28 , was taken into custody and arraigned wednesday afternoon on charges of attempted homicide
speaking at a news conference wednesday afternoon , @entity33 said that before authorities arrived assistant principal @entity35 was " very admirable " in tackling the suspect and holding him for authorities with the help of another assistant principal , @entity40
gov. @entity41 told reporters that there were " a number of heroes in this day " and " many of them are students " who stayed behind to help injured classmates
he said teachers , cafeteria workers , other staff members and school police officer @entity53 -- who was injured but who handcuffed the suspect -- ensured that others made it out safely
" this is obviously a very difficult day for this community , " the governor said
@entity2 , who has three children in the high school in addition to one in the middle school , was not surprised @entity35 was being praised for tackling the suspect
" he 's just a wonderful man , " she said
" he would do anything for your child
he would make sure he would get in touch with you if there were issues
he was very conscientious of what was happening within the friendships that they had
just an all - around great guy
" she added , " he would have done it for a stranger or a student or parent
but he was all about the kids so i am not surprised at all that he did try to get involved in stopping this
" @entity85 , with a population of about 20,000 , is a quiet middle - class enclave roughly 20 miles east of @entity5 on @entity87
" it was very shocking , " said @entity2 , who has lived in @entity85 19 years
" we are a tight - knit community
even the doctor attending at the closest hospital is a neighbor of ours
dr. ( @entity96 ) @entity95 , he knows these children
watching him , it touches home
" as she spoke on the phone to @entity0 , she said @entity95 , chief medical officer at @entity102 in nearby @entity103 , was live on the television news , talking about the victims and stressing " the critical nature of their injuries
" " we are so small compared to other communities , " @entity2 said
" we know each other
for myself , coming from the city of @entity5 , i came out here purposely to raise my children in a school district that we felt was safe as well as academically sound
it 's a lot to take in right now
" at @entity118 in @entity85 , @entity119 , a 1990 graduate of @entity121 , said some parents were having breakfast after dropping off their children at school
" they just kind of hung out until they got a hold of their children and made sure they were ok , " she said
" they had instructions not to go to the school
you could see the tension on their faces as they waited
" a message on the @entity6 's website said all of its elementary schools were closed after the incident , and " the middle school and high school students are secure
" @entity121 will be closed " over the next several days , " district superintendent @entity146 said
the district 's middle school and elementary schools will be open thursday , and counseling will be available for the whole district , he said
@entity2 said she was running late getting her 13 - year - old daughter to the middle school wednesday morning
by the time they arrived , they had heard about the stabbings on the news
" she did n't believe it , " @entity2 said of her daughter
" she wanted to get down there as soon as possible
once we got there , not knowing if her friends were ok , she started getting emotional
" three of @entity2 's four children attended @entity121 , she said
one of her daughters graduated last year and is now a freshman at @entity170
" you see stuff like this all the time on the news , but you do n't know the people , " she said
" here , we know quite a few of the families of the injured students
" at the @entity181 , @entity180 cried when she heard about what happened at the school attended by her nephews and nieces
she said she later learned that they were fine
" it 's heartbreaking , " she said
" it 's a nice community
the people are very friendly and hard - working
it 's so sad for everyone involved
something has been taken away forever in your safe community
you see these kids , and you know they 're hurt and they 'll probably have lifelong pain from this
