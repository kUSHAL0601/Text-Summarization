@entity0 -- four decades since @entity3 , and little , it seems , has changed
the january 22 , 1973 , @entity6 decision legalizing abortion remains the law of the land , passions remain high on both sides of the issue , and protests are held each year on its anniversary
access to abortion , then and now , is about more than simple legalities
social , religious and family values , as well as finances and politics , still play a role in shaping the abortion issue , but many legal and medical experts say the debate has become entrenched
" much of the controversy about abortion is really stimulated by the interest groups on both sides of the political question , rather than by ordinary @entity33 , " said @entity25 , a law professor at the @entity27 , and a longtime @entity6 scholar
" the @entity33 people and many political leaders have already made up their minds about legal abortion
" public opinion on abortion has remained stable over the years
a @entity1 / @entity40 survey last august found 44 % said abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances , while 52 % said only under few or no circumstances
and 88 % said the procedure should be allowed when the woman 's life is in danger ; 83 - percent said so in cases of rape or incest
the margin of error was plus - or - minus 3 points
the @entity3 decision did not prompt " abortion on demand , " as many opponents of the procedure had predicted it would
nor have various legislatures or court rulings restricted access as much as some supporters claim
research from the @entity64 finds the number of abortions at its lowest level since @entity3 , remaining steady at about 1.2 million reported procedures in the year 2011 , down 25 - percent since the all - time high in 1990
bans on abortion in the @entity33 began early in the 19th century
@entity71 in 1812 became first state to outlaw them , specifically after " quickening , " the time in the pregnancy when the woman starts to feel fetal movements
the laws were designed primarily to protect women from dangerous " back alley " abortions
these laws were also ambiguous , given the @entity82 moral code that stifled debate on so personal a subject as unwanted pregnancies
since then , movements have come and gone to relax the restrictions or to give women more choice , but such efforts mostly went nowhere
it was not until the 1960s that an organized movement was launched to ease the laws regulating abortions
medical technology had advanced to the point where they could be done safely by trained medical staff in clean , professional environments
by the early 1970s , a number of states had changed their laws , though most did so in very limited ways
survey : few religious groups want decision overturned despite abortion views the legal fights culminated with @entity3 , the court 's 7 - 2 decision giving women a qualified constitutional right to abortion during most of the pregnancy
the court , in fact , heard two cases around the same time : @entity3 ( aka @entity119 , who has since become an abortion opponent ) , which challenged a @entity123 law banning abortions except to save the woman 's life ; and @entity127 , involving a @entity129 law requiring that abortions be performed only in accredited hospitals and only after a review by a hospital staff committee and an exam by two doctors other than the woman 's physician
the @entity3 and @entity139 rulings affected laws in 46 states
for the justices , @entity3 reflected earlier cases involving the right to privacy
that " right , " wrote justice @entity147 in the main opinion for the court , is " broad enough to encompass a woman 's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy
" " prior to @entity3 , " said @entity25 , " whether one could obtain a legal abortion in the face of an unwanted pregnancy was a crapshoot
for 40 years now , it 's been a constitutionally guaranteed right
" he is the 1994 author of " @entity160 : the @entity161 to @entity162 and the @entity163
" but the ruling was a qualified one , and that fact has been used by abortion opponents in their efforts to narrow the scope of other abortion provisions
@entity147 noted that the state 's " important interests in safeguarding health , maintaining medical standards , and protecting potential life " are compelling enough to justify regulation " at some point in pregnancy
" that " qualified right " found its form in the controversial " trimester analysis " laid out by the justices in @entity3 : permitting no government regulation during the first three months of a pregnancy ; allowing limited regulation in the second trimester to protect the woman 's health and safety ; and granting government the power to ban abortions during the third trimester -- a time when , medical consensus has concluded , the fetus is capable of living on its own
that reasoning has outraged abortion opponents and puzzled many legal scholars
" the better argument for the result reached in @entity3 , " said @entity201 -- a former law clerk for @entity147 and an author of " @entity203 : @entity211 , @entity212 , and @entity213 " -- " is that it 's necessary for the equality of women , rather than grounding it in the privacy right
" after @entity3 , the high court affirmed the right to abortion in subsequent cases : striking down provisions requiring a husband 's consent for a first - trimester abortion ; requiring parental consent for an unmarried woman under 18 ; striking down efforts to expand on laws requiring women to give informed consent before having an abortion ; striking down a 24 - hour waiting period ; and striking down a law requiring doctors to inform women of the risks and of assistance available if she were to carry the fetus to term
but there was one notable victory for abortion opponents : a ban on the use of taxpayer funds to finance abortions for poor women
the abortion issue has been revisited several times since @entity3 , most famously in @entity247 ( 1989 ) and @entity248 ( 1992 )
opinion : if @entity250 had @entity3 @entity247 ( a 5 - 4 decision ) upheld major parts of a @entity254 abortion law that prohibited the use of public facilities or the participation of public employees in abortions , and required doctors to test the viability of the fetus before an performing any abortion
justices @entity264 , @entity266 and @entity267 said they would allow restrictions on abortion , but only if the restrictions had a rational basis
more important , the three conservative justices said , a compelling government interest need not be required to justify restrictions on abortion
that was a blow for anti-abortion forces
then came the @entity248 ruling , in which the justices outlined their views on @entity3
the decision ( also 5 - 4 ) reaffirmed the heart of @entity3 while giving states the power to regulate procedures so long as they did not impose an " undue burden " on a woman 's right to abortion
the standard : undue burden exists if " the purpose and effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability
" the ruling left supporters on both sides of the issue dissatisfied , feeling it was ambiguous
justice @entity303 joined neither opinion , saying there was nothing in it to justify reconsidering @entity3
nevertheless , @entity147 wrote , " the right to reproductive choice " was in danger of being overturned
another legacy of @entity3 : the head - counting of justices on the court , a what - if scenario that could lead to the overturning of @entity3
the current 5 - 4 conservative majority might shift in either direction if two or more justices leave the bench in the next few years , as is widely expected
in the meantime , conservatives in @entity323 have promised to push for tougher restrictions on access to abortion , though many political experts say the goal is not necessarily aimed at overturning @entity3
they found success five years ago when the justices , in a 5 - 4 ruling , upheld a federal ban on a controversial late - term procedure , rejecting concerns the law did n't take into account the physical safety of the woman
the procedure -- called " partial birth abortion " by its critics -- is typically performed in the middle - to - late second trimester
the legal sticking point was that the law lacked a " health exception " for women who might suffer serious medical complications , something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions
the swing vote , as in previous cases , came from @entity267
in angry dissent , justice @entity355 , then the lone woman on the high court , called the majority 's conclusions " alarming " and said they " can not be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court , and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women 's lives
" @entity355 has long been a leading voice for gender equality
ironically , some of the opposition to her 1993 nomination to the high court came from feminists , who did not like her criticism over the legal reasoning of @entity3
she believed a more gradual liberalization to abortion would have kept the issue back in the states , avoiding the social and political upheaval that has been part of @entity3 's legacy
the law on abortion was evolving at the time of @entity3 , @entity355 recalled in 2005
" the @entity6 stopped all that by deeming every law -- even the most liberal -- as unconstitutional
that seemed to me not the way courts generally work
" but @entity355 , in her rulings , has upheld a woman 's reproductive choice
" when government controls that decision for her , she 's being treated as less than a full adult human being responsible for her own choices , " she said during her confirmation
if there is one overriding legacy of the @entity3 decision , it may be that it opened and expanded the debate on the rights of women , sexuality , health care , and medical decisions
issues like cloning , stem cells , and fetal research have become part of the national lexicon
as significant as it was , @entity3 was only the beginning of the battle .
