-- @entity2 golfer @entity1 banished the ghosts of her nightmare final round at the @entity5 when she clinched the @entity6 by three shots on sunday
the 26 - year - old , whose grandfather died on the eve of the tournament at @entity12 in @entity13 , claimed the first title of her professional career in the first of four major events in the 2011 women 's season
" everybody in the family knew that he would have wanted me to finish out this week , " she told the @entity21 website
" i mean , he lived via my golf
he loved watching it on tv
he recorded it every week so he could keep watching it over and over again
" but him and my grandma , they both got to see me play the whole round today and they were out there with me , for sure
" @entity34 , who won an unofficial rain - shortened @entity21 event as an amateur in her native @entity38 in 2007 , had looked set to follow that up three years ago when she led the @entity41 heading into the last day , but a final - round 78 ended her hopes of glory
it was a different story this time , though , as the world number 28 overhauled top - ranked defending champion @entity46 of @entity47 to finish on 13 under par after a round of 69
" it does n't even feel real yet , " said @entity34 , who turned pro in 2008 four years after having a titanium rod and five screws put in her back to cure her teenage problems with scoliosis
" i do n't know
i 'm still trying to figure out if i actually won , but i played so good today and i was just proud of the way i hung in there
" the victory was all but assured for @entity34 on the 17th hole , when she held a tricky putt while three - time major winner @entity46 recorded a bogey
" probably the look on my face was i was shocked it went in , too , honestly , " said @entity34 of her finish on the penultimate hole
" it was a putt you had to hit on the perfect line with the perfect speed for it to go in
" @entity46 , who has won four titles already this year , closed with 74 to finish three shots back
" i did my best
i tried my best today , and i did n't give her any shots today
so i hung in there until the last putt and smiled the whole way , whole day
so it was good and it was very good experience for me this time , " the 22 - year - old said
" @entity85 is golf , so this is normal
i just did n't play well
and hopefully next tournament will be good , and i just really want to congratulate @entity1
" @entity2 @entity88 achieved her first top - 10 finish at a major since 2006 after ending the weekend sixth on three - under following a closing 69 , leaving the 21 - year - old one shot behind third - placed compatriots @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 .
