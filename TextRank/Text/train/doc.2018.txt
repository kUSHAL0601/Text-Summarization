@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 forces have captured a disputed oil - rich area along the border with @entity1 , escalating tensions between the two longtime rivals and threatening a return to war
@entity1 claims the oil fields in the town of @entity13 , which account for about half of the nation 's oil production
a spokesman for @entity1 's military said wednesday that his country 's soldiers have been defending the territory from attacks by @entity24 forces for the past two days
@entity1 's military now occupies oil fields and other areas of @entity13 , according to @entity27 , the spokesman
" that is @entity1 , " he said
" @entity29 has refused to demarcate the border
we know where the border is
" @entity1 also claims ownership of @entity13 and lodged complaints with the @entity36 @entity35 and the @entity37 on wednesday , urging them to pressure @entity1 to withdraw troops from its territory
@entity1 's parliament approved " general mobilization " of the country 's resources to support the military
it also voted to withdraw from negotiations with @entity1 that have been ongoing since the @entity1 declared independence last july
@entity27 called the parliamentary decisions " a public relations exercise " and accused @entity1 of carrying out attacks even during the peace talks
" there was no negotiation as far as i am concerned , " he said
" the @entity54 ( @entity1 military ) at the border were being bombed even when the politicians were talking
" @entity1 has repeatedly bombed southern territory since independence , including the november attack of a refugee camp in the neighboring nation 's @entity61
@entity1 fought a two - decade civil war against the government in @entity29 , which led to secession
when they separated , @entity1 acquired three quarters of @entity1 's oil reserves
the two countries have been locked in negotiations about how much the landlocked @entity1 should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north
in late july , @entity1 halted oil production after accusing @entity1 of " stealing " $ 815 million worth of its crude
@entity1 said it confiscated the oil to make up for unpaid fees
the @entity37 - led negotiations also cover other outstanding issues since secession , including the status of citizens of both countries who find themselves living on either side of the world 's newest international border
the fate of the @entity90 region and other disputed border areas are also a point of contention
@entity24 president @entity94 was scheduled to travel to the southern capital of @entity96 earlier this month to meet with his counterpart @entity97
the presidents were to sign agreements on citizenship and border demarcation , but @entity29 canceled the trip after fighting broke out along the border
@entity1 's sovereignty officially broke @entity107 's largest nation into two , the result of a referendum last year overwhelmingly approved by voters
the referendum was part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of civil war pitting a government dominated by @entity116 in the north against black @entity118 and animists in the south
the war killed about 2 million people .
