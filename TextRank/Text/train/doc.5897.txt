a daring raid by @entity1 and @entity3 forces into an @entity5 stronghold in @entity3 freed eight hostages , but not before kidnappers stole away with some @entity8 , including an @entity1
the raid took place monday , according to an @entity1 official and information posted on a @entity13 website associated with the country 's @entity14
the mission was planned after @entity5 militants were seen transferring hostages " chained and covered with blankets " into pickups that were driven to a cave about 68 miles ( 109 kilometers ) from @entity22 , according to the website
the intelligence included that there were foreigners among the hostages , so " a plan was established in order to raid the cave , " according to the @entity3 government account of the operation
the details were attributed to a @entity3 special forces member who was on the raid
the troops , equipped with advanced weapons , including night vision equipment , launched the mission about 4 miles from the cave , according to the @entity3 government
the kidnappers were found about 100 yards from the cave , and " clashes erupted " soon , according to the account provided by the special forces member
all seven kidnappers were killed
the special forces troops found eight hostages chained up
they told the rescue team that two days earlier , kidnappers had moved five others , including an @entity1 , a @entity50 , a @entity51 and a @entity3
the fifth was believed to be a @entity54 citizen
while the @entity3 version does not mention @entity1 involvement , an @entity1 official confirmed to @entity58 that @entity59 were part of the raid team
@entity58 learned of the @entity1 involvement this week but , at the request of the government , did not report the information as there was a search for the @entity1 hostage .
