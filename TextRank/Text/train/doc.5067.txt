@entity0 , @entity1 -- three witnesses whose testimony could absolve a 14 - year - old @entity1 girl facing life in prison have changed their statements
it 's the latest twist in the case of @entity11 , a @entity12 teenager who was charged more than a month ago under @entity1 's blasphemy laws for allegedly burning pages of @entity16 's holy book for cooking fuel
she has denied the charges
the three witnesses initially told police they saw @entity21 , a @entity22 cleric , tear pages out of a copy of the @entity25 and put them with police evidence that led to the charges against @entity11
but they recanted those statements on monday at a bail hearing for the cleric , according to the imam 's lawyer , @entity31
a fourth witness stood by his initial statement
the witnesses are a critical part of the police investigation that determined last week that the imam framed the teen
based on that investigation and a lack of witnesses , her lawyers are now appealing to have the blasphemy charges dismissed
the teen 's case has sparked international outcry against the @entity1 government , with some saying the blasphemy laws are used to settle scores and persecute religious minorities
@entity0 's police chief accused the three witnesses of lying to the court on monday , and said investigators never pressured the witnesses when they gave their initial statements against the cleric
" if they have changed their statements , they are just lying , " chief @entity59 said
police arrested @entity11 in august after her neighbor accused her of burning quran pages to for cooking fuel , investigators said
the neighbor began to shout in protest , drawing a crowd that grew angry
some neighbors said the teenager was beaten
others said she ran back home and locked herself inside
when police arrived , they arrested her
@entity11 's lawyers said the neighbor wanted to settle a personal score with the girl because the two did n't get along
they said it 's likely that he liked the teen and she did n't feel the same
the lawyers say that no one actually saw @entity11 burning the papers , but that the neighbor went to @entity21 with the bags
according to police , @entity21 was n't certain that simply burning pages with texts from the @entity25 would be enough to convict @entity11 on blasphemy charges
so , he added two pages from the actual holy book to the bag to bolster the case , they said
in addition to charges of tampering with evidence , @entity21 could also face blasphemy charges as a result of the police investigation
the pursuit of the accusations against the cleric is significant in @entity1 because " never before has a false accuser been held accountable , " according to @entity107 , the @entity1 director of @entity108
after her arrest in august , @entity11 had been held in an adult jail before she was released on bail in september
a local court transferred her case to the juvenile court last week after the police investigation said she had been framed
@entity117 will consider the petition to drop the charges against @entity11 on october 17 , said @entity120 , the teen 's leading lawyer
if the charges are not dismissed , her case will proceed in juvenile court
having her case transferred to juvenile court " is a precursor to the case ending , " said @entity124
" that is quite unprecedented in the 25 - year history of @entity1 's blasphemy laws , " he said last week
it 's unclear how the change in statements from the key witnesses will affect her case
blasphemy laws were first instituted to keep peace between religions
actions perceived as insults to @entity16 provoke fierce reactions in the predominantly @entity22 nation , as demonstrated by the recent angry protests in response to an anti-islam film produced in the @entity147 and made available online
there have been 1,400 blasphemy cases since the laws were first enacted in 1986 , according to @entity108
there are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in @entity1 , and 52 people have been killed while facing trial for the charge , he said
@entity11 and her family spoke to @entity2 last month from an undisclosed location after she was released on bail
the teen denied that she defiled the @entity25
she said she was happy to be with her family , but feared for her life
" i 'm scared , " she said by phone
" i 'm afraid of anyone who might kill us
" no matter how her case pans out , it 's unclear what kind of life she might be able to have
aid groups in the @entity147 , @entity174 and @entity175 have offered the teen and her family a home outside @entity1 , a family representative said
but she has said she wants to stay in her home country .
