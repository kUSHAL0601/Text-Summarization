@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity6 leader arrested in @entity1 after a bombing in @entity8 will be held separately from other prisoners until a bail hearing next week , his lawyer said tuesday
a judge in @entity0 court ruled tuesday that @entity13 will have his bail hearing october 14 , said attorney @entity15
" the prosecution has indicated they plan to oppose his release on bail , but i am confident our application will be successful , " said @entity16 , who wanted @entity13 separated from the general prison population for his safety
charged in @entity1 under terrorism legislation , @entity13 is suspected of being a leader of the @entity27 , known as @entity27 , which took responsibility for the bombings that killed 12 and injured 50 in @entity8 's capital , @entity31 , on friday
the bombings came as the @entity34 country celebrated 50 years of independence
@entity27 issued a statement saturday saying it had given the @entity8 government advance warning and blamed the government for the deaths
the @entity40 said monday that nine people have been arrested and they were being questioned in connection with the blasts
authorities are still seeking two men , identified as @entity46 and @entity47 , whom they accuse of being the " masterminds " of the plot
sources close to @entity27 told @entity2 that the two men are " not known to be @entity27 operatives or known to be active on the @entity6 issue
" they also raised concerns about the nine other arrests , calling them an " attempt by the @entity8 government to be seen to act
" @entity8 president @entity59 has appointed @entity60 , his former chief of defense staff , to be the country 's national security adviser in the wake of the bombings , @entity59 's office told @entity2 on monday
@entity59 later called the action a terrorist attack that was designed to " disrupt " the anniversary , presidential spokesman @entity66 said
but he said it had nothing to do with @entity6 issues or @entity27
@entity27 , which represents militants in the oil - rich @entity6 , is an umbrella organization of several rebel groups
it has been battling the government for years over fairer distribution of the country 's oil wealth
@entity27 said @entity13 had been harassed by authorities in @entity1 , where he lives , but denied his involvement
" @entity13 has never been involved in any @entity27 operations but has always been blamed for every attack , which is strange to us , " @entity27 's statement said
@entity27 said the " irresponsible attitude of the government security forces is to blame for the loss of lives
" " the security forces were also warned one full hour to the first bomb blast ahead of the general alert sent to the media and told to steer the public from all parked cars which was not done , " the group said in a statement
@entity2 's @entity98 contributed to this report .
