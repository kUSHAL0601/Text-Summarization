-- @entity2 's decision to allow the uploading and sharing of extreme / graphic content -- including beheadings -- makes no sense in a conventional media setting
most western media outlets operate under regulatory codes that make the screening or publishing of such material unthinkable -- not least because their audience might include children
inevitably the " protection of children " argument will be rehearsed in response to @entity2 's decision , which seems almost designed to court negative commentary

internet content is of course regulated and controlled but not very effectively so
the decision may also offer the genuinely weird and definitively 21st century prospect of @entity32 and @entity34 security services using @entity2 to track global viewing patterns of beheading videos

what should @entity2 users take from the site 's decision that it is ok to screen and view the brutal beheading of a woman in @entity54 -- provided that the commentary clearly does n't glorify the act and that any unsuitable comments are moderated / blocked ? is it only that brutal violence is part of life and we have the right to make the obvious comments about that fact
as @entity2 's statement says : " @entity2 has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences , particularly when they 're connected to controversial events on the ground , such as human rights abuses , acts of terrorism and other violent events
" people share videos of these events on @entity2 to condemn them
if they were being celebrated , or the actions in them encouraged , our approach would be different
" apart from an increased volume of utterly banal denunciations of the act ( only the " right " kinds of statements will be allowed ) what could the screening of such events lead to ? people who feel that violence is wrong will say so , people who make @entity93 Â© or bad - taste jokes will make them , and so the chatter will go on
in 2003 , the @entity34 military clamped - down on active service personnel 's trading of explicit smart - phone images of the aftermath of suicide bombings in @entity102
so , the potential cultural power of such images can be recognised by liberals , conservatives , and bodies such as the @entity108 alike -- even if they fundamentally disagree about what that power is
equally , it 's not safe to accept the treatment of such footage as a set of taboo " magic objects , " which can never be seen because they are inherently so dangerous in their ability to corrupt the majority and the minors
such anxieties are frequently directed at unspecified ( ie : less educated than " us " -- less middle - class ) mass audiences and are another means of closing down challenge or debate
what is at stake here does seem to be a realignment of sadly well - known patterns
these are simply thrown into sharp relief by the specifics of the examples that are being spoken about today
@entity2 kills search privacy setting ' laughably inconsistent ' @entity2 sees it as a legitimate service to allow its audience to see a woman being brutally killed and then host discussion of that content , but will not allow its users to see exposed breasts -- for fear of causing offense
is it possible for @entity2 to argue that there is nothing to debate in the representation of women 's bodies ? or that they are not part of people 's experience ? this is -- at best -- laughably inconsistent
one of the primary reasons for carrying out beheadings in public or for perpetrators to video a violent act is to send the clear message to its audience : this is what our " law " or " power " , or violence can do to you
so , the re-showing of such footage on @entity2 is actively collusive with those actions
it disseminates the fear and intimidation intended in the act
asserting that @entity2 users can respond to footage of a woman 's brutal murder by decrying it , sidesteps that issue
users could just as well decry violence against women without seeing this act
but fewer of them may do so
if @entity2 really was interested in public debate , it would have established a real and carefully constructed , open forum in which this decision could be debated -- as well as other issues about its policies , operation and inconsistent stances
what @entity2 is interested in , is generating more traffic through its platform and it is doing so from within a pretty inconsistent , narrowly male and conservative image of the world and of what should be discussed within it
how different is that from many traditional media organizations of the 19th and 20th centuries ? read more : twitter cracks down on abusive tweets the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .
