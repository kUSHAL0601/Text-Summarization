@entity0 is under pressure in parts of @entity4 and battling a variety of adversaries in @entity7 , but it 's metastasizing at warp speed elsewhere , most dangerously in @entity9 and @entity10
it also has support in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14
and the leader of the group ravaging northern @entity17 , @entity18 , has expressed his admiration of @entity0 leader @entity20
the savage killing of 21 @entity9 @entity22 in @entity10 -- all of them dressed in @entity0 ' trademark orange prison garb -- is another indication of @entity0 ' ability to take advantage of collapsed or collapsing states and of its growing presence in @entity30
most significantly , the atrocity took place in @entity33 , a long way from @entity0 ' first stronghold around @entity36 in the east of the country
@entity0 ' presence in @entity33 , a town of 50,000 , has been growing
the @entity9 were abducted in november , and more recently , the extremists strengthened their presence by taking over government buildings and a radio station
@entity0 first announced itself in @entity10 in october
amateur video showed a large crowd of militants in @entity36 affiliated with the @entity47 for the @entity48 chanting their allegiance to @entity50
sources told @entity1 at the time that @entity0 had up to 800 fighters in the area as well as training facilities in the nearby @entity55
they were bolstered by the return from @entity7 and @entity4 of up to 300 @entity10 jihadists
a short while later , @entity50 recognized three @entity10 " provinces " : @entity59 ( in the east ) , @entity61 ( west ) and @entity62 ( south ) as being part of the " caliphate
" since then , @entity0 has stepped up its presence across @entity10
late last month , a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital , @entity70 , killed 10 people , including an @entity72
the attack was swiftly claimed by @entity74 , @entity0 ' name for the province
politicians in @entity70 disputed the claim
@entity0 has also been active in southern @entity10 , attacking a @entity10 army checkpoint in @entity80 in january and killing 16 people
while a growing presence , the @entity10 affiliate is some ways from being able to mimic @entity0 in @entity7 and @entity4 , with its bureaucracy and governing structure
@entity87 of @entity88 says that " even in the jihadi stronghold of @entity36 , ( @entity0 ) does not rule independent of a broader coalition of like - minded , but ultimately distinct groups
" " while @entity0 may prove to be an enduring terrorist threat in @entity10 , it is very unlikely to be able to develop to the point where it controls a meaningful amount of territory , " @entity87 says
but as in @entity4 and @entity7 , @entity0 has launched an effective social media campaign in @entity10
it has also made a concerted effort to attract seasoned fighters from other groups , such as @entity101
@entity0 @entity10 affiliate has also started to exercise some forms of social control in areas where it is strong
" the group has publicized hisba activities such as burning cigarette cartons ; destroying water pipes used for smoking ; demolishing " polytheistic " statues and shrines , " says @entity107 of the @entity108
hours after the @entity9 air force carried out retaliatory airstrikes monday , the @entity116 warned that " leaving the situation as it is in @entity10 without a firm intervention to curtail these terrorist organizations would be a threat to international peace and security
" the @entity126 government has suggested an international peacekeeping presence in @entity10
@entity126 is acutely aware that it 's the jumping - off point for a growing flow of migrants and a base camp for terrorism , just hours across the @entity133
@entity134 , @entity135 envoy to @entity10 , has floated the idea of international monitors when a peace agreement between rival factions is hammered out
but " when " seems a long way off , despite the beginning of talks between rival factions in @entity144
and @entity72 and @entity146 officials fear that putting boots on the ground would be a bug light to @entity0 supporters
in a recent interview with the @entity152 , @entity134 admitted that " terrorism is becoming a problem beyond the east [ of @entity10
] it is growing into the west and now the south , and from the west they might go to @entity161 and @entity162
" @entity87 agrees there is a risk to @entity161
there are hundreds of @entity161 among @entity0 ' ranks in @entity7 and @entity4 , and the government is already battling a jihadist presence at home in the @entity170
" although @entity161 security services have improved their capabilities in the last 24 months , they fear that they would be overwhelmed by the emergence of a cross-border threat originating in @entity10 , " @entity87 says
while @entity10 is @entity0 ' most notable franchise , jihadists in @entity9 have made the vast @entity179 desert almost ungovernable
chief among them is @entity0 ' freshly minted @entity182 , formerly called @entity183
late in january , it killed at least 30 people in a series of co-ordinated attacks on security outposts , leading @entity9 president @entity188 to shake up the military command in the @entity179
and just last week , it released a video showing the beheading of eight alleged spies
with @entity197 on one side and a military - dominated government in @entity195 on the other , @entity182 has powerful enemies close by
" that said , " writes @entity204 , a leading scholar of jihadist movements , " if the @entity9 government continues to operate in a brazen manner , militarily it will create new local recruits that could sustain the @entity202 in north @entity179
" less developed but worth monitoring are self - declared supporters of @entity0 in @entity14 and @entity13 , which the group now calls the province of @entity210
one of them was a former @entity213 commander , mullah @entity212 , who was killed a week ago in a drone strike in @entity215
he had split from the @entity213 , and analysts are watching for further fragmentation of the group
several commanders of the @entity14 @entity213 also pledged to @entity50 , but it 's unclear yet whether their departure has more to do with the rifts that have torn the group apart in the last two years
the @entity222 concluded that most of the new isis group were low - to mid-level militants -- a sign of " the competition between smaller and emerging militant groups in @entity228 , some of which are seeking to align with the @entity202 brand
the most intriguing development in recent months has been the desire of the @entity17 group @entity18 to fly the @entity0 flag , literally and metaphorically
it has begun to hold territory and talk of its own caliphate in northern @entity17
its propaganda machine has become much more @entity0 - like
and it has incorporated the @entity0 symbol into its own flag
it has also begun inflicting ever more gruesome punishments , including beheadings , on its victims
@entity18 's leader , @entity244 , has expressed his admiration for @entity0 and @entity20 on more than one occasion -- but @entity0 has not officially acknowledged any link between the two groups
for now at least , it is the long coast of @entity10 and its deep empty interior , its lack of government and many porous borders that seem the most promising territory for @entity0 .
