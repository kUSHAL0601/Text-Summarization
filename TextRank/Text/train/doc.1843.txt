the manhunt for @entity10 ended saturday when cadaver dogs discovered his body in @entity1 's @entity17 , about a mile from where his red @entity18 was found more than a week earlier , police said
" @entity10 's body was found in a small dugout area in the ground , covered with leaves and debris , and it was apparent that he took significant steps to try to conceal his body from being located , " a statement from @entity0 police said
law enforcement officials determined that @entity10 , 57 , committed suicide after killing his wife , @entity31 , 47 , @entity32 , 40 , and @entity33 , 63 , outside a theater in @entity0 on april 25
another @entity1 professor , @entity35 , believes that she was also targeted by @entity10 but escaped because she was at a movie theater the day of the slayings
in an e-mail obtained by @entity2 , @entity38 had warned her colleagues at the university 's @entity41 that @entity10 , a marketing professor , was " dangerous
" the e-mail was sent after the shootings but before @entity10 's body was found
@entity38 could not be reached tuesday , but in her e-mail she said that law enforcement officials surrounded her house early on the morning of may 1 after authorities found @entity51 directions to her house , printed on april 24 , in @entity53
she said she was advised to go into hiding
" i do not believe @entity10 had a map to my house for any reason other than he planned to kill me as well on april 25 , " @entity38 wrote
" this also suggests premeditation for the three murders he did commit
by the grace of @entity62 , i was at the movies all saturday afternoon after being at school in my office ( like a sitting duck ) all that morning
" all three of @entity10 's victims were associated with the @entity70 theater group , which was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings
police did not give any motive for the slayings but said in a statement that @entity10 and his wife were having marital problems
@entity10 targeted @entity32 and shot him first , the statement added
authorities said @entity10 arrived while the @entity70 event was under way and got into a disagreement with @entity84
police believe that he left , went to his car -- where the couple 's children apparently were waiting -- and returned with two handguns
in addition to the three deaths , two people were wounded , police said
after the shootings , @entity10 , a marketing professor at the @entity41 , drove to his hometown of @entity95 , @entity1 , and left his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- with a neighbor
authorities put out bulletins across the nation for @entity10 after the shootings and revealed that he had purchased an airline ticket in march for a may 2 flight to the @entity105 , where he owned a house
but @entity10 never showed up at the airport .
