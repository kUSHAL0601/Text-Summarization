-- @entity1 was rightly shocked by the brutal , videotaped murder of @entity4 journalist @entity3
but we should not have been surprised
the @entity6 , as the jihadist group calls itself , has murdered , raped and savaged its way across borders in the @entity10 and into the headlines as the latest terrorist foe from the region
@entity3 's murder not only gives terrorist stature to @entity16 but also , if it draws @entity4 ground troops into the fight , will have given @entity16 a recruiting bonanza
so the @entity4 response requires , not just a set of airstrikes in revenge , but serious strategic calculation
the @entity4 must build a coordinated regional response -- diplomatic , economic and military -- with ground troops from our regional allies and friends , and with possible @entity4 support with intelligence , logistics and airstrikes
but we can not fight this war for our @entity36 friends in the region
despite its pretensions , @entity16 is not yet a state
it was initially a group of fighters funded , armed and assisted by groups or governments opposing @entity44 president @entity43
but its call for a caliphate governed by extremist interpretations of @entity49 law precisely echoes @entity52 @entity51 teaching , and is magnetic to disaffected , vulnerable young people
thus far @entity16 has perhaps 20,000 to 40,000 fighters or more , some heavy equipment , cash , oil , and a stunned , subdued population numbering perhaps a few million now suffering under extreme @entity49 law
it is not , at this point , an existential military threat to an alerted @entity63 , backed by @entity64 ( and the @entity4 ) , or the @entity65 , supported by @entity4 airpower
while it has challenged @entity43 's forces in @entity44 , it is more focused on carving out its territory in northern @entity44 , destabilizing @entity72 , and probably preparing for bolder moves against other states in the region , such as @entity76
who is the @entity16 ? @entity16 fighters , including perhaps a few thousand alienated young people from @entity80 , the @entity81 , or @entity1 , do pose a terrorist threat far beyond the territory occupied by @entity16
governments are anxiously screening travelers and seeking to block , intern , or otherwise isolate these potential terrorists when they depart @entity44
this is difficult , but our homeland security is far stronger than it was a decade ago
the @entity4 , at least , should be able to handle this very serious threat but if @entity16 is allowed to consolidate its gains , build its forces , spread its tentacles of terror and subversion , then it will pose a serious threat to @entity72 , @entity76 and the principal @entity99 states in the region , particularly @entity52
map : where is @entity16 ? @entity52 must recognize that it will eventually become the primary target of @entity16
it controls the most holy sites of @entity36 , and by its adherence to , promotion and export of extremist interpretations of @entity36 , @entity52 is uniquely vulnerable to the @entity16 's moral suasion
massive purchases of @entity112 arms will help only if the @entity52 armed forces and populace remain loyal to the @entity52 government
for @entity52 , this time , there 's no safety in underwriting the services of others from outside the region
ultimately , it will have to be the @entity52 people themselves , their ruling family and their clergy who rally to defeat the threat of @entity16
make no mistake : the latent threat is that @entity16 could seize control in @entity52 , with all its oil , revenues , and modern weaponry
therefore , coordinated action against @entity16 is urgent
but because @entity16 's motive force is primarily religious , and because the @entity4 armed forces are neither linguistically nor culturally best adapted for a sustained fight in the region , we should be wary of committing major land forces
opinion : how @entity4 can help @entity44 drive out @entity16 the @entity4 has learned the hard way that @entity112 armies inflame extremists and serve as recruiting magnets for terrorists
instead , other nations , and particularly @entity52 and other @entity99 states , must put their soldiers forward , and bear the brunt of the fighting
the @entity4 can use diplomacy and economic assistance , and it can strike using airpower , or special forces , to reinforce the efforts of our allies , but we can not fight a religious war as proxies for our @entity36 friends in the region
5 key questions in the fight against @entity16 the @entity10 is approaching its moment of truth , particularly for @entity52
having exported and promoted extremist @entity99 religious ideology , @entity52 must face up to the threat posed by its own , even more extremist progeny
it must summon the courage to take a firm stand now , before @entity16 becomes even stronger
for the @entity4 there is nothing to be gained by delay
we must work urgently , behind the scenes , to shape an effective regional response , in coordination with our friends and allies , now .
