@entity0 -- absent an unforeseen agreement , $ 85 billion in widely disliked spending cuts begin to take effect friday
the cuts are a product of the sequester , which @entity8 and president @entity9 agreed to in hopes of making such slashing so unpalatable that it forces them to reach an alternative
so what did many lawmakers do the day before the painful cuts take effect ? @entity18
" i think the sequester is crazy , i think the president had to show more leadership , @entity8 should do more , " said rep. @entity19 , a @entity20 heading back to @entity21
" but just to sit here by myself serves no purpose
" @entity19 was one of many congressmen who , before noon on thursday , walked down the @entity29 steps and into awaiting cars to leave @entity0
@entity31 criticized republicans for not even sticking around when the cuts start coming ; republicans , in turn , blasted democrats for not stepping up to do more to reign in spending
thus , there was plenty of blame to go around -- but not a lot of action
the @entity20 - controlled @entity42 held one vote thursday on the @entity44
the chamber had no votes scheduled on friday
there will be some movement friday , if for no other reason than that 's when @entity9 would be required to start implementing the cuts through the end of the current fiscal year
also , the president is set to meet with congressional leaders from both parties at the @entity42
expectations for that meeting are low
most observers think both sides will use the occasion to underline their positions heading into the next round of the budget wars -- a possible government shutdown on march 27 , when current federal funding authority expires
" i mean , we could stay here ... and not pass ... a bill , " said rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , as he left the @entity29
" that 's not any better
" @entity9 says spending cuts would be bad for business @entity48 holds show votes on @entity31 , @entity20 alternatives as expected , a sharply divided @entity48 voted thursday afternoon to reject alternative plans put forward by majority leader @entity78 , @entity79 , and minority leader @entity80 , @entity81
@entity78 's plan got 51 votes in support while @entity85 's got 38 -- well shy of the 60 needed to clear the 100 - member chamber
@entity78 had proposed replacing the current spending cut package with a $ 110 billion blueprint that included placing new taxes on millionaires while cutting agriculture subsidies and defense spending
most @entity20 object to new defense cuts and have called any new taxes unacceptable
@entity85 wanted to give @entity9 more flexibility to pick a set of replacement cuts by march 15
democrats considered the proposal a trap , designed to put more responsibility for the cuts on @entity9 's shoulders
critics in both parties considered the idea an abdication of @entity8 's power of the purse
@entity111 : why @entity0 ca n't cut wasteful spending who bucked the party line ? nine republicans voted against @entity85 's proposal : @entity118 's @entity117 , @entity120 's @entity119 , @entity122 's @entity121 , @entity124 's @entity123 , @entity126 's @entity125 , @entity128 's @entity127 , @entity130 's @entity129 , @entity132 's @entity131 and @entity134 's @entity133
three @entity31 opposed @entity78 's plan : @entity137 's @entity136 , @entity139 's @entity138 and @entity141 's @entity140
@entity78 himself also voted against the @entity31 bill , but purely for procedural reasons
@entity78 , @entity85 continue to play the blame game " republicans call ( their ) plan ' flexibility
' but let 's call it what it really is : a punt , " @entity78 said on the @entity48 floor thursday morning
" republicans should give @entity8 true flexibility -- flexibility to cut wasteful subsidies , flexibility to close unnecessary tax loopholes and flexibility to ask the richest of the rich to contribute a little more
instead , they 're completely inflexible -- insisting we risk hundreds of thousands of @entity162 jobs , as well as programs that strengthen families and small businesses across this nation
" but that should come as no surprise , " @entity78 added
" as usual , @entity20 have put the demands of special interests over the needs of middle - class @entity162
" @entity173 : @entity20 , avert cuts and share credit @entity85 replied by insisting top @entity31 knew before thursday they lacked the votes to pass @entity78 's proposal
" for the president and his allies , that 's really the whole point
they want it to fail , so they can go around the country blaming republicans for a ( spending cuts package ) the president proposed , " he said
" instead of changing as they promised , @entity0 @entity31 are just turning back to the same old campaign - first strategy they 've employed for years
" by the numbers : @entity8 and fiscal delays the @entity81 @entity20 also accused @entity9 of wanting to the make the looming cuts " bite as hard as possible -- all to send a simple message to the public : ' you want to control @entity0 spending , @entity162 ? fine , let me show you much i can make it hurt
' " the same game plays out in the @entity42 the back - and - forth was little different , in tone , in the @entity42
speaker @entity204 , referred to two @entity20 - authored bills the chamber passed last @entity8 on partisan lines to replace the now - imminent spending cuts
@entity31 dismissed the bills , which had no chance of clearing the @entity48 or surviving a presidential veto , as ideological showboating
furthermore , the bills are null for the moment since they did n't pass the @entity42 as presently constituted
but that did n't stop @entity204 , an @entity215 @entity20 , from trying to put the onus on the @entity31 - led @entity48
" we 've done our work , " he said thursday morning
senators have " not done theirs
the @entity42 should n't have to pass a third bill to replace the ( looming cuts ) before the @entity48 passes one
" @entity9 says spending cuts would be bad for business @entity225 says spending cuts = war on women friday " is the beginning of @entity232 , " @entity42 minority leader @entity225 , @entity228 , told reporters on @entity230
" we like to think of it as @entity235 , acknowledging our history , seeing what more we have to do
and why i mention these two points is because of the impact of ( the current spending cuts package ) on women
it is specific , it is large , and it 's substantial , and it must be avoided
" " just consider this , " @entity225 added
" cuts to women 's health from prenatal care to cancer screenings , cuts to services , to victims of domestic violence -- $ 20 million will be cut out of the @entity255 account
... cuts to initiatives to support children and families , like @entity260 ( the @entity261 ) and @entity262 , cuts to public sector jobs , where women are 50 % more likely than men to be employed , and therefore fired
" @entity31 " come to @entity0 to be legislators , " she insisted
" somehow , that piece is missing in what the @entity20 are doing here
they 're just making noise
they 're just saying something that might have good sound for domestic consumption back home
but they did not come here to legislate
" immigration detainee release under fire @entity1 's @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 contributed to this report .
