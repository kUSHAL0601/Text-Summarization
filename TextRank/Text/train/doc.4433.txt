@entity0 -- in a period of about three weeks she went from being a virtually unknown 14 - year - old @entity5 girl to making headlines around the world as a @entity9 teen facing a life sentence for allegedly burning pages of the @entity12
in her first - ever public interview since being released on bail , @entity13 said she 's happy to be back with her family but still fears for her life
" i 'm scared , " she told @entity1 by phone
" i 'm afraid of anyone who might kill us
" @entity13 spoke in short sentences -- often answering " yes " or " no " in a shy and nervous voice
she would n't reveal where she was because she was speaking from her hideout
judge grants bail to ' blasphemy teen ' in @entity5 , suspects accused of blasphemy often face vigilante justice , with some cases even resulting in murder
when we asked @entity13 how she was doing , she said she was good
we asked her if she ever burned pages of the @entity12
" no , no , " she replied instantly
were you falsely accused ? " yes , " she said
however , @entity13 would n't answer questions about what exactly happened on august 16 this year
@entity5 investigators said @entity13 's neighbor accused her of burning pages of the @entity12 to use as cooking fuel
the young man accused the teenager of blasphemy , shouted in protest , and attracted an angry mob , police said
but @entity13 's lawyers denied she desecrated the @entity50 holy book in this way
they said the neighbor wanted to settle a personal score with @entity13 because the two did n't get along
the lawyers told @entity1 this may have been because he liked her but she did n't like him back
within minutes hundreds of residents from this poor @entity0 neighborhood surrounded the terrified girl , witnesses said
there are conflicting accounts about what happened next
some neighbors said @entity13 was beaten , while others claimed she frantically raced back home and locked herself inside
the police eventually arrived and took @entity13 into custody her case made international headlines and sparked outrage among rights groups who have long accused the @entity5 government of allowing the country 's controversial blasphemy laws to be used to settle scores and persecute religious minorities
according to rights groups such as the @entity81 of @entity5 and @entity82 , most innocent victims of @entity5 's blasphemy laws belong to minority @entity50 sects like the @entity86 , who are often viewed as non-believers by @entity5 's majority @entity89
@entity13 's father -- a @entity9 house painter who earns a few dollars a day -- said no one in his family would dare dishonor the @entity12
" we respect the quran just like we respect the @entity97 , " said @entity94
" we could n't imagine committing blasphemy let alone doing it
our children would never do this either
" last week , under growing pressure from rights groups who were outraged that a juvenile had spent more than three weeks in jail , a judge finally approved @entity13 's request to be released on bail
her case is still pending but she seemed to gain fresh support earlier this month when police arrested a @entity50 cleric and accused him of planting torn pages of the @entity12 in @entity13 's bag in an apparent attempt to bolster evidence against her
meanwhile , a family spokesman said aid groups from the @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 have already offered to give @entity13 and her family a home outside @entity5
but @entity13 said , for now , she does n't want to go anywhere other than back to life as she knew it , away from the spotlight
" i love @entity5 , " @entity13 said
" i wo n't ever leave my country
