-- many said he only left @entity2 for the money
after all , he reportedly earns more than $ 300,000 a week in @entity4
why else would you leave the world 's most successful club ? @entity8 , however , insists that he came to @entity9 in 2010 for one reason -- to make history
he could be proved right on sunday , when @entity9 's expensively - assembled squad have the chance to win a first @entity14 in 44 years
such a success is but a small part of the dream held by the @entity21 club 's @entity19 owners , and @entity8 -- who last season ended @entity9 's 35 - year wait for a trophy by scoring the only goal of the @entity27 final -- is a key figure in their master plan
" when @entity9 wanted to sign me from @entity2 , they were thinking about bringing a good player to try to add to the club and make history in four years , " the @entity33 international told @entity0
" i think this is very interesting for me and for the club because i think they 've made the right choice
we gained a couple of fantastic players , this year we 're doing fantastically well
we have one more game , a very difficult game against @entity46 , although we hope we will win this game because it is very important
" " @entity52 " perhaps does not do justice to sunday 's home match against a @entity46 team battling to avoid relegation
@entity9 top the table from defending champions and fierce local rivals @entity56 by goal difference alone
if both teams have the same result this weekend then it will be the closest finish to an @entity4 season since @entity63 pipped @entity64 to the title in 1989 on number of goals scored
but perhaps even more crucially , it will tip the balance of power away from @entity56 -- a club seeking a record - extending 20th league crown
" if you want to make history you have to win , " @entity8 said
" last year we did it when we won the @entity27 , and this year with the signings we have i think we have to win something for this club
" the fans were amazing this year , incredible , and they helped us a lot in difficult moments and good moments , so i think we 've done everything for them
if we can win this title i think it will be for the fans and for the club
" @entity9 thrashed @entity56 6 - 1 at @entity88 in october as @entity90 's men led the table by five points , but @entity94 's side bounced back to move eight points clear at the top with six games to go
@entity9 struggled in the wake of @entity100 's fallout with @entity90 , a controversy that saw the club 's former captain and top scorer go missing for three months
just as crucially , @entity8 was away for six weeks at the @entity105 , depriving @entity9 's midfield of its driving force
add to that the on and off - field indiscretions of @entity109 , and it appeared that @entity9 's stars were shooting themselves in the foot
" sometimes it 's difficult because when you have an important , quality player like that and they make something wrong , sometimes it 's difficult because football is a game for all the group , " @entity8 said
" it 's 11 players , 45 players who live together , you see each other more than you see your family , and you have to be careful because when one of your teammates is wrong it can affect almost all the other players
" but i think this year we dealt with everything
@entity100 is a fantastic player who we always hoped would come back because he is a really important player for us
yeah he made a mistake but he 's apologized to everyone and he 's showed to the fans he 's there to fight for his friends for the title
" @entity90 has been criticized for his management methods since coming to @entity4 from @entity143 champions @entity142 in mid- 2009 , but @entity8 credits him for inspiring belief that the title race was not over
" when i was coming to @entity9 , it was @entity90 taking me there
he believes in me ... when i was playing with @entity147 he sent someone to look at me because last time he wanted to bring me to @entity142 because he was there , " @entity8 said
" i think the key was when @entity90 started making a speech in the dressing room and said , ' guys we do n't have to give up because the @entity21 is like that and maybe they can drop some points and we can come back
we have to believe to the end because we 're in the most competitive competition in the world and most importantly we have to keep going , keep winning and maybe we 'll be close to them
' " i think @entity90 was totally right because we never gave up and we continued to fight to the final , and now we have the same points , it 's unbelievable
" next season @entity9 will play in the @entity164 for the second successive time
their introduction this season will always be remembered for @entity100 's clash with @entity90 in @entity169 , which precipitated a group - stage exit from @entity172 's premier club tournament
@entity8 has already held that trophy aloft , in 2009 when @entity2 completed a treble of trophies also including the @entity177 league and cup crowns
" the @entity164 is one of the biggest competitions in the world , it 's very tough and all the best teams in the world play in this competition , " @entity8 said
" yes i 've already won it but i 've said i came to @entity9 to make history and most importantly i have to keep working hard and make me believe i can be part of history at this amazing club
" it 's going to be tough but i think we 're on a good way to being a big team
" @entity195 won @entity9 's group and went on to reach the may 19 final , which will be held at the @entity200 team 's home stadium
@entity4 will be represented by @entity201 , who overcame considerable odds to beat defending champions @entity2 in the semis
" it 's going to be tough because @entity195 is a fantastic team
two years ago they lost ( the final ) against @entity142 , but i think @entity201 are doing extremely well , they are fighting together , " @entity8 said
" it 's going to be tough for them because @entity195 have not stopped winning
but i hope an @entity4 team can win and the guys can say the @entity21 is one of the toughest competitions in the world
