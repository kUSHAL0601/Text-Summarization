@entity0 , @entity1 -- investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of professional wrestler @entity9 , who killed his wife and son last month before hanging himself in his @entity0 home , a medical examiner said tuesday
investigators found steroids in the body of pro wrestler @entity9 , who killed his family in june
dr. @entity16 , @entity1 's chief medical examiner , said the body of @entity9 's wife , @entity18 , also contained painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs
@entity16 said it 's likely the @entity23 ' 7 - year - old son , @entity22 , was sedated at the time he was murdered , because a high level of the anti-anxiety drug @entity26 was found in the boy 's system
@entity26 is not normally prescribed for children , @entity16 said
@entity9 's body contained an " elevated " level of testosterone and therapeutic levels of @entity26 and the painkiller hydrocodone , @entity16 said
but , he said , the level of testosterone revealed nothing conclusive about the wrestler 's state of mind before his death
" there 's no reliable scientific data that says elevated levels of testosterone lead to psychotic rage , " @entity16 said
" the only thing we can ascertain is that this level of testosterone indicates that he had been using testosterone at least in some reasonably short period of time before he died , " he said
" it could be an indication he was being treated for testicular insufficiency
" the investigators found no other drugs , including steroids , in @entity9 's body
the investigation into the @entity61 ' deaths led to speculation that the wrestler may have been injecting steroids and had experienced what is called " ' roid rage , " leading him to kill his wife and son
an official who is part of the investigation told @entity2 last month that @entity9 's name was on receipts that indicated he had purchased shipments of anabolic steroids and human growth hormones from @entity77
the @entity79 , @entity80 , facility is at the center of a nationwide investigation into the sale of illegal steroids
@entity85 , @entity9 's personal doctor , has been indicted by a grand jury on seven charges of improperly dispensing and distributing painkillers and other drugs
@entity85 has been released on $ 125,000 bond and is under house arrest
although @entity9 's name was not mentioned in @entity85 's indictment , his arrest stemmed from the investigation into the @entity61 ' deaths
" through prescription records for mr. @entity9 maintained at a pharmacy in @entity99 , @entity1 , dr. @entity85 was identified as prescribing , on average , a 10 - month supply of anabolic steroids to mr. @entity9 every three to four weeks from may 4 , 2006 , through may 9 , 2007 , " the @entity96 attorney 's office said
@entity16 said the body of @entity103 also contained therapeutic levels of hydrocodone and @entity26 , along with hydromorphone , which he said is a byproduct of the breakdown of hydrocodone
@entity103 's blood alcohol level was .184 , which is over the legal limit for intoxication , but @entity16 said all of the alcohol found in her body " could come from the decomposition process
" @entity16 said investigators did not have enough specimen to test for steroids or human growth hormone in @entity22 's body
@entity22 's body showed signs of needle marks at the time of his death , but @entity16 could not speculate why
district attorney @entity126 would not answer questions about the state of the investigation into the @entity61 ' deaths , which he said is ongoing
" we 'd rather wait until we have more of the pieces so we can be more accurate and discuss more of a whole what happened , " he said
" we 're trying to envision as best we can what happened inside that household
this ( the toxicology report ) adds one element to all the other elements
" police have said @entity9 , 40 , strangled his wife , @entity18 , and suffocated @entity22 , then placed bibles next to their bodies before hanging himself on a portable weight machine over the weekend of june 23
