@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you have a tv you have heard , or heard of , vuvuzelas
they 're the cheap plastic horns played by tens of thousands of spectators in @entity9 soccer stadiums in @entity10 and buzzing like so many unswattable mosquitoes in the ear of an irate camper
to hear most viewers tell it , " vuvuzela " -- like " abattoir " -- is a beautiful word for an ugly thing
the horns drone for the entire 90 minutes of every game , and that is the perfect word for what they do : drone , like the male bee that does no work -- idling pointlessly , unproductively , infuriatingly , to no end
or so say the multitudes that now watch the games with the sound muted
i 've tried muting the tv
the vuvuzelas still ring in my ear long after the sound is turned off and even after the game has ended
the world of sports has given us swimmer 's ear , tennis elbow and athlete 's foot
here , at last , is an affliction named for the spectator at home : couch potato 's tinnitus , turning every @entity9 fan into a @entity53 roadie
there is no clear etymology for the word vuvuzela , but my guess is it derives from the @entity58 ( blood ) and " zela " ( issuing from both ears )
the buzz it has created for the @entity9 is not the kind @entity65 intended
tv viewers and newspaper writers this week have demanded that vuvuzelas be banished from @entity10 stadiums for the monthlong tournament
they argue that the horns drown out singing and chanting , the traditional soundtrack for soccer
to read the editorials , you 'd think that the @entity78 has been serenading @entity79 and @entity80 when they play each other in the @entity82
i 've been to plenty of @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity9 matches
many of the songs and chants now being drowned out by the vuvuzelas are in far worse taste than the plastic horns
they make the vuvuzela sound like @entity96 playing @entity98 's trumpet on a cloud in heaven
perhaps it 's the @entity102 , but i 've grown to like the vuvuzela , for any number of reasons
with the @entity107 , the vuvuzela joins the ticking stopwatch on " @entity109 " and the piercing signal of the @entity111 in the pantheon of nonmusical sounds that instantly tell you what is on tv even before you 've entered the room
it denies us tranquility , sure , but the vuvuzela is a little bit like tranquility : a beautiful word for a beautiful thing
long after the @entity9 final is played on july 11 , the sound of the vuvuzela will remain instantly evocative of @entity10 -- as the didjeridoo is to @entity131 , the bagpipe is to @entity132 or the car horn is to @entity134
and even if i did n't like the vuvuzela , i would keep my objections to myself
it is n't polite to tell another country how to watch a soccer match
the sound that issues from the vuvuzela is cacophonous -- joyful and infuriating at the same time
it calls to mind mosquitoes on a continent tragically ravaged by those malaria - bearing insects
for better and worse , the vuvuzela is the sound of @entity10
as @entity148 said : " if you do n't live it , it wo n't come out your horn
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .
