-- @entity1 might be in the midst of one of the fiercest @entity5 battles of recent years but the @entity7 man is staying cool -- ice cool
while @entity1 has just eight races remaining to secure a second world title , the 29 - year - old took time out to brave the @entity13 ice bucket challenge
but while some might have frozen with shock , @entity1 was in red - hot form during practice at @entity18 , @entity19 , friday
the @entity21 driver , who trails teammate @entity22 by 11 points in the standings , finished more than half - a - second clear of the field in the second practice session
" it 's great to be back in the car and it was feeling good out there today , " @entity1 told reporters on the first day back after the mid-season break
" the morning was n't as strong , but it definitely improved in the afternoon
as always , we still have work to do tonight , but overall today was ok
" it stayed dry throughout both sessions but the forecast is wet for tomorrow , so it was important to maximize track time as this may be our last dry running before the race
" we 've seen rain so often here in the past and that can really mix things up -- particularly when it 's wet in places and dry in others
" your visor is almost level with the ground , so it 's not like looking from above where you can see the different patches
" that makes it really hard to pick out the areas where you can find grip , but it 's also a lot of fun
" @entity1 set a fastest lap of one minute 49.189 seconds on the soft compound tires , with @entity66 just behind on one minute 49.793 seconds
@entity67 , who finished 0.741 seconds behind @entity1 , was third ahead of @entity70 ' @entity69 and @entity71 in the @entity72
@entity1 , whose five victories this season have taken him to 191 points , will start as favorite for pole position on saturday but @entity22 is confident he can come out on top with adverse weather expected
" as normal , it will be a long night analyzing everything that we learned today to really nail it tomorrow , " @entity22 told reporters
" the interesting challenge for this weekend is to find the right compromise between being quick over one lap and over a long distance in the race -- especially if it 's wet tomorrow , with the predictions currently saying we will have mixed conditions
" elsewhere , reigning world champion @entity92 was forced to miss the session after his @entity94 suffered engine failure .
