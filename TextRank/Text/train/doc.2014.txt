-- two goals from @entity2 ensured @entity3 ended the @entity4 in third place after they beat @entity6 3 - 2 in @entity7
their victory also means they qualify automatically for the next installment of the competition , to be held in @entity13 in 2014
it had looked like the result would not be in any doubt as @entity3 raced into a three - goal lead inside 39 minutes but @entity6 hit back to ensure a nervy last half an hour
having been beaten by @entity20 on penalties in the semifinal , @entity3 flew out of the traps and looked to put pressure on their opponents , who were thrashed 6 - 0 by @entity13 in the other final four clash
it took just 17 minutes for @entity3 to find the net as @entity30 latched onto @entity32 's pass to finish emphatically past @entity34 goalkeeper @entity33
it was 2 - 0 ten minutes later when @entity2 ended a neat passing move with a low finish into the bottom corner
and when @entity2 's downward header crept past @entity33 after 39 minutes it looked like @entity6 were on course for another painful defeat
but just before half time they were offered a glimmer of hope when @entity46 brought down @entity47 in the penalty area
@entity49 successfully dispatched his first effort but it was ruled out because players from both sides had encroached into the area
the striker made no mistake with the retake
@entity49 then registered a superb second to put @entity6 right back in the game
he swiveled on a cross from the left and beat lee jung - soo before shooting into the net
@entity2 hit the inside of the post with an effort on 61 minutes and as the game entered its final stages @entity6 piled on the pressure
but @entity3 held firm .
