-- when you think about the images typically associated with hunger , a recreation of the @entity6 's tea party from " @entity7 " might not spring to mind
but one @entity10 nonprofit is using recreated scenes from popular movies , musicals and tv shows to get people talking about poverty and hunger
the @entity19 group @entity18 provides food to children , the elderly , people with disabilities and terminally ill patients
looking for an edgy way to raise awareness about poverty and hunger in the local community , the group turned to @entity32 , a photographer and long - time friend of many of the board members of the nonprofit
@entity32 conceptualized the community art project @entity38 , which combines food with images of iconic films , musicals and tv shows to get people talking about hunger and poverty
images like @entity48 savagely biting into a blood - red slice of red velvet or @entity51 trying to hold down a white dress of splashing milk are meant to provoke people to question the message behind them , said @entity32 , who served as creative director
" i want the images to first seem obvious , but then get the viewer to stop and take a second , deeper look to connect the purpose behind the photos , " he said
@entity32 was inspired by the global art project " @entity72 " started by @entity65 photographer @entity64 , who wanted to get people talking about social issues like poverty , hunger and homelessness through large wall postings
with a grant from the @entity74 , @entity32 and a small group of volunteer photographers and models were able to afford the props , food , sets and printing costs needed to create the images of lavish decadence
the shoots took several weeks to organize and produce
they mostly chose scenes from films that already had food in them , but took creative license with the images inspired by " @entity92 , " " @entity93 " and " @entity94
" the collection is n't intended to portray hunger , he said , but to raise awareness about the organization 's efforts
the pictures will be displayed on the side of the appetite 4 life building in early april for four weeks before they travel to local galleries , starting with the @entity105 at @entity106
while the images are meant to raise awareness more than money , @entity18 has received offers from people interested in buying the photos
the organization is considering making the images available to purchase , with all of the proceeds going to support the organization
@entity117 , founder and ceo of the national hunger nonprofit @entity119 , said organizations need to get creative to get people to pay attention to hunger and poverty , perennial issues
" data speaks to a person 's mind ; emotion speaks to their heart , " @entity117 said
" creativity is the bridge between the two
the more creative the communication , the more likely people will notice and be willing to give of themselves
