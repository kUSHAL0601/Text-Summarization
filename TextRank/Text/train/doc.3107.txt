@entity0 -- when @entity4 is agitated , his arms flail
president @entity5 has a tendency to drone on and on
debate experts say both should keep those quirks in check during the upcoming presidential debates
that 's because in the world of political theater , nobody likes a ham or a know - it - all , said @entity18 , a debate professor at @entity19
so @entity4 should keep that whiteboard full of facts and figures under wraps
and @entity5 should keep the lecturing to a minimum
" it 's the generation of @entity28 and @entity29 and efficient language choices are persuasive , " @entity26 said
both candidates are considered skilled debaters -- @entity4 's campaign called @entity5 a " universally acclaimed public speaker , " and @entity4 was lauded for his performance during the @entity36 presidential primary debates
however , there 's a lot more to effective debating than clever rhetoric
10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate delivery , tone and body language -- almost as much as substance -- convey a lot to would - be voters , political experts say
over the next three weeks , voters will have plenty of opportunities to watch the political posturing unfold
wednesday night 's debate in @entity55 is the first of three between the president and @entity4
the first debate focuses on domestic policy , so exchanges are bound to be lively , debate experts say
" @entity4 and @entity5 will disagree with the foundation of what caused our economy to go south , " said @entity62 , director of debate at @entity63
@entity68 : debate all about trust for @entity4 the two men will also mix it up over their different proposals for trimming the nation 's debt and entitlement spending , addressing tax rates , and reforming the nation 's health care system
for voters keeping score at home , pay attention to " things like argument depth , trying to get beneath the surface of the argument
they 've become quite skilled at not answering the question
they 'll repeat the question and then the next few things out of their mouths do n't answer the question , " @entity62 said
also , " look for inconsistencies ... things they have or have not said before , " he said
vice president @entity95 and @entity4 's running mate , rep. @entity96 of @entity97 , will face off once on foreign policy matters
and like their top - of - the - ticket counterparts , the veep candidates also have some habits to watch out for
" @entity96 has so much less experience that he 's going to be on talking points for the ticket , " @entity26 said , and that could make him seem a bit stiff
on the other hand , " @entity95 has to be careful to not be glib about it and assume his superior knowledge
" voters have already handicapped the presidential candidates ' performance
according to an @entity116 / @entity115 national poll released monday , 55 % of likely voters say they think the president will win the debate , with 31 % saying the former @entity120 governor will be victorious
the findings on this question from the new survey are in line with a @entity1 / @entity126 poll conducted right after the @entity127 last month , where likely voters predicted by 59 % to 34 % that @entity5 was more likely than @entity4 to prevail in the october showdowns
the campaigns spent the bulk of last week downplaying expectations
@entity4 debate challenge : high stakes , lowered expectations however , there 's still plenty of room for surprises
" the mistakes the presidential candidates have made over the years are numerous
poor body language has been a common blunder
as much as candidates focus on perfecting the substance of what they say before the cameras , a large number of @entity145 are really most interested to see how they say it , " @entity1 contributor and history professor @entity142 wrote for @entity1
despite weeks of preparation and practice with debate sparring partners , candidates often revert to nervous tics under the harsh glare of spotlights
during a 2008 debate , sen. @entity159 paced on stage ; in 1992 , president @entity162 glanced at his watch ; and in 1960 , vice president @entity164 was sweaty and cast furtive glances
both @entity5 and @entity4 have similar habits -- " tells " that signal that they 're nervous
the mistakes candidates make in debates " @entity4 is more aggressive , he talks with his hands more and is more animated
that 's not a good thing , " @entity26 said , adding that at times @entity4 seems irritated when pressed
" he 's a smart man ... but because he is not fully consistent in his message , it shows in his face
" such behavior could come across as impatient , @entity26 said
" the best thing he could do is shove those hands in his pocket , " she said
" even if he were to put one hand in the pocket it would calm ... his body and face down
" why debate is crucial for @entity5 , too @entity5 may have a reputation as " cool , calm , collected and very comfortable in his body , " @entity26 said , but he too has his own set of body language challenges
the town hall format -- such as the one scheduled for october 16 at @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192 -- is @entity5 's nemesis
it offers a looser , more classroom - like setting , one in which the former law school lecturer tends to slip into the role of an academic
" it 's his worst format , " @entity26 said
" it was not as pronounced as @entity159 wandering around
@entity5 in a town hall is more long - winded
he just ca n't help himself
" getting ready for wednesday 's showdown both candidates tend to fare well in settings in which they are standing behind podiums
" the setup with lecterns and longer questions and answers allows for more direct exchange , " @entity26 said
" they 're looking at the moderator and the audience , but they 're also able to look at each other
" but there 's also a psychological disadvantage to this , said @entity221
" when seated , the candidates become less aggressive , " he said
for viewers , that 's a good thing , @entity62 added , saying that voters tend to see aggressive debating tactics as bullying
" for @entity229 sakes , do n't actually debate
if you actually debate you tend not to do well in the polling the next day , " he said
" the public tends to think they were too aggressive and mean and they do n't like them
" in @entity236 , @entity4 praises debate partner @entity237 even things like height differences alter perception and the types of gestures a candidate should use , @entity26 said
" most of the presidential primary debates were the standard format of the line of humans behind lecterns
it generates some power dynamics in size difference , " she added
" we associate height with power
it 's a subtle stereotype that goes on
" so someone smaller , like rep. @entity261 of @entity262 , " had to use larger hand gestures to compensate with size , " @entity26 said
at 6 - foot - 1 and 6 - foot - 2 respectively , @entity5 and @entity4 are on an even footing
@entity4 : debates are n't about a win @entity1 's @entity266 contributed to this report
