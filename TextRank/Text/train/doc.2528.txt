@entity0 -- federal authorities are looking for a @entity4 passenger who they say caused an uproar aboard a flight from @entity7 to @entity8 on tuesday
according to a criminal complaint , @entity9 faces charges of interfering with a flight crew , making false statements about having weapons and saying the plane was being hijacked , and assaulting federal air marshals
an arrest warrant was issued
@entity9 , 31 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , was sitting in seat @entity20 of the main cabin of @entity22 235
the trouble began , according to an affidavit filed by air marshal @entity25 , when @entity9 tried to go into the front section of the cabin , which is restricted to business class passengers for security reasons
@entity9 refused to obey instructions from the flight crew that he go back to his seat or to a bathroom in the rear cabin , the document alleges
" mr. @entity9 threatened to urinate in the aircraft galley and grabbed his penis and threatened to urinate all over himself , " according to the criminal complaint
crew members summoned air marshals on the flight , saying they needed help with a passenger who appeared " heavily intoxicated " and was not behaving as requested
the court document says one marshal found @entity9 standing in the galley exposing his genitals
when the officer approached him , the complaint said , @entity9 clinched his fists and started hitting himself in the face
the marshals identified themselves as police officers and @entity9 shoved two of them , the affidavit states
the marshals handcuffed @entity9 and put him in his assigned seat
@entity9 allegedly made a variety of false statements during the remainder of the flight -- sometimes yelling them out -- such as " this is a hijacking
" he allegedly claimed to have a handgun and a bomb
according to the complaint , he also said the air marshals aboard the plane were hijacking the plane and called them terrorists
four marshals were on @entity72
the statements frightened the passengers , the document states , adding @entity9 allegedly threatened the air marshals by saying he would " track us down
" @entity9 was detained and questioned by law enforcement upon arrival tuesday in @entity8 , but he was not arrested
" we needed to do more investigation before we filed a criminal complaint , " said @entity79 , a spokeswoman for the @entity80 in @entity8
@entity84 , an official with the @entity85 , said she could not discuss the case and referred all questions to @entity89 officials .
