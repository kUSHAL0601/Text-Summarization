@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 finds intervention in @entity6 by the @entity9 kingdom 's neighbors " alarming " and wants all players in the region to keep " their own agenda " out of the struggle between the monarchy and anti-government demonstrators , secretary of state @entity3 said wednesday
@entity17 has told the @entity6 monarchy that " there is no answer to the demands for political and economic reform though a security crackdown , " @entity23 told @entity2 's @entity24
" we are urging in the strongest possible terms , both publicly and privately , that they immediately begin to negotiate with the opposition , " @entity23 said
" at the same time , we are telling the opposition , ' you can not use violence
you should return to the negotiating table
there is no positive outcome to this kind of standoff , and security alone is not the answer
' " troops from @entity43 and the @entity44 moved into @entity6 on monday to " protect the safety of citizens , " the @entity6 government said
the troops arrived under the banner of the @entity48 , an association of six @entity49
@entity6 's @entity50 imposed a three - month state of emergency tuesday and launched a crackdown on anti-government protesters wednesday , according to witnesses in the capital , @entity56
@entity6 officials deny these accounts
at the @entity60 , @entity4 president @entity59 called both @entity50 and @entity43 's @entity61 to express his " deep concern over violence " and the need for " maximum restraint , " according to @entity60 spokesman @entity66
@entity6 has a @entity68 majority population , but its rulers are @entity70
an underlying concern is that @entity72 , an overwhelmingly @entity68 state , could seize the opportunity to meddle in @entity6 's internal affairs
@entity23 said , " there is no room for anyone to be pursuing their own agenda in @entity6 , no matter who it is
" there are clearly other agendas are at work , but the only agenda that should matter is the future of the people of @entity6 , " she said .
