@entity0 , @entity1 -- growing up , @entity3 attended no ball games with his grandfather
no barbecues , either , or bedtime stories
@entity3 , now 20 , was 4 months old when the @entity8 invaded @entity9 and seized his grandfather
@entity10 was later convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison , reduced to 17 for good behavior
now , three years after the end of his prison term , @entity3 's grandad -- former @entity9 military dictator @entity10 -- remains behind bars pending secretary of state @entity19 's decision whether to sign extradition documents
that outcome will likely come sooner rather than later
the @entity8 @entity22 on monday turned down @entity10 's request for a new hearing , setting the stage for his extradition to @entity27 , where he has been convicted in abstentia on money laundering charges and faces a new trial
" it 's all up to @entity19 now , " @entity3 said
" there 's not much hope in the courts any longer
" president @entity35 has a role to play as well , @entity3 said , but he held out little hope that the president would intercede
" i do n't think he 's being informed about this case , and it 's still being ignored , just like the @entity43 administration did , " he said
" i 'm trying not to let this affect me
i just got off the phone with my grandfather
he was adamant about making this injustice known , " he said
@entity10 's @entity0 attorneys plan to send @entity19 a letter friday asking that the former @entity9 strongman be returned to his home country of @entity9
@entity10 's trial judge declared him a prisoner of war after his drug and money laundering conviction in 1992
because of that status , he and his attorneys believe he should have been returned to @entity9 -- where he would face murder charges -- when his sentence ended in 2007
but the federal courts have ruled against him , and he has remained in prison south of @entity0
" he was adamant about staying in @entity0 this whole time , " said @entity3
" his attitude now is ' whatever happens happens
' " @entity10 is charged in @entity27 with depositing drug money in @entity27 banks and using drug money to buy apartments in @entity70
he faces up to 10 years in prison there , but his attorneys believe @entity27 would not honor his status as a prisoner of war
he faces 20 years on murder and human rights abuse charges in @entity9 , but @entity9 law would allow him to serve his sentence under house arrest because of his age
the @entity8 holds his fate and must decide whether to honor @entity27 's extradition request or send @entity10 home
" they must also consider the seriousness of the charges , " said @entity83 , @entity10 's appellate attorney
" @entity10 is wanted for murder in @entity9
we 're not asking for sympathy from @entity19 , but to recognize there are larger issues , " he said
further , he said , " @entity9 made the request first , and he is a citizen of @entity9 , not @entity27
" @entity3 also believes that @entity9 's case should come first , but he is willing to go with his grandfather wherever he 's sent
" i told him i will follow him to be with him there , in @entity27 , but he said , no , i should stay and work on my studies , " said @entity3
@entity3 is a film student in @entity99
he says that he does n't know anything about his grandfather 's past or the drug charges that put him in prison
he was far too young to hear the stories about how @entity10 was once on the @entity107 's payroll
" when i was a kid , i did n't grow up knowing he was in prison
i thought he was in school , " said @entity3
the two have spent quite a bit of time talking both in person and on the phone
@entity3 said they talk about the present , not the past , and his famous grandfather has motivated him , helping him learn from his own experiences
" i 've spent quality time with him , but not private time , " he said , alluding to prison security and the monitoring of conversations
" he 's the smartest man i know
he 's so friendly , outgoing , knowledgable
he 's always looking to teach or give advice , " he said
the @entity8 government has portrayed @entity10 as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the @entity127 drug cartel to protect cocaine and money shipments
@entity9 remember him as a cruel dictator
but the former @entity9 leader has said his relationship with the @entity8 soured when he refused to help the @entity8 take part in acts of sabotage against the communist @entity137 government during the @entity139 - era , anti-communist efforts spearheaded by the @entity107 in @entity141 during the 1980s
@entity10 said that when he refused to help the @entity8 , his country was invaded
@entity10 was arrested and taken to @entity0 to stand trial on the drug charges
during the invasion , 23 @entity8 troops were killed , as were about 200 @entity9 citizens
@entity3 said he wants to learn more about his homeland of @entity9
he grew up in @entity0 , but his sense is that @entity9 never really wanted his grandfather back there to stand trial and is still reeling from the 1989 @entity8 invasion
" @entity9 needs closure , and i feel @entity9 has not wanted him back
@entity9 is still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , " he said
in the meantime , @entity3 said that his grandfather reads and prays a lot and still has a soldier 's mentality
" he 's ready for anything
he 's probably developed strategies , in his own mind , to emotionally prepare
he 's been packed for 2Â½ years waiting , " he said
" the @entity8 should be escorting him back to @entity9 , from where they took him
