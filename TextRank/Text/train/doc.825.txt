-- the website @entity2 has begun releasing what it says are 5 million e-mails from the private intelligence company @entity6 , starting with a company " glossary " that features unflattering descriptions of @entity12 government agencies
in a statement released early monday in @entity14 ( sunday evening @entity15 ) , the website promises a raft of juicy disclosures about @entity6 , a @entity18 - based firm that promotes itself to corporate and government clients as a source of intelligence on international affairs
the company has been targeted by hackers who have released private data about subscribers in recent months , prompting the company to offer its clients a year of paid identity - protection coverage
there was no immediate comment on the disclosures from @entity6 , and the authenticity of the documents could not be independently confirmed sunday night
@entity2 , a website that facilitates the leaking of confidential information , says the documents will be released through a network of more than 25 news outlets and activist groups in the coming weeks
the first document out was titled " the @entity44 of @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , " featuring brief and sometimes humorous definitions and blunt assessments of @entity12 intelligence and law enforcement
others focused on speculation about the health of @entity56 president @entity55 and who was behind a suspected campaign of sabotage against @entity61 's nuclear program
@entity2 has previously published hundreds of thousands of @entity12 military and @entity64 documents , including field reports from the @entity66 and @entity67 and embassy cables that feature the candid assessments of @entity12 diplomats
a @entity12 soldier , @entity71
@entity72 , faces a court - martial on charges that he leaked the documents to the website
@entity2 founder @entity77 , meanwhile , is in @entity78 battling an extradition request from prosecutors in @entity81 who want to question him about unrelated accusations of sexual assault
@entity77 has not been charged with a crime and denies wrongdoing .
