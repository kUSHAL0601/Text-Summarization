-- in the 1970s the world was coming to an end
famines in @entity4 , the @entity5 and @entity6 seemed to prove @entity7 finally right
population growth was outstripping food supplies , food prices skyrocketed : people like @entity12 warned of a " population bomb "
yet , the apocalypse did not happen
agricultural productivity growth not only fed more people , but also accommodated a resource guzzling boom in meat consumption
if skeptics pointed to inequalities and persisting hunger , the neoliberal orthodoxy would tell them to be patient until trickle - down effects would have worked their magic
@entity27 agriculture key if it has ever worked , it does so no more
the number of chronically hungry people has hovered around one billion for more than a decade
large swathes of the developing world , including @entity33 , have seen a worrying decoupling from the trend of long - term economic growth
given that the livelihoods of most @entity27 are linked to the agricultural sector , there is widespread agreement that @entity27 agriculture is the key battlefront to tackle hunger and poverty
heated debate in the last three years , a virulent debate has unfolded between two camps with diametrically opposed views
in one corner , we find global agro-business , the international financial institutions and governments of emerging powers like @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57
they advocate a transformation of @entity27 agriculture through commercialization and large - scale foreign investment with the goal of increasing food supply and augmenting productivity of @entity27 farms
this , or so the theory goes , is generating income , employment and export revenues for impoverished @entity27 states , while providing food to the @entity74 and industrial inputs like cotton to @entity76
the other camp , consisting of international and @entity27 ngos and skeptical academics , rejects this logic as an unconvincing excuse for lucrative collusion between @entity27 and foreign elites , largely at the expense of the rural masses
they denounce these " land grabs " by referring to large - scale displacement of farmers deemed " unproductive " and claim that the investments increase rather than decrease global hunger , as the benefits accrue to transnational partnerships while producing little food or income for locals
@entity96 so what is actually happening on the ground ? the truth is that , despite years of heated debate , we still know very little
the much hyped " @entity103 " - initiative claims to have put together the single largest , most comprehensive database so far on international agricultural investments ( " land grabs " ) to further inform policy
yet , it reports deals that have never happened , like the alleged acquisition of millions of hectares in @entity112 and @entity113 by @entity114 and @entity55 @entity115
there is a fairly uncritical reliance on extensive media reporting of big deals
' @entity121 ' sell newspapers and raise funds for @entity78 and academics , so why ruin a good story ? case study : @entity126 still , it is worth insisting : what is actually happening on the ground ? an interesting case in point is @entity126
it has been the focal point of agro-investments by @entity57 countries in the 1970s and again today
the country is best known for decades of violent conflict and devastating hunger
yet the controversy in @entity140 media over the secession of @entity126 and the war in @entity143 has sometimes obscured the important hydro - agricultural dynamics of recent years
while the @entity103 , to our surprise , scarcely reports any major agricultural investment in @entity150 and @entity151 and uncritically copies a report on @entity126 with unimplemented project announcements , the military - @entity146 government has spent the better part of the last decade positioning itself as a potential " breadbasket " for @entity33 and the @entity74
@entity158 's @entity157 hopes to attract one billion dollars annually in investments from @entity160 , @entity55 , @entity161 and other emerging powers , partly to offset the loss of 75 % of oil revenues due to the @entity166 secession , partly to build new political alliances domestically and internationally to entrench the regime in power for another decade
untapped resources the basic logic , as presented by the @entity174 government and its @entity57 partners during grand televised conferences , is sound : @entity126 has historically underused its vast agricultural potential and low productivity is one of the key problems locking farming communities in poverty
investment , foreign or domestic , in agriculture has been woefully low for 30 years ; the agricultural crisis of rural @entity126 is one of the great drivers of widening inequality , vulnerability to climatic changes and civil strife in the peripheries
sceptical voices at the same time , more sceptical voices have been right to warn against the euphoria of a possible agricultural revolution in @entity126 with the assistance of @entity199 capital
the memories of the last time such an ambitious project was launched , back in the 1970s , are still vivid : the projects never got off the ground or were unprofitable and the vision violently crashed when tens of thousands of smallholders were forcibly driven off their land to make way for big mechanised farming in @entity151
this contributed to a country - wide civil war between 1983 and 2005
these ghosts of the past understandably influence alarmist accounts surrounding foreign direct investment ( @entity215 ) in @entity126 and @entity126
headline v reality but the emerging picture is neither one of grand capitalist transformation and agricultural revival , nor one of all - out land grab that is leading to dispossession and growing impoverishment of ever more @entity174
there is a striking gap between the spectacular headline announcements and the reality that little actual investment seems to have transpired
there are @entity57 funds that have announced humungous agro-projects without a single agro-engineer among their ranks
according to confidential ministry of investment statistics that one of the authors was able to see , only about 20 % of all agricultural partnerships concluded between @entity174 and foreign investors actually have seen some degree of implementation
perhaps only a quarter of all promised @entity215 sums for commercial agriculture reach @entity126
an @entity33 - wide issue the reasons for this botched agricultural revolution are many but they seem to apply not just to @entity126 , but also elsewhere in @entity33
whilst high commodity prices and growing resource pressures heighten the interest of emerging powers and @entity140 investors , the fundamental obstacles that have held @entity27 agriculture back previously still remain largely in place
a chaotic regulatory framework ; political instability ; high costs of training local workers ; poor infrastructure to bring produce to local and international markets ; weakly integrated national and regional agricultural development strategies ; hidden taxes and corruption ; and elites looking for quick gains rather than long - term empowerment of rural areas which are left out of the process
mirage in the desert the land grab phenomenon in @entity126 and in many ( though not all ) @entity27 countries thus increasingly resembles a fata morgana , a mirage in the desert which completely distorts the object on which it is based
not only is far more thorough and non-ideology driven research needed on foreign investment and , where it actually takes place , its impact on local communities and national welfare
above all , the fata morgana nature of agricultural development in @entity33 calls for a serious re-examination of how the continent 's farmers can move from being among the main victims of global hunger to becoming more productive cultivators of the commodities that @entity33 and the world sorely need
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity299 and dr @entity300
