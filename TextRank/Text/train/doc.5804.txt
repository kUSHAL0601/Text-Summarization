-- @entity2 's vote on a controversial cigarette tax remained too close to call wednesday morning , although votes counted so far suggest it was narrowly rejected
with all precincts reporting , the tally was 50.8 % against the proposal and 49.2 % in support of it , according to the @entity2 secretary of state website
but the vote was listed as a " close contest " with no final result
counties have 28 days to count every vote - by - mail , provisional and damaged ballot , the secretary of state 's office said
with nearly 3.9 million votes cast in precincts , the " no " votes were ahead by only about 63,000
@entity23 29 , would raise about $ 735 million a year
about three - quarters of the money raised would go to cancer research
" @entity27 , the @entity28 and the @entity29 wrote the initiative carefully , " @entity26 of the @entity27 told @entity0 's " @entity31 " last week
" the money is going to be invested in cancer research here in @entity2 and on tobacco prevention and cessation programs to protect kids and reduce smoking here in @entity2
" studies show the tax would help decrease smoking and save lives , she said
opponents slammed the tax as a misguided burden in an already tough economy
" what we 're seeing in the state of @entity2 is a lot of frustration on the part of our citizenry that it 's just another tax , " said dr. @entity49 , a general practitioner
the tax , she said in an interview with @entity0 , " goes to build bigger bureaucracy , build business , build buildings , not necessarily to go to cancer research
" the opposition in @entity2 was fueled by a huge influx of cash from big tobacco companies
about $ 47 million was raised in efforts -- including tv advertising -- to defeat " @entity70
29 , " including $ 27.5 million from @entity71 and $ 11 million from @entity72 , according to figures from @entity74 , a nonpartisan research firm
about $ 12 million was raised in support of the initiative , including $ 8.5 million from the @entity27 and $ 1.5 million from the @entity77 , known as @entity77
@entity78 himself appeared in ads urging people to " vote yes on 29
" ( @entity82 , @entity0 chief medical correspondent , is a board member of the foundation
) there is already an 87 - cent tax on each pack of cigarettes in @entity2
according to @entity2 's official voter guide , the health groups behind @entity70
29 said it would " save lives , stop kids from smoking , and fund cancer research , " while those opposed said the initiative " does n't require revenue be spent in @entity2 to create jobs or fund schools
" @entity26 insisted the campaign against @entity70
29 traded in " deceptions
" the biggest misconception is that the money collected " will be somehow wasted or used otherwise , " she said
but @entity49 said it would heavily affect poorer @entity106 , who are more likely to smoke
and other efforts , including the state 's ban on smoking in public places , have succeeded at pushing people to quit smoking , she said
@entity113 , ceo of the @entity27 , said if the bill passed , " it would make @entity2 the second - largest funder of cancer research after the ( @entity118 ) in the entire country
" some grant proposals that currently go unfunded would find a source of revenue , he said
" so , it 's a tremendous opportunity for @entity2 to do the right thing -- not only for @entity2 , but for the whole world
" @entity0 's @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 contributed to this report .
