-- it was the first major terrorist attack in history in which the group that mounted the operation used @entity5 to announce to the world it was responsible
the group then quickly tweeted what its rationale was for the attack and also gave operational details of the assault -- all in real time
on saturday a group of armed gunmen stormed the upscale @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , shooting at shoppers and mall staff with automatic weapons , killing at least 61 civilians
several hours into the assault a @entity5 account used by the @entity24 terrorist group @entity23 tweeted : " the @entity23 ( ' holy warriors ' ) entered @entity15 today at around noon and they are still inside the mall , fighting the @entity17 kuffar ( ' infidels ' ) inside their own turf
" it was the first confirmation that the attack was the work of @entity23 , and journalists around the world quickly reported this
the terrorist group soon provided a tweeted explanation of its motives : " what @entity17 are witnessing at # @entity15 is retributive justice for crimes committed by their military
" the @entity17 army is part of a larger @entity47 - sanctioned peacekeeping operation that has recently been fighting @entity23 with much success , for instance , a year ago expelling the group from one of its last strongholds , the @entity24 port city of @entity55
as the attack on the @entity16 mall unfolded , @entity23 tweeted , " since our last contact , the @entity23 inside the mall confirmed to @ @entity60 that they killed over 100 @entity17 kuffar
" @entity62 is the name that @entity23 has used as its @entity5 handle
crucially , @entity23 then explained in a tweet that the mall attack was going to be a fight to the death in which there would be no negotiations for the lives of the hostages the gunmen had taken : " we 'll not negotiate with the @entity17 govt as long as its forces are invading our country , so reap the bitter fruits of your harvest # @entity15
" this key aspect of the assault on the mall was then reported around the globe
a day into the @entity16 assault , @entity23 tweeted that three @entity86 were involved in the attack
since 2007 some 40 @entity86 have traveled to @entity24 to fight with @entity23 , including at least three who volunteered to become suicide bombers for the group , so this claim is not implausible and the @entity92 is looking into it
indeed , whoever was live tweeting the @entity16 attack for @entity23 has a command of colloquial @entity97 with a sardonic edge that you might pick up somewhere such as @entity100 or @entity101
during the massacre , for instance , @entity23 tweeted , " like it or loathe it ! our mujahideen confirmed all executions were point blank range ! " the group also wrote , " @entity110 : a 14 - hour standoff relayed in 1400 rounds of bullets and 140 characters of vengeance and still ongoing
good morning @entity17 ! " at one point during the mall siege , responding to media speculation that @entity118 - born @entity117 -- whom @entity17 authorities suspect of being a financier of jihadist militants in @entity17 -- was part of the operation , @entity23 took to @entity5 to deny that a woman had any role : " we have an adequate number of young men who are fully committed & we do not employ our sisters in such military operations # @entity15
" ( on thursday , @entity132 issued a red notice -- an international wanted alert -- for @entity117
) according to an authoritative study of @entity23 's use of social media by the @entity100 - based @entity139 for the @entity140 , the group has been active on @entity5 since december 2011 , sending out a steady stream of tweets to at one point more than 15,000 followers that has included a good number of journalists and terrorism analysts
@entity23 's @entity5 account first used the handle @ @entity150 , an acronym based on the group 's full official name , @entity23 ( @entity154 )
since then @entity23 has used other @entity5 accounts with some slight variations on the same name such as @ @entity157 , @ @entity158 , @ @entity159 and the current @ @entity160
@entity23 seems to change the name of its @entity5 account as it gets taken down , likely because the account is in violation of @entity5 's terms of service , which explicitly explains that users can not " publish or post direct , specific threats of violence against others
" it 's impossible to tell definitively if all the tweets on @entity23 's purported accounts are really from the group , but the tone and content of the tweets have generally been consistent over the past two years , and information that the group has tweeted about the @entity16 mall attack , such as its responsibility for the assault and its unwillingness to negotiate for the release of hostages , has , unfortunately , proved to be accurate
an analyst who has tracked @entity23 's @entity5 feed carefully is @entity188 , the author of a book about @entity86 fighting overseas for groups such @entity23 titled " @entity191
" @entity188 has filed a number of reports with @entity5 that @entity23 is in violation of its terms of service
@entity5 does n't comment on why it suspends a particular account -- a representative told @entity0 , " we do n't comment on individual @entity5 accounts , for security and privacy reasons " -- but clearly @entity23 is egregiously violating those terms of service , and during the @entity16 attack the group had to use five different @entity5 handles as its account kept getting taken down , presumably by @entity5 employees
since tuesday , @entity23 has tweeted at its newest site and , as of this writing , it had more than 5,000 followers and had tweeted some 40 times
@entity188 says that @entity23 militants have also taken to @entity5 in recent weeks during other smaller - scale operations : " they have also tweeted bombing attacks on @entity213 and attempts to assassinate @entity24 's president within the last several weeks
" on wednesday @entity23 posted via @entity5 audio of a short speech by its leader @entity218 , crowing over the attacks and congratulating the " holy warriors " who carried out the @entity16 operation
he gloated , " the attack has also glaringly illuminated the sheer vulnerability of the different sections of the @entity17 forces , be they police , intelligence or the military
... it 's a disaster for the @entity233 politicians and their intelligence apparatuses who have miserably failed to save their own citizens
" @entity236 also goes by the name @entity238 , and a @entity86 official has told @entity0 the belief is he ordered the @entity16 operation
the fact that on wednesday @entity23 posted to twitter a speech by @entity236 taking ownership of the operation would seem to confirm that belief
in 1974 terrorism analyst @entity245 wrote an influential paper for @entity247 in which he made a key observation in the then - fledgling field of terrorism studies
" terrorism is theater , " @entity245 wrote , explaining that the real point of a terrorist attack is not the violence that is visited on its victims but the large number of people watching the event that serves to advertise the terrorists ' cause
a decade later @entity118 prime minister @entity262 gave a speech in which she made a similar point , declaring that terrorists depend on " the oxygen of publicity
" nothing had underlined this better than the @entity270 in 1972 during which 11 @entity272 athletes were taken hostage by @entity275 terrorists
all the @entity272 were killed either by the hostage takers or during the course of a botched rescue operation
the hostage - taking was covered by tv networks from around the world who came to cover the games but ended up providing coverage of a terrorist event that unfolded before the first truly global audience for such an attack
more than any other single event , it brought the @entity275 cause to the world 's attention
on 9/11 untold hundreds of millions around the world watched the attacks as they happened in @entity294 and near @entity295 on live television
@entity297 himself listened to live coverage of the attacks on @entity301 in his hideout in @entity303
the 9/11 attacks , which took place in the city that is many ways the capital of global media , thrust @entity297 and his terrorist group @entity310 onto the world stage in a spectacular manner
but in neither the @entity270 hostage - taking nor on 9/11 did the terrorists have actual control over the content of the coverage , which was instead determined by those media networks covering the event
so what we saw unfold in the attack on the mall in @entity17 is something quite new : a terrorist group shaping the media coverage of the event in real time through the medium of @entity5
the next logical step will be for terrorists to cover their deadly operations using their own real - time live video feeds linked to sites such as @entity5 , @entity335 or @entity336
if that happens , terrorist attacks will become a form of theater in which terrorists not only get to write the play but also act as the primary producers of the coverage of the event
a dark glimpse of this brave new world could already be seen in @entity23 's assault on the @entity16 mall
unfortunately , that may not be the end of @entity23 's terror attacks outside @entity24
on thursday shabaab posted the following chilling tweet : " the mesmeric performance by the @entity358 was undoubtedly gripping , but despair not folks , that was just the @entity353 re of @entity354
