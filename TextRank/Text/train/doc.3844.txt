law enforcement officials in @entity1 and the @entity2 are investigating a theft of at least 70 works of art from the island nation with a value totaling more than $ 1 million , says the @entity9 art dealer who first reported the heist to @entity2 authorities
on tuesday , the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) circulated a list of the missing artworks , which art dealer @entity15 examined and said would likely be valued at close to $ 1.5 million
@entity15 first alerted law enforcement officials to the theft in february after buying a painting by a 20th - century @entity1 artist for $ 15,000
after researching the painting , @entity15 said he discovered the work was registered to @entity22 's @entity21
he said he contacted officials there who , upon searching their archives , confirmed the painting and others were missing
while no major works were stolen , @entity15 said the case was notable because art theft is relatively rare in @entity1
museums are tightly guarded and artwork is usually inspected before it leaves the country
" the theft is so much more complicated than the smuggling out of @entity1 , " @entity15 said
" to just get the art out of the museum is very complicated
" @entity1 authorities have not said whether any arrests have been made , but a statement issued by the @entity42 of @entity43 said an investigation showed the artworks were removed from their frames while in storage
@entity15 said the same dealer in @entity9 who sold him the painting he purchased had another 10 @entity1 artworks for sale that appeared to have been crudely cut from their frames
" it 's an obvious tell that something is going on , " he said
@entity15 said he has turned over the painting he purchased to the @entity56 , and he said the agency is investigating
despite chilly relations between the @entity2 and @entity1 , @entity15 said he expected any art that is recovered would be returned to the island
" i am about certain it will go back , " he said
" stolen property is stolen property
