-- the @entity1 has the most powerful judges in the @entity3
but common citizens are often behind pivotal cases that those justices decide -- everyday @entity3 who , by taking their cases to court , made history
@entity3 was reminded of that this week , when the high court ruled in favor of @entity13
she 's an 84 - year - old @entity15 woman who sued to strike down the @entity16 so that the federal government would recognize her marriage to her late partner , @entity13
on a much broader scale , the case was aimed to ensure that legally wed same - sex spouses could get the same benefits as traditional male - female ones
@entity13 may be the latest , but she 's not the first @entity3 whose name is linked to @entity1 rulings that have altered society
below are a few such examples from the country 's more than two centuries in existence
who : @entity33 case : @entity34 ( 1803 ) his story : just before he left office , president @entity37 commissioned @entity33 -- among dozens of others -- to become a justice of the peace
but his secretary of state did n't follow through
and when @entity42 took over that position , he did n't either -- but purposefully , per the direction of new president @entity45 , who did n't want members of the opposing political party to take office
chief justice @entity49 issued the landmark ruling in the case
in the short term , he decided @entity33 would not become a justice of the peace in the @entity55 , as he 'd wished
but the opinion proved far more significant , long term , because it established judicial review -- the idea the courts could strike down laws and the like it deemed unconstitutional
as @entity49 wrote , " a law repugnant to the @entity64 is void
" who : @entity66 case : @entity67 ( 1857 ) his story : @entity66 was born a slave in @entity71
he and his family later were moved with their owners to @entity75 and eventually @entity76 , where he was sold to a @entity78 doctor
together , they moved around -- including in the free territory of @entity81 -- before ending up back in @entity76
@entity66 was there when his owner died , after which he sued in @entity86 city court for his freedom -- saying that , for some time at least , he had been free
so was @entity66 his own man , or was he still the property of his late owner 's widow ? the @entity1 ruled it was the latter , that as a slave he did n't have the rights as white @entity3
that included the right to sue in federal court
chief justice @entity96 wrote , " we think they are ... not included , and were not intended to be included , under the word ' citizens ' in the @entity64 , and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for
" who : @entity106 case : @entity107 ( 1896 ) his story : in june 1892 , @entity106 sat down in the whites - only compartment of a train rolling through @entity113
a conductor challenged him , and he was arrested for violating state law
he was â … ž white , not 100 % that he 'd need to avoid a $ 25 fine or 20 days in jail
as with others involved in some landmark cases , @entity106 was not necessarily caught off guard : he 'd been among a group working with the @entity121 to protest the state law requiring rail companies to provide " separate but equal " places for white and nonwhite customers , and for patrons to follow suit
the @entity1 eventually got the case , which had to do not just with @entity106 's arrest but more generally state and local @entity131 laws that had institutionalized segregation including in much of what had been the former @entity135
justice @entity137 , in his majority ruling , upheld such laws in calling it a " fallacy ( to assume ) enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority
" who : the @entity137 family case : @entity148 ( 1954 ) their story : there was a school seven blocks from @entity148 's @entity155 , @entity156 , home , but she could n't go to it
but because the third - grader was black , and @entity160 was all - white , she had to walk several blocks and catch a bus to attend @entity163
her father @entity164 and other parents petitioned for their children to attend @entity167 , then sued to city 's board of education after they were denied
the @entity170 were the first name listed on that lawsuit
they would later become the name at the front of the @entity1 's milestone ruling , even as others fought the same fight : in december 1952 , the court had similar cases on its docket from @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity71 and the @entity55
chief justice @entity185 's decision effectively overturned the @entity107 that an earlier @entity1 had passed decades before , which had helped make segregation possible
" the doctrine of ' separate but equal ' has no place , " @entity185 wrote
" separate educational facilities are inherently unequal
" who : @entity191 case : @entity192 ( 1966 ) his story : @entity191 was in his @entity196 home in 1963 when police came , arrested him and took him to a police station
there , a witness identified the truck driver as the culprit in a kidnapping and rape
so did @entity192 himself , in writing -- a confession that was taken into account during his trial , which ended with a guilty verdict
@entity192 challenged that conviction by insisting his confession was invalid
why ? because , he argued , he had made it without being advised by police of his right to remain silent and to have a lawyer working with him
the @entity1 got @entity192 's case ( among others involving suspects alleging they had n't been properly about self - incrimination prior to being interrogated ) , and ruled in his favor
thus was born what 's now known as a @entity192 warning , in which suspects are told they do n't have to talk to police and have the right to an attorney , whether they can afford one or not
@entity192 's victory , though , was short - lived
he was retried , and once again convicted , in 1967
after getting out after two stints in jail , he was stabbed to death in january 1976 in a fight over a $ 3 gambling pot. who : @entity240 and @entity241 @entity242 : loving v. @entity71 ( 1967 ) their story : in many ways , @entity241 and @entity241 were like any other couple
they 'd been childhood sweethearts who tied the knot in 1958 in @entity55 , then went back to their home state of @entity71
but their wedded bliss was interrupted one night when police broke into their bedroom and arrested them
their crime ? @entity240 was black and @entity255 was white , at a time when interracial marriage was illegal in @entity71 and other states
the @entity259 got out of a pending jail sentence after agreeing to move to @entity55
yet they pressed their case that their marriage , and those of other mixed - race couples , should be valid in the @entity3
in a 1967 decision , chief justice @entity185 agreed , thus opening the door for all interracial marriages
" marriage is one of the ' basic civil rights of man , ' fundamental to our very existence and survival , " he wrote , citing an earlier case
" to deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes , classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the @entity284 , is surely to deprive all the @entity286 's citizens of liberty without due process of law
" who : @entity291 , aka " @entity291 " case : @entity292 ( 1973 ) @entity293 : @entity291 was 21 , unmarried and on her third pregnancy when she , in the court 's eyes , became @entity291
in a 1980 autobiography in which she revealed her identity , the young @entity300 described having a tough life up until then -- including having endured sexual , physical and emotional abuse , a failed marriage and problems with drugs and alcohol
she was still anonymous in 1973 when associate justice @entity307 wrote the majority opinion that legalized a woman 's right to an abortion in all 50 states
his reasoning was this falls under a woman 's constitutionally granted right of privacy
ironically , @entity291 did n't have an abortion
and she later switched sides in the heated debate and became a passionate anti-abortion activist
who : @entity13 case : @entity13 ( 2013 ) @entity293 : @entity13 met her soulmate , @entity13 , in @entity15 's @entity325
they reunited two years later , and soon thereafter @entity327 proposed marriage with a round diamond pin
but actually following through seemed out of the question , given that lesbian couples could not legally marry then in the @entity3
the couple were together 42 years , marrying in 2007 in @entity333
two years later , @entity13 mourned @entity327 's death and realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes because @entity327 was , in legal terms , little more than a friend
she sued , arguing that the @entity16 that prevented the federal government from recognizing her marriage as valid was unconstitutional
on wednesday , she won
it meant she 's now owed back those inheritance taxes but , more significantly , that gay and lesbians around the country can now get " the same federal benefits , protections and dignity as everyone else
" " if i had to survive @entity351 , what a glorious way to do it , " she told reporters
" and she would be so pleased
