-- even if @entity1 and @entity3 negotiators manage to meet the november 24 deadline for a nuclear agreement with @entity3 , @entity1 faces a very inconvenient reality in the @entity7 : we 're stuck in a kind of @entity7 @entity10 where messy outcomes are more likely than neat solutions , and where ambiguity and uncertainty will rule over clarity and stability for years to come
and we better get used to it
part of the problem , of course , is us
we sit thousands of miles away , in a protected cocoon with nonpredatory neighbors to our north and south and fish to our east and west -- what one historian brilliantly called our liquid assets
and while this physical detachment is a wondrous advantage , it has also given us a very skewed view of the world
we may have freed ourselves from the dark forces of history and geography
but the rest of the world has n't
just ask the @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity3 , @entity42 , @entity43 or many others
for a start , our skewed view contributes to our naivete because we no longer really understand the mentality of the small power who lives in the bad neighborhood on the knife 's edge
it also explains our arrogance , because we really do n't have to listen
our margin for error is very wide given our size , power and protected status , which helps explain our idealism and why we somehow believe we can and should find those solutions
finally , our location informs our pragmatism , and the sense that somehow we can develop answers to these problems based on our own @entity68 , happy ending and heroic view of the world
i 'm sure you remember " @entity74 " under the last president -- and the campaign he launched to turn @entity77 and @entity78 into functioning democracies
yet 11 years later , and we 're now heading into @entity80 even our current president believed that the @entity82 required the @entity1 to get on the right side of history by acquiescing in former @entity42 president @entity86 's downfall
but @entity42 today is arguably less free and prosperous than under @entity86
and let 's not forget president @entity89 's words about " ultimately defeating @entity90
" let 's get real
even though we killed @entity92 and dismantled @entity94 's central core , the gravest threat to our security right now is n't isis at all but an affiliate of an @entity94 we were supposedly to have destroyed , @entity98 ( @entity98 )
these groups emerge from the poisonous environment that is now the @entity7
in order to defeat them permanently , we 'd have to fix the entire region
we ca n't do that
and now we come to the inconvenient truth
the @entity7 is a broken , angry , dysfunctional region ( just make it bad for short
) with the exception of @entity107 and perhaps @entity110 -- both still works in progress -- and several of the @entity109 kings , the @entity109 world is melting down
it is now , and will be for a good deal longer , marked by civil war
it is dysfunctional , and it is made up of largely failed or failing states that lack good governance , respect for rule of law , gender equality , transparency , accountability and respect for freedom of conscience
some argue that more time is required -- they urge us not to judge prematurely
but even the longer term trend lines do n't look good
where are the leaders who are capable and willing to rise above their narrow partisan , sectarian affiliations to govern in the interests of a nation as whole ? where are the institutions that reflect the popular will , inclusiveness and legitimacy of the public ? and where is the good governance that seeks to deliver freedom , security and economic prosperity ? ultimately , where are the moderates within the @entity109 @entity152 world who will denounce , fight and marginalize the extremists who have corrupted their religion ? the politically incorrect read on all of this is that this part of the world just is n't ready for prime time
indeed , there is not a single issue that appears on the verge of a sustainable solution
and there wo n't be for some time to come
@entity43 - @entity166 peace ? to do that , you need leaders , real ownership and decisions to close the yawning gaps on the big issues
but right now , there are n't any of those things in sufficient quantities
what about @entity77 ? that remains a country whose future is extremely uncertain as corruption , sectarianism , and regionalism threaten to pull it apart
@entity186 ? right now it is a veritable black hole with at least four subconflicts : @entity90 vs. @entity1 ; @entity189 vs. the so - called moderate @entity191 opposition ; jihadis vs. jihadis ; and sooner rather than later , perhaps , @entity194
what kind of @entity186 all of these tensions will produce is simply unknowable
suffice it to say , a unified , democratic state where everyone lives in peace and harmony will likely not be one of them
the fact is that more progress has been made on the @entity1 - @entity3 nuclear issue than all of these other issues
and yet even here should a deal be reached , the politics , lack of trust , conflicts on so many other regional issues , and challenges of implementation will all but guarantee perennial problems between the @entity1 and @entity3
@entity1 will have its hands full in this region for years to come
and it may well be able to help shape outcomes to some of these problems that will further its own interests
but it must give up any illusion that it can somehow produce solutions
these are , by and large , @entity7 problems , and their solutions will need to be owned by those who live in the neighborhood
@entity235 opined in his classic song " @entity240 " that if you want to make a real change , than start by looking in the mirror
if the region wants to fix itself with @entity1 's help , that 's the place to start .
