-- after churning through the @entity2 and chugging up the @entity3 , @entity1 made landfall over southeastern @entity5 on tuesday night -- bringing with it sustained winds of 80 mph and torrential , stinging rains
according to the @entity12 , the storm 's center moved over land in @entity14 at 6:45 p.m. ( 7:45 p.m. et ) -- one day before the seventh anniversary of @entity16 , which left nearly 1,800 dead and caused billions of dollars worth of damage along the @entity18
@entity1 's eye then " wobbled westward " and moved back over @entity3 waters , and by 10 p.m. @entity21 was centered about 75 miles southeast of @entity22 , @entity5 -- all while keeping its strength as it lashed those onshore
throughout the night , the hurricane center issued advisories indicating that steady hurricane - force winds of 74 mph and stronger were being felt 60 miles out , mostly to the east and northeast of @entity1 's eye
sporadic gusts were even stronger , including a 106 mph wind reading from high up on an oil rig off the southeast @entity5 coast and 85 mph in @entity34 , @entity5
while @entity1 is expected to eventually lose steam , that might not happen immediately because much of the sprawling storm will be over water for several more hours
how to prepare for a storm even with more dangerous conditions likely yet to come , the storm already has caused significant surges and flooding in a number of locales , and not just those directly in @entity1 's path
storm surges of 10.3 feet have been reported in @entity48 just outside @entity49 , and 6.7 feet in @entity50 , @entity51 , according to the hurricane center
these surges likely will get worse , with forecasters predicting water levels to rise between 6 to 12 feet on the coast in @entity51 and southeastern @entity5 alone
@entity51 state authorities have noted that waters have gone up around the state faster than expected , something @entity56 noticed as he surveyed the @entity61 in @entity62
he estimated tuesday afternoon that this river was 6 to 8 feet higher than normal , and at low tide , expressing concerns about even more flooding during high tide wednesday morning
" the fact that we have n't had any rain and that we 've got six to eight hours before the real fun begins ... makes me nervous , " echoed @entity68 , another @entity0 ireporter who documented flooding in nearby @entity72
a large swath of the northern @entity18 on tuesday night was experiencing tropical storm conditions , with winds in excess of 39 mph , including parts of @entity51 and @entity83 , the hurricane center reported
intense rains alone could cause major headaches , and flooding , given @entity1 's slow progression
having at one point swept through the @entity2 at 21 mph , @entity1 's movement slowed tuesday to 8 mph
it continued creeping northwest at this speed through tuesday night
because @entity1 is moving at such a slow clip , @entity0 meteorologist @entity92 estimated some residents could experience hurricane or tropical storm conditions for between 24 and 36 hours before the storm finally moves on
while residents had been feeling its effects for hours , the storm 's eye was still 75 miles south - southeast of @entity49 at 10 p.m. tuesday
by then , heavy rain had already contributed to significant flooding , including " deceptively deep " water under @entity104 at @entity105
but due to the strong winds , barriers aimed at keeping drivers away flailed in the wind
" please help us spread word : @entity112 at @entity105 is flooded
we can not keep up barricades b / c of wind
do not try to cross , " the city said via @entity115
mayor @entity116 said he expected the worst of the storm to hit his city wednesday morning , bringing with it hurricane - force winds and between 10 and 16 inches of rain
the mayor wrote on @entity115 that about 1,000 @entity124 troops and more than 2,900 law enforcement officers are in the city ready to address issues related to the storm
" we 're in a hunker down phase now , because this storm could be over us for a while with a lot of wind and rain , " @entity116 said in a statement
" @entity133 means hunker down and prepare to ride it out
" keep a hurricane preparation checklist like @entity116 and other local and state authorities , president @entity137 on tuesday had urged those in @entity1 's path to listen to authorities and stay safe
" now 's not the time to tempt fate , " he said from @entity142 , after signing an emergency declaration for the state of @entity51 like he had for @entity5 a day earlier
" now 's not the time to dismiss official warnings
you need to take this seriously
" besides strong winds , @entity1 could bring 14 inches of total rainfall in many places , and isolated parts of southeast @entity5 , southern @entity51 , southern @entity83 and the @entity156 could get as much as 20 inches , the hurricane center said
entering tuesday , @entity18 residents braced for the worst from a storm that has already caused considerable devastation as it headed north from the @entity2
@entity161 's civil protection agency reported at least 19 people in that country died due to @entity1 , which after hitting that impoverished nation went on to lash @entity165 and the @entity166
weathering the storm : links , tips and resources @entity170 , a @entity171 from @entity172 on @entity156 's east coast , reported that floodwater there is " almost waist deep at some ... points
" " all we can do is wait for the water to recede , " she said
the hurricane 's " increasing winds and seas " disrupted a search for a missing man on tuesday , @entity179 spokesman @entity179 said
the @entity185 had been looking off the coast of @entity187 , @entity156 , for a " missing jet skier " whose wife reported him missing monday night
@entity179 said that rescue crews would " temporarily suspend their search efforts until the storm passes and weather conditions become safe enough
" @entity1 : state by state @entity1 's impact has been felt , and seen , in other ways as well -- including bending trees , drenching roads and knocking down power lines
@entity203 , one of many utilities affected by the storm , reported around 222,000 customers without power statewide at 10:12 p.m. ct
@entity1 earlier prompted three airports to close -- in @entity49 ; @entity62 , @entity51 ; and @entity209 , @entity83 -- and cancellations of around 1,500 flights systemwide , according to airline and airport officials
in addition , the @entity185 announced it has closed major ports along the @entity18 and the @entity217 from @entity218 to its mouth because of the storm
business in many of the most affected areas came to a standstill because of @entity1
for example , 52 @entity227 and @entity228 stores in @entity5 and nine in @entity51 had shut down by 5:30 p.m. tuesday , their parent company said
@entity231 suspended its train service to and from @entity49 on tuesday and wednesday because of @entity1
and residents of @entity14 , located along the @entity3 , are subject to a " dusk - to - dawn curfew " because of @entity1 , parish officials said
in and around @entity49 , authorities closed a number of flood protection structures
these included the @entity240 -- one of the world 's largest pump stations , capable of pumping stormwater at 20,000 cubic feet per second -- said the @entity245
" there is no evidence of any ( water ) overtopping ( canals ) , " @entity116 said tuesday evening
" we have full confidence the levees will hold
" in @entity51 , more than 1,800 evacuees were staying in 33 shelters located in 16 counties as of 9 p.m. tuesday , according to the state 's emergency management agency
more than 80,000 sandbags were given out earlier in the day , and several popular @entity62 casinos closed temporarily
disaster dining : stay safe and stay fed shrimpers in @entity262 , @entity83 , were among those who heeded official warnings and hunkered down
" all the boats are coming
we 're anchoring them down and getting ready for this blow , hoping it 's not too bad , " @entity266 , the owner of @entity267 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity268 in @entity262
the @entity274 on tuesday said it was sending additional inspectors to two @entity5 nuclear plants in the storm 's path , as power company @entity203 planned a " controlled shutdown " of one of them starting tuesday afternoon
@entity1 is not expected to be as strong as @entity16 , which made landfall as a category 3 storm with 125 mph winds
even so , the head of @entity287 stressed tuesday that wind speed is n't the only factor to consider when assessing how much damage a storm might cause
" i know there are a lot of jaded folks on the coast that have been through @entity297 and then @entity16 and think , well , this is just a category 1 hurricane , " said @entity287 director @entity292 from @entity51
" the tendency to look at the category of the wind speed does n't always tell the story of what the impacts will be
" @entity304 share @entity1 photos , videos @entity18 authorities and residents are praying there will be no repeat of the devastation the 2005 hurricane caused after protective levees around @entity49 failed and flooded the city
col. @entity315 of the @entity245 vowed that the system now in place " is the best ... the greater @entity49 area has ever seen
" @entity319 , for one , trusts that the levees will hold this time
the @entity48 , @entity5 , resident , who rebuilt her home after @entity16 , said her family will wait @entity1 out -- though they have a generator and life jackets , " just in case
" " i do n't know if it 's going to be a true test , because they 're saying it 's not going to be that bad , " @entity319 said
" but you never know what bad is
we did n't think @entity16 was going to be bad either
