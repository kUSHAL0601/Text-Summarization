editor 's note : this is an excerpt from " @entity3 " by @entity4 , a nonfiction account of a @entity8 - @entity7 immigrant and his extraordinary experience during @entity10
@entity4 is the author of five other books , including " @entity13 , " a finalist for the 2006 @entity15
@entity4 is the founder and editor of @entity18 's , an independent publishing house based in @entity20
@entity4 writes that @entity3 dreamed of fishing on the @entity8 coast as @entity10 approached
( @entity23 ) -- friday , august 26 , 2005 on moonless nights the men and boys of @entity26 , a dusty fishing town on the coast of @entity8 , would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats
five or six small craft , two or three fishermen in each
a mile out , they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea , drop their nets , and , holding their lanterns over the water , they would approximate the moon
the fish , sardines , would begin gathering soon after , a slow mass of silver rising from below
the fish were attracted to plankton , and the plankton were attracted to the light
they would begin to circle , a chain linked loosely , and over the next hour their numbers would grow
the black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see , below , a solid mass of silver spinning
@entity3 was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way , a method called lampara , borrowed from the @entity56
he had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats , and he 'd spent those years asking questions
why only on moonless nights ? because , his brother @entity66 said , on moon - filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere , spread out all over the sea , and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease
but without a moon the men could make their own , and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations
you have to see it , @entity66 told his little brother
you 've never seen anything like this
and when @entity85 first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight , the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light
he said nothing , and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet , too , paddling without motors , lest they scare away the catch
they would whisper over the sea , telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them
a few hours later , once the sardines were ready , tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light , the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in
they would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn
he would pay the men and boys , and would then sell the fish all over western @entity8 -- @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118
the fishermen would split the money , with @entity85 and @entity66 bringing their share home
their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind , so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings
@entity85 and @entity66 did n't care much about the money , though
they would have done it for free
thirty - four years later and thousands of miles west , @entity3 was in bed on a friday morning , slowly leaving the moonless @entity26 night , a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream
he was in his home in @entity144 and beside him he could hear his wife @entity146 breathing , her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat
otherwise the house was silent
he knew it was near six o'clock , and the peace would not last
the morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second - story windows
one of the four would open his or her eyes , and from there the movements were brisk , the house quickly growing loud
with one child awake , it was impossible to keep the other three in bed
@entity146 woke to a thump upstairs , coming from one of the kids ' rooms
she listened closely , praying silently for rest
each morning there was a delicate period , between six and six - thirty , when there was a chance , however remote , that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep
but now there was another thump , and the dog barked , and another thump followed
what was happening in this house ? @entity146 looked to her husband
he was staring at the ceiling
the day had roared to life
the phone began ringing , today as always , before their feet hit the floor
@entity146 and @entity3 -- most people called him by his last name because they could n't pronounce his first -- ran a company , @entity194 , and every day their crews , their clients , everyone with a phone and their number , seemed to think that once the clock struck six - thirty , it was appropriate to call
usually there were so many calls at the stroke of six - thirty that the overlap would send half of them straight to voicemail
@entity146 took the first one , from a client across town , while @entity3 shuffled into the shower
fridays were always busy , but this one promised madness , given the rough weather on the way
there had been rumblings all week about a tropical storm crossing the @entity220 , a chance it might head north
though this kind of possibility presented itself every august and did n't raise eyebrows for most , @entity146 and @entity3 's more cautious clients and friends often made preparations
throughout the morning the callers would want to know if @entity3 could board up their windows and doors , if he would be clearing his equipment off their property before the winds came
workers would want to know if they 'd be expected to come in that day or the next
" @entity237 , " @entity146 said , trying to sound alert
it was an elderly client , a woman living alone in a @entity241 mansion , asking if @entity3 's crew could come over and board up her windows
" sure , of course , " @entity146 said , letting her feet drop heavily to the floor
@entity146 was the business 's secretary , bookkeeper , credit department , public - relations manager -- she did everything in the office , while her husband handled the building and painting
the two of them balanced each other well : @entity3 's @entity257 had its limits , so when bills had to be negotiated , hearing @entity146 's @entity261 drawl put clients at ease
this was part of the job , helping clients prepare their homes for coming winds
@entity146 had n't given much thought to the storm this client was talking about
it took a lot more than a few downed trees in south @entity220 to get her attention
" we 'll have a crew over this afternoon , " @entity146 told the woman
@entity146 and @entity3 had been married for eleven years
@entity3 had come to @entity144 in 1994 , by way of @entity281 and @entity282 and a half - dozen other @entity7 cities he 'd explored as a young man
@entity146 had grown up in @entity282 and was used to the hurricane routine : the litany of preparations , the waiting and watching , the power outages , the candles and flashlights and buckets catching rain
there seemed to be a half - dozen named storms every august , and they were rarely worth the trouble
this one , named @entity10 , would be no different .
