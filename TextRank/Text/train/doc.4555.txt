@entity0 , @entity1 -- convicted killer @entity4 was executed early friday by firing squad , the @entity3 said
@entity4 , 49 , is only the third person in 33 years to die by firing squad in the @entity7
he was killed at 12:20 a.m. mst ( 2:20 a.m. et ) , a @entity9 spokesman said
a hood was placed over @entity4 's head and a paper target pinned to his chest
he was heavily restrained as a five - person firing squad took aim at the target and shot him , witnesses said
journalists who witnessed the shooting said it happend quickly
one reporter said she noticed that @entity4 moved after he was shot
" it was over pretty quickly , " said @entity23 , a local radio reporter
" it was cleaner than i expected
he moved a little bit , and to some degree that bothers me
" outside the prison in @entity1 , there was a candlelight vigil attended by members of @entity4 's family
" he did things bad in the past , but now he realizes what he did and he changed the last couple of years , " said his granddaughter @entity35 , breaking into tears
" i got to know him the last couple of years
it sucks when you have to say goodbye to someone that is like your best friend
" the execution came after @entity4 's last - ditch efforts to save himself had failed
the @entity7 @entity50 rejected a request thursday to temporarily stay the execution
@entity1 gov. @entity52 rejected two appeals by @entity4 's attorneys to stop the execution , saying he had every chance to present his case
@entity4 , 49 , was convicted for the shooting death of attorney @entity58 during a botched escape attempt from custody in 1985 at a @entity62 , @entity1 , courthouse
among the claims @entity4 raised in his appeals is that he has been a death - row inmate for too long
" he asserts that executing him now , after nearly 25 years on death - row in @entity1 , so lacks retributive or deterrent value that it violates the @entity70 , " @entity65 , @entity4 's lawyer , told the high court
a federal judge late tuesday declined to block the execution , after @entity4 claimed the procedures related to a two - day commutation hearing held by the state @entity75 last week violated his civil rights
the parole board monday declined to commute @entity4 's sentence to life in prison , and the @entity82 on tuesday also denied his request for a stay
@entity4 was the third person to die by rifle fire , all in @entity1 , since the @entity50 restored the death penalty in 1976
he had a long history of escapes and was slipped a gun before he fatally shot @entity58 on april 2 , 1985
he was at the courthouse for a pre-trial hearing in the 1984 slaying of @entity94 , who was killed at the @entity62 bar where he was working to earn extra money
corrections officials announced @entity4 had consumed his last meal tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. , and chose to fast prior to the anticipated execution
his dinner included steak , lobster , @entity103 , apple pie and vanilla ice cream
@entity2 's @entity106 and @entity107 contributed to this report .
