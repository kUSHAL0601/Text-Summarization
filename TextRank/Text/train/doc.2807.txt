@entity0 , @entity1 -- he was born in @entity4 and spent much of his youth in @entity6 and south @entity1
investigators now allege that @entity8 has risen to a key position in @entity11 's leadership
the @entity12 says that after he left @entity13 , @entity8 started off as an @entity11 dishwasher , doing menial tasks at training camps
but he 's much more than a dishwasher now , according to investigators
" it 's like any other business
he would be equated with being the chief of operations , " says @entity21 , a special agent for the @entity12
as the alleged director of @entity11 's overseas operations , investigators believe he is " extremely dangerous , " @entity25 says
" he may not be someone who 's going to come into the @entity13 to conduct the attack , but what makes him more dangerous is he 's out there plotting the attacks and recruiting people to actively do that , " @entity25 says
the breakthrough came when @entity25 , an @entity12 counter-terrorism agent , linked @entity8 to the thwarted @entity39 suicide mission last fall -- the biggest post- 9/11 terror investigation
@entity41 and @entity42 admitted they planned to blow themselves up using homemade bombs
prosecutors say it was @entity8 who called the shots -- probably from somewhere along the @entity52 - @entity51 border
" [ @entity8 ] was the one that convinced ... them to come back to the @entity13 and conduct the attack here , " @entity25 says
but @entity8 's mother -- who did not wish to be named in order to protect her privacy -- says authorities are using her son as a scapegoat
" that is not my son
my son is not a violent person
he is very kind , generous , " she says
@entity8 -- the eldest son of a @entity4 @entity66 -- came to @entity13 as a young child
they settled in @entity69 , @entity6 , where his father preached at a mosque
they lived at a nearby house before moving to @entity1 in the mid- ' 90s
his father , who is now dead , opened a small mosque near @entity75
meanwhile , @entity8 worked at odd jobs , including selling used cars
his family says it 's how he paid for courses , including computers and chemistry , at a small college in @entity1
he even took classes to improve his @entity85
a few years later , when the @entity12 said they wanted to find him , @entity8 's @entity85 professor remembered videotaping him in class and turned over the tape to the @entity12
that proved crucial six years later
on a hunch , @entity25 asked agents in @entity6 to show that video of @entity8 to would - be bomber @entity41
" from that video , he was able to make an identification , " @entity25 says
the @entity12 says it now has a more detailed profile of @entity8 in part , from 9/11 mastermind @entity99
just before 9/11 , the @entity12 says @entity8 crossed the @entity13 by train
later , he scoped out the @entity101 as a target
he went to @entity103 , @entity104 and -- by june 2001 -- @entity52
on 9/11 , his mother says he called home for the last time
" he called me and he said , ' did you hear what happened with so and so and so ? ' he said , ' they 're putting it on the @entity112
i said , ' yes
' " she says she told him not to come home
" and he was arguing with me
he said , ' no , i did n't do nothing
i will come , do n't worry about this , ' " she recalls
after that , she says , she never heard from him again
@entity8 's mother adamantly denies her son is directing @entity11 attacks
but when asked about @entity124 -- who has pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges in the attempted car bomb attack in @entity127 in may -- she says that sometimes " you have to do something very alarming for the people to wake up
" " it 's not because you hate them or you want to destroy them or you want to hurt them , " she says
when asked if she has a message to send her son , she says she has nothing to say
" he [ has ] his own guide in his own heart , " she says
for the @entity12 , it 's all about staying one step ahead
where will @entity11 -- and their alleged chief of operations -- strike next ? " he 's definitely focused on attacking the @entity13 and other western countries , " @entity25 says
the @entity12 believes @entity8 is likely in @entity51 's lawless tribal region of @entity148
@entity8 moved up the ladder after two others who directed outside operations for @entity11 were killed in suspected @entity13 drone attacks , the @entity12 says .
