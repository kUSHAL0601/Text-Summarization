-- @entity1 is hot favorite for overall victory , but @entity4 will be keeping the race leader 's @entity6 jersey warm for his fellow countryman after a blistering finish to win the opening stage of the @entity11 saturday
@entity4 came with a late charge on the seafront in @entity14 to pip home rider @entity15 of the @entity17 team on the line
@entity20 @entity19 was third in the 130km opener around the southern @entity23 city
it was a reminder , if any was needed , of @entity4 's incredible finishing speed as he claimed his 11th @entity11 stage victory and his first in a @entity27 for new team @entity28
the 27 - year - old had to do it the hard way as lead out man @entity32 had a mechanical problem in the final kilometer and @entity4 was left to make up a small gap before unleashing his late burst
@entity15 was left thumping his handlebars in frustration at such a near miss while @entity4 acknowledged it had been a hard fought win
" that was a difficult , difficult stage for me
the team were incredible in staying in front but we did n't get it right at the end
" it 's cost us a lot recently but i managed to come round and win
i really wanted that so badly
he will take an eight second time bonus lead over @entity15 , with @entity19 12 seconds behind , into sunday 's 17.5km team time trial on the island of @entity50
@entity4 spent a single season with @entity52 at @entity53 last season , claiming the final stage of the @entity56 as his teammate made history by becoming the first @entity59 to win the historic race
but with @entity53 placing the emphasis on riders like @entity52 and @entity63 in winning the overall classification at races such as the @entity27 and @entity11 , he left to join @entity28 in the close season
@entity52 and his @entity53 team will be expected to make their move on sunday 's stage
the reigning @entity56 champion finished safely in the bunch , which split after a late crash , leaving @entity4 and a clutch of other sprint specialists to fight out the finish
@entity79 's @entity78 of the @entity81 team is the defending champion at the @entity11 with @entity83 's @entity82 carrying the main home hopes .
