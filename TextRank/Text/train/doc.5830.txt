@entity8 the 2016 calculations of three potential candidates -- two republicans and a very senior @entity3 -- plus big tests for president @entity5 and @entity7 majority leader @entity6 filled our sunday trip around the " @entity13 " table
sen. @entity14 of @entity15 skipped the big weekend @entity16 gathering in @entity17 , and some believe @entity20 's presumed candidacy makes it hard for @entity14 to find his 2016 footing
but @entity23 of the @entity24 shared reporting on how @entity14 is still very interested in running , and hopeful that perhaps the interest from @entity26 offers him a new place in the growing @entity16 field
" one of the things that is really keeping him intrigued by this race is the possibility that @entity26 will run , " said @entity23
" if you have a @entity20 and @entity26 scenario , that could open up a door for @entity14 because it divides the center right and also it makes @entity14 look more conservative , less establishment
" no offense to tv anchors , but what a politician says during a morning show interview may not tell you as much as what he or she says -- or does n't say -- once the camera stops rolling
a case in point just might be vice president @entity48 , who told @entity49 the other day he is still thinking about another run for president in 2016 , notwithstanding polls showing @entity53 with an overwhelming advantage among @entity55
the @entity57 's @entity56 , however , says she went looking for evidence the vp is doing the work necessary to actually run and , well , she 's still looking
" so i talked to some well - placed democrats in @entity17 who would be hearing from him if he were serious about this , because that 's what he would be doing , " said @entity56
" they have n't got the call saying , ' hey , do me a favor , keep your powder dry
' so all the signs out there -- this is the time when he would need to be reaching out to those people that he 's known for a long time , and they 're not hearing from @entity48
" the emails started midafternoon and kept coming into the evening
" @entity82 ? " was all one said
" do your people there think she is serious ? " was part of another
when @entity90 told @entity17 republicans he is seriously thinking about a 2016 run , serious @entity16 operatives just laughed
the way they did when @entity90 said the same early in the 2012 cycle
most also think @entity82 , like @entity90 , just likes the attention and wants to keep her name in the mix but is n't really serious about running
but , unlike their reaction to @entity90 , many @entity16 operatives take a minute , or three , to consider the impact @entity82 could have if she actually did run
again , that 's highly unlikely -- but it would be wrong to " misunderestimate " her potential in @entity17
imagine a field of @entity82 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and others competing for tea party and evangelical voters
@entity17 does n't pick nominees , but it does winnow the field -- and the competition on the right in the @entity16 class of 2016 is already intense
new senate majority leader @entity6 promised he would run things differently -- and it 's true that in the first big debate of his tenure , there has been a more free - flowing debate and more amendments
but @entity126 apparently did n't mean limitless free debate , and his moves late last week to shut down debate on some @entity131 amendments annoyed some @entity55 -- including some the @entity16 leader needs on his side to pass his bill
so @entity135 of the @entity136 took us inside the @entity7 as we wait to see whether @entity126 can get his first legislative priority to the finish line
" expect to see @entity16 allow for a few more ( debates on amendments ) , at least this week , partly because the moderate @entity55 , that @entity16 are going to need to pass this bill , expressed some displeasure about it over the weekend , " said @entity135
" there 's some concern that if they get upset , either they part ways on this bill or they wo n't be there in the future
" one ask in president @entity5 's @entity154 address was for @entity155 to authorize the military campaign under way against @entity159 targets in the @entity160
it was a jarring moment if you recall how @entity5 broke out in 2008 by being the candidate who opposed the @entity165 war and wanted to get the @entity166 out of @entity165 and @entity167
just watching him ask for authorization of military force was a reminder the world has not unfolded as @entity5 had hoped
@entity173 of the @entity24 shared reporting about whether the president 's request was an important shift in administration thinking
" some people think he goofed a little when he said we need that authority
that 's actually a change in position for him , " said @entity173
" but now he really wants @entity155 to give him some legislation that would authorize that fight
internally in the @entity192 , the discussions are really heating up about what that should look like
they 're anticipating quite a fight on @entity197 both with @entity16 and @entity55
