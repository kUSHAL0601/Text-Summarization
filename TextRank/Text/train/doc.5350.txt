a bar owner arrives to find his bartender still drunk , sleeping on a floor littered with empty beer bottles and cans
the band arrives , carrying a beaten - up car door
the intoxicated bartender , struggling to consciousness , is incapable of walking a straight line , yet he takes to a tightrope strung across the bar to do tricks to impress the cute female vocalist
this is n't a a scene from a wild @entity18 bar
it 's the opening act of " @entity20 , " a show by the @entity22 in @entity23 , the departure point for exploring dazzling @entity20 archaeological sites such as @entity26
after a day scrambling ruins in the sticky heat , most tourists spend their nights dining on @entity20 barbecue while downing cold one - dollar beers on @entity33
but increasingly , visitors are opting for a taste of contemporary @entity18 culture , everyday life and entertainment under the big top at the city 's new circus
@entity42 in @entity18 performing arts wiped out by the @entity44 seeing a circus in @entity23 is n't such a strange idea
carvings at temple ruins dating back as far as the 6th century vividly illustrate the country 's circus tradition , depicting circus artists performing for ceremonies and festivals
in the 1960s , @entity54 encouraged a revitalization of the circus , only to see it die in 1975 when @entity59 's brutal @entity44 abolished all forms of art , culture and creative expression , and murdered artists
after the @entity69 occupation sent the @entity44 fleeing into the jungle , eight young @entity18 who 'd been in a refugee camp on the @entity67 border decided to help rebuild their country by reviving the arts and culture scene
in 1994 , the group established @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , a " @entity78 , " and opened a school for visual and performing arts , including circus skills , in a place that needed it most : poverty - stricken @entity84
near the @entity67 border , the small city was a magnet for repatriating refugees , including orphans , most suffering post-traumatic stress
@entity77 rescued disadvantaged children from the street , troubled homes and trafficking by providing free food , education , training and jobs
while the school is flourishing in @entity84 , where some 1,400 students are enrolled , @entity77 decided to raise its shiny red big top tent and launch a program of shows starring students and graduates in @entity23
@entity18 's most popular tourist destination , @entity23 had 1.24 million foreign tourists visit in the first seven months of 2013 , making @entity77 's mission to reap profits and become self - sustainable more achievable
@entity111 's @entity110 : @entity114 's @entity113 - inspired fast food joint distinctly @entity18 show @entity76 is no ordinary circus , but an edgy , alternative , down - to - earth , all - singing - and - dancing @entity18 circus in the tradition of @entity121
a contemporary circus without animals , the cast of talented young @entity18 performers are accomplished in acrobatics , contortion , aerial ballet , balancing , tightrope walking , fire dancing , vaulting , juggling , music , dance , drama , mime and comedy
their show , " @entity20 , " about love , life and rock ' n ' roll , is set over the course of one night in a crazy bar and it 's edge - of - the - seat stuff
a cocktail - sipping customer in a miniskirt and high heels does an elbow stand on the table , folding her legs over her back and head with ease to shoot a bow and arrow at a balloon with her feet
a moneyed , muscle - bound customer in skinny white jeans , who has had his @entity162 stolen , takes to the bar , doing some impressive hand - balancing moves on beer taps to grab her attention
in between these daring feats and complex tricks , bar staff and customers break into choreographed dance numbers as the band performs @entity18 rock songs , incorporating an array of samples , from heavy metal to hip hop , traditional @entity180 folk music to 1960s @entity18 pop. 10 meals every visitor to @entity18 should try show draws from folk traditions while " @entity20 " is thoroughly modern in its setting and storytelling , the group 's " @entity188 " show is steeped in tradition , drawing from folk stories , religion and popular beliefs to tell the story of a bullied hunchback , rejected by villagers , who seeks divine intervention from an angel - like @entity200 , the celestial maiden who graces @entity26 temple walls
wearing the simple black garb of rural peasants and using few props , the artists perform elaborate acrobatics and audacious stunts , forming human towers to strike @entity200 poses , doing somersaults in flight and executing an impressive aerial strap routine
in between acts , they do a spirited , high - energy dance to the upbeat rhythms of the traditional xylophone , guitar and drums
as clever as it is , it 's ultimately uplifting fun , the energy and enthusiasm of the artists contagious
what also makes @entity76 special is that it 's distinctly @entity18 -- the music , dance , settings , themes and stories provide an insight into @entity18 culture and everyday life difficult to experience scrambling about ruins -- or drinking beers on @entity33
@entity22 tickets ( adults / kids $ 15 / $ 8 ) available for daily 7:30 p.m. shows from 7p.m
