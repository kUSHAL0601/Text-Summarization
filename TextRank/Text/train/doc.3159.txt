-- @entity1 believes his renowned ability as a frontrunner will land him the @entity5 title despite seeing his lead cut to a single stroke at the halfway stage friday
@entity1 was unable to reproduce his first round heroics when he shot a 63 , but followed it up with a two - under - par 70 for a two - round total of 11 - under 133
unheralded @entity14 @entity13 was his nearest challenger after a sparkling second round 65 while world number one @entity16 struggled to a one - over 73 to make the cut by one shot on three - under
@entity21 's @entity20 matched @entity13 's 65 to share third place on eight - under with @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity26 @entity25
defending champion @entity27 , who played in the same group as @entity1 and @entity16 , was among seven players a shot further back , which included last year 's @entity33 number one @entity34 of @entity35
@entity1 struggled from the outset with a bogey on his opening hole but recovered to card three birdies to the turn
on the easier back nine he would have expected to pull further clear but instead made two bogeys , canceled out by birdies at the 10th and 18th
the 24 - year - old remained optimistic he could build on his slender lead at the weekend and land his sixth @entity46 title
" i will just go back tonight and regroup and realize that i am still leading the tournament , " he told the official @entity46 website
" i hit a couple of loose drives which i have n't done the last couple of weeks but i still feel like i 'm playing well enough to go and win the tournament
" @entity1 has won a number of events , including the 2009 @entity5 after leading for much of the way and believes it will hold him in good stead
" i have led from the front quite well in tournaments that i have won
i feel like i am still playing well , i know the course as well as anyone else and i expect to go out there and shoot two good scores over the weekend and hopefully lift the trophy
" @entity13 , who won three events on the secondary @entity67 last season , carded seven birdies to earn his chance of pairing with @entity1 saturday
" i 've never played with @entity1 , so it 's going to be fun
i know him a little bit from seeing him around , so hopefully i 'll be able to play as well as i did today , " he said
@entity34 , who topped the money lists in both the @entity78 and @entity79 last season , looks to pose the biggest threat to @entity1
" i think there is still a little way to go but today was the best i have putted for a long , long time , " said the @entity35
woods , who missed the cut in his opening event of 2014 , was wayward off the tee and found the fairway just twice from 10 attempts when using his driver
the result was a three - bogey round that left him tied for for 44th , but still not out of the running if he could produce an inspired round at the weekend .
