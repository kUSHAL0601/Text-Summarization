@entity0 has issued a defiant message to his rivals for the @entity5 presidency and challenged @entity7 governing body @entity6 to put up a candidate of its own in the election later this year
@entity0 , who is seeking a fifth term at the helm of world football 's governing body , told @entity1 in an exclusive interview that he still had unfinished business and would not step aside without a fight
" i have to say i have not finished my mission because it 's a mission to be in football
we have started in 2011 with the reform process
the reform process is not over
i would like to have these four years to finish it and to show that football is more than a game
" but @entity5 has been mired in controversy since its decision to award the 2018 and 2022 @entity30 to @entity31 and @entity32
criticism reached a fever pitch when the man hired to investigate the bidding process for those @entity30 , @entity38 lawyer @entity37 , resigned in protest last year , unhappy that the published summary did not accurately reflect his findings
@entity0 has faced calls to stand down and although @entity6 is yet to declare its official position , he clearly believes they are campaigning behind the scenes to depose him
" they want to get rid of me , " he told @entity1
" all this opposition is coming now it 's unfortunate to say it , it 's coming from @entity51 , from @entity6
they do n't have the courage to come in
" so let me go ( on ) - be respectful ! because in football you learn to win but you also learn to lose
so i 'm going now
if i win the better , if i lose ok ! " a @entity6 spokesman told @entity1 sunday that they had no immediate comment to make over @entity0 's remarks
three candidates have so far stated their intention to challenge @entity0 ; @entity63 @entity62 , @entity64 of @entity65 and former star footballer @entity66
all must get the backing of at least five of the 209 member associations of @entity5 by a deadline of january 29th to get on the ballot paper for the election on may 29
@entity0 appears unfazed by his likely opponents , with or without another candidate throwing their hat into the ring at this late stage
" i have been asked by the national associations to be our candidate again because nobody that is strong was in
so i go there , " he said
he also appears to be relishing the fight ahead , despite closing on his 79th birthday in march
" i 'm now 40 years in @entity5
i 've been the president since 1998
" you know it is impossible to make everybody happy
" if i would have only positive press then it would not be good
and i like criticism as long as the criticism is ... i would say fair criticism
i like the discussion to go with that
but listen i 've been there such a long time now and i just want to finish that , " he added
but perhaps at odds with his other comments , @entity0 also called for unity in football , effectively inviting @entity6 to put up or shut up
" football is a team sport
let 's go together with the team
i invite the confederation of @entity6 and especially the leaders of @entity6 that are so bitterly attacking me : join ! join ! football is a unity
and we need this unity in this world
" and if he can not find the necessary level of support and extend his tenure as the most powerful in world football , @entity0 came up with a surprising choice of new career
" the day i 'm going to retire the first thing i 'm going to do is radio
i always said i will do radio
" because radio is even more popular than television , than all electronics ... i said one day - this was my boy 's wish - to be a radio reporter one day
i do n't know but i 'm not so bad
" the first indication of whether @entity0 will be seeking out new horizons may well come on february 7th or 8th , the date he revealed to @entity1 when @entity5 will make public the full list of qualified candidates for the election
" anyway , i 'm in and i do n't mind
it 's not my first battle for the presidency
i still have the conviction and i believe in myself and i believe in football , " the @entity137 said .
