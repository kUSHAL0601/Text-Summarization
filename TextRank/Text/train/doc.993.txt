@entity0 , @entity1 -- security was tight in @entity1 on saturday for a contentious annual march by a @entity6 group
saturday 's march by the @entity8 through the mainly @entity10 city of @entity11 is the largest of several they hold during the year , mainly in summer
the march commemorates the @entity15 in 1689 , when thousands of @entity6 died
before the @entity11 parade was due to begin at 12:30 p.m. ( 7:30 a.m. et ) , local members were also holding smaller " feeder " parades in their own areas
a feeder parade in the @entity23 area of north @entity0 , a flashpoint for sectarian violence , happened peacefully saturday morning
trouble flared in @entity23 and other areas of @entity0 last month after a decision to allow another @entity6 parade to pass through a mainly @entity10 neighborhood on july 12 , a day when protestants march to celebrate the victory of @entity33 's @entity32 over his ousted @entity10 predecessor , @entity34 , in 1689
dozens of officers were hurt in days of violence surrounding the annual event , known as @entity39
