-- @entity2 ' water broke early on december 1 , 2010
just 18 weeks pregnant , she called a friend for a ride to @entity6 , the only hospital in @entity7 , @entity8
during that visit , and two others the following day , @entity9 was in excruciating pain
she was sent home twice -- given pain medication , told to return if her contractions became unbearable -- and was waiting to be discharged for a third time when she started to give birth
the baby died less than three hours after it was delivered
that 's all according to a lawsuit filed on her behalf by the @entity24 last week , which also said that @entity2 ' fetus had almost no chance of surviving and continuing the pregnancy posed serious risks to her health
health care providers at the hospital knew those facts to be true , the suit alleges , but failed to tell @entity9 about the risks and the option of ending her pregnancy because they follow directives from the @entity40 , which do not permit abortion
" as a direct result of these religious directives , ms. @entity9 suffered severe , unnecessary , and foreseeable physical and emotional pain and suffering , " reads the lawsuit , which was filed in the @entity43
it accuses the @entity40 and others of negligence " for promulgating and implementing directives that cause pregnant women who are suffering from a miscarriage to be denied appropriate medical care , including information about their condition and treatment options
" it seeks damages and a declaration that the defendants ' actions were negligent
' abortion ... is never permitted ' at the center of the case is what is known as the @entity66 and @entity67 -- a set of guidelines that advises @entity71 health care providers and patients what to do
specifically , the lawsuit mentions directives no. 27 and no. 45
directive 27 states : " free and informed consent requires that the person or the person 's surrogate receive all reasonable information about the essential nature of the proposed treatment and its benefits ; its risks , side - effects , consequences , and cost ; and any reasonable and morally legitimate alternatives , including no treatment at all
" the termination of a pregnancy would not be considered " morally legitimate , " as outlined in directive 45
" abortion ( that is , the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the directly intended destruction of a viable fetus ) is never permitted , " that directive reads
still , the @entity40 is not standing by doctors , whispering in their ears , telling them what to do , said @entity103 , a law professor at the @entity104 who focuses on bioethics , health law and religious liberty
" you would have to show some sort of control , or agency , or direct duty in order to reach up to them
... what i read did n't seem to make the linkages that i would have wanted to see , " she said , adding that she thinks the case will be difficult for the @entity24 to argue
" creative claims win sometimes
it 's just conceptually hard to get my mind around it , " @entity103 said
@entity122 , a spokesman for the @entity40 , declined to comment on the @entity8 case
a call to @entity6 was not immediately returned monday
' it 's about medical care ' means ' lawsuit raises issues similar to a recent case in @entity131
there , a woman died after being denied an abortion last year
seventeen weeks pregnant , @entity135 , 31 , went into a hospital complaining of back pain
the doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but refused to do an abortion even though she was in extreme pain , her husband said
days later , @entity145 died from a blood infection , leading lawmakers to call for an investigation into what role abortion laws may have played in her death
" they knew they could n't help the baby
why did they not look at the bigger life ? " her husband , @entity154 , told the @entity156
according to the @entity8 lawsuit , @entity9 was diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes
at the time she gave birth , she had acute chorioamnionitis and acute funisitis , infections she developed after her membranes ruptured
when left untreated , both can result in infertility and cause other problems , the lawsuit states
it says that @entity9 should have been told about her treatment options , including the termination of her pregnancy
she also should have been told about the risks associated with continuing the pregnancy and that even if she decided to go ahead with it , there was virtually no chance the fetus would survive , the lawsuit says
had @entity2 known the full extent of her condition , she would have opted to end the pregnancy , according to the lawsuit
the @entity24 filed the suit to get relief for @entity2 and to make sure that what happened to her wo n't happen to other women , said @entity192 , national deputy legal director at the @entity24
" we care about the right to practice religion , " she said
" but this case is n't about religious freedom
it 's about medical care
