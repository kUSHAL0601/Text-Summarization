@entity1 @entity4 rep. @entity3 will not run for president in 2016 , he said in a statement on monday , preferring instead to focus on policy work as chairman of the @entity9
" after giving it a lot of thought , i 've decided not to run for president
our work at the @entity9 over the next few years will be crucial to moving @entity15 forward , and my job as chairman deserves undivided attention , " he said
@entity19 vs. @entity20 : the establishment match - up " it 's clear our country needs a change in direction
and our party has a responsibility to offer a real alternative
so i 'm going to do what i can to lay out conservative solutions and to help our nominee lead us to victory , " @entity3 added
@entity3 , the @entity33 's 2012 vice-presidential nominee , has long been seen as a top contender for the presidency
the nine - term congressman has made a national name for himself as a policy wonk on @entity39 , helping to draft and promote the @entity33 's budget proposals as chairman of the @entity42
indeed , the @entity44 average of national political polls of the potential 2016 @entity33 field found @entity3 in third place , behind former @entity48 gov. @entity20 and @entity50 gov. @entity49
a @entity2 / @entity52 poll conducted in mid-december , however , found him farther down in the pack , tying for sixth with @entity48 sen. @entity55
but even as he 's decided to say no to a presidential bid , @entity33 have a chance for deja vu with his top - of - the - ticket running mate , former @entity33 presidential nominee @entity19
@entity19 recently told donors that he 's considering a 2016 run for president , and has led a number of national polls of the potential field
but @entity3 told @entity67 that his decision came over the holidays , long before @entity19 appeared to be inching towards another bid
" it is no secret that i have always thought @entity19 would make a great president , " he said
" as for his plans for 2016 , i do n't know what he is ultimately going to do and the last thing i want to do is get ahead of his own decision making process
" @entity3 would n't offer his support for any potential @entity33 contender , however
" i think we 've got a number of very capable candidates who have every ability to become president
there are a lot of talented people , " he told @entity67 in a phone interview
" i think it is critical that our party puts forward bold , conservative ideas and give people a choice
i think we have a number of capable leaders who can do that
