-- two lesser lights stole the headlines as the @entity3 routed the @entity4 113 - 77 in @entity5 of the 2013 @entity6
all talk ahead of the best - of - seven series centered on the " @entity4 " on each team , with @entity3 's @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 set to take on @entity4 's @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15
but it was @entity17 and @entity18 of the @entity3 who took the contest away from the defending champion at @entity3 's @entity23 on tuesday as the home side took a 2 - 1 series lead
@entity17 scored 27 points with @entity18 scoring 24 as @entity3 , which last won the title in 2007 , sank a finals - record 16 three - pointers
" those guys stepping up on this stage in this game is huge for us , " @entity10 told reporters after finishing with 12 points and 14 rebounds
" we talked about it before the series started , how we 're going to have to have guys step up and guys play well in certain games
and we do n't expect a performance like this from those kind of guys , but they were great
" @entity11 was forced to withdraw with a hamstring injury in the second half , but even the loss of @entity3 's star point guard could n't prevent a crushing win
" it 's been a while since i shot the ball like that , " said @entity17
" a couple games in the season , i shot it pretty well , but tonight it was a totally different level of feeling -- comfort level on the perimeter
" @entity3 will now sweat over the fitness of @entity11 , who will have an mri scan to judge whether he will be fit for thursday 's @entity62
@entity63 , to be played on sunday , will take place in @entity3 before the series return to @entity4 's @entity66
" we did n't do anything right , " said @entity13 , whose team lost in the 2011 finals
" we ca n't play like that on either side of the floor if we want to win
" at the end of the day it is just one win for them
we have to come out thursday and do better
