and the winner is ... @entity1
that was the selection made wednesday by @entity3 , the @entity4 high school student accepted by the eight @entity6 schools -- @entity7 , @entity1 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13
he made his pick in style , staging a news conference in the gym of @entity19 and delivering the big announcement before teachers and members of the media
a visit to the @entity25 , @entity26 , campus helped him decide
" my @entity28 experience last week was incredible , " he said
" i met geniuses from all across the world
and everyone there was so friendly and inviting
... and i believe that their deep appreciation and love for music , like i have , was very critical for me deciding to go there
" his father , @entity38 , thanked all those at the high school who encouraged his son
" we are grateful for all the inspiration , " he said
" people think @entity3 is like an angel or somebody who was sheltered
really , we gave him a lot of freedom , even though at the same time we were very strict with him in terms of academics and the way he behaved
... we only pray that going forward he will stay focused and not be distracted
" referring to @entity3 's 14 - year - old sister , @entity57 , their father said : " i told her , look , i believe you can do better than him
" @entity3 scored 2250 out of a possible 2400 on his sat , placing him in the 98th percentile across the country , according to @entity64
he 's also ranked 11th in his class at @entity19 , a public school on @entity66 , according to his principal , @entity67
" i applied knowing that going to any of the @entity6 schools would be wonderful , " @entity3 told @entity68 earlier this month
" i thought if i applied to all eight , i figured i 'd get into one ... but from the first one onwards i said , ' this ca n't be happening ! ' i was shocked seeing all these acceptances under my name
" @entity67 said @entity3 is not only a model academic student , but also plays three instruments for the chamber orchestra , sings in an a cappella group , throws shot put and discus for the high school 's track and field team , participates in student government and has had a lead role in school plays since the ninth grade
" usually kids are good athletes or good musicians or good actors , but they do n't have all three and then on top add student government
it 's a balancing act
he somehow finds time to do it all and then volunteer at a local hospital , " @entity67 said
@entity67 has been @entity3 's principal for six years in both middle and high school
" he is an incredibly modest , humble and respectable person , " @entity67 said
" he is incredibly dedicated and he has his priorities straight
he takes advantage of whatever opportunity he is afforded
" @entity98 , the founder of @entity99 in @entity100 , who also previously served on admissions committees at selective universities , said the feat is extremely rare
" it 's quite atypical , " @entity104 said , adding that most students do not apply to all the @entity6 schools
" standardized test scores and good grades will get a student in the door to have their application read , " @entity104 said
" but it 's their extracurricular activities , leadership experience , exceptional talents , recommendation letters and personal essays that will move a student from a pile of ' maybes ' to a pile of ' accepted
' " @entity7 's acceptance rate , among the most selective in the country , was just 5.9 % for the applicants for the class of 2017 , according to its admissions site
@entity3 was also accepted to @entity129 and three @entity131 campuses
@entity3 admitted all along that he favored @entity1
" i really liked their sense of family , relationships between undergraduates and professors , and the residential college , " he said earlier this month
" they also have a strong biomedical engineering program , which is a wonderful combination of biology and creative tools that doctors and health care professionals can use
" @entity3 added that @entity1 also has a strong music program , one of his beloved hobbies that he hopes to continue when he is n't hitting the books in college
he hopes to one day pursue medicine , a dream of his that just so happens to align with his parents ' careers
his parents , who immigrated from @entity157 in the late 1980s , are both nurses and pushed @entity3 to receive the highest grades possible and follow his dreams
" health care is a prominent field that satisfies people beyond finances and edifies people and is about moral development , " he said
his advice for future applicants ? " follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools , " he said
" develop your outside interests -- not just academics
