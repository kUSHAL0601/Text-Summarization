@entity0 -- after deliberating for more than 20 hours over three days , jurors in the @entity4 trial wrapped up for the day thursday afternoon and will be back at it for a fourth day on friday
the eight - man , four - woman federal panel asked thursday to see one of the pieces of evidence in the case -- a gun with an obliterated serial number
the last charge in the 32 - count indictment accuses @entity4 of possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers
@entity4 , 83 , is accused of racketeering , including involvement in 19 killings , and also 13 counts of extortion and money - laundering during a 20 - year " reign of terror " that defined @entity0 from the early ' 70s through 1995 , when @entity4 fled @entity0
outside the courtroom , @entity4 's lead attorney , @entity26 , said he was " very , very proud of the service these jurors have provided to us no matter what the outcome of the trial
" @entity26 added that it was difficult waiting for a verdict " because we invested at this point two years of work to get this case ready for trial
" " the longer the jury stays out the more it shows us they are as conscientious a jury as i have ever seen , " @entity26 said
" i know that the prosecutors also believe that , the judge believes that
we are very pleased at that
" the widow of one of @entity4 's alleged murder victims said separately that she believed " the jurors are looking at the situation and trying to do right by all of us
" @entity55 , who has been at the trial almost every day with her three sons , added , " we been putting our lives on hold since this trial started -- it 's tough ... but it 's almost over now
" still , @entity55 said , " if deliberations go for a long period of time i 'm going to start to worry about a mistrial
" ' you 're a coward ! ' widow yells at @entity4 on wednesday , jurors submitted five questions for the judge
one of the questions involved the second count of the federal racketeering charge , with that lengthy count including numerous alleged acts and involvement in killings
jurors wanted to know whether they needed to vote unanimously on the 33 " predicate acts , " including the 19 murders
@entity80 district court judge @entity79 answered in the affirmative , although she advised jurors that if they were unable to reach a decision on a specific act , they can move on and decide the next act
for @entity4 to be found guilty under that racketeering count , one of the major charges against him , jurors must agree that prosecutors proved he committed at least two of the acts within a 10 - year period
during the seven - week trial , jurors heard dramatic testimony from convicted gangsters , bookies , extortion victims , a disgraced @entity98 supervisor , ex-drug dealers , retired @entity98 agents and relatives of people @entity4 is accused of killing
former hit man @entity106 testified for both sides , for a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days
@entity4 never took the stand despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify
in fact , @entity4 seemed to want to testify
questioned by @entity115 , @entity4 called his decision a " choice made involuntarily
" @entity4 was a fugitive for more than 16 years , disappearing after a crooked @entity98 agent told him he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges
the @entity98 tracked him down and arrested him in 2011 in @entity120 , @entity121 , where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias
@entity4 's attorneys release photos designed to show his softer side
