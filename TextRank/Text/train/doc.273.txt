-- a man who worked as a civilian military contractor at an air force base in @entity4 faces federal charges for improperly getting military housing and failing to report the weapons he had at the location
the @entity12 attorney 's office in @entity13 said @entity14 has n't been indicted but has been charged by criminal complaint for actions last year at @entity17 , the headquarters of both @entity18 and @entity19
the complaint -- dated december 16 in @entity21 in @entity13 and unsealed two days ago -- said @entity14 made a false statement and violated a defense property security regulation
a statement from @entity17 said @entity14 legally possessed the weapons but he had failed to register them as the base required
@entity14 had an initial court appearance in @entity31 on wednesday and was released on his own recognizance , and his preliminary hearing will be next friday at @entity21 in @entity13 , the attorney 's office said
an affidavit from an air force detective laid out this timeline : early on april 23 , @entity14 was selected for random screening when he entered a gate at the base
two knives and an empty gun holster were found in the inspection of the man 's car
when @entity14 was asked if there were more weapons in the car , he said there were n't any
officers " noticed that @entity14 appeared dazed and confused " and they called in @entity13 police , who ran a field sobriety test and then arrested the man for driving under the influence
@entity14 was searched and authorities found a " concealed , loaded handgun
" police also searched his vehicle and found another loaded handgun , three more knives , a box of throwing stars , a machete , a collapsible baton , @entity64 and a slingshot with bbs
after he was released by police , he returned to the gate at the base
authorities read him his rights and @entity14 asserted his right to remain silent and asked for a lawyer
military officials wanted @entity14 's permission to search his home at the base but @entity14 denied it
after a military judge ok 'd a search warrant , weapons and ammunition were found at @entity14 's residence , including seven loaded firearms , about 9,389 more rounds of ammunition , several knives , brass knuckles , an electric stun gun , and a collapsible baton
@entity17 required him to register any weaponry he intended to keep in his residence but he had not reported any of the items
also , he was not permitted to carry concealed weapons on base
during the probe , the affidavit continues , investigators learned that @entity14 " obtained housing on @entity17 by subterfuge
" active duty orders are required to live on the base
while @entity14 is a member of the @entity102 , his commander said he " has not been on active duty orders at any time relevant to this complaint and has only been on active duty orders one time during his membership in the @entity102 to attend a week - long training session
" @entity14 was employed as a contractor by @entity111 " during some time periods relevant to the complaint , " and his supervisor at that company said he " was operating strictly as a civilian
" the affidavit says @entity14 " repeatedly held himself out to officials in the @entity120 " at the air base as being on active duty and eventually was approved for the on - base living quarters
@entity14 said his " incoming unit assignment " was @entity18 and he was transferred from " 11th @entity124
" which was his " assigned unit in the @entity102
" and , he visited the base housing office " dressed in a military uniform " and said he was working as " admiral @entity131 's aide and that admiral @entity131 had directed him to obtain government housing as quickly as possible , " the affidavit says
@entity133 , @entity14 's attorney , said the @entity135 case has not been resolved
as far as the accusations made in the affidavit , he said @entity14 was just following his orders
regarding the charge concerning the weapons , @entity133 said @entity14 had moved on base " just a few days " prior to the april 23 incident
he said @entity14 had n't completed all the paperwork required of him , including the form telling the @entity144 what weapons he had in his home
at present , @entity14 is no longer living on the base ; he is in a @entity13 condominium , @entity133 said
the attorney said @entity111 had let @entity14 go and his client is looking for work
the company said @entity14 " no longer works " there , but " the incident was not in any way related to his employment with us
" @entity133 said he has been working with the @entity144 to settle the matter
a statement from @entity17 mirrors the information in the affidavit
it said @entity14 " was apprehended by base security forces during a random base entry vehicle check
" it said " the security forces members followed established procedures and discovered legal weapons in his vehicle , but the weapons were not properly registered with the 6th @entity172
'' later , authorities determined that @entity14 " falsely presented himself on active duty status to gain residence on the installation
once his status was verified , his eligibility for base housing was revoked
" @entity0 's @entity181 contributed to this report
