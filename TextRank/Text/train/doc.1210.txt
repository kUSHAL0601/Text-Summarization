-- crews in @entity2 were testing the air tuesday morning for any dangerous fumes a day after two trains wrecked , sparking a large fire
the results of the tests will help determine when it is safe for residents to resume their routine activities
one of the trains was carrying crude oil , which sent dangerous smoke into the air , officials said
the incident occurred one mile west of @entity19 , a town of 2,300 residents about 25 miles west of @entity21
authorities issued an evacuation order , which was not mandatory , but " strongly , strongly recommended , " @entity23 sheriff @entity22 told @entity0
he estimated that 65 % of area residents heeded the call to leave their homes
there were no injuries in the wreck , and everyone is accounted for , @entity29 said
" when you see the fireball and you see the damage and the aftermath , that 's amazing that nobody was hurt , " he said
" there were people inside their homes that could feel the heat from the explosion in their homes
" firefighters were forced to let the fire burn out
the extreme heat made it impossible for them to get close enough to the flames to battle the blaze
@entity0 's @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 contributed to this report .
