six months ago , the story began as a puzzling news bulletin
a @entity3 passenger jet with 239 people on board had vanished from radar screens as it was flying from @entity7 to @entity8
the disappearance was quite the mystery
was it a terrorist attack ? was there a mechanical failure that led to a crash ? did the plane go down over land or water ? were there any survivors ? we all figured the answers would come after searchers found the aircraft or its wreckage
half a year later , it remains a deep mystery
no part of the plane has been discovered
not one speck of debris
with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board , it just vanished
authorities are convinced the plane crashed march 8 in the southern @entity39
satellite data and radar information indicate the plane turned off course and most likely went down about the time it would have run out of fuel
officials do n't know why it flew off course
looking for debris yielded nothing but garbage airplanes and ships searched the surface of the ocean for nearly two months , with each report of debris turning out to be a false lead or flotsam from another source
to date , more than 4.5 million square kilometers of sea have been scoured
an underwater drone with sonar took the search beneath the waves in mid-april and looked for the source of four underwater pings picked up by devices towed by ships
the pulses were encouraging because they were of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons on the plane
the four signals were within 30 kilometers of one another
more days of searching followed
dozens of underwater missions over hundreds of kilometers
heartbroken family members of the people on board the plane have been left still seeking answers
deciphering the noise recently , @entity84 researchers said they had recovered another underwater sound recorder that was in the ocean when @entity87 vanished
they found a signal similar to one they noticed on recordings from other devices pulled from the water
it could be a noise made by the plane crashing
as with many possible clues in this strange case , there is a big but
the researchers at @entity100 believe the sound or sounds came from an area thousands of kilometers to the northwest of the search area
the signal seems to have originated close to the tip of @entity108 , near a geologically active ridge -- meaning the recordings are most likely those of a seismic event
experts poring over data the latest clue comes from a failed satellite phone call from the airline 's staff on the morning the plane disappeared
subsequent analysis of the failed call has given experts a better idea of the aircraft 's position and where it was traveling , @entity84 deputy prime minister @entity119 said august 28
and that data indicates the missing passenger jet may have turned south slightly earlier than previously thought
the next phase of the search for the remains of the plane and the people on board is primarily focused on a 60,000 - square - kilometer area , roughly the size of @entity137 , in the southern @entity39
forbidding undersea terrain a deepwater search that will involve three ships is expected to start in the area in late september , using a range of sophisticated sonar equipment
the process is forecast to take as long as a year and cost $ 48 million , officials have said
ships have already been mapping the undersea terrain in the isolated swath of ocean to help the searchers
much of the geography of the area was previously unknown before @entity87 's disappearance drew attention there
and some of it will be very , very difficult to search , with the mapping survey showing undersea volcanoes and steep ridges
the latest analysis of the data indicates that southern areas of the huge search grid may be of high interest , @entity84 officials have said , suggesting that the zone is likely to be further adjusted
job cuts at airline the loss of @entity87 and the shoot - down of @entity170 17 over @entity171 in july have contributed to 6,000 people at the airline losing their jobs because of heavy financial losses
the carrier reported in late august that it lost $ 97.4 million in the second quarter
@entity3 was once a symbol of national pride
but the airline was in big financial trouble before the twin disasters of @entity87 and @entity182 claimed the lives of 537 people
@entity84 : @entity87 may have turned south earlier than previously thought hard areas found in search zone unlikely to be man - made
