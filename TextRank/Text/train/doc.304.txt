@entity0 , @entity1 -- as fighting continued in the @entity1 cities of @entity6 and @entity7 , a rebel spokesman questioned the commitment of @entity10 's mission there
forces loyal to @entity1 leader @entity14 were bombing @entity6 from 40 - 50 kilometers ( 25 - 31 miles ) away , @entity1 rebel spokesman @entity12 told @entity2
the loyalists who were bombing the city " have no problem with the weather conditions there , " referring to unconfirmed reports that @entity10 airstrikes were halted in the area due to weather conditions
@entity14 's forces are using @entity26 missiles and mortars , " and sometimes we feel that @entity10 wants to use any excuse out there so they do n't carry out their duties , " he said
@entity10 did not immediately respond to a @entity2 inquiry about its operations sunday
earlier , however , the @entity10 press office told @entity2 that it does not discuss ongoing operations and would not confirm or deny any reports
the most official report from @entity10 states that it conducted 142 sorties on saturday , of which 42 were strike sorties
@entity40 allies face unease without @entity40 at helm meanwhile , in @entity44 , six people were killed and 47 injured in sunday fighting , @entity12 said
@entity44 remains in control of the rebels , he said , though they are still fighting some 200 to 300 @entity14 troops inside the city
" we are confident that we will be able to liberate the city completely and rescue our civilians who are being targeted by the madness of @entity14 's death squads , " he said
the rebel spokesman also criticized @entity10 's role in @entity44
" we still need @entity10 's assistance , but we do n't understand what they are up to , " he said
in one instance , rebel fighters pushed back @entity14 's squads to a shoe factory , from where they were bombing residential areas in the city , he said
@entity10 refused to bomb the shoe factory because it is a civilian facility , he said
in the end , the rebels pushed the loyalists out of the shoe factory , which they burned after abandoning
" we ca n't understand ( @entity10 's ) excuses , " @entity12 said
" we want to save our population from being murdered by these merciless death squads
earlier , an opposition member said loyalists were using bombs that look like perfume bottles
photographs indicated they were shells fired from a grenade launcher that either did not explode on impact or were deliberately masked and placed in populated areas
the lethal weapons have blown off people 's limbs and killed children , the council member said saturday
the report came a day after @entity88 reported its members saw three cluster bombs explode thursday night in a @entity44 neighborhood
the activist group said it inspected debris and interviewed witnesses about two other apparent cluster bombings
the @entity1 government has denied the use of such bombs , which are banned internationally because of their indiscriminate nature and ability to harm civilians after a conflict ends
in the @entity105 capital , @entity0 , hundreds of chanting supporters waved green flags and pledged loyalty to @entity14 after thunderous explosionsbelieved to be @entity10 airstrikes pounded targets in the capital
" i have a message to @entity10 and to the @entity115 and @entity116 , " a man wrapped in a green flag said saturday night
" we say to them , we will kill you if you come to our land
" others chanted , " go go @entity122 , " referring to @entity116 president @entity122
@entity116 is one of the nations taking part in the coalition airstrikes
" everyone here will die for @entity14 , " a young man said
the supporters gathered at @entity14 's compound in the capital hours after @entity10 apparently hit targets in @entity0 and its outskirts saturday night
@entity1 forces reacted with anti-aircraft fire
with no signs of an end to the war , immigrants have scrambled to flee the nation
@entity142 said saturday that a boat rescued 1,200 migrant workers and their families who had been stranded around the port cit of @entity44
the area has been bombarded daily by @entity14 's forces , according to witnesses
witnesses have reported dire conditions in the city , including food shortages and the fear of @entity155 snipers taking aim at anyone walking on the streets
at least 700 people have died since violence erupted in @entity44 two months ago , a medical director said
despite weeks of aerial bombardment by international fighter jets , @entity14 remains defiant and has rebuffed global calls to stop attacks on civilians
at a news conference in @entity168 , the deputy chairman of @entity1 's @entity170 appealed to the international community to help prevent further tragedy
he said 1.5 million @entity1 were under attack every day
" we already have warned before that the regime was threatening real massacres against innocent civilians , " @entity174 told reporters
" the international community is now witnessing what this regime is capable of
the destruction in @entity44 and other cities is unacceptable
" @entity10 has said it needs more precision fighter jets because loyalist maneuvers have made airstrikes much more difficult without harming civilians
@entity2 's @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report
