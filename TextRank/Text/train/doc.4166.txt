when president @entity0 said that @entity3 strategy to combat the terror group @entity4 could follow the models of strikes in @entity7 and @entity8 , it drew a swift rebuttal from some top @entity10
@entity10 sen. @entity11 of @entity12 took to the @entity14 floor thursday to say the administration 's tactics in both of those countries had not succeeded and would be even less effective when used against @entity4
" that is so disturbing , to think that a strategy against @entity4 would be the same as against @entity21 in @entity8 and @entity7 , " said @entity11
" yes , we have been killing with drones
but we have by no means defeated them , " he said
he was responding to @entity0 's speech wednesday night : " this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us , while supporting partners on the front lines , is one that we have successfully pursued in @entity7 and @entity8 for years
" another @entity10 , sen. @entity35 of @entity36 , told @entity37 thursday that not only had the administration 's strategy in @entity7 and @entity8 come up short , but also that it was not the right template to apply to @entity42
" @entity4 poses a risk very different from the risk posed by terrorists in those two countries , " @entity35 told @entity37 , using an alternate acronym for the militant group
" @entity4 is a terrorist group , but it has insurgent elements to it
they are working with people on the ground
they 've got funding , and they carry out military - style operations
they pose a much different risk
" @entity61 : @entity4 can ' muster ' between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters but the @entity63 defended the comparison , saying that there have been some successes against both groups , @entity67 in @entity7 and @entity68 in @entity8
" there is still more work to do in those countries
but what has been put in place is a counterterrorism strategy that has succeeded in degrading the threat , and making those organizations less capable of threatening the @entity3 people , " said spokesman @entity72
" in both of those situations , the president has selectively and strategically brought @entity3 military might to bear in support of those ground troops to mitigate and counter the threat
" over the past few years , the amount of territory that extremists control in @entity7 and @entity8 has indeed been rolled back
and several terrorist leaders in both countries have been killed by @entity3 strikes , including @entity68 leader @entity91 , and @entity67 's no. 2 , @entity93 , and top propagandist @entity92
a frightening , far - reaching new world of terror threats since 9/11 but @entity97 at the @entity98 maintains the fight against @entity67 has been no success story
" @entity67 is still planning attacks against the @entity3 homeland , " @entity101 said
and the group 's top leadership is still mainly intact , he said
" @entity108 , who was groomed by @entity109 to run an @entity21 branch , has in fact been the emir with that organization for years now
he is still in place , " he said
" many of his top lieutenants are still in place , including the chief theologians and the chief military officers
" @entity118 hits @entity0 for ruling out boots on the ground also still at large is @entity67 's master bomb - maker , @entity122
he is believed to be behind the nearly successful printer - cartridge bombs placed on @entity3 - bound planes in 2010 , and the underwear bomb on a plane to @entity127 in 2009
" there 's concern now he may be sharing his bomb - making technology with jihadist groups in @entity42 , " said terrorism analyst @entity128
carrying out air strikes against @entity4 could be even more difficult than against @entity67 and @entity68 , because while the governments of @entity8 and @entity7 have complemented @entity3 airstrikes by deploying ground forces against extremists , the @entity3 has no such partner in @entity42 's government
and according to @entity142 , @entity4 fighters are more inextricably mixed in with civilian populations in @entity144 and @entity42
but he added that military action against extremists can be successful , even if it does not produce total victory
" the more you can shrink the space they can operate , the more you can take out training camps so they ca n't provide bomb - making instructions to @entity153 recruits , you 're clearly then limiting their ability to plot terrorist attacks against the @entity153
" still , he warned , " it 's going to be a long time before that capability to theoretically plot attacks against the @entity153 is going to be wiped out
" @entity161 : @entity3 not at war with @entity4
