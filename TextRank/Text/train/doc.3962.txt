@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday endorsed an upgraded @entity4 status for the @entity5 , despite intense opposition from the @entity7 and @entity8
the resolution elevates their status from " non-member observer entity " to " non-member observer state , " the same category as the @entity14 , which @entity15 hope will provide new leverage in their dealings with @entity8
its leaders had been working with dozens of supporting nations to develop a formal draft , enlisting the backing of @entity24 countries such as @entity25 and @entity26
the vote was 138 delegates in favor of the measure , nine against and 41 abstentions , including @entity32

" it comes on the heels of an eight - day conflict that raged between @entity8 and @entity43 fighters , where a series of airstrikes and rocket launches drew international attention and threatened regional stability
" we did not come here seeking to delegitimize a state established years ago , and that is @entity8 ; rather we came to affirm the legitimacy of the state that must now achieve its independence , and that is @entity58 , " he said
but @entity8 's @entity4 ambassador @entity59 said the move largely ignores the specifics of longstanding issues , such as settlements in disputed lands , and can not substitute for direct negotiations between @entity66 and @entity67
this resolution " does n't pursue peace , " @entity59 said , criticizing @entity34 for being unable to represent the @entity69 , where a @entity43 - controlled government presides
" it pushes it backwards , " he said
@entity74 , a member of the @entity43 ' political bureau , welcomed the decision but made demands reflecting @entity43 ' unwillingness to recognize the state of @entity8
" we need to put this in its normal context as a part of the @entity89 vision based upon the rights and national principles without compromising an ounce of soil from our @entity5 lands extending from the @entity96 to the ( @entity98 ) river , " he posted to his @entity82 page
he called for the establishment of a @entity5 state " with @entity66 being its capital " on land that includes what is @entity8
the effort stalled last year when it became apparent that the bid could not get the necessary support in the @entity107
observer state status does not require @entity107 approval , unlike full membership recognition
the observer status resolution needs only a majority of the @entity4 's 193 members to approve

@entity7 ambassador to the @entity4 @entity123 said @entity7 leaders could not support a measure that circumvents direct talks and cautioned that thursday 's decision did " not establish @entity58 as a state
" @entity129 urged both sides to the resume direct negotiations without preconditions
" @entity8 is prepared to live in peace with a @entity5 state , " @entity8 prime minister @entity134 said thursday
" but for peace to endure , @entity8 's security must be protected , the @entity15 must recognize the jewish state and they must be prepared to end the conflict with @entity8 once and for all
" @entity8 government spokesman @entity142 called the resolution " political theater
" opinion : why @entity7 , @entity8 should welcome @entity5 move at @entity4 but @entity5 leaders have said they had the right to go to the @entity4 because @entity8 failed to comply with agreements signed more than two decades ago
" it 's about a contract
our contract is that in five years , we should have concluded the treaty of peace and all core issues
this did not happen , and we 're talking about 20 years later
and going to the @entity4 is not a unilateral step , " @entity5 chief negotiator @entity158 said in september
the last round of negotiations between @entity8 and the @entity5 was in 2010
@entity158 said the new status would eliminate @entity8 justifications for building settlements in the disputed areas of @entity66 and the @entity166
" no decision by the @entity4 can break the 4,000 - year - old bond between the people of @entity8 and the land of @entity8 , " @entity134 said
former @entity8 prime minister @entity172 , however , threw his full support behind the new status for the @entity5
" what the @entity15 moved to do today in the @entity4 , i think is in basic line with the strategy of a two - state solution , " @entity172 told @entity1 's @entity175 on thursday
the peace process is completely stalled at the moment , but @entity172 said @entity8 must move rapidly toward a two - state solution
" @entity183 is running out for @entity8 more than for the @entity15 , " he said
@entity4 @entity184 ban ki - moon , who supports a two - state solution , said thursday 's vote " underscores the urgency of a resumption of meaningful negotiations
" " i urge the parties to renew their commitment to a negotiated peace , " @entity184 said
meanwhile in @entity194 , @entity8 's defense minister @entity193 addressed his country 's relations with @entity197 and expressed doubt about sanctions against that country
the @entity2 ' nuclear watchdog has said @entity197 is cooperating enough in a review of its nuclear programs
" i do n't believe that these kinds of sanctions will bring them to a moment of truth where they sit around a table and look at each others eyes and decide that the game is over , they ca n't stand it anymore , they are going to give up their nuclear intention , " @entity193 said
@entity193 was visiting @entity7 defense secretary @entity216 , who noted how the @entity8 defense chief announced his retirement from political life
@entity216 praised @entity193 's " brilliant strategic mind " and " warrior heart
" @entity1 's @entity222 , @entity223 - @entity224 at the @entity2 and @entity225 contributed to this report
