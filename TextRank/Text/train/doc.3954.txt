-- a catholic priest , facing criminal charges and a lawsuit alleging that he sexually abused a teenage boy , is now charged with attempting to hire someone to kill the youth , authorities said tuesday
the rev. @entity8 was in the @entity9 , @entity10 , jail on tuesday , charged with one count of criminal solicitation to commit capital murder , according to the @entity14 and the jail 's website
he also is charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child
his bail totals $ 700,000
@entity8 , 52 , of @entity9 , was out on bond on other sexual assault charges involving the youth , now 18 , when he allegedly attempted to negotiate the boy 's murder , said @entity26 , the teen 's attorney
he was arrested last week after he offered an undercover agent with the @entity14 $ 5,000 to kill the teen , according to department spokeswoman @entity30
" this guy , " @entity34 sheriff @entity33 said , " is an evil man
" a call to @entity36 , the defense attorney listed in jail records for @entity8 , was not immediately returned tuesday
the youth met @entity8 in 2007 , according to @entity26
the attorney said the priest started " grooming him , " buying him gifts including a computer and a car
in early 2008 , when the boy was 16 , under the guise of providing private catechism lessons , @entity8 " gained access to him and began to sexually abuse him once or twice a month , including on church grounds , " @entity26 said
at the time , @entity8 was administrator of @entity51 of @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity10 , which is in @entity34
the alleged abuse occurred in two counties -- @entity34 and @entity57 -- and included the youth 's rape at gunpoint , the attorney said
@entity8 allegedly threatened to kill the youth if he told anyone -- threats he repeated in daily text messages , @entity26 said , and @entity8 also threatened to kill himself , telling the teen they would " go to heaven together
" the teen , after struggling with the abuse , told a school counselor , who notified authorities , @entity26 said
he filed suit in april against @entity8 , as well as the archdioceses of @entity75 , @entity10 , and @entity76 , @entity77 -- where @entity8 was before @entity10 -- and @entity8 's religious order , the @entity79 , the attorney said
the suit claims that all three covered up @entity8 's record of abuse
all three have denied doing so , according to the @entity75 , @entity10 , express - news
when former @entity75 archbishop @entity86 and the religious order learned of the police investigation into @entity8 's relationship with the teen , he was removed from active ministry in october 2008 , the newspaper reported
in september , an @entity34 grand jury indicted @entity8 on three counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child and one count of aggravated sexual assault by threat , according to the @entity84
@entity8 was arrested in @entity100 by a fugitive task force and was extradited to @entity10 , where he posted bail on september 27 , according to the newspaper
he then moved to @entity9
a grand jury in @entity57 handed up an indictment last week on the two aggravated sexual assault charges , the @entity84 said
meanwhile , " approximately a week ago , we got an anonymous phone call from someone saying , ' look , i 'm living in a building with this guy , and he 's talking about killing this young man , ' " @entity26 said
" our response was , ' you need to call police
' " @entity33 said he got a call november 11 from the neighbor
the man at first just told authorities they should " be looking at this guy , " the sheriff said , but later said @entity8 had offered him $ 5,000 to kill the teenager
the allegation surprised him , @entity33 said
the @entity14 and its @entity124 got involved , sending the undercover agent to speak with @entity8 , @entity26 said
the conversation was caught on video and audiotape
@entity26 said his client was relieved to hear of @entity8 's arrest
he was attending college but had to withdraw and be spirited away somewhere safe because of the threats , he said
" he 's still very afraid , but he is hoping that this time @entity8 will stay behind bars , " @entity26 said
a hearing on the lawsuit was held monday , he said
the @entity76 diocese had argued it should be sued in @entity77 rather than @entity10
the judge rejected that argument , @entity26 said
" i think he 's cooked his goose now , " @entity33 said of @entity8
" we know that pedophiles sometimes threaten their victims to keep them quiet
but this is kind of an older victim , and you wonder sometimes why they would n't come forward
... i can see now the evil in this guy is pretty bad
