" be kind , please rewind , " the signs used to say in video stores , urging customers to return their rented @entity4 tapes spooled back to the beginning
if only @entity6 could rewind back to the 1990s
that was the time when the video chain was the colossus of the movie - rental business , with stores in seemingly every city shopping district and suburban strip mall in @entity14
visiting the store was a weekly rite for many people , who would show up on friday evenings to check out the latest releases , navigating a crush of couples and families who had exactly the same idea -- only to find out that the last copy of " @entity24 " or " @entity25 " had already been snagged
that custom is now as gone as a world with three television networks , a @entity31 station 's late show and a @entity32
on wednesday , @entity33 , which purchased @entity6 in 2011 , announced it was closing the chain 's 300 remaining @entity14 - based retail stores , as well as its distribution centers
" consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment , " said @entity33 president and ceo @entity37 in the press release about the closures
his statement echoes many from recent years about the migration of entertainment from physical objects -- cds , dvds , books , games -- to bits , bytes and pixels available on various screens and portable devices
@entity6 will continue its @entity6 @ home brand to @entity33 customers , as well as its @entity61 streaming service
and an additional 50 @entity6 stores not owned by @entity33 will remain open for the time being
reaction : jokes and shrugs the action was long expected
@entity6 had been closing stores for years , as is obvious from the yawning vacancies still present in many of those very same strip malls
the chain was done in by @entity73 , streaming video and a world of internet options
reaction from that @entity78 was , of course , swift and pithy
several posts on @entity80 made fun of the store 's late fees -- the bane of people who could n't get their rental back in the standard 48 hours -- and the @entity4 tapes that made @entity6 's name
" i knew this day would come
i 'm mere months away from owning a @entity4 copy of @entity92 without paying my late fees to @entity6 , " wrote @entity90
" yes ! all the @entity94 are closing ! that means they 'll never get back that @entity4 tape of @entity98
i won ! " added actor and comedian @entity100
many said they did n't even realize @entity6 had any stores left
in a headline , the @entity104 put it best : " internet kills the @entity108
" but @entity109 , author of the forthcoming book " @entity111 " and a film professor at the @entity113 , wants to praise @entity6 , not bury it
the stores were clean and family - friendly , with wider aisles and a bigger emphasis on movie selection than the mom - and - pops that dotted the landscape in the 1980s , he said
" they really standardized video rental in general , " @entity109 said
as with many franchises , at its height @entity6 often came in for criticism
the chain put many mom - and - pop stores out of business
befitting its name , it generally catered to a blockbuster mentality : hit releases filled shelves by the dozens , but independent and foreign - language films could be hard to come by
the stores would n't carry @entity137 - 17 films at all
and then there was the @entity6 clerk , easily recognized in a blue knit shirt , who was often depicted as either clueless or snotty , depending on how frustrated you were on those crowded friday nights
but @entity109 , a former video clerk himself -- though not at @entity6 -- points out that @entity6 was successful for a reason
it had more variety than many video stores : blockbuster stores were required to have a minimum of 7,000 movies and averaged 10,000 , more than many of its competitors , he said
by doing so , it opened up more of @entity14 to more movies ( and , later , tv show collections )
even though @entity6 itself primarily stuck to cities and suburbs , it became a model for other chains that opened stores in small towns
playing catch - up if people compared @entity6 to @entity163 's , that was n't necessarily a knock , said @entity109
" they self - consciously modeled themselves on @entity167 , and at various points hired members of @entity167 's upper management , " he said
but over the last decade , business took one hit after another
in a september article , the @entity175 's @entity174 described how independent video stores were put out of business
the same trends affected @entity6
first there were dvds , which were relatively inexpensive and intended for purchase , especially compared to the @entity4 titles that cost stores up to $ 100 a pop. with the advent of broadband , people started downloading movies and shows -- not always legally
@entity73 and @entity191 used the slim size of @entity193 to their advantage
and finally , " @entity195 was launched , and your average @entity198 and @entity199 were introduced to @entity200 , " @entity174 said
even @entity6 's late fees came back to bite the chain in an unlikely way
in 1997 , a man named @entity205 returned a late copy of " @entity207 " to his local @entity6
he was assessed a $ 40 fee
two years later , he founded @entity73
@entity6 was caught flat - footed by many of these changes
it could have purchased @entity73 for $ 50 million in 2000 , but passed
as @entity73 rose , @entity6 's attempts to compete on @entity73 's terms -- especially through the mail -- foundered
it also tried to compete with @entity191 using standalone kiosks
that did n't work , either
by the time @entity6 was sold to @entity33 in 2011 , it was down to 1,700 stores , more than 7,000 fewer than its peak just seven years earlier
people had long since started devoting their friday nights to streaming and downloading at home -- and if they were heading out , it was n't to a @entity6
the @entity225 , of course , nailed it
in a 2008 video headlined " @entity230 were rented in the past , " the satiric site showcased a @entity228 venue that " aims to transport visitors to a time before the @entity78
" like a version of @entity233 , it had actors playing clerks and customers who described how the rental process worked
onlookers watched the performance , stunned
" it 's really amazing that people had to go through so much just to get a movie , " says a visitor in the skit .
