2:20 p.m. update : rep. @entity1 pleaded guilty to one charge of tax evasion
update : rep. @entity1 , @entity7 - @entity6 , is expected to sign a " statement of facts " admitting that he evaded taxes as alleged by the federal government in a 20 - count indictment , although @entity1 will only plead guilty to one count of tax evasion , law enforcement sources said
the sources added that prosecutors will push for @entity1 to serve at least some federal prison time after his guilty plea
@entity1 is set to be sworn in as a re-elected member of @entity20 in january , although his colleagues could choose to expel him from the body
@entity24 minority leader @entity23 said in a statement wednesday that @entity1 should resign
" now that the election is over , congressman @entity1 is finally admitting the truth to his constituents , " she said
" clearly , speaker @entity29 must insist that congressman @entity1 resign immediately
" original post : @entity6 @entity32 congressman @entity1 will plead guilty to one count of tax evasion on tuesday in a @entity6 court , according to a @entity37 law enforcement official
the charge can bring some prison time , but it 's not clear whether @entity1 will be sentenced with any
after being indicted in april on 20 counts of filing false tax returns , mail fraud , wire fraud , hiring undocumented workers and perjury , @entity1 insisted he did nothing wrong and pled not guilty
his trial was scheduled to begin in february
but a @entity37 law enforcement official tells @entity49 that @entity1 will appear before a @entity51 judge at 1 p.m. on tuesday and admit he deliberately misled the @entity52 , a move that throws his congressional future into jeopardy
federal prosecutors say @entity1 failed to report $ 1 million from his restaurant business in @entity58 prior to his 2010 election to @entity20
@entity60 hoped the federal indictment against the @entity24 @entity32 last spring would mean @entity1 's constituents would toss him out
but despite efforts by his @entity60 opponent , @entity64 , to paint him as corrupt , @entity1 was easily re-elected in november for third term
@entity1 attracted national attention last year even before his high - profile legal troubles when he threatened to throw a reporter over a @entity71 balcony at the end of an interview
@entity1 was captured on a hot mic after the president 's @entity77 speech berating the reporter for pressing him on allegations of wrongdoing
he later apologized for his behavior
@entity1 gave up his seat on the @entity82 after he was charged , but repeatedly insisted he would be " fully exonerated
" the @entity83 began an investigation into @entity1 's activities last spring , but recently announced it was deferring action on the matter at the request of the @entity89
with @entity1 's new plea , the committee could decide early next year to renew its investigation and consider some type of punishment
there will also likely be pressure on @entity1 to step down from @entity20
@entity1 's congressional office and his attorney did not immediately respond to @entity49 requests for comment .
