-- fewer people are expected to travel for the @entity3 holiday this year
some 43.4 million @entity4 are predicted to travel for the @entity3 holiday next week , a 1.5 % decrease from the 44 million people who traveled last year , according to @entity8 projections
the number of people traveling at least 50 miles from home during the @entity3 holiday travel period fell short of last year 's four - year high
travel company @entity8 describes the @entity3 holiday travel period as wednesday , november 27 to sunday , december 1
some 90 % of travelers drive rather than fly during the holiday , but fewer are also driving this year : some 38.9 million travelers will drive , a decrease of 1.6 %
the number of people flying is also expected to drop 3.7 % from 3.26 million last year to 3.14 million this year , according to @entity8
" while the economy continues to improve , the sluggish pace of the recovery is creating uncertainty in the minds of some consumers and therefore @entity8 is projecting a slight decline in the number of @entity3 travelers this year , " said aaa chief operating officer @entity19 , in a wednesday press statement
" for those traveling the good news is motorists will receive a holiday bonus in the form of lower gas prices which are at their lowest levels for the holiday since 2010
" @entity38 : a day in the life of the world 's busiest airport the wednesday before the @entity3 holiday will be the holiday 's busiest overall travel day , according to @entity8
thirty - seven percent of travelers expect to travel on wednesday and the second busiest day will be sunday , with 33 % planning to return home that day
for fliers , the busiest travel day is expected to be sunday , december 1 , with an estimated 2.56 million travelers , according to @entity51 , an airline industry group
the second busiest is the wednesday before @entity3 ( november 27 ) with 2.42 million fliers
those numbers compare to the estimated 1.87 million travelers on saturday , november 23
impact of gasoline prices on travel plans drivers may find some relief at the gas pump , with @entity8 predicting prices of lower than $ 3 per gallon at gas stations in most states -- the cheapest gas prices for the @entity3 holiday in three years
the national average price of gas is at its cheapest level of the year and is expected to continue dropping for weeks
car travelers are expected to drive an average of 601 miles this year compared to 588 miles last year
they are also spending less on travel , with median spending expected to drop from $ 498 last year to $ 465 this year
help for the infrequent traveler if you are flying this holiday season and rarely fly , here 's a bit of helpful holiday advice from the @entity78 : what about my shampoo and conditioner ? follow the @entity78 's 3 - 1 - 1 rule
if you want to travel with liquids in your carry - on bags , you can most likely bring them in bottles that hold 3.4 ounces or less , placed in one quart - sized , clear , plastic , zipped bag
( one bag per passenger , please
) frequent business travelers : just because you carried more bottles on your weekly trips does n't mean you will be allowed during the holidays
these flights will likely be full , and you do n't want to be the one slowing down your @entity78 security line
travelers with medication , disabilities or medical conditions
people can travel with their medication , but make sure to tell the @entity78 officers at the start of the screening
and there are rules to follow
travelers who need extra assistance because of disabilities or medical conditions can call the @entity115 line at 855 - 787 - 2227 before your trip for guidance
do n't wrap your presents ( yet )
while there 's no absolute rule against wrapped gifts , @entity78 officers may need to unwrap your gifts to inspect them
why not wait until you land to wrap them ? do n't carry a knife
knives are still prohibited in carry - on luggage , but they can be placed in checked luggage
( yes , there was a debate earlier in the year about knives , but the knives did n't win the right to fly in the passenger cabins
) do n't carry a gun
passengers carrying guns up to a @entity78 security checkpoint can be subject to arrest and prosecution , even if bringing your weapon was an accident
check @entity78 and airline regulations before trying to transport firearms and ammunition
knitting needles and other needlepoint items -- including scissors under 4 inches -- can be packed in your carry - on bags
but any cutter with a blade , including circular thread cutters , must be packed in your checked baggage
the @entity157 has eased up rules on the use of portable electronics devices aboard airlines flying within the @entity4 , so you may be able to watch a downloaded movie or read an e-book below 10,000 feet
but check your airline 's website first to make sure it 's gotten approval from the @entity157
talking on cell phones is still not allowed in - flight and no connecting to the internet unless the flight attendants say so
airlines quick to ease electronics rules still have questions ? call the @entity78
call the @entity175 at 866 - 289 - 9673 about your upcoming travel , @entity78 rules and any feedback about your travel
