-- @entity3 's child rights ombudsman slammed @entity6 prosecutors for deciding not to charge the adoptive parents of a @entity3 boy who died suddenly , @entity3 's @entity2 news agency reported tuesday
on monday , the @entity10 district attorney said a grand jury declined to indict @entity12 and @entity13 , the adoptive parents of 3 - year - old @entity15
a @entity6 coroner had declared @entity15 's death in january accidental , but @entity18 demanded a complete report from @entity21 officials
@entity3 children 's rights commissioner @entity22 claimed the district attorney 's office has not done enough in investigating the case of @entity15 , also known as @entity26
" the @entity6 prosecutors ' position in the case of @entity26 is upsetting , because they refused to scrutinize the circumstances of his death , " @entity22 tweeted , according to @entity2
but district attorney @entity33 said the grand jury found no evidence to charge the @entity36
" this death was the result of a tragic accident occurring most likely on playground equipment , " @entity33 's office said , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity38
" when a child dies so young and tragically , it is natural to want to hold someone accountable
however , in this case , there is no evidence to support holding anybody criminally responsible
" investigating the death this month , @entity33 told @entity0 that said four pathologists and the @entity10 medical examiner attributed the death to a laceration of a small bowel mesentery artery because of blunt trauma to the abdominal area
the bruising was consistent with a " self - inflicted " injury , @entity33 said
a statement from the @entity61 said the boy " had previously been seen for a behavioral disorder that manifested itself in self - injury and these bruises were consistent with that diagnosis
" @entity22 had accused the adoptive mother of killing the boy and giving him " psychotropic substances , " @entity2 reported
but toxicology reports were negative , and there were no substances found that could have contributed to the child 's death
international strain on adoptions the death drew international attention after @entity22 said that the boy was " killed " or " murdered
" in february , @entity22 said he tweeted those words based on the initial reports he received about the death but acknowledged he may have spoken too soon
@entity3 concerned over adopted boy 's cause of death still , he said he wanted his country to ban all international adoptions of @entity3 children
@entity18 passed a law in december banning adoptions of @entity3 children by @entity21
that pending law was set ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents
but some say the @entity3 move was retaliation for a @entity21 law that places restrictions on @entity3 human rights abusers
@entity15 's death aggravated @entity103 efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which @entity21 families have already begun the process of adopting a @entity3 child
@entity21 adopted nearly 1,000 @entity3 children last year , according to @entity103 figures
though the number has been dropping in recent years , @entity3 remains the third most popular foreign country -- after @entity113 and @entity114 -- for @entity21 foreign adoptions .
