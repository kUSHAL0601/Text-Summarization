-- one evening last winter , @entity1 was watching his local tv news when he saw a segment that caught his attention : parents were using software to monitor their kids ' cell phones
as more kids carry cell phones , some parents use software to monitor their calls and texts
@entity1 , an investigator for the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , thought the service could be a new tool for combating sexual predators
equipping his phone with the software , @entity1 posed as an underage child on social - networking sites and began luring pedophiles
since then , @entity1 has made 83 arrests of alleged sexual predators -- 44 of them with the help of the monitoring program
" it makes life easy for me as an investigator
it saves me hours of time , which obviously means i have more time to go out and catch offenders , " he said
the software also documents text messages and other data that can be used in court , he said
" now all i have to do is go into the account and pull everything out that was done between that sex offender and me
" programs such as @entity43 and @entity44 are becoming increasingly popular with parents as more school - age children are carrying cell phones
parents say the services help them protect their kids against predators and also reduce " sexting , " the growing practice of using mobile phones to share sexually explicit text messages and pictures
in 2008 , @entity56 , a @entity58 , @entity57 , teen , hanged herself after her nude photo , meant for her boyfriend , was sent to teenagers at several high schools , exposing her to ridicule and taunts
the monitoring programs work like this : once a child 's phone is equipped with the software , the parent or law enforcement officer creates a list of contacts -- close relatives , trusted friends -- who are authorized to communicate with the minor 's phone
an online file , accessed by the parent , stores all activity related to the child 's phone , including text messages and shared photos
any unauthorized number that contacts the child 's phone gets flagged , and the parent or guardian receives a real - time text message alerting them to the infraction
parents pay a monthly fee -- about $ 10 -- for the service , which only works on so - called " smart phones " with web access
my mobile watchdog also will alert parents if their child has removed the software from their phone
@entity102 of @entity103 , @entity104 , is the creator of @entity43
@entity106 , the company 's ceo , said he never imagined the software would become a tool for authorities cracking down on online sexual predators
" the threat is huge , " @entity106 said
" there are so many different ways out there for child predators [ to find victims ] -- through @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and a host of other sites
" a @entity124 , @entity16 , woman said she outfitted her 12 - year - old daughter 's phone with monitoring software after the girl was sexually assaulted by a man she met on @entity130 , a mobile chat network
" i was n't going to take away her cell phone , and i knew i had to do something , " said the woman , whose first name is @entity133
@entity0 is not printing her last name in accordance with its policy of not identifying the victims of sexual assault
@entity133 said the service has given her more peace of mind and her daughter a greater awareness of the responsibilities of having a cell phone
other parents have n't been so transparent
@entity149 of @entity150 , @entity151 , equipped his daughter 's cell phone with monitoring software but did n't tell her what it was
he told her the icon was a gps system
" i was n't going to get my 15 - year - old a cell phone and not know how she was using it , " @entity149 said
over time , @entity149 found the software was n't just useful for tracking his daughter 's behavior ; it also helped him discover more about the nature of his child
" it 's good to know how she 's treating people and how others are treating her , " @entity149 said
" i think it 's a caring father that wants to know what 's going on in her life ... wanting to know how she feels
" when @entity149 's daughter discovered the software on her phone , she was n't angry , he said
" she understood that i cared about her
" a @entity185 , @entity184 , mother found that monitoring her daughter 's phone calls and texts gave her new insight into her daughter 's life
" we talk a lot more about what 's going on in her life , " said @entity192 , who requested her last name not be published
" it 's really opened up communication between the two of us
" some privacy advocates might object to parents digitally eavesdropping on their kids without their children 's consent
but an @entity206 , @entity207 , mother , who fitted her son 's phone with the software without his knowledge , disagrees
" i monitor my employees at the workplace , " said the woman , who owns a small business and asked that her name not be disclosed
" and this is my son
so to me it 's not like i 'm wiretapping him
besides , privacy in my house is earned
