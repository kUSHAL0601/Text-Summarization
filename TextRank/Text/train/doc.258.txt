@entity8 , chief of staff for former president @entity9 , said that @entity2 , 83 , was " fine " following the surgery

" we , of course , naively wanted to keep it quiet -- mrs. @entity2 did , " @entity8 said wednesday night
" she thought there was too much fuss the last time
" wednesday 's surgery was not related to surgery she had in november for a perforated ulcer
her husband is with her in the hospital , where she is expected to remain for seven to 10 days
" i am very impressed with and grateful to the wonderful team of doctors and nurses at the @entity4 who have helped @entity2 , " the former president said
" we have every confidence she is in the best hands
" the open - heart surgery was taken as a precautionary step after she experienced shortness of breath last week and doctors found hardening on one part of her aorta , according to a statement released by the hospital
dr. @entity42 performed the 2 1/2 hour surgery , replacing her aortic valve with a biologic valve , the hospital said
" this is a very common aging change , " @entity42 told @entity0 's " @entity48
" " it 's estimated as many as 10 percent of people over 70 need this type of surgery
it 's basically a wear - and - tear that leads to calcium deposits
" @entity42 said the former first lady " really should " recovery quickly with the new aortic valve taken from a pig
" that 's what we use most commonly , " he said , adding that @entity9 " woke up from the surgery joking
