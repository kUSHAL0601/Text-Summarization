-- @entity2 international @entity1 scored a vital goal five minutes from time to send @entity5 five points clear as @entity7 resumed thursday after its short mid-winter break
@entity1 first goal in the @entity11 top - flight gave @entity5 a 1 - 0 win over @entity13 in @entity14 to increase their lead in the title race as @entity17 were held to a 0 - 0 draw at @entity19
in the evening kickoff , @entity20 gave new coach @entity22 a superb start with a 3 - 1 win at home to @entity26 , who would have cut the gap on @entity5 at the top to three points with victory at the @entity31
@entity32 @entity22 , who replaced @entity33 , saw @entity34 score twice with @entity35 also on target
@entity26 replied through @entity37 , as the win takes reigning champions @entity20 to within 13 points of their city rivals , but they have two games in hand
@entity45 ' championship challenge hit the buffers after a humiliating 4 - 1 home defeat to mid-table @entity48
@entity45 's chances were hardly helped by the 17th minute dismissal of @entity51 for violent conduct
but they were also undone by one of the own players , striker @entity54 , who is out on loan to @entity48 this season
he scored a double before defender @entity58 pulled a goal back for the @entity61 giants
but @entity63 's penalty sealed the three points before substitute @entity65 scored a fourth in added time
the defeat leaves @entity45 eight points adrift of @entity5 , who made their breakthrough late as new signing @entity71 played in fellow substitute @entity1 to net
in other action , @entity73 leapfrogged @entity45 into fourth after winning 4 - 2 against @entity76 , with @entity77 and @entity78 scoring two apiece .
