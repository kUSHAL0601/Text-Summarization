-- former @entity2 head football coach @entity1 may have played a greater role than previously known in a decision made by university officials not to report a 2001 incident involving former coach @entity7 and a boy in a locker room shower , according to e-mails written by university officials
@entity0 does not have the e-mails , but the alleged contents were made available to @entity0
a jury last month convicted @entity7 , 68 , the @entity15 ' former defensive coordinator , on multiple charges of sexual abusing 10 boys over a period of 15 years
at @entity7 's trial , former @entity2 graduate assistant @entity20 testified he believed he saw sexual contact between @entity7 and a boy in the shower and told @entity1 in february 2001
disturbing e-mails could spell more trouble for @entity2 officials @entity1 , a revered @entity2 icon who died in january , testified before a grand jury that when he learned about the situation , he contacted his then - boss , athletic director @entity30 , as required and left it up to the university to investigate
in court documents , prosecutors state they have e-mails from university officials that allegedly contradict grand jury testimony of @entity30 and @entity2 vice president @entity38 , who oversaw campus police
the alleged e-mails , the contents of which were first reported by @entity0 , were among other documents , including a @entity7 file , discovered by @entity2 and turned over to state prosecutors as part of ongoing investigations , according to both @entity2 and prosecutors
one of the newly revealed alleged e-mails appears to show @entity1 had another , previously undisclosed conversation with @entity30 about the shower incident
on february 26 , @entity2 's vice president told @entity30 , the athletic director , to contact @entity7 , alert child welfare authorities and inform @entity56 , the charity @entity7 founded for disadvantaged children , a purported e-mail says
after @entity30 spoke with @entity1 , however , the athletic director allegedly told the school president that he had changed his mind about the best course to pursue
" after giving it more thought and talking it over with @entity1 yesterday -- i am uncomfortable with what we agreed were the next steps , " he purportedly wrote the following day
instead of alerting authorities , @entity30 allegedly wrote , he would prefer meeting with @entity7 , telling him they knew about another incident in 1998 , and offering him professional help
he suggests notifying the @entity56 " at some point " if @entity7 is cooperative , and " maybe " child welfare officials
if @entity7 did not cooperate , @entity30 suggested notifying both @entity56 and child welfare
how the case unfolded how much the purported conversations between @entity1 and @entity30 influenced the decision not to contact outside agencies , something @entity2 was required to do under state law , is unclear
an internal @entity2 investigation headed by former fbi director @entity83 also has turned up billing records from @entity2 officials to the university 's outside council around the time of the 2001 incident showing @entity2 was " researching its legal obligations " for reporting the assault , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation
the results of @entity83 's investigation are expected before the end of the summer
asked whether @entity2 had any comment on the alleged e-mails , school spokesman @entity98 said the university and board of trustees are " reserving comment " until after @entity83 's report is released
@entity105 , a lawyer for the @entity1 family , issued a statement following @entity0 's disclosure of the purported e-mails
" some number of e-mail exchanges between former @entity2 officials have apparently been leaked to the media
since the @entity1 family is not in possession of these e-mails , it would be inappropriate to comment on their supposed content , " the statement said
" to be clear , the e-mails in question did not originate with @entity1 or go to him as he never personally utilized e-mail
" @entity105 noted that @entity1 , " from the beginning ... warned against a rush to judgment in this case
coach @entity1 testified truthfully , to the best of his recollection , in the one brief appearance he made before the grand jury
as he testified , when informed of an incident involving @entity7 in 2001 , coach @entity1 followed university procedures and promptly and fully informed his superiors
he believed the matter would be thoroughly and professionally investigated and he did not interfere with or attempt to compromise any investigation
" monday , @entity105 released another statement , calling on @entity83 and the @entity137 attorney general to release all e-mails and records they have related to the case
the " selective " leaking of e-mails " is not intended to inform the discussion but to smear former @entity2 officials , including @entity1 , " said @entity105
" the public should not have to try and piece together a story from a few records that have been selected in a calculated way to manipulate public opinion
@entity1 did n't fear the truth , he sought the truth
his guidance to his family and his advisors was to pursue the full truth
this is the course we have followed for 9 months
it is the course we will follow to the end , " he said
painful chapter closes with @entity7 's conviction @entity1 testified to the grand jury that @entity20 was " very upset " when relating the incident and told him that he saw @entity7 " doing something with a youngster
it was a sexual nature , " according to a transcript
@entity1 said he told @entity30
attorneys for @entity170 and @entity30 issued a statement on their behalf
" for @entity30 , @entity170 , @entity175 and @entity1 , the responsible and ' humane ' thing to do was , like @entity176 ( @entity178 ) @entity177 , to carefully and responsibly assess the best way to handle vague , but troubling allegations , " the attorneys said in a statement to @entity0 on friday
" faced with tough situations , good people try to do their best to make the right decisions
" @entity1 and @entity175 were ousted from their jobs after the @entity7 scandal broke in november
when @entity1 was fired , the university 's board of trustees questioned his leadership for not doing more
@entity170 had retired in 2009
@entity1 family spokesman @entity190 told @entity0 the coach 's final guidance to him before @entity1 died was " to seek the truth " and due process for everyone involved
calls to @entity175 's lawyer have not been returned
@entity30 and @entity170 have pleaded not guilty to charges of perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse
it 's not known when the @entity137 attorney general 's office will complete its ongoing investigation of what @entity2 knew about the 2001 incident and how it was handled
mourning @entity1 , a flawed hero @entity0 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .
