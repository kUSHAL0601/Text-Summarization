@entity0 grew up in the middle of the cornfields of central @entity3 , longing , he says , to do something important in his life " to make his family proud
" so when a cousin beckoned him to come work on boats off @entity11 , he jumped at the chance
his goal : to be a ship captain , " the best that i could be
" " it meant strength , accomplishment , ' he said when he finally was made a captain in 1991 and traveled the world for various shipping firms
with a wife , eventually three children and boat to lead , capt. @entity0 had achieved his piece of the @entity26 dream
" i wanted to be in charge of my own destiny , '' he recalled during an interview in his attorney 's @entity29 office
all of that came crashing down on october 23 , 2013 when @entity0 was piloting his supply boat , the @entity35 off the coast of @entity37 towards a @entity39 - owned oil field
over the next six hours , he would huddle with his crew in an incredibly hot , water - sealed tank room as a half - dozen pirates stormed his boat and began their siege looking for their prize : the @entity26 captain and his @entity26 - born engineer
@entity0 reluctantly gave up when the pirates started firing guns through a hole in the room door
he told his engineer they had no choice if the rest of the 13 - member crew , still in hiding , was to be spared
" i told him , ' look i think it 's time we give up
if we do n't give up we are either going to die or somebody is going to get killed from ricocheting bullets
' " @entity0 and his engineer were the only ones to be kidnapped by the pirates , driven away in a speed boat and held in @entity37 swamps and jungles for 18 days
the experience was so horrific that even today @entity0 is unable to bring himself to reveal all details of his captivity
" we were n't being punched or kicked or anything like that but just i 've told people that i would have rather been punched then went through what i went through , " @entity0 said
" the mental abuse of it with the guns pointing at you
and knowing how unstable these guys are
" @entity0 said there were about 18 @entity37 kidnappers , some chain - smoked marijuana or crack incessantly , constantly waving their weapons and making threats
@entity85 consisted of instant noodles -- on days the negotiations were going well -- and maybe a bottle of water
and his captors blared their music constantly , fixated on , of all things , country singer @entity94 's song , " @entity98 , " and the music of hip hop artist @entity97
" i knew i was going to die
we knew it every day , every night , " he said
despite the chaos in the jungle , @entity0 said the leaders were organized , using satellite phones to negotiate , first demanding a $ 2 million ransom
@entity0 believes the payoff was eventually whittled down to several hundred thousand dollars , though @entity107 can not confirm who paid the ransom or who received it
@entity0 said one evening he and his engineer were told to get in a small boat with six pirates
they motored for about two hours to reach a village
there , four of the pirates got out and met some other men who handed them backpacks , @entity0 told @entity107
they returned to the boat and counted the cash stuffed into the bags
after a dispute , @entity0 says he and the engineer were taken to the other men and told to lie on the ground until the pirates left
then they were put in a car and driven off
later they were transferred to a second car , where a representative from the shipping company was waiting for them
at that point they were finally free , 18 days after being seized at gunpoint
after a debriefing by his ship managers , then a similar one by the @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity37 , @entity0 returned to the @entity26 last november , days after his release
he has been seeing mental health advisers and other medical professionals since
but his hostage - taking and the negotiations that freed him have raised alarm bells in counterterrorism circles and elsewhere for numerous reasons ; not the least is @entity0 ' claim that the @entity141 told him the money paid for his freedom may eventually have wound up in the hands of the notorious terror group @entity155
on the hunt for @entity155 that is the same group that in april kidnapped nearly 300 @entity37 girls
they 're also blamed for laying waste to multiple villages in the northern part of the country , burning them down and killing many people in bomb attacks
@entity0 said during his debriefing in @entity142 the @entity141 indicated that the money paid for his freedom may have been funneled through other groups before making its way to @entity155
the @entity141 would not comment
@entity107 can not independently confirm whether @entity155 received any money from the kidnapping
@entity172 , ceo of @entity173 , said his contacts believe @entity155 , once confined strictly to the northern parts of @entity37 , is benefiting from the increase in piracy along the west coast of @entity179
but the group is perhaps not directly carrying out the kidnappings itself
" so when people are asking , is there a link between @entity155 and piracy in @entity37 , it 's not the one they usually expect it to be , '' said @entity172 , whose firm was not involved in the @entity0 case
" it 's one that is not necessarily logistical and operational
it 's one that is more subtle
essentially they will probably provide personnel every now and then , but it 's not a fixed structure
so we are talking more ( about ) providing means to wash the money , to clean it
to make sure the smuggling routes , personnel , sex slaves , drugs , weapons above all else , these pirates need weapons
" so if @entity155 provided the weapons in advance for example and said , ' well we will get a cut of the ransom , ' which is standard policy within these groups within the region in general , this would make absolute sense to say , well the ransom money that was paid for the captain ended up at the very least partially into @entity155 's hands , quite probably as a payment for services delivered
" major oil companies have an official policy of not paying ransom for personnel or the thefts of fuel and ships on the high seas
and subsidiary companies , like capt. @entity0 ' employer @entity235 , are n't talking , so it is unclear if they , too , have the same policy
it is against @entity26 law to deal with terrorists but that issue becomes murky when dealing with ransoms for captives because so many middle men are involved , counterterrorism sources said ; it is hard to say who is a terrorist and who is just a common criminal
piracy off the coast of @entity37 is on the rise , according to one study published by @entity253 , a project of the @entity255
by contrast , piracy off @entity258 -- on the other side of the @entity261 continent -- dropped dramatically in 2013 to only 23 vessels attacked from 237 ships attacked in 2011 , the same group reported
in @entity179 , the group estimates there were at least 100 total piracy attacks and characterized them as more violent and frequent
@entity0 , in a series of emails , says he warned his company , @entity269 , that security was deteriorating and he feared some of his own @entity37 crew members
his attorney shared two of the emails with @entity107
in one email to his operations coordinator , @entity0 , summing up his fear of the security situation , wrote " i am also asking to not to return to @entity37
" @entity0 said company officials told him things would improve but never did
on the day he set out on his fateful trip , @entity0 said dock workers announced over two - way radio where the ship was going and what supplies it was carrying
he said those communications left them doomed before they ever got to their destination
" the pirates ( later ) told me they knew where we was going ... they knew my cargo , they knew my position , they knew the track i was taking
" @entity107 made multiple attempts to contact @entity235 for comment but the company refused to return multiple calls or an email
@entity0 said two representatives from the company stayed near his wife in their hometown during his ordeal and the @entity141 was also in contact
but once he was freed , the communications virtually ended
it was n't until january that someone from the company offered to assist in his medical care and other financial needs , he said
@entity0 is now consulting with a @entity29 attorney on his next move as he says he is medically unable to return to his overseas duties as a ship captain
" life is hell for me now , " @entity0 said
" life will never be the same again
the man that my wife married is not the same anymore ...
i walk around all day paranoid
" earlier this year , @entity0 finally broke his silence , giving an in - depth interview to a shipping newsletter @entity324
he is talking now , he says , so others do n't face the same fate
his attorney , @entity327 , represented members of the @entity330 crew that served with capt. @entity332 , whose capture by @entity258 pirates was made into a movie starring @entity336
he said he believes these companies owe crew members , like @entity0 , the same level of protection now provided to crews off the @entity258 coast
" now all the ships in @entity344 have armed guards , or most do , and piracy has plummeted in @entity344
@entity179 is now the hotspot and there is no question that these companies are making hundreds of millions in ( oil ) profits should do something more than they 're doing to protect the men that work over there , " @entity327 said
how @entity359 rescued capt. @entity360
