@entity0 -- for a moment , the nervous chatter , rustling costumes and jovial jostling came to a standstill
silence fell over the 36,000 competitors who just minutes earlier had been impatiently rearranging themselves for the start of the @entity9
for 30 aching seconds the spring sunshine beat down on their bowed heads , a sea of black ribbons pinned to their chests , as they remembered those who never got a chance to cross the finish line
it was a deeply tender and haunting image , and unlike anything ever seen in the 32 - year - history of the race
then again , this was n't just another @entity9
six days after @entity27 's @entity9 was rocked by the bombing which killed three people and injured more than 180 , the @entity26 capital hosted its own premier race

it loomed large in the minds of competitors observing the silence ahead of the starting gun
" marathon - running is a global sport
it unites runners and supporters on every continent in pursuit of a common challenge and in the spirit of friendship and fellowship , " event commentator , @entity46 , announced over loudspeakers before the half - minute silence
" this week the world marathon family was shocked and saddened by the events at the @entity27
in a few moments a whistle will sound and we will join together in silence to remember our friends and colleagues for whom a day of joy turned into a day of sadness
" watch : @entity27 wheelchair racer in @entity0 among the runners , there was a humbling sense of how easily the @entity27 victims could have been themselves
there was also a determination to complete the race -- as much for their own gratification as for those who could n't
for every competitor who crossed the finish line , organizers will donate $ 3 to @entity82 , set up to raise money for victims of the blasts
along with the usual whacky costumes -- a man dressed in an @entity89 hat and beard earned respect both for his bravery and lunacy -- were reminders of @entity27 's tragedy
almost everyone wore black solidarity ribbons , with many also donning customized t - shirts bearing the name " @entity27
" @entity101 was one such runner
the 27 - year - old from @entity103 was working with his asset management company in @entity27 last week when the attack rocked the city
" it was pretty much carnage , the whole place was in lockdown , " he told @entity1
" everyone has been so generous sponsoring us
it totally makes you more determined to show them [ the bombers ] that terrorism does n't work
" dressed in a stars and stripes t - shirt , 62 - year - old @entity118 , from @entity119 , @entity120 , fought back tears as he talked about the impact of the @entity27 bombings on the international racing community
this was @entity118 ' 84th marathon and he said he had been inundated with people offering to sponsor his race
" i 've run @entity27 three times and the attack really hit home , " he told @entity1
" people keep emailing me saying ' never back down , ' and ' no fear
' " @entity135 @entity134 , 36 , ran in the @entity27 last week and was proudly wearing his @entity82 race shirt adorned with black ribbons in respect to the victims
describing the 30 - second silence at the start of the race , he told @entity1 : " it was so silent and very moving
" for that many people to be that quiet -- it was incredible
" friends @entity146 and @entity147 , from @entity148 in @entity149 , have family in @entity27 and were not planning on competing in @entity0
but then last week 's bombing changed their minds
" the bombings made me disappointed in humanity , " @entity147 told @entity1
" i do a lot of marathons and there is a huge solidarity here today
" similarly , @entity160 runner @entity159 , 24 , wore a t - shirt with the slogan " for @entity27 , " as she prepared to compete in her fifth marathon
" i wanted to support them , " she told @entity1
" the running community is quite strong and i think we were all in shock after what happened
" when you start hitting that wall , i think it will help to think of them
" watch : suspects ' uncle tells of familial break crowds were out in force as the marathon wound its way past some of @entity0 's most iconic landmarks such as @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 , before finishing near @entity185
" the best way for us to react is to push ahead with the marathon , to get people on the streets and to celebrate it as we always do in @entity0 -- and to send a very clear message that we wo n't be cowed by this sort of behavior , " sport minister @entity189 had earlier told the @entity190
there was also a strong police presence with 40 % more officers on duty in the wake of monday 's bombings
as an extra security measure , litter bins were also removed from the 42 - kilometer route
this is the city which nine months earlier hosted the @entity207 without incident , and politicians say it provided the ideal training ground for hosting international sporting events
at the heart of the competition were ordinary people slogging it out in one of the most grueling races of its kind in the world -- and all for charity
as @entity160 journalist @entity223 wrote this week : " the @entity27 bombers served only to remind the world that marathons are something in which we all have a stake
" the message , on this sundrenched sunday , was loud and clear : " we are in it together
" the first woman to cross the finish line was the winner of the @entity27 women 's wheelchair race , @entity135 athlete @entity237 , who repeated her feat at the @entity9
the winner of the men 's wheelchair race was @entity242 's @entity241 , and the winning runner in the men 's elite race was @entity246 of @entity247
