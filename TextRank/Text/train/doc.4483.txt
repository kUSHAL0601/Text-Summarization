-- a wildfire scorching @entity2 prompted authorities to urge thousands to evacuate on tuesday , though authorities appear to have gotten a better grip on the blaze as the day wore on
" at the point that the fire is right now , we have a pretty good handle on it , " @entity9 fire chief @entity8 told reporters early tuesday evening
" we hope to do some more work through the night and into tomorrow , but i think that the largest part of the emergency has passed
" at one point late tuesday afternoon , @entity9 announced on @entity20 and its emergency department website that " more than 20,000 homes and residences are being evacuated due to the @entity24
" but in a news conference tuesday evening , county sheriff @entity26 that only 5,000 evacuation notices had been issued ; he said that the 20,000 number may have come from an assumption of four people in each residence
authorities initially said that most of the evacuations were in @entity9 city limits
but by the evening , @entity9 police chief @entity35 estimated about 300 homes were still evacuated in select areas
earlier , parents were told to pick up their children from three elementary schools because of the fire and an evacuation center was moved from one high school to another
@entity8 , though , said he did n't see any reason now why classes in those elementary schools would not resume wednesday
the fire began at 10:45 a.m. ( 1:45 p.m. et ) , fanned by strong winds , according to the fire chief
" it has been , to say the least , a very challenging day for local fire agencies and law enforcement agencies , " @entity8 said
" it is unusual in may to have wind driven fires like this that prove to be such a challenge to contain
" for all those challenges , authorities said they do n't know of any injuries or fatalities tied to the blaze
it had burned 800 acres and was 5 % contained as of 7:50 p.m. , according to @entity65
the @entity66 issued a red flag warning for areas around @entity9 through 8 p.m. wednesday
as the agency noted , " a red flag warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will shortly , " with strong winds , low humidity and warm temperatures feeding into " extreme fire behavior
" temperatures in the @entity2 city are forecast to peak in the mid- 90s wednesday and thursday with no sign of rain , before cooling somewhat later in the week
@entity0 's @entity80 contributed to this report .
