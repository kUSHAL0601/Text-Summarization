-- more than five million @entity2 vehicles are being investigated by the federal government for deadly fuel - tank fires caused by rear - impact collisions
fiery fuel - tank crashes have resulted in 48 fatalities in the @entity9 model since 1993 , according to data from the @entity11 , but so far neither the federal government nor @entity13 has announced a recall
this week the @entity11 expanded the investigation to include @entity16 from model years 1993 to 2001 and @entity19 models from 2002 to 2007
federal investigators initially looked into the @entity9 following complaints by the @entity22 , a consumer watchdog organization founded by @entity23
the fuel tank of the 1993 - 2004 @entity9 is made of plastic and extends below the rear bumper " so there is nothing to protect the tank from direct hit " in a rollover or rear - end collision , the watchdog group said in a letter sent to @entity11
" @entity13 has concluded that 1993 - 2004 @entity9 vehicles are neither defective nor do their fuel systems pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety in rear impact collisions , " said a @entity13 statement obtained by @entity0
@entity13 spokesman @entity41 told @entity0 the company estimates two million of the affected vehicles are still on the road
" we still feel confident these vehicles are safe
they have really , really good safety records , " @entity41 said , adding , " we feel really confident , and we 'll work cooperatively with @entity11
" the investigation could take a year to complete , possibly longer if it becomes complex , the @entity11 said
in 2005 and later models , @entity13 moved the gas tank of the @entity9 from behind the rear - axle to the middle of the vehicle
@entity41 said that @entity13 made the move to allow more cargo space , not due to safety concerns
since the change , there has been only one fatal fire crash in the redesigned vehicle , according to the @entity22 .
