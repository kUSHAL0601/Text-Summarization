@entity0 , @entity1 -- in downtown @entity0 -- once a no - go zone riddled with crime -- a young entrepreneur is sparking an urban restoration
property developer @entity7 is busy rejuvenating the @entity1 city 's industrial heart after years of urban decay , with his @entity11 , on the east side of @entity0 's central business district
@entity11 -- meaning " place of light " in @entity14 -- is now a mixed - zone neighborhood , full of shops , restaurants and residences , which comes alive at the weekend
and it could follow in the footsteps of @entity23 's trendy @entity22 and the shabby - chic streets of @entity25 in @entity26 as @entity0 's young middle class flood to the district

" @entity7 and his team own 35 properties in the area and have developed 10 of those buildings since 2008
" it 's paid off financially , but it will pay off more in the medium to long term , " he added
the @entity11 's first project , called " @entity45 " is a creative hub boasting an in - house restaurant , rooftop bar and an exhibition space as well as a studio for some of @entity1 's most respected artists

" initially buildings were being bought for 100 euros a square meter , " he said
" i think prices have tripled , but that still makes it very competitive when you compare it to the suburbs
there are still very good deals to be enjoyed
" but for seemingly low prices by @entity72 standards , @entity11 still remains an aspirational area for many of the city 's 3.8 million inhabitants
despite @entity1 being the continent 's largest economy , 23 % of the population is below the poverty line
@entity7 said that @entity11 's continued development will have a positive impact on @entity0 , known as the " @entity83 , " as other similar projects spring up around the city
" there 's always a knock - on effect , " he said , " it 's all coming together now in total regeneration
" another company investing in @entity0 real estate is @entity92
originally a trucking company , today @entity92 owns 100 commercial , industrial and farming properties around @entity1

when it was built in the 1970s , @entity102 was a desirable place to live
but having loomed over the city for nearly four decades , it became a symbol of the urban decay as the abandoned building fell victim to crime , drugs and prostitution toward the end of the last century
when it was taken over in 2001 , after years of neglect , five stories of discarded trash had to be removed as the building 's rejuvenation took place
@entity92 founder @entity122 , who is overseeing the renovation , explained : " we bought in large conveyer belts with earth - moving equipment and we started moving it out
" the group has invested tens of millions of dollars into the project and has already finished renovating the residential floors
@entity122 says all of the 500 apartments currently in @entity102 are occupied
" what we 're creating is an environment where people can feel safe , " said @entity122
" it 's a big change from where it was 15 years ago
i think the whole of @entity0 is starting to change as well
" @entity2 's @entity140 contributed to this report .
