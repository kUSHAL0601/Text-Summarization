this western @entity1 city , now a boom town once again because of its accelerating oil business , is reeling with the news that more of its sons have joined to fight with the radical @entity7 group called @entity8
a government report issued in late august says 130 @entity1 citizens have gone abroad to join terrorist groups , including 30 believed to be fighting in @entity12
in @entity15 , five of those young men are linked to one downtown apartment building , which has a mosque on its ground floor
that mosque is where a recent convert to @entity7 , @entity21 , began worshipping in 2012
not long after , he slipped away
his mother told @entity24 that her son said he was going to @entity26 to study @entity27
instead , she says , he flew to @entity28 and later across the @entity30 border into @entity12
@entity21 's boyhood friend , @entity31 , says he spoke to @entity32 briefly last december 23
@entity31 says his friend sounded " normal , " just as if he was n't in @entity12
less than a month later , the 22 - year - old would be killed on an @entity8 battlefield near @entity36 , @entity12 , fighting against @entity12 rebels of the @entity38
" i 'd be lying to you if i told you i did n't see this coming , " @entity31 told @entity24
" if he was there for reasons he thought true , there was nothing that could have stopped him
" and only a few weeks ago , one of two @entity15 brothers who disappeared in 2012 emerged on @entity47 , praising the @entity8 terrorists who executed freelance @entity50 journalist @entity49
@entity51 tweeted under his new @entity47 name , @entity53
" the video of @entity49 losing his neck is the perfection of @entity57 , " he wrote
@entity51 and his brother @entity58 both said that they had joined @entity8 after leaving @entity1
another @entity60 , @entity61 , showed up on @entity62 , burning his @entity1 passport and vowing to bring his fight home
" this is a message to @entity1 and all the @entity50 , " he says on the video
" we are coming and we will destroy you
" @entity61 was also killed
all of this has made @entity60 leaders in @entity15 say they are deeply concerned about what one of them called " criminal radicalization
" a conference discussing this will take place in @entity15 on thursday , the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the @entity50
" we plan to go beyond primary prevention and focus on how to interrupt criminal acts of violence and even find worst - case scenarios of violent radicals returning from foreign theaters , " said @entity80 , one of the conference organizers
what is @entity8 ? more than 100 @entity50 fighting in @entity12 opinion : why @entity50 leave for jihad
