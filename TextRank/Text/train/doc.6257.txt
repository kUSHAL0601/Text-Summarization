-- left - leaning @entity3 president @entity2 easily won re-election with more than double the votes of his closest rival , election officials said on monday , amid complaints of voting irregularities
with 85 % of the ballots counted , the incumbent had 62.6 % of the vote , versus @entity12 's 30.9 %
" i want to congratulate the current president , " @entity13 , president of the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) , told reporters
opposition leaders have criticized sunday 's vote and @entity12 , @entity2 's closest rival , refused to accept the results
he was known until recently as a radio - station owner and journalist and as creator of the popular @entity3 radio character " @entity25
" " we ca n't accept the results presented by the @entity15 as they do n't reflect the will of the people , " @entity12 said
according to opposition leader @entity31 of the @entity33 @entity32 , 20 % of election observers had been stopped from entering polling stations
" this has been a process plagued with irregularities , " he said
@entity39 spokeswoman @entity38 similarly weighed in monday on reports of procedural irregularities and voter intimidation
" frankly , if the @entity3 government had nothing to hide , it should have allowed a broad compliment of international monitors , " she told reporters in @entity44
placing third , with 6 % of votes , was former president @entity51
he was convicted of corruption during his term and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2003 , but in a controversial 2009 decision , the nation 's top court overturned the conviction
@entity3 's constitution bars presidents from being re-elected , but that did not stop @entity2 from running in his sixth straight presidential race
supporters of the president celebrated what was then his apparent re-election victory in the streets of the country 's capital sunday night
he was first elected as president in 1984 , and ran unsuccessfully in 1990 , 1996 and 2001 before being elected again in 2006
@entity2 is known as an ally of @entity73 president @entity72 and was a public supporter of former @entity76 leader @entity75 during the @entity76 uprising
but recently he has reached for the middle , making overtures to the business class and promising to lure foreign investors into the country
" our government program is the one in practice now and the one we have to improve , strengthen ( and ) develop , " @entity2 said recently
for his supporters , re-election guarantees that social and economic programs will continue
they want to see more investment in infrastructure and technology , and more public housing , projects often financed through @entity73
@entity2 came to power as part of the @entity98 rebels who overthrew the @entity100 dynasty in 1979
his detractors accuse @entity2 of having too much influence over the @entity14 and the @entity103 , which allowed his candidacy
yet his popular support remains high , particularly among the country 's youth
" the level of support shows a bit of a new generation that does not know the experience of the past , of 30 years ago , of the war that happened in @entity3 , " said @entity108 , a senior associate at the @entity44 - based @entity109
@entity0 's @entity116 and @entity117 contributed to this report .
