@entity0 , @entity1 -- flags in @entity1 were flying at half - staff thursday and government workers observed three minutes of silence a day after a teenager opened fire at his high school , killing eight people before fatally turning the gun on himself
police probing @entity1 's first known school shooting said thursday that a picture was emerging of the gunman as a lonely , antisocial 18 - year - old who acted alone and left a suicide note saying good - bye to his family , but that his motive was unclear
police said the victims -- all of whom were from the school -- were apparently picked at random
six were students , one was the 61 - year - old school headmistress and one was the 42 - year - old school nurse
ten other people were wounded in the attack
@entity30 was closed for the rest of the week , but some of the 460 students gathered there overnight and into thursday , crying and lighting candles for the victims
police identified the gunman as @entity39 , a senior at the high school in the southern @entity1 town of @entity0 , about 30 miles north of @entity42
@entity39 died at a @entity42 hospital late wednesday of a self - inflicted gunshot wound to the head
police said all of his victims had multiple gunshot wounds , most to the upper body and head
police said they found 69 shells and more than 320 unused bullets at the scene
chief inspector @entity54 told @entity1 news agency @entity55 that @entity39 was determined to kill as many people as he could before turning the pistol on himself
@entity54 said everything suggested @entity39 wanted the massacre to be as spectacular as possible , according to @entity55
watch @entity61 fire weapons in video from his web page Â» at a news conference thursday , police said @entity39 had sprayed a flammable liquid , possibly lamp oil , on the walls of the school and that he tried but failed to light it
students and police painted a picture of panic at the school during the attack , which started around 11:45 a.m. ( 4:45 a.m. et )
students said that the principal ordered everyone to stay in their classrooms , but many thought it was just a drill
students said that , as word spread that a gunman was moving through the school , they were told to barricade themselves in classrooms , lie on the floor down and wait for help
for 40 minutes , many lay in fear as the gunman moved through all three floors of the school
police said that , when they arrived just before noon ( 5a.m
et ) , they found students trying to scramble out of windows ; officers broke down doors to help students escape
police said that , when they first made contact with @entity39 , they told him to drop his gun , but he responded with fire
fearful of hitting others , police did not fire back , they said
police said they found @entity39 a little more than an hour later , just after 1p.m
a search of his house turned up books and the gunman 's writings , which suggest he had " very strong opinions against society , " police said
authorities were also investigating notes and videos @entity39 had posted on @entity112 , the online video - sharing site
most of the videos indicated a fascination with violence and some hinted at the massacre itself
hours before the shooting , a video titled " @entity39 -- 11/7/2007 " was posted on the @entity112 site by someone who identified himself as @entity39
in rambling text posted on the site two weeks before the shooting , @entity39 called himself " a cynical existentialist , anti-human humanist , anti-social social - darwinist , realistic idealist and god - like atheist
" " i am prepared to fight and die for my cause , " he wrote
" i , as a natural selector , will eliminate all who i see unfit , disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection
" the @entity30 clip was one of about 80 videos posted on the site by @entity39
in the video , a picture of the school disintegrates to reveal an image of a man resembling @entity39 against a red background , pointing a gun at the screen
the clip was accompanied by the track " @entity159 " by the rock band @entity151 , whose lyrics were also quoted by @entity154 and @entity154 , the students behind the @entity157 massacre of 1999 in the @entity158
