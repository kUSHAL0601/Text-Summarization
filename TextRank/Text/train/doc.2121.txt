@entity18 officials ' conflicting numbers the news conflicted with information @entity0 provided to @entity6 on sunday indicating that all 48 people would be cleared at midnight

@entity0 told @entity6 that in addition to the 48 people whose quarantine was ending monday , there were 75 health workers being monitored
