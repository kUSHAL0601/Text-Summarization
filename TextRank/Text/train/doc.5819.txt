-- it 's grown from selling clothes to a handful of friends inside a small dorm room to a popular fashion website featuring more than 1,000 stylish items
admittedly , it 's been quite a journey for @entity10 , the co-founder of @entity11 , an online marketplace that links buyers of clothes and accessories to sellers across @entity17
launched just over a year ago , the growing website features a mix of new and used fashion items -- from custom - made pieces by young designers and boutique stores to well - preserved clothes from women looking to de-clutter their closets
" we simply merged the idea to sell affordable fashion to people who just did n't want to pay too much , " says @entity10
" and also give people an opportunity to sell off clothes they do n't want anymore in their closet but are still in good condition -- and you can be able to get extra cash , " she adds
@entity10 first began selling clothes to her friends back in 2008 while studying at the @entity40
" they would tell me , ' well , where did you get this dress from ? ' " she recalls
" i said , ' if i see something that you like then i will get it for you
' and then it suddenly became a bi-weekly thing , where they would stop by my room and select what they liked -- so that really kick - started it off
" after graduating with a marketing degree , @entity10 then decided to expand her small venture , going into business with her high school friend @entity57
using @entity10 's living room as their base , the two business partners called their shop @entity11
" when we met the first time to try to exchange clothes and buy from each other as friends , we had , like , 49 items so we picked 49 , " says @entity10
while the two entrepreneurs still use @entity10 's living room as a physical store twice a week , they see the biggest opportunities for growth online , where buyers can connect to sellers 24 hours a day , seven days a week
@entity10 says they started with about 10 customers a month and they 're now getting about 100 , while last year there were some 2,500 fashion items sold through the website
" there is huge potential in this market , " says @entity10
" it is quite competitive but at same time there is huge opportunity , " she adds
global connections @entity17 has experienced a major it boom over the past few years , spurred by a rapid increase in the usage of mobile phones
according to the latest data by the @entity94 , the number of mobile phone subscribers rose to 31.2 million in september 2013 , while internet users stood at 19.1 million
the growth has the potential to revolutionize the east @entity100 country 's retail sector
in recent years , several web - based marketplaces have proliferated as more and more mobile phone users turn online to buy or sell goods and services
indeed , the widespread adoption of mobile money platforms like @entity107 has turned @entity17 into " a global leader in mobile money transfer service , " according to @entity110 , a @entity111 - based think tank
but while websites such as @entity11 connect users and buyers within @entity17 , other online marketplaces such as @entity116 enable small - scale artisans and producers sell their handcrafted creations not only locally but also across the world
@entity116 , which means marketplace in @entity122 , allows jewelry makers and craftspeople to participate in the international trade
it helps them link directly with buyers from around the world , even if they do n't have access to a computer or a bank account
using a simple mobile phone , artisans can create virtual storefronts by posting their products on @entity137 's e-commerce website
consumers then can buy directly from the designers , with @entity137 facilitating shipment and payment to the vendor
@entity143 , the @entity17 co-founder of @entity116 , says the site receives tens of thousands of hits per month and has helped artisans to sell thousands of products to consumers from places such as the @entity111 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150
" @entity137 transforms the ubiquitous mobile phone into a tool for trade that expands access to economic opportunity for developing world producers of handmade goods , giving them a greater share of the profits of the global creative goods industry , " says @entity143
looking ahead , the @entity116 team has big plans for the future
@entity143 says the e-commerce marketplace will be looking to expand its geographical footprint , scaling across @entity167 and @entity168 as well as piloting in @entity169 and @entity170
back in @entity10 's home , the young entrepreneur says she hopes @entity11 's annual profits will make them a million @entity17 shillings in the next two to three years -- a goal of about $ 12,000 in profit a year
" it 's working , you can see the growth , " she says
" so it 's really exciting when you see all that working out , " adds @entity10
" i am not denying there are no ups and downs for anyone out there who wants to start but it 's really , at the end of the day , very satisfying that you are building something that you are proud of , that you are working , that you like , and then still be able to pay your bills
