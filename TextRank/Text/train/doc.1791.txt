in late january , @entity0 , a seventeen - year - old woman with bipolar disorder and depression , walked into the police department in @entity5 , @entity6 , with " i have a gun " written on her hand
she also had a knife in her waistband
officer @entity12 approached her , read her message , and quickly restrained her
he then let her go , restrained her on the floor , then let her go again as two other officers entered the scene
on the surveillance video that the department released , you can see the moment in which @entity0 decides to die
she raises her knife and charged at @entity12 , who shoots , as does one of the other officers
the third officer deploys a @entity25 , but by then it was too late
she lies on the floor for a few minutes until emergency medical services arrive
the department has released a statement and held a press conference
the officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation by the @entity36
when police misread the circumstances of encounter with an individual with mental health crisis , the possibility for violence rapidly escalates
the only solution is for law enforcement to try to stabilize every encounter , to the extent possible , as if it involved psychiatric disability
as a nation , we are in the midst of an extended conversation about police violence , and this case stands out as unusual
the victim was white and female , for one thing
moreover , ugly use - of - force incidents usually result from police being too quick to escalate , rather than too slow
in the last few years i 've watched many videos , either from cell phones or police cameras , and read even more incident reports describing encounters between law enforcement and people with psychiatric disabilities
i can not recall seeing a case in which an officer has a potentially violent individual so well subdued , and then just backs away
i wondered if just as being black and male sparks some officers to be overly aggressive , a confrontation with a slender white female might produce the opposite effect
the best known victims of police violence while in mental health crisis are black men
police arguably are more prone to consider black men dangerous
they demand instant compliance and respond to any hesitation as a threat
for example , in cases such as the death of @entity89 in @entity90 , or @entity91 in @entity92 , police officers engaged aggressively , demanding the individual act in a non-disabled manner and comply
in my review of such encounters , i 've argued that @entity89 , @entity91 , and many other individuals in similar circumstances , could n't follow orders as expected
therefore , they were shot and killed
these are cases of law enforcement officers failing to recognize the complexity of a mental health situation
in @entity108 , @entity6 , on the other hand , the incident shows the other side of the coin -- under aggression
i spoke to @entity113 , a police officer and a trainer for use - of - force incidents , he said that in his experience many officers are likely to be less aggressive toward women , especially small women , in ways that put everyone in greater danger
" generally speaking , male officers are more reluctant to use lawful , justified , and necessary levels of force against women as compared to incidents with men
" he also said that use - of - force models for a suspect armed with a knife , but restrained , might differ
hypothetically , @entity113 says that if he could control a suspect 's arms , he would not let her free from the restraint hold , but that if he feared he might lose control , backing up and readying his firearm might be a reasonable choice
at this time officer @entity12 is not speaking about his decision - making , due to the ongoing investigation , so i do n't know why he did n't try to handcuff her
i expect the investigation to determine that he was operating within the norms of his training for use - of - force
there 's no question that using a firearm and aiming for center mass is the correct response for someone at close proximity charging you with a butcher knife raised
it 's just not the only way to handle these situations
for example , in @entity92 recently , a man with a butcher knife charged at police officers
they held their fire , remembering the death of @entity91 , and instead led him in a chase around parked cars , shouting at him to drop his knife , and simply waited until he eventually complied
that 's a model of tactical restraint that we need to see applied more broadly
encounters between people with psychiatric disabilities and law enforcement can be dangerous
studies estimate that around half the people killed by law enforcement every year have psychiatric disabilities such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder
there will always be some situations in which the threat level is so great that there 's no way to stabilize it peacefully
but the death of @entity0 was not one of them
her death demonstrates that the ongoing crisis of violent police encounters with people with mental health transcends race , class and gender
it requires fundamental rethinking of strategic approaches to these types of incidents on a national level
until that happens , the unnecessary deaths will continue .
