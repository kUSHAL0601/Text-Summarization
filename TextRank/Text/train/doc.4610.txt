-- before this week , the last time the @entity1 went on strike was september 8 , 1987
it lasted until october 3 , during which officials , teachers and parents clashed in the city 's longest teachers strike ever
after it ended , i called the @entity13 school system the worst in the country
" i 'm not sure there 's a system as bad as the @entity13 system " were my exact words as @entity20 secretary of education
the @entity13 school system was a failure
half of @entity13 's 64 public high schools scored in the bottom 1 % of schools on the @entity25 , an old metric used by many colleges for admissions
'' forty - six percent of @entity13 teachers send their children to private schools , '' i noted then , too
'' the people who know the product best send their children elsewhere
'' in spite of this , the teachers union had the gall to demand a 10 % raise with a 5 % raise to follow the next year
after a month of jawing , they eventually wrangled a 4 % raise the first year , with the second year determined by funding from elsewhere
twenty - five years later , and in the midst of another teachers strike , it does n't look like much has improved in @entity13
today , the 26,000 members of the @entity1 are on strike because they ca n't accept a 16 % raise over four years , tougher testing and accountability standards , and non-automatic rehiring
once again , the @entity1 is showing its true colors : self - serving public sector bullies more interested in their well - being than the well - being of students
consider that public school teachers in @entity13 make an average of $ 71,000 a year , while a majority of the roughly 350,000 public school students , overwhelmingly minority students , receive free or discounted school meals , meaning they are at or near the poverty line
what do these well - paid teachers bestow on the poor children and families of @entity13 ? nearly 80 % of eighth - graders in @entity13 public schools are not proficient in reading or math , according to the @entity20 @entity69
in fact , little has improved in @entity13 since the 1987 strike
@entity72 of the @entity73 points out that " in 1987 , 43 % of incoming @entity13 freshmen would drop out of high school without graduating
today 's drop - out rate is 39.4 % , the lowest it has ever been
" a dropout rate of nearly four students in 10 is a national disgrace
for 25 years , @entity13 's teachers ' unions have held the city 's parents and students hostage while morally and financially bankrupting the city
@entity13 public schools are $ 665 million in debt , and that debt is expected to exceed $ 1 billion next year
for 25 years , the union has blocked and impeded educational progress
the time for change is long overdue
for decades , conservative education reformers like myself have been pushing for performance pay , strict accountability , flexible rehiring practices for school principals and longer school days to improve our public schools
now , @entity13 mayor @entity103 and secretary of education @entity104 , through the @entity107 grant requirements , are trying to implement similar measures in @entity13 's public schools
@entity104 , whom i sometimes agree with , and @entity103 , whom i almost never agree with , both seem to be taking the traditionally conservative side of this issue
we have in @entity13 a battle for the soul of the @entity115
will @entity103 and @entity104 succeed in curtailing the long - term ally and bulwark of the @entity115 , the teachers union , or will the @entity1 and its leader , @entity119 , once again strong - arm their own party for their own interests ? a teacher 's view from the picket lines president @entity125 has been noticeably silent
the nation deserves to know whether his allegiances lie with his political allies in the public sector unions or with @entity103 and @entity104
this power struggle will reveal much about the constitution of the modern @entity115
if @entity103 wins , the effects would be felt throughout the large , predominantly @entity115 inner - city school districts across the country
for one of the first times in recent history , @entity115 would stand up to their own entrenched inner - city public sector teachers unions
should @entity103 lose , teachers unions will grow only stronger and more brazen , and the city of @entity13 and its children and families may be set back for another 25 years
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .
