-- @entity2 's military is using a new weapon to catch draft - dodgers : the social networking site @entity6
the army says it checks the home pages of those who have sought an exemption from military service because they are orthodox -- religiously observant
the pages sometimes provide evidence that the people have done things that a strictly observant jew would not do
about 1,000 female @entity2 in the past two years who had claimed to be orthodox have had to " rephrase their religious declarations " and do their military service after being found out , @entity2 military spokeswoman @entity17 told @entity0
military service is obligatory for @entity2 from the age of 18
men serve three years , women serve two
some reasons , including religious observance , can be claimed to avoid this
@entity17 said checking @entity6 is just one tactic used to uncover false religious claims
questioning and background checks also are done
but with @entity6 , @entity17 said , the military can " check whether a person is taking photos on @entity34 ( the @entity35 sabbath ) , whether they are wearing something that is not modest or updating their status on @entity34
" @entity40 are not allowed to use machinery like cameras or computers on the sabbath
the military has also caught draft - dodgers by seeing photos of them in a non-kosher restaurant .
