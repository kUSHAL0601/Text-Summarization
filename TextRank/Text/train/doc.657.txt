@entity0 has some advice for @entity3 owner @entity2 : sell the team , take the money and enjoy the rest of your life
a day after @entity2 appeared on @entity9 slamming the @entity12 legend 's character , his battle with @entity14 and his community outreach efforts , @entity0 said tuesday that he feels sorry for the 80 - year - old billionaire
i 'm going to pray for this ... man , " @entity0 told @entity9 's @entity19 in an exclusive interview
@entity2 's explosive @entity9 interview that aired monday night was the first time he had spoken publicly since audio recordings surfaced last month of him making racist remarks
reaction to the taped remarks came fast and furious , and the @entity12 responded with a lifetime ban for @entity29
@entity0 became an involuntary figure in the controversy after @entity2 named him in the leaked recording
" admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put ( @entity35 ) on an @entity36 for the world to have to see so they have to call me , " @entity2 is heard telling friend @entity33
@entity0 told @entity19 he is still waiting for an apology from @entity29 for getting roped into @entity2 's fight with @entity33 , and @entity0 called the monday interview -- in which @entity2 directed another tirade at the @entity12 legend -- " disturbing
" " what 's really sad is , it 's not about me , " @entity0 said
" this is about the woman you love outing you and taping you and putting your conversation out here for everybody to know
... this is between you two , but then he wants to include me
" @entity0 said he had only met with @entity2 three or four times , and most of those discussions had focused on basketball
@entity0 could n't say if the @entity3 owner has slipped mentally
@entity2 " seems like he 's all there , " @entity0 said
" but the problem is , he 's living in the stone ages
" @entity0 : @entity2 called me @entity2 went on the offensive in his interview with @entity19 when @entity0 's name came up , blaming the basketball @entity69 for @entity2 's delay in apologizing for the racist remarks that have him now fighting to keep his team
" wait , be patient , i 'll help you , we 'll work it out , " @entity2 said the @entity12 legend told him
not so , @entity0 said tuesday
in fact , @entity0 told @entity9 , @entity2 called him recently and asked him to appear alongside him in an interview with @entity81 's @entity80
" i said the number one thing you need to do which you have n't done is apologize to everybody , and myself , " @entity0 said
" ( @entity2 replied ) ' i 'll get to that
i 'll get to that
' " the former @entity12 star told @entity29 that the billionaire businessman needed to consult with attorneys , stressing that the controversy was bigger than @entity2 realized
@entity0 said @entity2 was adamant about @entity0 doing the interview , even reaching out a second time
@entity0 said his attorneys advised him not to have any further conversations with the embattled owner
@entity2 never did the interview with @entity80
" i 'm really disturbed by the fact that when he called me he should have said , ' @entity35 , i 'm sorry , ' " @entity0 said
a sterling solution : start talking honestly about race ' i do n't know that young lady ' @entity0 and the woman at the center of the scandal -- @entity33 -- have met briefly only once , the @entity12 legend said , taking a picture at a @entity109 game
@entity0 is a part - owner of the baseball team
" i do n't know the young lady
i barely know @entity2 , so now i am caught in the middle of this love affair or whatever they had , " @entity0 said
@entity33 has denied being intimate with @entity2 , who when asked about the nature of their relationship declined to answer
@entity0 said he does n't think @entity2 understands what a big mistake the @entity3 owner 's racist comments were or the number of people who were offended by the remarks -- and by @entity2 's statements to @entity19 that aired monday night , slamming @entity0 again
" what kind of a guy goes to every city , has sex with every girl , then he catches @entity14 ? is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about ? " @entity2 asked @entity19 in monday 's interview
" i think he should be ashamed of himself
i think he should go into the background
but what does he do for the black people ? he does n't do anything
" in response , @entity0 defended his charitable work and business investments , saying @entity29 should have done his homework before making the comments
" my whole life is devoted to urban @entity145
so , you know i just wish he knew the facts when he 's talking , " @entity0 told @entity19
" but he 's a man who 's upset and he 's reaching
he 's trying to find something that he can grab on to help him save his team
and it 's not going to happen
" @entity0 says @entity2 disrespected the work he 's done , like helping coffee shops , gyms and theaters open in urban areas
" that really makes me upset
and then my competitive spirit comes out , because i 've done all this great work
all the kids we 've sent to college , and i 've got 150 kids on scholarship right now
" he also responded to @entity2 's @entity14 remarks , saying he never hid from the diagnosis when he retired from the @entity12 in 1991
" i came out like a man , you know , i told the world
i did n't blame nobody else
i understood that what i did was wrong , " @entity0 said
" ok , so i announced that to the world , and i hoped that i was able to help people in doing that , and i think i did
" @entity0 says @entity2 's comments about @entity14 show there 's still a stigma that needs to be fought
" i hope this does n't set us back , " @entity0 said
" the stigma is still there
we 've been fighting it for years , and what we want to continue to do is just educate the world that it 's ok , that you can high - five a person who has @entity14
... it 's a shame that @entity2 used this platform with you , instead of using this platform to come out and apologize to the world , which would have been great
" opinion : the 5 apology rules that @entity2 broke @entity35 's interest in a basketball team @entity0 , whose ownership interests also include the @entity201 's @entity200 in @entity202 , denied @entity29 's assertion that the former @entity204 was trying to deceive his way into buying the @entity3
the accusation made @entity0 laugh
" if i was going to trick somebody , deceive somebody , be dishonest to somebody , steal somebody 's franchise , it 's going to be the @entity204 , " said the man who won five league titles while with the team , one of the @entity12 's marquee franchises
@entity0 once owned a minority stake in the @entity204 , which have been owned by the @entity221 family since 1979
but @entity0 said he would entertain the idea of buying the @entity3 with his five partners who spent more than $ 2 billion on the @entity109
he thinks a sale forced by a vote of the @entity12 @entity227 would take at least eight months to complete and would be a $ 1 billion transaction
" if it comes out and it 's for sale , and my @entity236 ( @entity237 ) partners and i say , ' ok , we want to take a look at it , we want to buy it , ' of course , we 'll make a run for it , " he said , adding that he has had offers from other @entity12 teams to become a part owner
@entity2 's claims vs. reality time for change ? @entity2 , the longest tenured owner in the @entity12 , bought the team in 1981 when it was in @entity249 and moved into @entity202
but after his recorded racist remarks were revealed , the @entity12 began the process of forcing him to sell the franchise , which some experts have valued between $ 575 million and $ 1 billion
it will take a 75 % vote of the league 's owners to terminate @entity2 's franchise rights
the case is with the @entity12 's finance and advisory committee of 10 owners , which talked by conference call on tuesday , but did n't recommend sending the matter to the board
@entity2 has n't definitively said if he will sue to keep the team -- which is actually owned by a family trust that includes his wife , @entity267 , as a co-executor -- but many analysts expect him to do so
@entity0 noted @entity2 's past legal issues with his real estate business where he settled lawsuits brought against him and his wife with out - of - court payments
@entity2 " ca n't buy his way out of this one
he has bought his way out of all the other situations
ca n't do it this time , " @entity0 said
@entity0 said @entity2 should go into retirement
" you 're 80 years old
you 've had a tremendous life
and you 're going to benefit , whatever the price tag is , from this team selling
just go ahead and enjoy the rest of your life , " @entity0 said
" you 're fighting a battle that you ca n't win
" @entity2 asked : what has @entity0 done ? answer : quite a lot
