-- nearly three - quarters of @entity1 say that the government wastes their tax dollars , according to a new national poll
a @entity6 survey released thursday also indicates that roughly half the public believes the tax system is unfair , and as a result , four in 10 say they 're angry about the amount of taxes that they pay
seventy - four percent of people questioned say that a lot of their tax dollars are wasted by the government ; 23 percent say that some of their tax dollars are misspent and three percent say that not much of their tax dollars are wasted
@entity1 are split on their overall opinion of the country 's tax system : 49 percent say it 's fair and 50 percent say it 's unfair , according to the poll
" six in 10 democrats say that the tax system is fair , " said @entity0 polling director @entity26
" republicans are split down the middle , with 49 percent calling it fair and 51 percent thinking it is unfair
" four in 10 questioned say that they are angry about the amount of taxes they pay ; 36 percent say they 're satisfied and just under one in four say they do n't have particular feelings on the issue
nearly half of @entity42 questioned say they 're angry , but that figure drops to 44 percent among @entity45 and 29 percent among @entity27
the poll indicates growing public frustration with taxes over the past couple of decades
" this is a significantly higher level of anger than existed during the 1980s , " @entity26 added
" in 1985 , only 27 percent were angry about the amount of taxes they had to pay , possibly a reflection of the tax cuts that @entity56 instituted in his first year in office
" however , it appears that @entity1 are n't taking their anger out on the @entity60
" only a quarter of all @entity1 think that the @entity60 should be abolished , " @entity26 said

the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points
