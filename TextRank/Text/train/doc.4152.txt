@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 - winning music producer @entity4 , 69 , has been moved to a @entity1 prison to serve his sentence of 19 years to life for killing actress @entity9 , corrections officials said
@entity4 will serve time at the @entity11
@entity4 , who was convicted of second - degree murder and sentenced last month in @entity9 's 2003 shooting death , will be housed at the @entity11 in @entity14
however , " he is not in any of the therapy or treatment facilities at the prison , " said @entity15 , a @entity1 @entity17 spokeswoman
@entity4 is housed in a " sensitive - needs yard " at the prison -- the largest prison by area in the state
it functions like a general population yard , @entity28 said , " but it is for inmates with safety concerns , such as celebrities , gang dropouts or those whose crimes make them a target of other prisoners
" @entity4 's accommodations are standard , with the exception that the cells are slightly larger to accommodate wheelchairs should inmates need them , which he does not , prison spokesman @entity43 said
there are several therapy and education programs for inmates , but @entity28 said she is not sure whether @entity4 will participate in them
inmates who do can work toward a modest reduction of their sentences
@entity4 is not the first celebrity to serve a sentence at the facility south of @entity58 ; actor @entity59 served time there in 1999 for probation violation of a drug charge
the @entity63 and @entity64 and @entity65 houses 6,919 inmates
although it is in @entity14 , it is a separate facility from @entity68 , where @entity69 is serving his life sentence .
