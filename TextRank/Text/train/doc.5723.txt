@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the peak of @entity1 's relentless downpours , a year 's worth of rain fell in a day , disrupting the lives of 15 million men , women and children across the country
they might have otherwise have been celebrating fast - breaking feasts every evening during the @entity15 holy month of @entity16
and in two days , they might have celebrated independence -- @entity1 was partitioned off from @entity19 on august 14 , 1947 , a date observed with immense national pride
instead , @entity1 this year will be surrounded by the effects of the worst natural calamity since its creation , immersed literally in a uniquely dynamic disaster unlike anything they have seen before
thursday , almost two weeks into the crisis , president @entity28 finally got a firsthand look
he had been away in @entity31 during the worst of the flooding , an absence that was deeply felt in @entity1
he and his government came under blistering criticism for a perceived lack of action in helping those in need
presidential spokeswoman @entity40 said the criticism of @entity28 was unfair and that he has been involved from the start in directing relief efforts
" the president has always been concerned with the welfare of @entity1 's people , notwithstanding the venomous propaganda of his opponents , " @entity40 said
" his visit to flood - affected areas should effectively shut up those who would rather play politics than focus on helping those uprooted by raging waters
" but while the government defended its response , the scale of human misery started to become all the more apparent
the death toll climbed thursday to 1,343 , the @entity59 said
another 1,588 people have been injured and 352,291 people have been rescued
more than 722,600 houses and 4,600 villages have been damaged or destroyed
more people have been affected in the flooding than in the 2005 @entity1 earthquakes , the 2004 @entity66 tsunami and the january earthquake in @entity68 combined
in the mountainous north , water funneled down treacherous slopes , quickly engulfing the roads below
it surged down the mighty @entity77 , spreading economic , political and social woes through the heart of @entity1
the fetid stench of death filled the air in many places where mere seconds of unstoppable water ended lives
those who bore witness , even those who thought they had seen everything in this land marred by crisis and killing , were baffled by the suffering wrought by the monsoons
public health officials fear a second wave of deaths that might be caused by waterborne diseases if action is not taken quickly enough
more than 1 million @entity1 are in need of clean water
dr. @entity103 already is struggling to keep up with the demand for medical attention , so many people are sick with diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis
" we are facing much of the problems with the drinking water , because there is no electricity , " he said
towns such as @entity113 , in northwestern @entity1 , have been particularly hard hit
the stagnant water forced tens of thousands into temporary government camps
@entity117 , 60 , shares a flooded tent with eight family members after losing everything -- his house , all his possessions
his family survived with only the clothes on their back
the @entity128 estimated that 6 million @entity1 are , like @entity129 , in direct need of emergency aid , mainly food
@entity129 said food has been distributed in @entity113 , but in chaotic conditions
no one in this squalid camp of 18,000 people wants to miss getting their hands on the last few bags of rice
further north , at @entity142 , lies another common challenge
like 278 other crossings in the province , the @entity145 bridge was swept away by the sudden torrent
dump trucks are trying to close the gap
and men are finishing a suspension bridge so people and supplies can get to the other side
in @entity157 , @entity156 picks through the bricks that used to be his house
he and his 7 - year - old daughter @entity160 are suddenly homeless -- they will have to find somewhere to sleep here , amid the wreckage and rubble
@entity1 soldiers are already familiar with the towns and villages that dot the @entity168
last year , they fought fiercely to regain control of the from the @entity170
the task at hand is daunting in a different way
the @entity170 may have gone , but @entity175 charities with alleged links to terrorist groups are handing out food and , with it , a clear message
" the government is not working properly
that is why the people are working on their own self , so we are also from those people and we are joining hands with those people , " said one man who did not want to be identified
four @entity190 helicopters arrived here from @entity192 to help deliver aid , competing with the @entity175 charities
a silver ribbon of destruction guides them to the farthest reaches of the @entity168 towards @entity199
the @entity190 crew can see the rippled bridges and vast swaths of land eviscerated by water , scoured clean of vegetation , buildings and people
what lies below is a landscape robbed of color , robbed of signs of life
the town of @entity199 was once the @entity214 of the @entity215
now the tourist destination is hell on @entity218
the @entity219 unload bags of flour
for desperate recipients , the @entity222 are a lifeline
the aid situation is complicated by the fact that the humanitarian agencies are themselves victims of the flood
the @entity231 warehouse outside @entity113 should have been a busy distribution hub
instead , it sits under several feet of water
at its height , the water was three times deeper than it is now
it soaked 25,000 canvas tents in sewage - polluted water
the @entity231 had supplies worth $ 15 million in the warehouse
officials do n't know how much they will be able to salvage
" it makes me sad
the idea of pre-positioning stock is to allow us to move quickly with distribution of relief items , and this is back to square one , so to speak , " said @entity247 , of the @entity231
at a nearby camp , @entity254 could use a few of the @entity231 supplies
she is 70 and shivering outside a makeshift shelter
" we only managed to get our children out of the house , we have nothing literally nothing the only help we get is from members of the public , " said @entity254 's grandson
some people are so desperate that they have offered their children to strangers , hoping they 'll take them away from all this
others worry how they will feed their families with so many crops submerged and prices of tomatoes , cucumbers and other vegetables and fruits soaring in the markets
" the crop has been lost and it is a race against time to ensure the next sowing season can be met , " said @entity280 , the @entity128 special envoy
for now , though , the immediate focus is on evacuation
between breaks in the weather , men , women and children rush onto helicopters
some are clearly terrified about their first flight , even though they know it will take them to safety
@entity2 's @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .
