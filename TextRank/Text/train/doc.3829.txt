-- " i did not really realize i was getting life until the date of sentencing
when my attorney told me , i told him that i wanted to take back my guilty plea ... they denied me
" @entity8 says his life ended when he was 23 - years - old
that was two decades ago , when he was arrested and later sentenced to a mandatory double - life term in prison without the possibility of parole for conspiracy to possess lsd with intent to distribute
a self - described " deadhead , " @entity8 was busted after mailing five grams of the hallucinogenic drug to a friend who was working as an informant for the federal government
he 's had more than 20 years to fixate on that moment , years of " what ifs " and " whys
" more than 20 years of feeling like he died , until now
changes on the horizon though the @entity31 administration has been campaigning for prison reform for some time , it has recently begun to take concrete steps to alleviate overcrowded federal prisons that are flooded with non-violent offenders
the @entity36 announced changes to its clemency criteria this week , a move that will likely lead to a wave of sentence commutation requests being sent to president @entity31 by thousands of prisoners who 've been convicted of non-violent drug crimes
" we are launching this clemency initiative in order to quickly and effectively identify appropriate candidates , candidates who have a clean prison record , do not present a threat to public safety , and were sentenced under out - of - date laws that have since been changed , and are no longer seen as appropriate , " deputy attorney general @entity44 said at a news conference wednesday
the clemency changes would be open to prisoners who have met a set of specific conditions : they must be low - level , non-violent offenders without a significant criminal history and must be serving a federal sentence that would likely be shorter if they were convicted today
they must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison , with no history of violence before or during their prison term
the pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort attorney general @entity69 calls " @entity70 , " which also seeks to remedy the once - common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine , based on guidelines first enacted by @entity76 more than 25 years ago
in january , @entity69 urged @entity76 to pass the bipartisan " @entity77 , " which would allow judicial leniency in the sentencing of those convicted of federal non-violent drug crimes
and in april , the @entity82 voted unanimously to back a @entity36 proposal to change the sentencing formula for drug offenders that could shorten prison stays for as many as 70 % of federal drug defendants
" this reduction in the federal sentencing guidelines , while modest , sends a strong message about the need to reserve the harshest penalties for the most serious crimes , " @entity69 commented
of the more than 200,000 inmates in the federal prison system , some estimates show the new clemency criteria could apply to about 2,000 prisoners
but the number is likely to fall to perhaps hundreds after government lawyers review the applications
sentencing guidelines the history of federal mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses dates back to the 1950s , when a mandatory 10 - year sentence could be imposed for crimes such as selling heroin to a juvenile
in the 60s , then - president @entity111 proposed sentencing reforms that would eventually result in nearly all mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses being repealed
but the alarming rise of cocaine use , particularly crack cocaine , in the 1980s sent @entity76 scrambling to react to the epidemic and prompted the hasty revival of the laws that had been viewed so unfavorably two decades before
though the primary goal of legislation such as @entity123 was to target and successfully prosecute " kingpins " or major drug traffickers , thousands of low - level offenders , like @entity8 , have been swept up and imprisoned based on outdated guidelines
while he understands why some may have trouble sympathizing with a three - time drug offender , @entity8 offers perspective
" a life sentence , people do n't really understand it
a man raped his daughter , got probation
a man killed people with his car , got probation
if they did 10 days in jail they would understand ... they ca n't comprehend
" in 1991 , @entity8 was a fixture in the @entity149 fan community
his days were often spent crisscrossing the country alongside fellow " deadheads
" now , his days are spent alongside convicted murderers and rapists , his nights locked down at 9:45 p.m. " i actually thought that i would get 262 months - 327 months , which is a lot of time , but it had a release date , " he explained
@entity8 was arrested on his way to a @entity149 concert in @entity161 and was eventually extradited back to @entity162 , the state in which he mailed his lsd delivery
on the day he was sentenced , he tried his best to conceal his emotions for the sake of his sister , who was present in the courtroom
but " once i walked out of the courtroom while seeing my sister 's eyes tearing up , i could not hold back my own , " he remembered
crack cocaine at heart of once - common sentencing disparity would n't take plea deal @entity8 was initially offered a plea bargain with a 10 - year sentence in exchange for testimony against his co-defendants
had he accepted the deal , he would have been released about 10 years ago
but the decision was n't that easy
one of his co-defendants was his own father
@entity8 maintains that his father had never ingested lsd , but like his son , was only assisting a friend in obtaining the drug
@entity8 did not testify against his father , who was convicted on a lesser offense
" my dad was just helping his friend acquire some because he knew i was able to get it , " @entity8 told @entity0 over the phone from @entity191 in @entity192
" he certainly did not think he could get 10 years for a simple envelope
" admittedly , @entity8 was an avid user of @entity197 and was often called upon by friends to procure the illegal drug , which was often in abundance at @entity149 concerts
" when i was arrested , me and my friends considered @entity197 to be sacred or a sacrament , " he said
and though his two previous encounters with law enforcement for similar crimes had resulted only in probation , his third offense triggered the federal government 's mandatory sentencing guidelines that would ensure he never spends another day as a free man
according to @entity8 , his public defender never explained to him the federal minimum mandatory guidelines , and by the time he did learn about them , it was too late
the guidelines did not allow the judge to take into consideration @entity8 's age , mental state , drug addiction , or the absence of violence when he decided his punishment
the guilty plea he thought would soften his sentence and spare his father effectively ended @entity8 's chances of ever stepping outside of prison again
" i loved my father just like i loved my adopted family at the concerts , so i could not go against him or them
" following sentencing they sat together in prison , father and son , contemplating the bleak future that awaited them both
" he did tell me after sentencing while we were in the same jail together that he would not live long enough to complete his sentence , " @entity8 remembers
his father 's premonitions proved true when he passed away in federal prison in april of 2001 , with only 18 months left to serve
does the punishment fit the crime ? @entity8 's supporters -- including his most ardent advocate , his sister @entity250 -- do n't think his punishment fits his crime
" i do n't think i 've done more wrong to society than has been done to me , " @entity8 explains
he ca n't help but get emotional thinking of his father
" my dad died in prison , how much blood does society feel they need ? " many of his supporters believe that minimum mandatory sentencing is an inhumane and inefficient way to fight the war on drugs
more than 300,000 people have signed a change.org petition calling for clemency in @entity8 's case
in addition , groups such as @entity270 , the @entity271 , and the @entity272 are lobbying for his release
" people have been becoming more aware , evolving it seems
based on that and the current president and attorney general holder , maybe there is hope for others too because there are about 3,700 others who are doing life for non-violent [ offenses ] , " @entity8 explains
and though legislation such as the " @entity77 " is a perfect example of the turning tide on the issue , @entity8 says only one person can help him gain his freedom
" the only thing i can wish for now is a commutation of sentence from the president
" considering that @entity31 issued clemency in december of 2013 for eight non-violent drug offenders , and the recent changes in clemency criteria , this is n't out of the realm of possibility
while daydreaming about freedom may be a nice thought for @entity8 , he 's cautiously optimistic about his chances of actually being released
" i never thought about it ' til recently
i never thought about it but i have some supporters out there and maybe i will
i know my sister is wishing that would happen
" as he waits , @entity8 -- or inmate # 99672 - 012 -- takes it one day at a time
" i hold out , live day to day , stay healthy , keep a positive attitude
" " i can beat any man around in handball , which is a big thing in prison
" rules change means more drug offenders eligible for clemency @entity0 's @entity322 contributed to this report .
