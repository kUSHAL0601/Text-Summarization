was a police officer justified in shooting and killing @entity2 ? that 's the question at the heart of the looming legal battles over the controversial case
what charges could @entity7 police officer @entity7 face ? what would state and federal authorities have to prove in order to pursue charges ? and does the fact that the gunman was a police officer change how the case could play out ? here 's a look at what legal analysts say could happen next
was a state crime committed ? a local grand jury has started hearing testimony , but that does n't mean any particular charges are being recommended by prosecutors at this point , @entity24 senior legal analyst @entity23 said
" an investigation is just an investigation
... it 's just something that they 're looking into , " @entity23 said
for a criminal case to go forward , the grand jury must decide whether a crime was committed , and whether it 's more likely than not that the accused person -- in this case , @entity7 -- committed the crime , said @entity24 legal analyst @entity40 , a former federal prosecutor
after a fatal shooting , a range of charges are typically on the table , said @entity24 legal analyst @entity45 , a criminal defense attorney
" they 're going to be anything in the spectrum of murder , manslaughter ( or ) negligent homicide , " he said
the prosecutor will make a recommendation to the grand jury
from there , the grand jury could decide to indict @entity7 , or that there is n't enough evidence to move forward
in order to bring charges against @entity7 , nine of 12 jurors will have to agree
but the prosecutor plays a key role in the hearings , which are not open to the public
" the grand jury ultimately decides whether to indict , but it 's 100 % the prosecution 's show
... the prosecutor could , in theory , make less of an effort if he does n't want someone indicted , " @entity45 said
some residents and community leaders contend @entity76 prosecuting attorney @entity75 has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases
@entity81 , a former district attorney in @entity82 who knows @entity75 , defended him as fair and objective
" i believe mr. @entity75 will present the facts and the evidence to the grand jury and the @entity89 law as he is required to do so , " @entity81 said
" we do not put defendants on trial just to see what a jury will do
" were @entity2 's civil rights violated ? as part of a federal civil rights investigation , authorities are interviewing witnesses and weighing a number of factors
@entity102 among them : whether @entity7 exhibited " racial hostility , " @entity23 said
" the most important thing would be , did he say anything that indicates racial hostility , either before , or after , or during ( the shooting ) ? " @entity23 said
@entity7 is white , and @entity2 was african - american
" the bar is very high , " @entity40 said , " and they 're difficult cases to prove
" but race does n't have to be a factor in the shooting for investigators to allege there was a federal civil rights violation , @entity45 said
federal statute says it 's a crime for government officials " to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the @entity123
" federal prosecutors could argue that @entity2 's right to life was violated , @entity45 said , but it 's a tough case to make
" they have to show that the officer intended to deprive somebody of that constitutional right
they would have to show intent to kill ... which is not a particularly easy showing to make , " he said
when can police use deadly force ? the fact that @entity7 is a police officer could influence whether he faces charges -- and how the case plays out
" often jurors are extremely sympathetic to police officers , " said @entity140 , a professor at @entity141 and a former federal prosecutor
" they think , even if he made a mistake , he 's got the hardest job in the world , so they often want to cut police officers some slack
" authorities also weigh different factors when deciding to prosecute police
" there are issues that come up when you 're prosecuting cases against police officers , because police officers by the very nature of their jobs can use deadly force , " @entity40 said
police officers have the same rights civilians have to self defense , @entity45 said , and they also have the right to make arrests
" to do that , " he said , " they can use deadly force to prevent an escape
" if @entity2 was trying to get away from the officer , @entity45 said , the @entity170 case @entity171 allows the use of deadly force when an alleged felon is trying to flee if " the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others
" but given the number of times @entity2 was shot , along with newly released audio that may show a pause in rapid gunfire , @entity7 has a lot of explaining to do , the analysts said
" evidence suggests that he was n't fleeing and was facing the officer , " @entity45 said
" if that 's true ... the officer has to explain six shots
he has to explain a reason for each of those six shots
he has to have justifiably been in fear of his life or fear of some imminent serious bodily harm
