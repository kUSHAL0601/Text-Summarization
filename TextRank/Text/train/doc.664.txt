@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 says there is only one person he blames for the spectacular implosion of his career the first time round -- himself
@entity3 backstage at the @entity9 holding his @entity10 for his portrayal of @entity12 in " @entity12
" " you lose your house , your wife , your career , your everything at one time , " he says , " you 've got to look in the mirror and go ' it 's your fault
' " for a long time it looked like @entity3 was destined for obscurity
but , amazingly , he has battled his way back to the top
it has taken him 15 years , but his critically - acclaimed role in @entity27 's latest film , " @entity12 " might finally allow the actor to shake off the notoriety and grab on to the career that should have been his all along
@entity3 's recent @entity9 win for best actor seems to be just another chapter in the actor 's strange roller coaster story
despite early promise , @entity3 gained such a terrible reputation for self - destructive behavior and on - set antics that , no one in @entity41 would touch him
he has also been beset by public mistakes and scandal : his ruined face , the arrests and alleged spousal abuse , a short stint as a boxer and some terrible career choices -- he turned down the role of prize - fighter @entity51 in " @entity53 " which was eventually played by @entity54
today , a relaxed , expansive @entity3 is sitting in sweats in a private room at an exclusive @entity1 hotel that is thick with cigarette smoke
the face , battered during his short boxing career and reconstructed with extensive plastic surgery , is , unexpectedly , less of a train wreck in the flesh , although his moustache does look distinctly stuck - on
his ever - present pet @entity65 , @entity67 , is also there , slumbering quietly by @entity3 's side in a tiny gray hooded top
( in his @entity9 acceptance speech , he thanked his dogs saying , " sometimes when a man is alone , that 's all you 've got is your dog
" ) squashed on top of his scarecrow hair extensions is a beanie with the word " indestructible " embroidered across the front
it 's not a bad description for the 52 - year - old actor
candid is another one -- especially about the bad times
" seeing your entourage leaving with everything they can carry
" he says , giving an example of a particularly bleak time , " and you 're standing there in the dark with your thumb up your ass
" it is the uncomfortable parallels between the ups and downs of @entity3 's life and that of his character @entity12 -- a burnt - out fighter , once a crowd - puller , now scraping a living from second division fights in school gyms -- that give particular resonance to the role
" there was so much of the character ... living in shame , the character being a has - been , it was like it hit me in the face really hard , " he tells @entity2
he says he also knew director @entity27 would " want his pound of flesh
" " i knew he 'd want me to revisit some very dark painful places
" things started to go wrong for @entity3 in 1987 , at the height of his fame after explicit blockbuster " 9 1/2 weeks
" he says simply that he lost interest in acting and preferred riding motorcycles
but it was more than that
@entity132 , who directed @entity3 in 1987 film " @entity134 " is quoted as calling him " a nightmare " and " very dangerous on set
" @entity3 puts this down to a problem with authority -- for him " there were no rules " -- and an innate mistrust of the political side of @entity41
he says it could be to do with being abused by his father as a child
" you look at some other guy who 's making movies and they 're calling him a movie star or whatever and the guy ca n't , he ca n't carry your jockstrap
" because of my temperament and my upbringing i took it real personal and short - circuited
" whatever it was , @entity3 gave up acting and took up professional boxing for four years in the early 1990s and , it seems he was able to fully indulge his self - destructive streak
by the time doctors told him he must stop boxing , he was suffering from memory loss , poor balance and needed extensive plastic surgery to reconstruct his battered face
of course , @entity3 's scandals and problems would n't be half as interesting if it was n't for his prodigious talent
he was one of the last actors to train with the legendary @entity172 at the actor 's studio in @entity175 with @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 and @entity179
early roles had some comparing him to @entity181 and @entity177
he says he has spent the last 13 years going to therapy to deal with his issues -- not a natural place for an " old school guy
" " for me it would be easier to talk to a priest than a therapist , " he explains , " i was afraid that if i changed i would n't be a man
" but , he says he persevered and straightened out " some issues from my childhood
" he says he is now a changed man and is being welcomed back into the bosom of @entity41 : he is reprising his role as " @entity195 " in " @entity196 2 , " is lined up for a role in @entity199 's " @entity198 " and is in talks to play a villain in the upcoming blockbuster " @entity203 " -- his first major studio film since resurrecting his career
he 's still a bit edgy , though
even after all the years of therapy
he recently sparked up one of his beloved @entity209 during an interview and , then , of course , he called @entity212 a " homophobe , " as reported in the @entity213
does he ever worry he might throw it all away again ? " i 'll never lose it all again , " he says , " it was too much hard work to get it back and too lonely and too dark
" i 've worked too hard for it
it would be too hard to take
