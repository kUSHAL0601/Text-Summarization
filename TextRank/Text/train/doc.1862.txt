-- @entity1 and @entity2 could n't agree more on one thing : something has to be done about the pervasive gun culture in the @entity6
and that problem , @entity1 said , becomes even more of an issue when you pair it with the culture of the @entity12 , which has seen its share of tragic events , including the recent @entity16 murder - suicide
@entity17 sportscaster @entity1 sat down with @entity0 's @entity2 on monday night to discuss the growing debate over gun control
both have faced criticism after taking on the issue -- costas during a recent halftime show of a " @entity27 " game and @entity2 on @entity26
@entity1 said the issue is a growing one , especially for @entity12 players , many of whom reportedly say they carry a weapon for security or some of whom have been arrested
so does @entity1 think that @entity16 's suicide after killing the mother of his child means the league is at a breaking point ? " i do n't know if it approaches crisis ; perhaps it does , but it 's at a crossroads because there 's an issue about the fundamental nature of the game
it 's so popular and so profitable , but it takes a tremendous toll on many of those who play it
not just body , but as we 're now learning , mind and emotions , " @entity1 said on " @entity56
" " and it 's a legitimate question to ask whether , for some players at least , the toll that the game takes , brain trauma , medications that they may take , enhance performance or deal with pain , all those things
the culture of the league increases the likelihood of abhorrent behavior
" @entity1 said regardless of what side of the gun debate you fall on , there is a simple rule that can not be debated
" it is infinitely more likely that something bad will happen if you 're armed than something good will happen , " he told @entity2
shortly before the taping of the @entity87 interview , a shooting occurred not far from the @entity0 headquarters in @entity89
it 's an example , @entity2 said , of how pervasive guns are and also how numb @entity6 have become to a dangerous issue
@entity1 said the real problem is the way guns have of escalating a situation
his case in point : @entity99 and @entity100
putting aside the facts of the case or race concerns , @entity1 asked one simple question
" what does common sense tell you about the likelihood of that confrontation ever taking place in the first place if @entity99 was not carrying a gun ? it is a comment you might not have expected months ago from @entity1
he said he never intended to create a pulpit of any kind but he felt he had to say something following @entity16 's suicide
should @entity1 have spoken out on @entity16 suicide ? and while critics argued a halftime show was n't the time or the place for the debate , @entity1 said he could n't remain quiet
the comments that followed mostly trashed @entity1 for speaking out
" it was n't my intent to become a spokesperson in any way for this issue , " @entity1 told @entity2
" but if no matter how imperfectly i may have done it a week ago sunday , if this has sparked a conversation and in some small way influenced people 's behavior , so much the better
" it was not lost on him that many people took him to task for only speaking out about guns
and on monday night , @entity1 addressed those critics
" @entity16 had eight guns
and for those who , by the way , say what if ( his girlfriend ) @entity147 had a gun ; there were guns in that house , " he said
" she 'd have to have it holstered like she 's @entity153 in the old @entity154 to have it at the ready when @entity16 came barging through the door
" but comments on @entity26 kept flying : what if it were a stabbing ? what if it were drunken driving ? or what about the situation with the @entity165 , with @entity166 being arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter after being in a crash that killed teammate @entity169 " it 's tough to tangentially link it to what happened with @entity16 , but obviously it 's a case of bad judgment , " @entity1 said
@entity1 recalled a story of former @entity177 coach @entity176 asking 80 players at training camp how many had guns and 65 raising their hands
" even if those guns were legally obtained , what do you think over time would be the ratio between unintended and tragic consequences , including accidents , but also including times when people just snapped and impulse got in the way , anger got in the way ? " @entity1 said
" the ratio of that as against the times that the gun would be used for a good outcome for legitimate self - defense
it 's common sense to see where that 's going to wind up
" @entity2 said during his debates on @entity26 he had constantly been asked about the times that guns were helpful
but @entity2 said he found the pro-gun lobbyist debate to be harmful for the country
" a certain type of pro-gun lobbyist twists , i believe , this debate , in a very unhealthy way , " @entity2 said
" they always say it 's never the gun , it 's always the person , with a clear indication that the people are evil and they perpetrate evil with guns
" opinion : give gun owners what they want @entity2 rattled off three tragic stories in a four - day period : " december 5 , a 4 - year - old boy accidentally shot and killed his younger brother in @entity226 with his father 's handgun in the home
december 6 , a 7 - year - old finds his grandfather 's gun -- this is in @entity234 -- and shoots his sister , " @entity2 said
" december 9 , a 7 - year - old boy ( is ) shot dead when his father 's handgun went off in a parking lot of a @entity241 gun store
" @entity1 said those are exactly the circumstances he thinks we need to try and avoid
he noted there are many instances of legitimate self - defense
but in his opinion , they do n't outweigh " how many bad things happen because of an attitude toward guns in this country
" " that 's what i was trying to get at on that sunday night
and my mistake was , and i 've acknowledged this , normally , we have about 2Â½ minutes
here we had only 90 seconds , " @entity1 said
" i alluded in a general way to the culture of football but did n't have time to enumerate it
but those who think that i was reluctant to hold the @entity12 to account are not familiar with my work
because almost alone among network sports broadcasters , i have made many points about the culture of the @entity12 , asked many questions of ( @entity12 commissioner ) @entity272 and @entity12 officials , and continue to -- plan to do so in the future
" are drugs involved , alcohol involved ? yes , all those things
but guns are among them
it seems that some people want it to be about everything and anything but guns
i do n't think it 's only about guns , but i think that guns , even if legally obtained , people 's attitudes toward guns are definitely a part of this problem
" opinion : manhood , football and suicide @entity1 said he understands why many people feel the need to have a gun , whether it is for safety in their home or elsewhere
" over the course of a year , how often do you think that would lead to tragedy and how often do you think it would lead to safety ? that 's my question
