@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's military spokesman says more than 400 members of security forces have been killed in the months - long unrest that has taken hold in the country , a charge that came as videos surfaced allegedly showing children killed in the violence
in an interview with @entity2 in @entity0 , maj. gen. @entity13 said that 1,300 security personnel also were wounded , and that 300 soldiers , 60 security officials and 50 police died in the violence
he also has said 700 people , whom he described as terrorists , and their families had fled @entity1 authorities for @entity23
@entity13 offered no details about the killings of the security forces other than to blame the deaths on armed gangs
@entity2 can not independently verify the claim
president @entity30 has faced growing criticism from leaders in the @entity33 , @entity34 and elsewhere over his government 's violent clampdown on demonstrators
@entity39 has repeatedly blamed " armed gangs " in explaining its military crackdowns , which have pushed thousands of @entity1 to flee to @entity23
security sources in @entity44 told @entity2 that about 1,000 @entity1 have crossed into @entity44 near the town of @entity46
months of protests have left more than 1,100 dead , according to human rights activists
but the extent of the carnage is not clear
about 10,000 people have been jailed since mid-march when the protests began , said @entity53 , head of the @entity55 - based @entity54
@entity2 can not independently verify the claims of the activist or the human rights group
@entity13 's claim came as two videos surfaced on @entity61 purporting to show a 13 - year - old boy killed friday in @entity63 , a suburb of @entity0
in the video , a hand is seen turning the head of the boy to reveal what appears to be a surgical scar
the boy 's mother is also seen in the video moaning and cursing @entity30 and his security forces
a voice on the video identifies the boy as @entity75
in another video , mourners are seen at a funeral for two children and a man who were said to have been killed in a @entity0 suburb
mourners can be heard chanting : " patience oh @entity30 , patience , we will dig your grave
" while the videos appeared to be from @entity1 , @entity2 was not able to independently verify their authenticity
the network 's reporters had been barred until recently from officially entering @entity1 , and its reporting about events inside the country had been limited largely to what the network was able to piece together based on official government reports , witnesses in the country and accounts and videos posted on the @entity100
meanwhile , @entity1 state tv reported that some of the thousands who fled to @entity23 to escape a military offensive have begun to return to their homes
about 730 people returned to the town of @entity108 , the state - run @entity109 ( @entity109 ) reported
but more than 11,400 @entity1 are still in @entity23 , the @entity23 government said sunday
@entity109 said some residents returned to find electricity , water and phone lines ransacked by armed groups
but opposition activists countered @entity109 's report , saying about 500 people were detained in neighboring villages and sent to @entity108 ahead of the media 's arrival
@entity123 , a @entity1 activist who lives on the other side of the border in @entity23 , said he saw an interview with an alleged shop owner of a store in @entity108 but " everyone knows that is not actually the man that owns the store
" @entity134 , another activist who lives on the @entity23 side of the border , said about 300 to 400 @entity1 returned to @entity108 because conditions in the refugee camps in @entity23 were unbearable
@entity134 said residents who were returning to @entity108 were reporting arrests and killings by security forces
both activists said they had received reports from residents who said @entity1 security forces had entered two towns , @entity147 and @entity148
@entity134 said residents were reporting that @entity1 forces were firing indiscriminately
@entity13 , the military spokesman , told @entity2 the military did enter @entity152 but there was no evidence of violence , arrests or casualties
he denied security forces entered @entity147
@entity2 can not independently verify the claims of the activists or @entity13
@entity2 's @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .
