-- two @entity2 levees broke monday along the swollen @entity2 near the @entity4 - @entity2 border , a local official and the @entity6 said
the first breach , which was some 300 feet wide and growing , was a " full breach , " the @entity6 said in a statement
the break was in @entity10 , @entity2 , just south of @entity11 , @entity4 , it said
the @entity12 warned that flooding could affect @entity14 and the town of @entity11
" the concern is that anybody ... near the river would see some floodwaters that could impact either their road or homes , " said @entity16 with the @entity12 in @entity17 , @entity18
the second breach was located just south of @entity10 , in @entity27 , @entity2 , said @entity27 clerk @entity28
she said flooding was affecting farmland
a breach earlier this month prompted the evacuation of hundreds of people in the @entity11 area as a precaution
no evacuations were immediately recommended or ordered as a result of monday 's breaches , officials said
however , " people 's safety is our number one concern , so we want to stress how important it is for the public to stay off these levees as we continue to assess the risk , " said @entity41 commander col. @entity40
the breach near @entity11 was deemed too substantial to repair , said @entity16
" the next step is to attempt to mitigate the flooding with another levee between the one that failed and @entity11
" state and local emergency management officials were notified , the corps said , and were working with the corps , the @entity12 and the @entity61
it was too early to determine the cause of the breach near @entity11 , the corps said
but it follows weeks of high flows and record releases from dams in @entity68 and the @entity69
heavy rains and snowpack runoff could result in near - record flooding along parts of the @entity2 this year , officials have said
this year 's flooding is putting levees to the test along much of the 1,700 miles of the @entity2
temporary levees are being built in several locations
@entity0 's @entity80 contributed to this report .
