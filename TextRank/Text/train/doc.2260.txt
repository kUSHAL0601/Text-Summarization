@entity0 -- @entity2 is a student at @entity3 , where her favorite class is music
the 13 - year - old loves the class
" it makes me feel good , " she said
and she says about her school life at @entity10 : " this place is good , i like it
i want to stay here
" but she may have to leave
@entity2 's family migrated to the @entity0 from the countryside for work , and @entity10 is a school for migrants
but the surrounding community , once filled with families like @entity2 's , is under pressure as the government began dismantling the neighborhood to make way for new development
the school , funded by migrant parents , may soon close
" the children of the rural migrants wo n't be able to continue to attend school in this area , " said human rights lawyer @entity27 , referring to the area where @entity2 's family lives
in @entity34 , families are registered as rural or urban
when rural migrants move to the cities they live in a twilight zone : they ca n't access healthcare , social security or even public education as part of the nation 's " hukou " system , which requires household registration
migrant workers still must be registered in their rural town of origin , not the city to which they move -- which keeps public services out of reach for many who have flocked to cities for work
" what makes this bad is that it violates the rights of migrants to live and work here , " @entity27 said
" secondly , and more importantly , it violates children 's rights to get compulsory education because when parents are forced to move back to their hometown
@entity0 has made urbanization a main goal for increasing domestic consumption and closing the wealth gap
hundreds of millions have moved to the cities from the countryside in search of jobs
last year , the urban population of the world 's most populous nation exceeded the rural population for the first time , according to the @entity81
but activists say that the government 's own policies are forcing these migrants out of cities and creating an underclass in @entity34
about 250 million people -- equivalent to about 80 % of the population of the @entity90 -- are migrant workers in @entity34
it 's the children of migrant workers , like @entity2 , who are often hardest hit
" they do n't have a lot of connections back home
their kids do n't speak much of local dialect , " @entity27 said
" the government is forcing these people to move elsewhere without understanding their difficulties
" but registration of children is tied to their parents , so children of migrant workers eventually will have to return to their parents ' home village to register and continue their education
@entity0 has pledged to reform the hukou system but is hampered because many social services are funded by local cities rather than the national government
" the government is trying
they 're definitely making efforts , they realize that this is a big problem , " @entity117 of the @entity118 said
" the problem is the finances of the health care scheme and education are all done at the local level , so i think it 's very difficult for the government at the national level to say , ' okay , let 's just reform the hukou system '
" the political cost of reforming the hukou system is onerous
" the mayors and party secretaries of many major cities are concerned that if hukou is freed up , there will be a huge fiscal burden in providing services for these migrants , " said @entity134 , senior associate of the @entity135 and former @entity137 director of @entity34
" if you ask the residents , the established residents of the major cities , they would say i do n't want more people coming , this may mean fewer job opportunities for us , " @entity134 added
" they also associate inflows of migrant workers in terms of crime , pollution or congestion
so this is going to be a political issue
and i think it is a political issue that requires very careful management , " he said
" @entity34 has been very successful in avoiding some of what i call ' the urban sprawls ' in places like @entity168 or @entity169 or even @entity170
in that sense , it 's going to be a new challenge for @entity34
" if reform is on the horizon , it may come too late for @entity2 's family , who is watching their neighborhood being torn down as her father recovers from heart disease
" i just hope that my father can get well as soon as possible and that we will be okay , " said @entity2 , breaking down in tears
@entity1 's @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .
