-- a warden and a security official have resigned their posts at an @entity9 state prison where three inmates escaped last month , a spokesman for the private company that runs the facility said sunday
unit warden @entity11 and an unidentified unit security chief resigned last week from @entity14 -- @entity15 , according to @entity16 , a spokesman for @entity17 the resignations come amid a nationwide search for the last of the three escaped inmates , @entity21 , and his alleged accomplice , @entity22
@entity21 , 45 , was serving a 15 - year sentence for attempted second - degree murder and other charges when he and fellow convicts @entity26 and @entity26 broke out of the prison july 30 , allegedly with @entity22 's help
@entity22 , who was on the visitation list for one of the inmates , threw cutting tools over a prison fence , according to @entity35 , director of @entity9 's @entity36
@entity35 has noted some " operational security problems " at the prison
" those are being evaluated and investigated as we speak , " he said earlier this month
@entity26 , 36 , was captured august 1 in a shootout with police in @entity43 , @entity44
he was serving 22 years for second - degree murder when he escaped
@entity46 , 42 , was rearrested monday in @entity47 , @entity48 , near @entity49 when authorities were notified by a local resident who sat and talked with @entity46 a day earlier on the steps of a church in town
he was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery
@entity26 remains in the @entity59 , @entity44 , @entity60 on charges of attempted first - degree murder and eluding police , the @entity58 said sunday
authorities are working to coordinate the transport of @entity46 back to @entity9 from @entity48 -- expected to occur within the next month , the marshals service said
meanwhile , the hunt for @entity21 and @entity22 continued in western @entity69 and along the border with @entity71 , the marshals service said
the last credible sighting of the pair occurred august 6 in @entity75 , @entity69 , the marshals service said
a reward of up to $ 35,000 is being offered for information that leads to their arrests
@entity21 is believed to have dyed his hair dark and grown a beard and @entity22 may have blonde hair
" all information indicates @entity21 and @entity22 are still traveling together and should be considered armed and extremely dangerous , " the marshals service said in a news release
" it is likely they are reacting , rather than taking deliberate action
as the manhunt protracts , it is highly possible they will become more desperate , creating increased danger to law enforcement and the general public
if they are encountered , call local law enforcement immediately
" @entity21 and @entity22 are also suspected in the killings of a couple whose bodies were found in their burned out camper earlier this month in @entity101 , according to authorities
authorities said they are likely driving a gray , gold or tan 1997 @entity104 , though both are experienced semitruck drivers known to have frequented truck stops , rest areas and campgrounds .
