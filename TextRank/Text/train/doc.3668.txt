explosions rocked the @entity2 capital early friday , hours before @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 meets with her @entity6 counterpart to raise pressure on the crisis in the @entity10 nation
@entity11 meets @entity6 foreign minister @entity12 in @entity13 amid their nations ' deep divisions over @entity2
their meeting is expected to include a discussion of @entity6 arm sales to the @entity2 regime
@entity11 will attend saturday 's emergency meeting in @entity22 , @entity23 , led by @entity24 , the @entity25 ' and @entity27 's special envoy for @entity2
@entity25 @entity28 ban ki - moon said he hopes the meeting marks a " turning point " in diplomatic efforts
the @entity4 has advocated a political transition plan in @entity2
@entity6 has opposed the idea that other countries dictate a political transition , insisting that it is a decision for the @entity2 themselves
but @entity12 said in @entity38 that a transitional period is " necessary for settling the @entity2 crisis and establishing stable and generally acceptable rules and norms , which will satisfy all the @entity2 groups
" as diplomats prepared for the weekend talks , violence continued thursday across @entity2
massive explosions shook the heart of @entity50 near the @entity51 , state - run media said
two blasts occurred in a parking lot thursday outside the @entity55 , which houses the ministry , @entity2 state tv said
the @entity57 said it occurred in the @entity59 neighborhood of central @entity50
at least three people were injured , and 20 cars were damaged , state tv said
the opposition @entity62 said more than 140 people , 46 of them government forces , died in violence thursday
the @entity57 put the number at 139 , but it counts only civilians and soldiers who defected
both opposition groups said many of the deaths occurred in @entity50 suburbs , mostly in the town of @entity74 , and in @entity75
@entity76 can not independently confirm the reports of casualties or violence because access by international journalists to @entity2 has been severely restricted
state media said an armed terrorist group assassinated a doctor and several members of her family in a @entity75 suburb
it said that " competent authorities " fought the group , killing 10 and injuring 20
on wednesday , bombers killed at least seven people in the headquarters of the @entity97 television station near @entity50 , the state - run @entity91 reported
three journalists and four security guards died , and the attackers ransacked and destroyed studios , the news outlet said
there has been a flurry of attacks in @entity2 's major cities of @entity50 and @entity107 in recent months , strikes that opposition groups have said the government has orchestrated to discredit anti-regime forces
president @entity112 's regime has blamed the attacks on terrorists
" terrorist operations of this nature could not be implemented without adequate financing and support in terms of providing money , weapons or persons or through media and political coverage , " @entity115 , @entity2 ambassador to the @entity25 , said thursday
after more than 15 months , unrest in the @entity128 nation shows no sign of abating
internationally , tension rose last week after @entity2 shot down a @entity133 jet , an act deplored by @entity135 and many @entity137 nations
the @entity22 meeting will bring together top diplomats of the five permanent members of the @entity141 -- @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity6 , the @entity144 and the @entity4 -- and @entity133
envoys from the @entity25 , the @entity146 and the @entity27 also were invited
the meeting of the group , dubbed the @entity149 for @entity2 , comes at a critical time for the country , which has been mired in an uprising since march 2011 that has pitted @entity112 's forces against rebels calling for his ouster
a peace plan hammered out by @entity24 fell apart this month after both sides -- the @entity2 government and the rebels -- accused the other of failing to abide by the terms to end the killing
@entity163 has not been invited to the meeting
the @entity4 was against @entity166 's presence despite @entity24 's and @entity6 's positions that @entity163 must be involved in helping forge peace in @entity2
@entity12 says @entity163 is an " influential player in this situation , " and it 's a " great mistake " to exclude that country
" it has been said publicly in @entity174 that the @entity4 is categorically against @entity163 's participation , " @entity12 said
" this is a manifestation of a double standard
when the @entity4 needed to settle some issues related to the security of their troops in @entity183 and @entity184 , they initiated contacts with @entity163 and agreed on something without any hesitations
" @entity24 also declined to invite @entity188 , which backs the opposition
@entity6 did not want @entity188 at the meeting
@entity6 has been under pressure to stop providing arms to the @entity2 regime
a shipment of refurbished @entity6 helicopters headed for @entity2 had to turn around and return to @entity6 after its @entity144 insurance company dropped coverage on the ship carrying the aircraft
@entity6 and @entity142 , permanent members of the @entity141 , have major trade deals with @entity2
both countries vetoed a @entity25 resolution calling for an end to the violence and a transition of power
