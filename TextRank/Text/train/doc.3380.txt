@entity0 -- several shots have been fired at the @entity5 building in @entity6 , the @entity2 said friday
it is the second time the @entity10 museum in @entity11 , @entity6 , has been fired on in recent days
the @entity12 and a vacant @entity13 in @entity6 also were shot at recently
all the previous shots came from the same weapon , authorities said
federal officials said they believe that the person taking the late - night shots at military - related buildings has a grievance against the institution of the @entity10 but not the men and women serving in the @entity10
the officials said at a news conference that they want to talk with the shooter
" we 'd like to know what this grievance is and what we can do to try to resolve it , " said @entity28 , assistant director of the @entity2 's @entity0 field office
the latest incident occurred thursday night , said @entity35 , spokeswoman at the @entity5
no one was in the building at the time , she said
new bullet holes were found in the glass and metal structure of the building but not inside , @entity38 said
the new damage was found during a routine inspection , officials said
the bullet holes were on the western side of the building , which faces @entity46 , the @entity2 said
the shots probably came from the interstate , said maj. @entity49 of the @entity50 , @entity6 , police department
the museum was closed friday morning while the investigation continued , @entity38 said
it will remain closed for the rest of the day , she said
there were no plans friday to cancel or postpone sunday 's @entity60 or any events connected with it , race spokeswoman @entity57 said
additional security measures have been taken , however , to bolster an " already robust plan " for security at the marathon , col. @entity62 , the commander of @entity63 , said friday .
