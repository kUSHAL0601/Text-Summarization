-- triathlon has a reputation for being expensive
in fact , the perceived costs are enough to stop some prospective participants from taking up the challenge
there 's no doubt that triathlons are harder on the bank balance than other sports , such as running , soccer , baseball or swimming
but believe me when i say that you do n't need to max out your credit card to do triathlon , to enjoy triathlon and even to succeed in triathlon
in 2007 , i raced my first @entity21 on a road bike ( not the normal @entity24 bike used for @entity21 racing ) with regular wheels
i borrowed my friend 's race kit , and wore a $ 20 pair of sunglasses i bought from a gas station in @entity32 three years prior to the race
the most important investment you can make is in the form of hard work , drive and determination
the most important piece of equipment you can have is a huge heart
the most important weapon in triathlon is your mind
10 ways to act like a champion having said that , it 's hard to compete in a bike ride without a bike
and race directors are not overly keen on your swimming , biking or running in your birthday suit
so here are a few items that every triathlete , budding or otherwise , needs to be able to train and race in this amazing sport : goggles : leaky , ill - fitting goggles can cause panic and discomfort
if possible , try goggles on before you buy them
they should stay on your face , even without the strap
your eyelashes should n't touch the lenses , and the nose piece should n't cut you like a knife
slightly tinted goggles are best , as they are suitable for both cloudy and sunny conditions
wetsuit : wetsuits are mandatory in some races
they help keep you warm and also provide buoyancy
ideally , your wetsuit should be swim / triathlon specific , rather than a surf wetsuit
you do n't need to spend a fortune -- some companies offer one - off , monthly or even season rentals
just make sure you swim in the wetsuit before race day and learn how to get it on and off properly
it needs to be snug , but not too tight or restrictive
@entity93 : these are usually provided by race organizers , but a spare is useful for training and for doubling up if the water is cold
bike : you need one , but what kind ? bikes can be few hundred dollars or as much as the price of a car
if you 're just starting triathlon and only planning on doing one or two local events , you can use a beach cruiser , shopper or mountain bike
but if you are thinking of doing more , it 's probably best to buy a road bike -- which you can train , race and even commute on
secondhand bikes can be a great value , but it 's your responsibility to make sure your bike is roadworthy
getting a personal " bike - fit " from a bike shop is worthwhile
race day tips from an @entity21 champ shoes : whether you use regular or so - called clipless pedals ( a bit of a misnomer , as you actually clip into them ) will depend on your cycling experience and confidence
your choice of pedal determines what shoes you wear
cleated shoes ( these lock onto the pedals ) are definitely not essential for those new to cycling
with flat pedals you can use the same shoes for cycling and running
buy a sturdy running shoe that you can trust that suits your form / biomechanics ( a good running shop can help with this )
helmet : of course , helmets are a must , but it does n't have to be the all - song - and - dance " aero " kind
a regular brain bucket will protect your head fine ; just make sure it has passed the necessary safety tests
race suit : you could wear a pair of shorts and a t - shirt under your wetsuit and keep them on until the finish line
but while not essential , opting for a tri suit in a race enables you to wear the same outfit from start to finish
there are basically two options , a single - piece tri suit , or a two - piece shorts and singlet
tri training : taking to open water there are lots of other items that are useful , but not essential , and it 's easy to spend far more than you need to succeed
start with the gear listed here , and then make sure you can use it
once you fall in love with the sport , and if your wallet can handle the pressure , you may want to add some optional extras or upgrade what you have
but remember , it 's not all about the gear
it 's about the idea , the plan , the ambition ...
