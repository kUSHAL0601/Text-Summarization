-- with president @entity3 's approval rating hovering in the low to mid- 40s -- it was 45 % in @entity0 / @entity6 's recent poll -- democrats in tough contests are largely keeping their distance from the president 's tarnished reputation
and as @entity13 has drawn closer , those differences have become more pronounced
@entity15 opponents are trying harder than ever to link their rivals to the president , forcing @entity7 to visibly distinguish themselves from the @entity18
here are seven @entity7 candidates who 've kept @entity3 on the sidelines : 1
as the @entity23 challenging the @entity24 's top @entity15 in a state that voted for @entity26 two years ago , @entity21 has been perhaps the most high - profile candidate to keep her distance from @entity3
most notably , she refuses to say whether she voted for the president , citing a matter of principle of privacy at the ballot box as her reason for not answering the question
she 's been pressed about her support for the president because she 's made a blatant attempt to paint herself as the @entity7 antithesis to the commander in chief
" i 'm not @entity3 , " she said in a campaign ad
" i disagree with him on guns , coal and the @entity43
only 41 % of @entity45 voters sided with @entity3 in 2012 , so @entity44 knows all too well that it 's not a smart strategy to be a champion for the president
in fact , he likes to think of himself more as a " thorn
" " i 'll be a thorn in his [ posterior ] , " @entity44 told the @entity53
" there 's times when i 'm a total thorn , you know , and he does n't appreciate it
" last week he admitted he voted for @entity3 but argued that his voting record was irrelevant because " the president 's not relevant " and will be " gone in two years
" a limited role for @entity3 in his final campaign and earlier this year he told @entity0 that he does n't need @entity3 to campaign for him in @entity45
" i need him to change some of his policies
" regardless of how big of a thorn he is , @entity44 has a tough hill to climb to win a second term
he barely squeaked out a win in 2008 over then - longtime sen. @entity70 , who at the time was buried in an ethics scandal
and a @entity0 / @entity6 poll from early october had @entity73 leading @entity44 , 50 % to 44 %
@entity75 was expected to have a smooth ride to re-election until @entity79 rep. @entity79 entered the race in march
@entity3 attended a @entity7 fundraiser in @entity82 this summer , with half of the money raised going to @entity75 's campaign
but the senator was n't there
his staff chalked up the absence to last - minute votes and legislative activity
the episode was foreshadowed somewhat when @entity75 refused to answer questions from @entity0 's @entity94 earlier this year over whether he 'd want to campaign with @entity3
in another example , @entity75 tried to take a stake out a firm line on airstrikes against @entity99 , saying in september he wo n't give " this president -- or any other president -- a blank check to begin another land war in @entity104
@entity105 is running for a second term in a state that voted for @entity3 in 2008 but not in 2012
as a result , she 's had to strike a balance between appealing to the pro-obama factions in her state -- mostly concentrated in the college hubs and big cities -- and the more rural parts of @entity106
@entity24 math seems impossible to some democrats she exhibited this fine line in august , when she publicly criticized the president over the @entity122 scandal in remarks released ahead of her speech at the @entity126
but when he showed up to also speak at the event , she warmly greeted him at the airport
last week she reluctantly admitted that the president has n't shown strong leadership
and when he visited @entity106 in january , she avoided him entirely
@entity133 has tried to paint herself as someone willing to go toe - to - toe with the @entity3 administration , especially when it comes to energy policy
she uses her position as chairman of the @entity141 as a major selling point in her campaign , and has sided with @entity15 in pushing for the approval of the @entity145
in an ad , she 's seen saying " the administration 's policies are simply wrong when it comes to oil and gas production in this nation
" last year @entity133 declined to attend a visit by @entity3 to her state , though she still hitched a ride aboard @entity155 with the president on his way to @entity134
@entity158 's @entity15 challenger , @entity160 , ca n't say one sentence without highlighting that @entity158 with @entity3 voted 99 % of the time
@entity158 says she 's proud of her record , but she 's still not angling for a visit by the president
asked whether she would want him to campaign for her , @entity158 said " we have a lot going on
" " i do n't think it makes sense for the president to come to @entity159 , " she continued , while answering the question at the @entity0 / @entity176 debate last week
but she 's happily welcomed former president @entity177 , and @entity178 is set to visit this weekend
fighting to keep his seat against @entity15 challenger rep. @entity182 , @entity179 has also sought to strike a balance between the politics of his state and on the national level
for example , he backs a minimum wage hike that 's on the ballot in @entity180 , but he opposes @entity3 's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10
like other vulnerable @entity24 candidates -- such as @entity158 , @entity75 and @entity105 -- @entity179 has also called for travel restrictions to help prevent @entity194 from spreading to the @entity195 , a policy the @entity3 administration has not pushed
@entity179 made headlines earlier this month when he sounded unsure of how to answer a question about @entity3 's handling of the @entity194 situation .
