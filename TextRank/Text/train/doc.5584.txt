@entity0 -- the @entity3 government could embrace @entity5 winner @entity4 with pride and respect " with a little twist of the mind , " actor and activist @entity8 told a small group of activists at a @entity12 rally in honor of @entity4 , who has been imprisoned by @entity14
the rally took place in @entity18 , named for another @entity5 winner who was involved in the formation of the @entity0
standing beneath a portrait of @entity4 behind symbolic @entity23 bars , @entity8 read an excerpt from the jailed dissident 's final statement , " i have no enemies , " issued two days before he was sentenced to an 11 - year prison sentence on december 25 , 2009
" i hope to transcend my personal experiences as i look upon our nation 's development and social change , " @entity8 read
" and to counter the regime 's hostility with utmost goodwill , and to dispel hatred with love
" @entity8 was invited to remove the first prison bar from the hanging banner of @entity4
he joined a group of nongovernmental organization representatives in removing the remaining bars from the banner , created by artists @entity45 and @entity47
descending the park steps , @entity8 said that @entity4 , alone in jail , is " more courageous than organizations like the @entity0 or the president of the @entity52
" in the bitter cold outside @entity0 headquarters , @entity8 called for a moment of silence to reflect on @entity4 's achievements and on his imprisonment
" it 's funny , " @entity8 said
" it just got a little warmer thinking about those things : @entity4 , freedom and compassion
" during the @entity65 ceremony in @entity66 , @entity67 , earlier in the day , @entity4 's prize was placed on an empty chair , symbolizing the winner 's absence
@entity8 called the empty chair " an extremely eloquent symbol
" @entity4 is the first winner in 75 years who was unable to accept the @entity5 medal , diploma and accompanying $ 1.5 million check
the last time a winner did not travel to @entity66 was in 1935 , when @entity78 , a @entity79 journalist and pacifist , was barred from accepting the award and attending the ceremony
@entity78 was imprisoned in a concentration camp and suffering from tuberculosis
the @entity85 decreed publicly that he could travel to @entity67 for the prize , but he was never issued a passport
the government barred the press from mentioning @entity78 's prize and decreed that no @entity79 could accept any @entity65 .
