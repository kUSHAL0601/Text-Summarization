-- @entity1 will meet arch - rival @entity2 in the semifinal of the @entity5 after @entity6 fired the @entity7 past @entity8
the @entity9 international scored his 40th goal of the season as @entity1 claimed a 4 - 2 win to prevail 6 - 4 on aggregate and set up two more ' @entity15 ' games
it will give @entity1 , which is top of @entity18 , the opportunity to avenge its defeat by @entity22 's men in the 2010 final
@entity6 and @entity24 ensure honors shared in 222nd @entity15 with @entity2 trailing @entity1 by 15 points in the league , @entity22 will be desperate to regain the trophy which @entity29 lifted in his final game in charge at the @entity33 last season
but if the current @entity36 champions are to triumph , they will have to stop @entity6 and his accomplices , who continue to prosper despite the absence of coach @entity39
@entity39 , who is undergoing treatment for cancer , left deputy @entity42 in charge , but it made little difference as @entity1 continued its hot streak
@entity1 have now scored 100 goals in its 34 goals this season
it is the fourth year in succession that @entity6 has reached the 40 - goal mark , while his late header also made it 23 goals in his past 15 starts
with the tie level at 2 - 2 going into the second leg , @entity1 made the perfect start when @entity60 headed home after just eight minutes
@entity6 leads @entity1 to new record but @entity8 fought back and @entity63 equalized four minutes later with a neat finish following wonderful interplay
although far from its fluent best , @entity1 picked up in the second half and @entity67 netted four minutes after the interval only for @entity69 to pull @entity8 level once again
but @entity1 continued to look threatening and a wonderful flowing move ended with @entity72 threading the ball through for @entity74 to stroke home
there was still time for @entity6 's customary goal , running through the middle to head home @entity81 ' cross from close - range and kill off any hopes of a @entity8 comeback
more than a game : austerity gives @entity15 new twist in the night 's other game , @entity88 booked its place in the last four with a 1 - 1 draw at @entity92 to progress 3 - 1 on aggregate
@entity94 put @entity88 ahead on the stroke of halftime with @entity97 scoring from the penalty spot late on
@entity88 will now face @entity99 in the semifinal
@entity102 forward @entity101 opens talks with @entity104 meanwhile , @entity106 champion @entity104 confirmed the signing of @entity109 forward @entity101
