@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's response to a scathing @entity5 report alleging war crimes and human rights violations has reached the president 's desk
president @entity10 received the 400 - page document on sunday night
the response , compiled by the @entity13 , will be presented to @entity14 , though @entity10 did not say when
at their president 's urging , @entity1 took to the streets in may to rail against the @entity5 report , which cites " credible allegations " that crimes were committed by both sides during the final stages of the country 's civil war
a three - member @entity5 panel recommended that @entity1 immediately conduct an investigation into the alleged violations of international law
human rights groups have already alleged both government troops and @entity34 rebels violated humanitarian laws and that thousands of civilians were killed during the war , which ended in may 2009 after the government declared victory
the rebels had fought a 26 - year bloody separatist war that left thousands dead and large numbers of others internally displaced , according to the @entity5
the @entity5 report concluded there were " credible allegations , which , if proven , indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international humanitarian rights law was committed both by the government of @entity1 and the @entity34 ( rebels ) , some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity
" in the war 's final stage , which lasted from september 2008 to may 2009 , the @entity1 army advanced into an area of northern @entity1 known as the @entity60 , where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting
the report said the government used " large - scale and widespread shelling " that left many civilians dead
some of the shelling happened in no - fire zones where the government had encouraged civilians to congregate , the report said
government forces also shelled a @entity5 hub and food distribution lines and fired near @entity77 ships that were picking up the wounded , the report said
the government also shelled hospitals on the front lines , some of them repeatedly , the report said
" most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling , " the report said
a spokesman for @entity5 @entity90 ban ki - moon said @entity90 hopes the @entity5 report " will make a contribution to full accountability and justice so that the @entity1 government and people will be able to proceed towards national reconciliation and peace
