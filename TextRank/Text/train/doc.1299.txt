-- raise your hand if this has ever happened to you : you wake up bleary - eyed on a weekday morn , lazily scroll through your newsfeed or @entity7 feed or @entity9 reader or whatever medium you use to absorb small bits of inanity , and there it is -- an opinionated update on a season finale , new movie or hot book , filled with important plot points
@entity20 ! you 've been struck by a spoiler
times have changed since 76.3 million @entity23 tuned in to the disappointing series finale of " @entity25
" as one , they turned their gazes to their television sets , letting out a slow exhale as the final credits rolled
nowadays , fewer and fewer people are catching programs at their air time
in 2012 , 36 % more people watched tv on their smartphones than in 2011 , according to a report from @entity39
and @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and streaming services let us mold tv schedules into our own lives
which is all to say : you can not assume , just because you 've seen something , that everyone else has , you arrogant jerk
your friends should n't have to creep around with their fingers in their ears screeching , " do n't tell me ; i have n't seen it yet ! " if you simply must pontificate on a cultural reference point with surprises , twists or big reveals , bear the following in mind
simple : just put " @entity65 " at the beginning of the write - up
bonus points if you place the big plot - pivotal announcement after a jump ( on a blog ) or after a few hard enters on @entity73 ( so readers have to click " see more " to read the rest )
remember : hints are spoilers , too
if people want clues as to how the tale will end , they will ask
ninety - nine percent of the time , they 'll want to finish it unbiased , draw their own conclusions and then discuss
hot tip : saying anything to the effect of " there is a huge twist at @entity92 , but i 'm not going to tell you what it is " is indeed a spoiler , because the viewer / reader will now follow the entire tale expecting the unexpected
just keep your mouth shut until they 've finished , yes ? 3
favor exclusive discussions over blasted proclamations
all 483 of your @entity73 friends do not care what you thought of the moment in " girls " when we learn @entity111 is an illegal alien
( spoiler alert : @entity111 is not an illegal alien
) guess what ! you can even use social media to bring to you those who are equally eager to discuss @entity118 's untimely death
( spoiler alert : @entity118 is n't dead
) simply make your chat status something like " must begin discussing the end of ' brave ' posthaste
who 's seen it ? " and then squawk away without ruining anyone else 's experience
give it the three - year test
has the @entity129 made three or more trips around the sun since the book / movie / show / play had its day ? then all bets are off
those who still have n't seen " @entity135 " by now are unlikely to get around to it
ok , so your jerk friend just posted about the shocking moment in " @entity141 " when we realize the whole trilogy is the fever dream of a koala who watched his friends get taxidermied
( spoiler alert : oh , please
) take heart : research from @entity150 reports that spoilers actually enhance enjoyment
scientists found that students had more fun reading narratives when they knew the plot twist ahead of time than when they just learned it at the end , likely because it helped them pick up subtle clues along the way
( that 's the reason everyone saw " @entity164 " at least twice
) in case you have n't seen it , @entity166 ' character ... is a ghost himself ! you 're welcome ! hey , do n't blame us
that movie came out waaay more than three years ago .
