-- @entity1 was known to break out into song during his long - winding speeches , and fittingly , traditional @entity5 llanera music filled the space where his funeral was held
@entity1 , who died tuesday at age 58 , was a polarizing figure in his country
but his followers revered him , and his funeral friday in @entity13 reflected that status
there were 32 heads of state in attendance , and all of them were called , in groups of eight , to flank the @entity5 president 's casket and observe a moment of silence as honor guards
@entity5 standouts in the arts and sports likewise surrounded the deceased leader
@entity1 left behind a mixed legacy : he is credited with putting the nation 's poor at the center of his policies , but also had an authoritarian streak that garnered criticism from defenders of human rights and press freedom
the turnout of foreign leaders and thousands of mourners who waited hours for a chance to view @entity1 is a testament to the role he played in the country , the rev. @entity39 said
@entity5 vice president @entity47 , who will be sworn in as interim president later friday , laid a replica of the sword that @entity52 hero @entity51 used on top of @entity1 's flag - draped casket
tributes to @entity1 were also paid in @entity57 , where the military made a 21 - gun salute from the @entity60 overlooking @entity61
military officers placed roses in front of a picture of @entity1
@entity5 and @entity57 maintain close military ties , and @entity57 sent hundreds of military and intelligence advisers to aid @entity1 while he was president
@entity1 was known for his anti-american rhetoric and allied himself with others at odds with the @entity72
@entity74 president @entity73 attended and kissed @entity1 's casket
" he was a dear friend of all nations worldwide , " @entity73 had said upon his arrival in @entity5
" he was the emotional pillar for all the revolutionary and freedom - seeking people of the region and the world

@entity98 actor and @entity1 friend @entity97 was at the funeral , as was the rev. @entity101 , who offered a prayer
" @entity1 fed the hungry
he helped them realize their dreams , " @entity101 said
hero or villain ? the many ways to see @entity1 @entity47 , who @entity1 had named as his preferred successor before his death , gave a lengthy , impassioned speech that made him emotional at times
he addressed the view of @entity1 as an autocrat and inept leader who left @entity5 worse off than when he assumed power
" never has a man , here or anywhere , been lied about so much , " he said
@entity1 was a " true son of @entity121 " who taught the country love and forgiveness , @entity47 said
" that 's why today we say from our hearts , we forgive those who have defamed you
" @entity1 had asked @entity47 and other top leaders what they would do when he died , the vice president said
" he arranged it all for us , and now it is up to us whether we will carry it out or not , " he said
there was no burial after the funeral , because of an unexpected twist that @entity47 announced thursday
@entity1 will be embalmed " just like @entity142 ( and ) @entity143 " and laid to rest at a military museum where generations of @entity5 can visit
it is a reminder that @entity1 's image will not soon fade
" the body of our leader will be embalmed , and it will ... be surrounded by crystal glass forever , present forever , and always with his people , " he said on state - run tv
opinion : @entity1 was a maker of dreams @entity1 died after a long battle with cancer
thousands of his supporters lined the streets wednesday in a procession from the military hospital where he died to a military academy where @entity5 could view him
as president , @entity1 cultivated an image as a protector of the country 's marginalized , and his followers worshiped him with fervor
the turnout at the military academy to view @entity1 was so great that the viewing was extended for another seven days
opinion : @entity1 used force of personality to win votes @entity1 first announced his cancer diagnosis in june 2011 , but the government never revealed details about his prognosis or specified what kind of cancer he had
