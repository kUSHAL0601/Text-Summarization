-- on wednesday , the @entity2 @entity1 will review the @entity3 , a landmark legislation that cleared barriers to the ballot box for all @entity2 citizens
in @entity8 , the @entity1 will hear arguments on @entity10 -- the heart of the @entity3 -- that allows the federal government to block state election practices that are discriminatory
a predominantly white county in @entity15 , @entity8 , charges that the decision of @entity17 in 2006 to reauthorize @entity10 is unconstitutional
the case comes on the heels of a federal election last fall in which our nation witnessed the greatest assault on voting rights in more than a half century
drastic cuts to early voting hours , restrictive photo id laws , tens of thousands of registered voters being dropped from poll books due to illegitimate purges were only a few of the tactics used to keep people from voting
@entity36 , a 102 - year - old @entity37 resident who was invited to join first lady @entity38 at the recent @entity40 address , stood in line for more than three hours to cast a ballot
sadly , thousands of voters had to endure waiting times up to eight hours , prompting president @entity45 to call for the nation to " fix it
" new laws and policies are being considered on the state and federal level now that will make it harder to vote -- particularly for the elderly , the young and people of color
without the protections afforded by @entity10 of the @entity3 , many @entity2 would find voting even more difficult
@entity58 is the one day where we are all equal
@entity61 , brown or white , rich or poor , we all have an equal say in the ballot box
voting is the most fundamental pillar of a democracy and it is imperative that we keep elections free , fair and accessible to all
opinion : @entity3 and the @entity71 on trial as this important debate begins anew , here are five key misconceptions you need to know about the @entity3 and why it remains as relevant today as the day it was originally signed
section 5 unfairly punishes the @entity71 for its past this provision of the @entity3 requires jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices to get federal " pre-clearance " ( essentially , permission from the @entity85 ) before changing any voting procedure
this applies to not just @entity71 , but also to other states such as @entity89 , @entity90 , along with certain counties in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96
once a state has demonstrated that it can fairly run elections for a period of 10 years , it can be exempted from @entity10
in fact , every jurisdiction that has sought this " bailout " since 1982 has been approved
the jurisdictions that remain covered by @entity10 have not applied for bailouts
they are not being punished for their past , but held accountable for their present practices
the formula is outdated section 5 is not static , and dozens of jurisdictions have been added under the provision since it was first passed
in fact , section 5 was reconsidered and reauthorized by @entity17 in 1970 , 1975 , 1982 and 2006 based on extensive evidence of continuing discrimination
the @entity119 , @entity120 and other civil rights advocates have long pushed for expanding @entity10 's " pre-clearance " to include more states with voting problems , such as @entity124 and @entity125 , and more counties with records of egregious discrimination in voting
doing so , however , takes @entity17 action
so far , @entity133 's lawmakers have not demonstrated the political will
we should not revoke critical protections for fair voting simply because @entity17 has failed to act on expanding them
section 5 is no longer applicable the @entity3 was passed not only for the most extreme acts of intimidation , but also for the small changes , such as literacy tests and poll taxes , that made voting harder for people of color and poor whites
the last few years leading up to the 2012 elections saw the greatest efforts to pass restrictive voting laws since the @entity154 era , including limiting the type of @entity156 that people can use , and requiring additional proof of citizenship to register and vote , all of which disproportionately impact people of color and the working poor
these adjustments unfairly shift the goal line and demonstrate why @entity10 is still needed
section 2 is sufficient to ensuring fair voting procedures while section 2 of the law bans voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity , it is enforced only through lawsuits
when lawsuits are filed , the burden of proof rests with the challenger ( not the local or state government that has changed voting rules )
in contrast , @entity10 ensures that discrimination ca n't take hold by blocking problematic policies from going into effect in the first place
without these precautions , unfair voting policies would go unchecked , leaving disenfranchised voters to face harm later
the country reelected an @entity61 - @entity2 president , with a large share of support from black and @entity195 voters , so we no longer need their votes to be protected by @entity10 section 5 made a difference in the 2012 elections
it blocked restrictive photo id laws in @entity204 and @entity205 , and was used to reject a @entity204 redistricting plan that would undercut @entity195 voting power
and as the @entity2 @entity85 reviews @entity210 's photo id law , that measure is on hold
it is against this backdrop that the @entity1 will hear the challenge to @entity10 of the @entity3
losing this provision would signal a green light for even more partisan legislatures to manipulate election laws for political gains
at a time when voting rights are increasingly under attack , we should be expanding federal oversight of voting laws -- not scrapping the most effective civil rights legislation ever enacted
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 and @entity230 .
