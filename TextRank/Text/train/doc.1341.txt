the @entity0 arose out of frustrations experienced by the @entity6 human rights machinery in dealing with that country
the international community was confronted with many reports , both scholarly and reliable , and some informal , of grave human rights violations against the people of the @entity3 ( @entity3 )
in january 2013 , the @entity12 , @entity13 , called for a fully - fledged international inquiry into serious crimes said to have been taking place in @entity3 for decades
she stressed that the natural concern of the international community about the implications for peace and security of the reported possession by @entity3 of nuclear weapons should not overshadow the deplorable human rights situation in the country
but an immediate challenge was presented to the @entity1 by the non-cooperation with the human rights mandate - holders of @entity3
@entity3 impasse @entity3 stated publicly that it would " totally reject and disregard " the resolution establishing the @entity1
it claimed that this was " a product of political confrontation and conspiracy
" in this sense , @entity3 confronted the @entity6 human rights system with an impasse
it would not cooperate with @entity39 , a review of the human rights records of all @entity6 member states
it would not cooperate with the @entity12
it would not cooperate with the present special rapporteur or his predecessor
it would not cooperate with the @entity1
it wished to be left alone
but this was not acceptable because of the substantial and believable testimony and other information demonstrating grave crimes against humanity and other human rights violations on the part of @entity3 , a member country of the @entity6
in this particular case , the @entity1 had access to satellite images which were available to it
those images , addressed to the vicinity of the towns described by the witnesses , strongly confirmed the existence of large facilities , whose layout and appearance conformed to the descriptions given by witnesses before the @entity1
crimes against humanity like documentary interviews of @entity72 survivors , now commonly available in museums created following the @entity75 genocides , witness testimony given to the @entity1 on @entity3 was presented in a low key , matter of fact , generally logical , unemotional and chronological manner
based upon the testimony and information received , the @entity1 found that @entity3 authorities had committed , and were continuing to commit , crimes against humanity in political prison camps ; in the ordinary prison system ; by targeting religious believers ; by imposing starvation on large sections of the population ; and by targeting persons , including persons from other countries , and through the course of state sponsored abductions and disappearances
the presentation of the @entity1 report to the @entity6 created a sensation
no report of a coi of the @entity102 had been so effective , i believe , in drawing attention to victims and to such a broad range of wrongs perpetrated against the civilian population of a member state of the @entity6 to such a shocking degree over such a long period of time
unlike earlier totalitarian states and oppressive conduct , the world can not now lament , " if only we had known ... " now , the world does know
and the question is whether the world will respond effectively and take the necessary action
failures with @entity3 it was frequently said that the greatest danger to human rights in the case of @entity3 was its possession of a reported 20 nuclear armed warheads and its current development of an arsenal of missile delivery systems that could threaten its neighbors and the global community
in these circumstances , was there a danger that the injection ( including into the @entity135 ) of " contestable questions " of human rights , would simply divert attention from the highest security priority that the world faced ? the strategy of non-criticism , attempted friendliness and deference was singularly unsuccessful in securing either the goal of peace , national reunification or human rights compliance
for example , the meetings in @entity150 in september 2002 with @entity152 's prime minister at the time , @entity151 , and in september 2000 with then - president @entity153 of @entity154 , were not long - term substantive successes
in the case of the @entity152 prime minister , a tiny number of abductees were returned with an acknowledgment of a state policy of abductions by the @entity3 that was said to have been abandoned
however , when the bones of some of the @entity152 abductees , said to have died in @entity3 , were returned to @entity152 , they were found to have no dna match to the families of the abductees
in some cases they were probably animal bones -- an affront to @entity152 and to the abductees ' families
negotiations with @entity154 actually coincided with the clandestine development of nuclear weapons at the very time of the promotion of the " @entity179 " by president @entity153
whilst such strategies are sometimes rewarded by minor concessions , objectively such measures can only be assessed as " crumbs " when measured against the violations and international crimes reported by the @entity1
action from @entity188 and @entity135 ? what is the bottom line ? the charter of the @entity6 gives the five permanent members of the @entity135 a veto that can prevent the passage of resolutions on substantive matters , which the proposed referral of @entity3 to the @entity188 would undoubtedly be
the @entity198 has links of tradition , sentiment and history with @entity3 dating to @entity204 times
@entity205 has political links and substantial trade and is now the principal economic supporter of @entity3
how in these circumstances can the @entity1 seriously expect any real action to the taken by the @entity135 ? in the end , a veto might indeed prevent action being taken upon some of the central recommendations of the @entity216
however , the @entity198 now has few economic or other contacts with @entity3
@entity205 must itself be deeply concerned , not only by the development of nuclear weapons on its doorstep but also by the dangers of an exodus of civilian populations seeking refuge in the neighboring areas of @entity205
the execution of @entity230 , the uncle by marriage of the @entity232 of @entity3 in december 2013 , reportedly an advocate of the " @entity205 path " for @entity3 , must also be a source of concern for @entity205
both @entity198 and @entity205 have agreed to the adoption of resolutions on the nuclear weapons program in @entity3 , and to the close monitoring of the sanctions imposed by the @entity135 on @entity3
no guarantees the @entity1 can not , of course , guarantee the adoption of a new @entity135 resolution on human rights in @entity3
still less can it ensure one that refers the case of @entity3 to the @entity188
but that would be the correct , principled step for the @entity6 system to take , based on the @entity1 report
it would put human rights up front
it would assure accountability for crimes against humanity
it would vindicate the international rule of law
it would fulfill the " responsibility to protect " human rights , agreed by the @entity258 unanimously in 2005 as a duty of the international community where a given country fails to protect the human rights of its nationals
that , assuredly , is the case in @entity3 today
the world has therefore reached a moment of truth over @entity3
the international community and people everywhere will be watching closely the @entity6 ' consideration of the @entity1 report
i am hopeful that the outcome will be positive
the human rights of the people of @entity3 demand it
the peace and security of the @entity278 and its region require it .
