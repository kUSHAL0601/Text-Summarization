@entity0 -- exports of @entity4 @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity6 could get more expensive in @entity7 if a tit - for - tat tariff war bubbles over between the world 's most populous country and the @entity11
on wednesday , @entity12 launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes into imports of @entity18 wine
the inquiry follows new @entity11 tariffs , only announced tuesday , of nearly 12 % on @entity7 - made solar panels that begin june 6
the @entity22 has accused @entity7 's state - subsidized panel makers of flooding @entity18 markets with unfairly cheap products
in a public statement , @entity7 's @entity26 said it had " received requests from domestic wine companies , accusing @entity18 wine companies of entering the @entity7 market by dumping products , receiving subsidies and other unfair measures
based on these requests , the @entity26 will initiate a serious investigation according to laws and regulations
" " this is what we call ' strategic play ' in game theory
it is an action which is intended to have benefits in negotiation , " says dr. @entity41 , professor of economics and finance at the @entity43 , or @entity43 , in @entity44
@entity7 is smart to pick on @entity18 's wine industry , adds @entity41 , because it is " not core to @entity18 's economy " yet " symbolic enough " that it will have an " immediate impact " on people 's hearts and minds
if a tariff war ensued , " it would be very damaging for @entity4 , " says @entity55 , managing director of @entity56 , one of @entity7 's biggest importers of foreign wine
@entity4 is @entity7 's number one exporter of wines
in 2012 , the country shipped more than 700,000 bottles to @entity7 , more than four times the volume of second - ranked @entity68 , according to the @entity69
yet @entity55 believes a tariff war -- if kept brief -- may actually help the bottom lines of @entity7 's foreign wine importers in the longer term
from 2002 to 2012 , @entity7 's total imports of foreign bottled wine rocketed nearly 15,000 % to more than 1.3 million bottles
but from 2011 to 2012 , growth trickled to an anemic 8 %
" there has been a lot of enthusiastic buying that needs to be depleted , " says @entity55
" there is excellent inventory to last a short trade war
i 'm not as alarmed as i think i should be
" while a quick tariff war might encourage @entity7 consumers to drink their imported wine stocks -- and replenish their supplies -- a longer tariff war would have a more ambiguous impact , with potential winners and losers both in @entity7 and around the world
" new world wines are waiting for this opportunity , " says @entity55
" @entity68 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 are well positioned
" both @entity96 and @entity100 recently implemented bilateral trade agreements with @entity7 that lowered duties on wine imports to zero percent , he adds
" i do n't think it 's a good thing for us , " says @entity104 , president of @entity105 , a well - known domestic @entity7 boutique label that aims to keep volumes at or below two million bottles each year
" yes , we are in competition with imported wine , but that imported wine helps educate consumers
if consumers are more highly educated then it 's better for us all
" @entity104 expects a tariff war would only lead to a short - term jump in sales and that big - name , high - volume @entity7 wine suppliers like @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 would benefit most
" if prices rise because of a tariff war , @entity7 's wine companies will have less reason to do better , " adds @entity104
" human beings are lazy
" looking ahead , early august is the deadline to a tariff resolution
in two months , the @entity11 tariff of 11.8 % on @entity7 solar panels will rise to an average of 47.6 %
if talks fail before then , the @entity11 will decide in december whether to impose duties on panels for a maximum of five years
" ideally it would be better for both sides to retreat from their current positions , " says @entity41 of @entity43
" i understand the @entity18 economy is not in good shape , so there is a lot of pressure from domestic lobbies for protection from other countries
" " in the end , both will yield some inches , " says @entity41
" there is no winner in a trade war
