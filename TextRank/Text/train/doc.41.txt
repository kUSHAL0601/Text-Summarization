-- for five turbulent years , " @entity7 " has charted the underworld rise and moral decline of @entity3 , the mild - mannered @entity4 chemistry teacher who evolves into a ruthless drug lord after being diagnosed with cancer
on sunday , august 11 , after 54 increasingly dark chapters of the fearless @entity11 drama , we begin @entity13 's final ride
it 's probably about time
it 's a testament to the power of " @entity7 " that it keeps you invested in its characters even after some of them do horrible things
but it 's not easy to watch a gentle family man -- the goofy dad from " @entity24 ! " -- morph into a megalomaniacal monster
and the show ca n't sustain @entity13 's high - wire act much longer without losing all plausibility
among @entity11 's marquee shows , " @entity7 " has never attained the retro - chic cachet of " @entity31 " or the big ratings of " @entity33
" but it 's won seven @entity34 -- mostly acting nods for star @entity36 and sidekick @entity37 -- and received widespread critical acclaim for its taut writing , vivid characters and inventive jolts of violence
8 ways to get your ' @entity7 ' fix in @entity4 like " @entity47 " before it , the show is about a middle - aged father of two whose seemingly mundane suburban existence -- wife , kids , swimming pool -- conceals toxic secrets
in both shows , @entity13 and @entity56 must grapple with family tensions while keeping a tenuous grip on their criminal empires
unlike @entity13 , however , @entity56 never developed the world 's most abominable mid-life crisis
one of the greatest strengths of " @entity7 " is how its plotlines pit characters -- @entity13 , wife @entity68 , meth - cook partner @entity69 , @entity71 agent brother - in - law @entity70 and assorted drug - world bad guys -- against each other in a complex , ever - shifting geometry of alliances and manipulations
how will these machinations play out in the show 's final act ? we 're about to find out
here are five questions " @entity7 " fans may be pondering as the show begins its last eight episodes ( spoiler alert : read no further if you 're not caught up )
what will @entity70 do now that he suspects @entity13 ? federal agent @entity89 has long been obsessed with nailing his near - mythical " @entity90 , " the shadowy figure supplying crystal meth to most of the @entity93
but he has no conclusive evidence against @entity13 , and his new chief suspect is married to the sister of @entity70 's wife , who will not be pleased to see her family torn apart
complicating things further : unbeknownst to @entity70 , @entity13 's drug money paid for @entity70 's medical care after he was seriously wounded by members of a @entity104 cartel
and it wo n't do wonders for @entity70 's career when people discover his elusive meth king was right under his nose all along
@entity70 's got to tread carefully here
what will become of @entity69 ? when we last saw @entity113 , he had grown weary of the bloody criminal lifestyle and had parted ways with @entity13
the street - smart , but emotionally fragile @entity69 has somehow managed to retain his humanity amid the horrors engulfing him , and many viewers are rooting for him to find a new life
will he reunite with ex-girlfriend @entity120 and her son @entity121 ? invest his drug money in a new venture ? uncover @entity13 's betrayals and seek vengeance ? either way , @entity69 would appear to deserve some redemption
whether he gets it -- " @entity7 " is rarely predictable -- is another question
how ' @entity7 ' should end , according to @entity36 can @entity68 keep it together ? oh , poor @entity68
she has witnessed her husband launch a secret life of crime without her knowledge , lie repeatedly , endanger her and their children and become a callous sociopath
she 's trapped in a horrific situation
no wonder she tried to drown herself in the backyard pool
but @entity68 is also shrewd and resourceful
she knows she 's become complicit in @entity13 's crimes , and that for the sake of her freedom and their kids she needs to keep his secret
unless , of course , she finds some brilliant way to extricate herself
what was up with that flash - forward scene of @entity13 in the diner ? this prologue scene at the start of @entity153 sure offers some tantalizing clues
it takes place almost a year in the future , on @entity13 's 52nd birthday
@entity13 has grown his hair back , although he coughs and pops some pills , suggesting his cancer may have returned
he is alone and seems paranoid , glancing about the diner anxiously before meeting his gun dealer and opening the trunk of a car to reveal a machine gun
why does he need a machine gun ? also , @entity13 shows the waitress a @entity170 driver 's license with his photo and a fake name on it
did he go underground and flee to @entity170 ? and if so , why did he come back to @entity173 ? the episode is named after @entity170 's state slogan -- " @entity176
read into that what you will
how will the series end ? in other words , will @entity13 die ? it would seem fitting , given how many other lives he 's cut short or ruined
a cancer relapse is possible , if not all that dramatic
prison would be an anticlimax , and seeing him and his family survive intact , " @entity47 " style , does n't seem realistic
there 's no shortage of people who might want to kill him : @entity69 is probably the leading candidate here , although @entity70 or even @entity68 could surprise us
do the machine gun and the " @entity195 " scene foreshadow a last - stand shootout ? will @entity13 finally sample his own product and die of a hugely ironic overdose ? fake his own death and sneak off quietly to @entity200 ? series creator @entity201 will likely opt for a climax that 's unexpected yet somehow makes sense
@entity201 told tv critics last month that " i think most folks are going to dig the ending
" let 's hope so
in eight more weeks , fans of " @entity7 " will finally know everything .
