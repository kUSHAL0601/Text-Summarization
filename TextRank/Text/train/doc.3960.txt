-- even as much of @entity2 struggles to recover from last year 's devastating earthquake , scientists have found some survivors who are coming back from the edge
hopping back from the edge , to be precise
an expedition by a conservation team searching for frogs in @entity2 's dwindling forests has turned up six species not seen by scientists in more than two decades
the species ranged from a tiny frog smaller than a coin , to a whistling frog named after @entity17 to a hard - to - track frog that has the ability to ' throw ' its voice like a ventriloquist to fool predators
" it was incredible " , said expedition leader @entity24 in a press release
" we went in looking for one missing species and found a treasure trove of others
that , to me , represents a welcome dose of resilience and hope for the people and wildlife of @entity2
" expedition sponsor @entity37 says that population pressures and environmental degradation have left the island nation with only a tiny percentage of its original pristine forests
" a common assumption about @entity2 is that there is nothing left to save " , said @entity24 , an amphibian conservation researcher who has been to the island three times
" that is not entirely true
there are biologically rich pockets intact , despite tremendous environmental pressures
@entity2 now has the opportunity to design their reconstruction plans around these pockets , and grow them , so they can more effectively act as natural buffers to climate change and natural disasters
" @entity24 spent just over a week in the southern @entity2 cloud forests , searching through the trees , creeks , and bushes for frogs and other amphibians
in the end , they were able to find examples of just over half of the 49 known frog species in @entity2
that gives them hope that there are more out there , and that part of the overall recovery for the nation needs to include conserving its natural habitats
" finding six lost species in these relatively small corners of the country tells us that , despite tremendous human pressures , nature is hanging on in @entity2 , " said @entity24
" there is reason to hope
managed properly , these species and ecosystems can become a source of natural wealth and national pride for the country , that we hope will offer long - term benefits for its people
