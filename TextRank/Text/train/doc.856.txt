-- with his city still trying to bounce back from the damage caused by @entity4 , mayor @entity1 said @entity5 must rebuild " smarter and stronger and more sustainably
" @entity1 told reporters @entity5 will prepare for natural disasters better by revising building codes , changing zoning requirements in some low - lying areas and making sure infrastructure can withstand a category 2 hurricane or a heat wave
" whether or not one storm is related to climate change or is not , we have to manage for risks , and we have to be able to better defend ourselves against extreme weather and natural disasters , " he said
@entity20 : cities key to beating climate change @entity1 said that @entity5 , which has more than 500 miles of shoreline , will consider building berms , dunes , jetties and levees to protect against surging seawater during bad storms
such a system could be expensive
improvements to the @entity33 ' flood protection system , which is 130 miles long and includes sea gates and flood walls , cost $ 14 billion
@entity5 does n't have unlimited funds , the mayor said
" we have to live in the real world and make tough decisions based on the costs and benefits of risk - avoidance investments , " he said
" saying we 're going to spend whatever it takes just is not realistic
" the mayor compared @entity47 @entity5 to the one that faced security challenges after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks
the city quickly built the largest counterterrorism operation of any city in the world , he said
drought - stressed trees face race to adapt the @entity58 of @entity5 will take the lead on drawing up " concrete recovery plans for the communities @entity4 hit hardest as well as a specific and comprehensive action plan to prepare our city for the climate risks we face , " @entity1 said

at the same time , he wants residents who rebuild to do so without being penalized if they build homes higher than current height restrictions

the city should replace copper wiring for phones with fiber optics , he said , and cell phone towers need to have more than eight hours of backup power

their report is due by the end of february , @entity1 said
" we may or may not see another storm like @entity4 in our lifetimes , but i do n't think it 's fair to say that we should leave it to our children to prepare for the possibility , " he said
@entity4 slammed ashore near @entity99 , @entity100 , on october 29 after forming in the @entity101 and sweeping northward , killing a total of 182 people from @entity104 to @entity105 .
