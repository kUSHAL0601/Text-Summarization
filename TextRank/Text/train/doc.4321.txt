a new survey about preferences and trends in @entity3 concludes that one out of every three @entity3 would migrate to the @entity5 if given the opportunity
the survey published tuesday by the @entity9 - based @entity8 also says that of the 34 % of @entity3 who indicated they would like to move to the @entity5 , 17 % " would do so without authorization , " meaning without legal documents
@entity14 , senior researcher at the @entity8 , says that attitude has changed little in the past five years
" it 's been relatively constant , " @entity14 said
" we first asked people about this in 2009 , and the percentage was 33 % , compared to 34 % this year
" on the other hand , the survey found that fewer @entity3 have friends or family in the @entity5
according to @entity14 , this means the migration of @entity3 to the @entity5 has continued to decline in the last few years
the number of @entity3 who report having a friend or family member living in the @entity5 has fallen to 32 % , compared with 42 % in 2007
" the most interesting finding that we reported in terms of migration is this change in the percentage of @entity3 who have friends or relatives in the @entity5
this percentage is a reflection of the change in net migration
it 's an objective indicator of current migration trends , " @entity14 said
the @entity8 reported in 2012 that net migration from @entity3 to the @entity5 fell to zero ( and perhaps less ) between 2005 and 2010 , meaning the number of @entity3 migrating north is equal to or less than those going back to their country
the latest @entity8 survey " is based on face - to - face interviews conducted among a representative sample of 1,000 randomly selected adults from across the country between april 21 and may 2 , 2014
" the survey covered a wide range of topics including the popularity of current president @entity60 ( 51 % ) , which declined 6 percentage points in the past year as he pushed through energy and communications reforms some view with suspicion
