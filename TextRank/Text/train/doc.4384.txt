-- @entity1 overcame a final - round charge from fellow @entity4 golfer @entity3 to win the @entity5 by one shot in @entity7 on sunday
@entity1 went one better than his second - placed finish at the @entity9 last weekend
@entity10 had resumed play in 20th place six shots adrift of third - round leader @entity1 , but surged up the leaderboard with a sensational 10 - under - par 62 to set the clubhouse lead on 12 - under 276
the 35 - year - old , who was third at @entity17 two years ago after a closing 66 , birdied seven successive holes from six to 12
he had already picked up shots at two of his opening four greens , then also birdied 17
@entity1 , however , kept his nerve as he went one better than last weekend , when he lost the @entity23 @entity9 in a play - off with @entity26 's @entity25 -- the fourth time out of four he has been beaten in sudden death
the 39 - year - old started birdie - bogey - birdie , then rattled off four successive birdies before dropping a shot at the 15th hole
however , he immediately bounced back with a birdie at the par - five 16th and parred the last two to take victory , his third on the @entity35 following wins in @entity37 and @entity38
he carded a five - under 67 to follow up successive rounds of 68 as he denied world @entity40 a maiden title on the circuit
@entity10 is becoming noted as a strong finisher , having closed with a course - record 63 at the @entity9 , where he tied for 15th
defending champion @entity47 of @entity48 closed with 67 to share third place on 278 with former @entity51 @entity9 champion @entity50 , who carded 69 after starting the day one shot adrift of @entity1 in second
the @entity54 had led the tournament for the first two rounds , in which he did not drop a stroke
his final round featured an eagle on the par - five ninth hole , which followed two birdies , but his title challenge faded with bogeys at 12 and 15
@entity50 's compatriot @entity64 was fourth on nine - under 279 following a fine 64 , which featured 10 birdies and a double - bogey at the par - four fifth hole .
