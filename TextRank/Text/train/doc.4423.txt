-- we love it when an awesome rumor turns out to be true
as suspected , @entity4 will indeed reunite at @entity5 2014 , headlining the three - day music festival in @entity7 , @entity8 , along with @entity9 and @entity10
the @entity5 will be a must - see for @entity4 fans , who 've been anxiously waiting for @entity12 and @entity13 to begin performing as a duo again
the two artists have spent the past several years largely working on solo projects , with hints of an eventual reconnection surfacing regularly
in november , speculation grew that the two would choose @entity5 for their big reunion , but it was n't until wednesday night that the festival confirmed the news
joining @entity4 , @entity10 and @entity9 will be a number of newer faces , such as @entity27 and @entity28 , plus established artists such as @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32
@entity5 will run the same lineup across two weekends in april : the first edition is scheduled for april 11 - 13 , followed by the second stretch from april 18 - 20
@entity4 will kick off @entity5 with acts such as the replacements , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity28 , with @entity9 leading the second day along with @entity27 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46
closing out the event on both weekends will be @entity10 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and more
tickets will go on sale at 7 a.m. et ( 10 a.m. pt ) friday
