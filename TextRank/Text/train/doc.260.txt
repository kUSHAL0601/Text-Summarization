-- president @entity1 left for @entity2 on @entity3 friday but , in a twist that has left some @entity6 reporters scratching their heads , he apparently arrived at the presidential retreat by car
@entity6 press secretary @entity10 explained the decision not to land at @entity2 was made in advance because of the weather
@entity3 landed at an alternate site near @entity15 , @entity16 and the president and his daughter , @entity18 , rode in a motorcade the rest of way to the compound
because it is customary practice that the traveling press pool is included whenever the president uses a motorcade , reporters naturally wondered why the pool was not part of the trip or even informed that the president would use a motorcade ahead of time
meanwhile , @entity0 's weather team found no signs of stormy weather in the area at the time @entity3 departed the @entity6
the @entity6 said there were no mechanical issues with the presidential helicopter
" it was a bit of a surprise because he ( @entity1 ) usually does not land here
they usually go all the way to @entity2 , " said @entity46 , a customer service representative at the @entity48
also friday , a fighter under the direction of @entity53 ( @entity54 ) intercepted an aircraft in the vicinity of @entity2
the civilian aircraft left the restricted area and landed at the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity54 said
no other details were immediately available on the incident , which was separate from the decision to divert @entity3
@entity0 's @entity64 and @entity65 contributed to this report
