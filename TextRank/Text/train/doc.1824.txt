@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 's @entity3 has released files on @entity7 sightings dating back to the 1970s , including witness accounts and the government 's response
the ministry on wednesday released the files as part of a four - year project to transfer all of the @entity7 documents to the @entity15 to make them available to curious members of the public
the documents include hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who describe seeing lights or strange objects in the sky , from southern @entity0 and @entity24 up to @entity25
the files released wednesday cover 1978 to 1987
the rest , dating from the 1950s and covering recent history , will be released over the coming years
reported sightings typically describe various shapes and colors of lights , moving in formation or hovering in the sky
witnesses reported orange , red , white and green lights that were diamond - shaped , square , or cigar - shaped
they reported them to police , who have a standard 16 - question form specifically for @entity7 sightings
" the vast majority of them are just ordinary people who 've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it , " said @entity43 , a professor at @entity44 and a @entity7 expert who worked with the @entity15 on the project
in one sighting in january 1985 , a man near @entity54 , @entity24 , was closing his living room curtains when he saw an object in the sky
he said it moved " up and down like a bouncing ball , " then disappeared behind a mountain
two police officers in @entity64 , south of @entity65 , reported seeing a white light in the sky on christmas morning 1985
the light , they said , moved into the nearby area of @entity70 , where author @entity71 had placed the @entity73 landing in his book , " @entity74
" the person who took the report noted the officers were aware of the connection , writing , " genuine report
two competent officers slightly embarrassed ( @entity81 features in @entity71 )
" two other police officers in @entity83 , @entity65 , reported seeing an object in the sky in june 1984
they viewed it with binoculars for an hour and sketched a picture , showing a white sphere with a ring of blue and red lights
" the object moved erratically from side to side , up and down and to and fro , not venturing far from its original position , " the officers wrote
other reports came from stunned members of the public , pilots , and members of the military
the @entity3 said it examined the reports and held onto the records solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated @entity4 airspace
once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky , it did not investigate further
watch why the ministry is revealing what it knows about @entity7 Â» " the @entity3 has no other interest or role regarding @entity7 matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life - forms , " it said wednesday
that leaves many of the incidents simply unexplained , such as an april 1984 report made by a senior air traffic controller at an unidentified airfield
the controller was bringing in a light aircraft for landing when he noticed a series of lights appearing to come down on another runway
the crew of the incoming plane radioed that they saw the lights , too
all reported that they saw the lights come down " at speed , " touch down , and disappear
" they were so concerned about this , they filed an official report , " @entity43 said
" but what was the thing that they saw ? there 's no evidence from the papers that any further investigations were done and it remains a mystery
" in 1979 , two years after @entity149 's alien - visitation movie " @entity152 , " reports of strange sightings had increased and the @entity153 decided to hold a debate on @entity7
one of the documents released wednesday is a detailed briefing prepared by the @entity3 for the debate , and it sheds light on the military 's position on the matter
" there is nothing to indicate that ufology ( the study of @entity7 ) is anything but claptrap and no evidence at all of ' alien space craft , ' " read the briefing , prepared by the ministry for @entity169 , then government chief whip
at least one report in the files has since been explained , however
a report from august 1985 details the crop circles that two army officers found in a wheat field in @entity180 , in southern @entity0
they noted one large circle surrounded by four smaller ones , all perfectly round with the wheat pressed down in a clockwise direction
no tracks led up to the circles , they said
the farmer called the army officers because he thought the @entity191 had created the circles , but the officers said they were stumped
" none of us could offer any reasonable explanation , " they wrote
it is now known that the crop circles were some of many created by two hoaxers named @entity200 and @entity201 , according to @entity43
" @entity200 and @entity201 , " as they were called , came forward in 1990 to say they created the circles with a garden roller and planks of wood , @entity43 said
" we now know that this particular circle near @entity180 was one of the ones that was created as a hoax by these two men , " he said .
