" @entity21 was scheduled to be deployed to @entity54 " and appeared to be upset about that , " sen. @entity52 , @entity53 , said
" i think that there is a lot of investigation going on now into his background and what he was doing that was not known before , " @entity52 said
@entity52 said she was told that the soldiers at the readiness facility " were filling out paper processing to go to @entity54 or @entity64 , " according to @entity0 affiliate @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity5
the readiness center is one of the last stops before soldiers deploy
it is also one of the first places a soldier goes upon returning to the @entity34
the base reopened thursday night after being under lockdown for more than five hours
at a news conference earlier in the day , @entity7 said at least 10 of the dead were soldiers
the shooter had two weapons , both handguns , @entity7 said

" it was total chaos , " the witness said
@entity7 said a graduation ceremony was being held in an auditorium just 50 meters from where the shooting took place

" she 's being deployed to @entity54 on december 7 , " @entity113 said
" i thought i was more worried about her going over to @entity54 than here , just doing training in @entity5
she just got there yesterday
" a woman who lives on base , about eight blocks from the shooting , said she and her daughter were at home when her husband called and told them to stay inside
" and i asked him why , what was going on
he said that there was a shooting , " said the woman , @entity132 , who asked that her last name not be used
she said her husband called her back about 20 minutes later and told her to go upstairs , stay away from doors and windows and keep the doors locked
" it 's just been crazy , " she said
" a soldier who asked not to be identified told @entity0 that an e-mail went out to all base personnel instructing them not to speak to the media
president @entity145 called the shootings " tragic " and " a horrific outburst of violence
" he expressed his condolences for the shooting victims
" these are men and women who have made the selfless and courageous decision to risk , and at times give , their lives to protect the rest of us on a daily basis , " @entity145 said
" it 's difficult enough when we lose these brave @entity34 in battles overseas
it is horrifying that they should come under fire at an @entity166 base on @entity34 soil
" @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity5 , posted an online appeal for blood as it began receving victims
" due to the recent events on @entity4 , we are in urgent need of all blood types , " it said
@entity4 , with about 40,000 troops , is home to the @entity166 's @entity177 and elements of the @entity179 , as well as the @entity180 and the 13th @entity181
it is located near @entity182 , @entity5
the headquarters unit and three brigades of the @entity177 are currently deployed in @entity54
at least 25,000 people are at @entity4 on any given day , an @entity166 spokesman at the @entity186 said
@entity4 is home to the @entity189 , which is designed to help soldiers overcome combat stress issues
in june , @entity4 's commander , lt. gen. @entity192 , told @entity0 that he was trying to ease the kind of stresses soldiers face
he has pushed for soldiers working a day schedule to return home for dinner by 6 p.m. , and required his personal authorization for anyone working weekends
at the time , two soldiers stationed there had committed suicide in 2009 -- a rate well below those of other posts
nearby @entity182 was the scene of one of the most deadly shootings in @entity34 history 18 years ago when @entity212 crashed his truck into a @entity214 and began shooting , killing 23 people and wounding 20
@entity217 's spree lasted 14 minutes
he eventually took his own life .
