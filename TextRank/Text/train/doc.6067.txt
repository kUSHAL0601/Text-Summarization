@entity0 -- as @entity3 debates the size and scope of defense budgets in a looming age of austerity , one senator is seeking to resolve a much older question about the president 's ability to exercise military power without the consent of the @entity14 and @entity15
sen. @entity16 , @entity17 , has introduced legislation requiring explicit congressional approval of future @entity21 humanitarian or peacekeeping operations involving the military and likely hostilities
the measure would not apply to instances where there 's an imminent threat to the @entity21 , @entity21 allies or @entity21 citizens
under the terms of the bill , co-sponsored by sen. @entity33 , @entity34 , both chambers of @entity3 would be required to vote within 48 hours of a presidential authorization request
" the question is simple , " @entity16 said last week
" when should the president have the unilateral authority to decide to use military force , and what is the place of the @entity3 in that process ? year by year , skirmish by skirmish , the role of the @entity3 in determining where the @entity21 military would operate , and when the awesome power of our weapon systems would be unleashed , has diminished
" @entity16 , a former @entity51 secretary and assistant defense secretary , was strongly critical of president @entity54 's decision to intervene militarily in @entity55 in 2011 without congressional authorization
he has also expressed concern about the possibility of @entity21 intervention in the @entity61 crisis
last summer , a sharply divided @entity3 was unable to pass any legislation explicitly endorsing or rejecting @entity21 's involvement in @entity65 's @entity55 intervention
the matter was never voted on by the full @entity15
deep congressional divisions over the mission stemmed in part from a belief among some representatives and senators on both sides of the aisle that @entity54 violated the @entity75
passed in 1973 , the law gives a president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending @entity21 forces to war , followed by a 30 - day extension to end hostilities
while the combined 90 - day period ended before hostilities concluded , @entity14 officials insisted the mission -- backed by the @entity86 -- did not violate the @entity75 because it failed to meet the law 's definition of combat
previous administrations also resisted the law 's restrictions
" the ( @entity54 ) administration , which spent well over a billion dollars of taxpayer funds , dropped thousands of bombs on the country , and operated our military offshore for months , claimed that ' combat ' was not occurring , and rejected the notion that the @entity75 applied to the situation , " @entity16 recently said on the @entity15 floor
" i am not here to debate the @entity75
( but ) i am suggesting that other statutory language that covers these kinds of situations must be enacted
" @entity16 's proposal notwithstanding , a number of political analysts question the ultimate willingness of @entity3 to oppose any @entity21 military action -- particularly in the post- 9/11 era
" these attempts by @entity3 to restrict the president 's authority as commander - in - chief are almost always symbolic , because presidents rarely enter conflicts without some expectation of public support , " said @entity114 political scientist @entity113
@entity1 polling showed a slight majority of @entity21 in favor of the @entity55 intervention in the spring of 2011 , though public sentiment quickly turned against the conflict .
