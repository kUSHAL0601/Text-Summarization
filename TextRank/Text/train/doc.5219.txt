-- @entity1 , the estranged wife of 2004 vice presidential candidate and former @entity4 senator @entity3 , died tuesday after a lengthy battle with cancer
she died at the family home in @entity8 , @entity4 , according to a statement released by the family
" today we have lost the comfort of @entity1 's presence but she remains the heart of this family , " the statement said
" we love her and will never know anyone more inspiring or full of life
" @entity3 was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her husband lost his bid for vice president in november 2004
@entity3 , a one - term @entity22 senator , was @entity24 sen. @entity23 's running mate
it was later revealed that she knew before the election she might have cancer , but shielded her husband from the news during the campaign
she immediately underwent treatment , and the cancer was believed to be in remission
in march 2007 -- at the start her husband 's 2008 presidential campaign -- @entity3 learned that the cancer had returned and spread
dr. @entity38 , the oncologist treating @entity3 , categorized the cancer as metastatic stage four cancer , largely confined to the bones
the cancer was diagnosed treatable but not curable , @entity3 said
despite the diagnosis , @entity3 said she was ready to go forward with her husband 's bid for the @entity47
" either you push forward with the things that you were doing yesterday or you start dying , " she said
" if i had given up everything that my life was about ... i 'd let cancer win before it needed to
" " maybe eventually it will win , " she said
" but i 'd let it win before i needed to
" @entity3 , unable to compete with the attention focused on then - sens. @entity57 and @entity59 , withdrew from the presidential race in january 2008
several months later , he admitted that tabloid claims about an extramarital affair with former campaign videographer @entity63 were true
eventually , he also admitted to fathering a child with @entity65 -- an allegation he initially vociferously denied even after conceding the affair
@entity3 said the affair happened in 2006 while his wife 's cancer was in remission
he claimed he informed his wife at the time and asked for her forgiveness
the couple was criticized by some activists for not revealing the affair prior to his presidential bid , as the news could have damaged @entity22 chances if it became publicly known during a general election campaign in which @entity3 was the party 's standard bearer
" this was our private matter , and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well , " @entity1 said
the affair appeared to end any future political ambitions the former senator may have had
it also led to the couple 's separation
@entity1 was born @entity1 on july 3 , 1949 , in @entity95 , @entity96
her father was a @entity98 pilot , and in her early years , she attended school in @entity100
she attended the @entity101 in @entity8 , and met her future husband while studying at @entity101 's law school
they spent their first date dancing at a local @entity106 , and it ended with @entity3 kissing @entity1 on the forehead
" it was just really sweet , " she said of the kiss
" i was n't used to men being sweet
" the couple was married july 30 , 1977 , the saturday after they took their state bar exams
they had four children : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity119
@entity1 was killed in a car accident in 1996
mrs. @entity1 worked as a clerk for @entity123 district judge @entity122 in @entity124 , @entity125 , and was a bankruptcy lawyer in @entity127
in 2006 , after her initial cancer diagnosis , she wrote " @entity129 : finding @entity130 from @entity131 , " which chronicled the aftermath of her son 's death and her battle with the disease
when her cancer returned in 2007 , the couple held a news conference to publicize the information and declare their intention to continue with @entity3 ' campaign
" you can go cower in the corner and hide or you can go out there and stand up for what you believe in , " the former senator said
" we have no intentions of cowering in the corner
" in an interview with the @entity152 after her husband admitted to his affair , @entity1 said the incident helped her focus on resuming her role as an advocate for the poor and for health care reform
she also said it pushed her to refocus on her role as a mother
she also said she did not want her husband 's tarnished public image to overshadow his role as an advocate for the poor -- particularly in the eyes of her children
" i have to prepare for the possibility if i die before they are grown " to make them " able to function without an involved , engaged and admiring parent , " she said
" so i need to create the picture for them that i want them to have
" in a september interview on " the @entity178 , " @entity1 was asked what she sees when she looks at her estranged husband , @entity3
" i see the father of my children , and that 's very important to me , " she said
" particularly since i have a terminal disease , this is the person who at some point will take over the primary parenting , and it 's important to me that he heals , if he needs too
" asked about forgiveness , @entity1 said that 's a difficult topic for her
" it 's really hard to use a word like forgiveness but we found a new of interacting with one another that is healthy -- and i think for the kids -- and really easy for us , which is great , " she said
she said living with stage four cancer " is like dancing with a partner who keeps changing
" " fortunately with the research , it looks like there may be a new drug for me down the line , " she said
" my job is to stay alive until they find a cure
i do n't think there 's any way to live with this diagnosis than to have that kind of optimism
" on monday , the @entity1 family released a statement saying that further cancer treatment would be unproductive
in a message posted on her @entity219 page , @entity1 addressed her family and friends : " the days of our lives , for all of us , are numbered
and , yes , there are certainly times when we are n't able to muster as much strength and patience as we would like
it 's called being human , " she wrote
" but i have found that in the simple act of living with hope , and in the daily effort to have a positive impact in the world , the days i do have are made all the more meaningful and precious
and for that i am grateful
it is n't possible to put into words the love and gratitude i feel to everyone who has and continues to support and inspire me every day
to you i simply say : you know
