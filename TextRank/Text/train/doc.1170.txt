a @entity2 school that stopped students from wearing @entity6 flag t - shirts on @entity7 did n't violate their constitutional rights , an appeals court ruled thursday
the school 's approach , according to the appeals court , kept students safe in a climate of racial tension
" the controversy and tension remained , " a panel of judges from the 9th @entity19 said in their opinion , " but the school 's actions presciently avoided an altercation
" school officials were worried about violence and disruption of school activities " and their response was tailored to the circumstance , " the opinion said
the case dates back to may 5 , 2010 , when the principal of @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity2 , asked a group of students wearing @entity6 flag t - shirts to turn their shirts inside out or take them off
the students at the @entity2 school refused , according to the appeals court 's summary of the case , and later brought a civil rights suit against the school and two administrators , arguing that their rights to freedom of expression , equal protection and due process had been violated
judges said the civil rights case forced them to weigh the difficult question of what takes precedence : students ' free speech rights or school safety concerns ? according to court documents , the incident occurred amid " ongoing racial tension and gang violence within the school , and after a near - violent altercation had erupted during the prior @entity7 over the display of an @entity6 flag
" the previous year , court documents said , a group of students carrying a @entity72 flag had clashed with students who hung an @entity6 flag from a tree and chanted " @entity6 " on @entity7 , a holiday marking a famous @entity72 military battle that is often celebrated in the @entity6
in 2010 , the appeals court said , " threats issued in the aftermath of the incident were so real that the parents of the students involved in the suit kept them home from school two days later
" @entity87 first learned of the court 's ruling on @entity90 .
