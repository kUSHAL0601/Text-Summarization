debris from @entity0 lay splayed for miles across silent rural fields in eastern @entity2 on saturday
two days after the jet crashed , some bodies remained strapped in seat belts -- wearing inflight headphones
conspicuously missing at the crash site near @entity8 were international forensic workers needed to secure and sort the wreckage , and a recovery crew to identify and remove with dignity the bodies of the 298 people who were on board @entity15
a few things have been moved
luggage was stacked in piles ; mementos , children 's toys were handled
most everything is unguarded , there for the curious -- or for the taking
but the debris field has n't changed much overall since it slammed into place from about 30,000 feet in the air
not like it would change , if investigators had a chance to cordon it off and catalog it
plane parts , books , bodies a round piece of wreckage the size of a small garage -- part of the cabin perhaps -- stood tilted over personal effects of people heading for vacation
fields were bestrewn with novels , beach sandals , guide books and colorful carry - on bags
and all around them were the bodies of their owners , some dressed in shorts and other vacation wear
with leaders around the world calling for a swift , thorough and professional investigation , in eastern @entity2 , a small group of local government workers camping near the wreckage emerge from their tents in the mornings
they split up the crash site territory in an orderly manner to look for bodies , said journalist @entity68 , who visited the site
the emergency workers mark spots where they find human remains with stakes and tie white rags around them
there are so many of them
bodies lie by the roadside , some in fields , some intertwined with parts of the aircraft
and they are spread out so far
" half of them are so mangled , you could n't identify them , " @entity68 said
collecting bodies not their job a witness who saw the people falling to @entity91 on tuesday said they had appeared from out of the cloud cover -- like horrifying rainfall , after the plane tore apart in the sky
emergency workers tell @entity97 it 's not their job to collect the bodies
and a local @entity101 rebel leader has said that officials from the @entity103 and @entity0 asked that the bodies not be moved
but rescue crews and inspectors from those countries are not on site
and to get there , they would have to drive about 90 minutes from the city of @entity112 down pot - hole pocked roads
but these lead through a war zone , past checkpoints set up by varying local militias
there is no central command , virtually no rule of law
three separate @entity101 rebel groups guard the perimeter of the crash site alone , @entity68 said
a small international delegation a delegation of 21 monitors from the @entity128 in @entity129 made it in after assurances from rebel leaders , but local militiamen at the site allowed them only a brief view of a small outtake of the crash site
" it basically looks like the biggest crime scene in the world right now , guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy firepower who are quite inhospitable , " said @entity138 spokesman @entity137
they asked militiamen for their commander , their leader , he said
" no one showed up
" an armed man who appeared to have been drinking was there , @entity137 said , but he was n't helpful
" he kind of rushed all of them away , including the journalists
" militiamen would have to trust international and @entity2 crews enough to let them in , and trust is scarce in the conflict zone , @entity68 said
many militiamen hold conspiracy theories about the crash
" they claim that it 's a provocation conjured up by the @entity2 authorities in @entity167
" they do n't trust anything coming out of @entity167 , he said
the @entity138 crew is at the site to get an overview and report back what they see
they usually act as observers in conflict zones and are not equipped or trained to recover bodies and evidence
but for now , they , the local workers and a few journalists are the only ones there to care
