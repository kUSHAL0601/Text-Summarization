@entity0 -- the @entity3 ' cultural organization recognized mariachi music sunday in a move that @entity7 authorities hope will help preserve the well - known tradition
the songs -- often played on festive occasions by groups of guitar , violin and trumpet performers wearing traditional clothes or wide - brimmed hats -- are sung throughout @entity0 , and have become a key part of regional identity , officials said
" the community and the family hand down musically their knowledge , history and the pleasure of singing to the nature surrounding them
they consider it their own , " @entity7 officials said in their application to the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) , which added mariachi music to the organization 's list of intangible cultural patrimony sunday
putting mariachi on the list could increase awareness of the music , @entity31 said in a statement sunday
" learning by ear is the main means of transmission of traditional @entity46 , and the skill is usually passed down from fathers to sons and through performance at festive , religious and civil events , " the statement said
@entity0 's application notes that the music " has crossed borders and become a symbol of @entity0
" " immigrants , descendants of @entity7 living abroad , as well as @entity59 , have made the modern mariachi a symbol of community identity , because it is a bond linking them to their roots in spite of the distance , " the application says
@entity67 , director of the @entity68 in @entity0 , told @entity69 last year that the music has evolved over time , and also drawn greater international attention
" now including in foreign countries like the @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , there are mariachi schools , mariachi classes , mariachi degrees , " he said
many of @entity0 's monuments have already been honored by the @entity3 ' cultural organization
last year @entity31 added traditional @entity7 food to its intangible cultural patrimony list
in 2008 , the organization recognized @entity0 's traditional @entity87 celebration
this year @entity31 also added 13 other items to its list , including @entity91 shadow puppetry , a ritual of transplanting rice in @entity94 , @entity75 , and " poetic dueling " in @entity96
@entity97 contributed to this report .
