@entity0 is on the hunt in @entity3
her tour of the region will see her travel to @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9
not in search of lions , rhinos or other big game
rather she 's on a quest for a much more elusive creature -- the @entity18 poet
" we have a rich oral tradition and it 's important that we document what is happening in history poetry-wise , " she explains
" @entity3 has a history of a lack of documentation and we really did n't want this to happen to our poets
" @entity0 , 29 , is part of the team behind the @entity31 , the largest online archive of @entity18 poetry , accessible via mobile phone , in the world
the @entity37 project was originally conceived as an annual poetry festival overseen by the @entity39 , a pan-african organization based in @entity41 in 2008
over the following years it grew to become a powerful mouthpiece for showcasing @entity18 wordsmiths
and by 2012 , the institution decided to move online in an effort to break down geographical borders and open up their diverse anthology to a wider audience in @entity3
poetry in your phone following an overhaul of the site last year , @entity53 relaunched in september , making its immersive archive accessible to a broader international following through a " mobile - first " site
it 's a shrewd move on a continent where mobile phones have revolutionized critical sectors such as education , healthcare and agriculture
adoption of mobile phone use has been prolific in @entity3 with mobile data services going from strength to strength
seven out of 10 mobile users in @entity73 use their phones to browse the web , according to a recent report from @entity77
elsewhere , a study by analyst firm @entity79 predicted in november that " mobile broadband connections in @entity3 are set to rise from 96 million in 2013 to 950 million to cover 77.3 % of all mobile subscriptions in the continent by the end of 2019
" @entity89 adds : " a lot of @entity91 use their mobiles to go on the @entity93 and because they are own main target audience , we had to cater for them and make it easy for them to access this content
" to date , the project has collected almost 400 @entity18 poets from 31 countries in @entity3 and across the diaspora , in 14 different languages
since the relaunch , users are able to navigate the site through a myriad of options including by theme , poet , country , language , emotion or by their " @entity113 " list , a popular feature curated by a guest poet each month
and it seems their following has embraced the organization 's decision to go forward on mobile with an average of 3,000 visitors to the site monthly
" we want the archive to be a place where people can come and get educated about what other @entity18 poets are saying
a place for them to interact with one another , " says @entity0
" there is great value in a @entity8 interacting with a @entity132
a @entity132 interacting with a @entity18 ... " also the archive has now reached an international status and it has become a global stage
poets can get the exposure that they usually do not get
" @entity41 - based poet @entity139 , who compiled this month 's " @entity113 " list , says : " i do n't think the importance of an archive like this can be overstated
it is the first ' living archive ' focusing solely on poets from @entity3 and the diaspora
" the archive serves a number of purposes : it makes poets available to an international audience -- and for less known poets , this is a chance to be heard beyond their own community , city or country
it raises the the profile of poetry from and of the continent , while allowing people to engage with the words through hearing and reading them
" hot on the trail of poets two poets are introduced to the platform weekly and each poet profile features a short biography , two text poems , a photograph and audio podcast recordings of the wordsmith reading their works
@entity0 , a poet and writer herself , says : " it adds so much value to actually hear the poet 's voice recite their work
it adds a different dimension , it adds a texture
we really want to give our audience a holistic experience of poetry
" if some people just choose to read it , that 's fine
but if others want to hear it , ( the podcast ) really brings the work to life
" meanwhile , @entity139 , who also runs poetry and performance workshops , says the multi-layered format " democratizes poetry " by " offering an equal platform to poets working in all languages on the continent , and to established and emerging poets
" poets can supply their work directly to the organization via the project 's submissions page
it is then evaluated by a rolling judging panel who determine whether the work is suitable for @entity53
" at any given time we have two or three poets sitting on the panel , " says @entity0
" we try to have a mix of people so we will invite poets to come curate for us
it keeps the selection process exciting and diverse
" conversely , the team also approach poets directly to inquire if they are interested in adding their work to the collection
additionally , they travel to various nations in search of poets to connect with
" we write to publishers or anybody who has access to these poets and build those profiles
we do , from time to time , have to travel to a specific country
we really have to do a lot of ploughing and digging of the poetry scene and that space
" one such voice on the platform is @entity246 - born @entity245 poet @entity244
having first encountered @entity53 while visiting @entity41 several years ago , he is thrilled to see how the organization has created a burgeoning poetry scene online
" i had the chance to visit their studios and to learn more about what they intended to do
it was exciting to see this fledgling idea blossom into what is simply one of the best things to happen to @entity18 poetry in a long time
" the concept is simple , but the impact is massive
" existing in an online space @entity244 , who is also a distinguished actor , documentary writer and founder of the prestigious @entity264 , has not only curated content for the site but he 's also featured in this month 's " @entity113 , " compiled by @entity18 's @entity139
he adds : " of course it feels good to see that other poets are engaged by my work
i am not sure what it means really ( to be included in the @entity113 ) , but i have to think that the few poems on the site resonate with people in positive ways
i am in good company , frankly , and i find that an honor
" it 's a sentiment project manager @entity0 says many poets share about their inclusion in @entity37
" when we first started there was obviously a bit of resistance
people not understanding how being online works
now as a society , we are more accustomed to being online , a lot of our activities are based online -- we shop online -- so as society becomes more comfortable with the idea of the web , so do poets , " explains the curator
" poets are very open to it and they appreciate having such a space there they can engage with one another
" @entity53 is principally funded by @entity300 , a @entity18 wine estate , with additional financing from applications to the government and other private institutions
and in a time when traditional publishers are shying away from printing poetry due to lack of sales , the project offers poets a new outlet for presenting their work in a digital age
but @entity89 is quick to clarify @entity53 's position as an alternative literary publisher
" a lot of publishers right now are n't publishing a lot of poetry , ( and ) we do n't want that to be what stops us as poets from having thriving careers
i think we can exist online and maybe when people see how popular poetry really is , they can start increasing the number of books being published
i think we can coexist and work with one another
