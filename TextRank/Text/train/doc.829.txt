-- a month after defending the health care law , the @entity2 administration again confronted the buzz saw of skeptical @entity6 justices on wednesday -- this time on immigration
but come november , @entity8 may very well be on the losing end of the argument
as has been widely reported , oral arguments regarding @entity14 's @entity13 illegal immigration law began with an unusual interruption : chief justice @entity16 broke in during @entity19 solicitor general @entity18 's opening comments to ask assertively , " no part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling , does it ? " and , while it is difficult to predict how the justices will rule , justice @entity24 signaled the tough road ahead when she said of the administration 's argument , " you can see it 's not selling very well
" but in the court of public opinion , @entity14 's @entity13 law has stirred the fastest - growing electorate in the nation : latino voters , who made up 7.4 % of all voters in 2008
@entity8 are in serious trouble
co-authored by one of @entity40 's informal advisers , signed into law by @entity42 gov. @entity42 , and touted by @entity40 endorsers , @entity13 is the gum sticking to the presumptive nominee 's general election shoes
and president @entity2 knows it
in an interview with @entity49 magazine , @entity2 said , " i do n't think that their nominee is going to be able to suddenly say , ' everything i 've said for the last six months , i did n't mean
' " the mind - boggling part is that @entity40 knew branding himself as an anti-immigrant firebrand was going to present a problem in the general election
but instead of moderating his approach -- as @entity8 strategists implored -- he doubled down
guided by @entity61 secretary of state @entity60 , who is co-author of @entity13 , @entity40 endorsed the concept of " self - deportation " of undocumented immigrants while trying to talk about the @entity67 community 's economic needs
he went even further by saying he would halt lawsuits against @entity13 " on day one " of his presidency -- surely agitating thousands of @entity67 voters in @entity14 in the process
no voter is going to listen to @entity40 's economic message if he wants the voter 's mother to " self - deport
" political common knowledge suggests the @entity8 candidate needs at least 40 % of the @entity67 vote in order to hang drapes at @entity82
in fact , @entity67 , @entity83 and other new immigrant voters may well provide the margin of victory in @entity14 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92
what 's a candidate for president to do ? regardless of the @entity6 's decision , the @entity2 re-election campaign would like to believe @entity13 opens the floodgates for the madre of all get - out - the - vote efforts
but leading an administration that has detained and deported a record 1.2 million people , the president has a trust deficit of his own
@entity2 needs to use the powers granted to the executive branch to fully implement new guidelines that prioritize immigration enforcement resources
the only way he can make up for @entity111 ' inability to deliver immigration reform is to take decisive action and continue to deport people here illegally who mean to do us harm -- but stop deporting landscapers , nannies and their hardworking families
clearly , @entity40 has the bigger challenge
he can not smile and nod his way out of this problem , as he tried to do at a recent meeting with @entity67 in the @entity126 area
to a former @entity129 president 's question about the @entity130 , @entity40 responded , " thank you
appreciate it , thank you
" to earn anywhere near a winning percentage of latino votes , @entity40 must redirect citizens ' frustration with the broken immigration system away from @entity13 and its copycats , and join republicans such as @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , all of whom have called for immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for the undocumented
for political cover , @entity40 can look to a growing alliance of conservative faith , business and law enforcement leaders working together across the country to forge a new consensus on immigrants and @entity19
if @entity8 fail to appreciate the anger and frustration of new @entity19 voters and their allies who want pragmatic immigration solutions , a different buzz saw -- one of electoral justice -- will decide their fate come november
and it will not be pretty
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .
