-- alleged @entity2 crime boss @entity1 may have authored two memoirs , one of which was titled " @entity6 in the @entity7 , " according to court documents
it is not clear whether the notorious fugitive , who evaded authorities for 16 years , actually wrote the memoir , but prosecutors say it is part of their investigation
the manuscript was seized at a @entity18 home on january 5 , 1995 , the same day a warrant was issued for @entity1 's arrest on racketeering charges
the alleged gangster also apparently penned a separate autobiography that was found by authorities at @entity1 's @entity26 , @entity27 , apartment after his arrest there , courts documents say
@entity1 , 82 , has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him , including 19 murder counts
once one of the @entity33 's 10 most wanted fugitives , he is currently being held without bail and faces an impending racketeering indictment after authorities tracked him down in june 2011 at his @entity27 home

when @entity1 went down to check , @entity33 agents arrested him
