@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 says the @entity3 plans to expand a review of police tactics to update training , technology and other standards around the nation
the aim , in part , is to produce broad national recommendations to enhance officers ' safety , help them deal with new threats and also boost the use of technology such as police car and body cameras
in the wake of complaints about police handling of protests in @entity25 , @entity26 , critics likely will also push for new standards to address police crowd control tactics and the use of force

@entity2 , who speaks to a gathering of police officers in @entity43 , @entity44 , on wednesday , plans to announce his support for such a commission to do the most expansive review of police tactics in 50 years
@entity2 on @entity51 's @entity50 early voting decision : a ' step backward ' @entity2 , in prepared remarks , said the goal of the ongoing review is to " swiftly confront emerging threats , better address persistent challenges , and thoroughly examine the latest tools and technologies to enhance the safety , and the effectiveness , of law enforcement
" an ongoing review is already doing some of the work
but @entity2 says expanding it would " consider the profession in a comprehensive way and to provide strong , national direction on a scale not seen since president @entity69 's @entity68 nearly half a century ago
" excerpts of his speech were provided by the @entity3 before delivery
@entity2 's speech is also intended to mark the 20th anniversary of a landmark crime law that created the federal cops grants program , which funds community policing in cities around the country .
