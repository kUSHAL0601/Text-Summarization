-- @entity1 and @entity2 ca n't trademark the name of their daughter , @entity5 , the @entity7 has ruled , which means the @entity10 wedding planner @entity5 can continue to use the name
the superstar couple filed a petition to trademark the name " @entity16 " shortly after their daughter was born in january , seeking to reserve it for use as a possible brand name for a line of baby - related products , including carriages , diaper bags and baby cosmetics
@entity27 , who started @entity16 in 2009 , filed her own petition to trademark the name , and the @entity7 ruling means she can use " @entity16 " for event and wedding planning and related marketing and advertising
@entity1 and @entity2 can use the name for other potential business endeavors
" i knew this was going to be a bittersweet roller coaster , " @entity27 , 32 , tells @entity0
" if this was n't going to work , i 'd go after both of them
like , ' let 's do it ! ' in my mind i had some protective rights
there 's no way by way of being a celebrity they should have entitlement [ to the name ]
" @entity56 was initially surprised to learn the famous couple had given their child the same name as her company
" i was really blatantly shocked , " she says
" i did n't think it was true because nobody names their daughter @entity5
" still , @entity27 , who named the company to convey romantic traditionalism , says the trademark dispute has been a blessing in disguise
" for me it was a very large compliment , " she says
" all in all i was extremely happy that my design capacity is pretty badass
" the entrepreneur 's main takeaway ? " money does n't buy everything
