@entity0 -- @entity2 is defending his relationship with daughter @entity4 , denying that she felt " abandoned " last summer when he was divorcing her mother , actress @entity5
@entity2 's sworn affidavit was filed in federal court tuesday as part of the actor 's defamation lawsuit against a tabloid publisher ; it was made public wednesday
" the assertion that i ' abandoned ' @entity4 after my divorce is patently false , " @entity2 said
" i have in no way cut @entity4 out of my life -- whether physically , emotionally , financially or otherwise
" his lawyers are trying to force @entity17 to disclose any sources that support the headlines and stories published by the company 's @entity22 and @entity23 magazines
tabloid lawyers : headlines are ' true or substantially true ' the publisher said in a statement thursday that both magazines " stand behind the reporting and articles at issue in mr. @entity2 's action
" " this litigation has established that the editorial teams had a wealth of evidence substantiating that following his divorce from ms. @entity5 , mr. @entity2 was absent from his daughter for long periods of time , that seeing her was not his first priority and that she was emotionally struggling as a result of her father 's extended absences , " @entity51 " mr. @entity2 does not challenge the accuracy of any of the underlying facts that informed the opinions expressed by the editorial teams at @entity23 and @entity22
" Ã‚ the tabloids ' lawyers argued in a response filed in court in december that @entity2 ca n't win " because he is a public figure and the @entity17 defendants did not act with actual malice
" " the articles reported on an issue of legitimate public interest , " the publisher said in thursday 's statement
" mr. @entity2 has repeatedly promoted himself as being a devoted father who made his family his top priority
now , with his own admissions , it is clear that the picture he strives to paint is not accurate
it is entirely in keeping with responsible reporting to question mr. @entity2 's self - promotion and to inform the public about the truth
" the publisher 's court filing said that @entity2 " did not dispute that he had not visited @entity4 for over two months , despite previously assuring his daughter that he would be spending a lot of time with her after his divorce
" the july 18 , 2012 , @entity22 cover carried the headline " suri in tears , abandoned by her dad " along with a photo of the child
there was no accompanying story to support or explain the headline
a story inside the july 30 , 2012 , @entity22 read " @entity4 's emotional troubles , " under a photograph of @entity4 appearing to have tears in her eyes while in her mother 's arms , the suit said
the story reveals that it was " as a result of @entity4 being upset over not being able to take a puppy home from a pet store
" the complaint also points to an @entity23 cover story from september 2012 headlined " 44 days without @entity2 ... @entity105 ... @entity4 is left heartbroken as @entity2 suddenly shuts her out and even misses her first day of school ... @entity107 ? " photos : celeb custody battles @entity2 : @entity4 and i are ' extremely close ' @entity2 said his daughter often traveled with him when he traveled around the world to make movies , which " allowed me to see my daughter while still fulfilling my obligations to my work , my colleagues , and the studios that hire me
" @entity4 , now 7 , stayed with @entity5 and attended school in @entity121 while @entity2 worked on two back - to - back film projects in @entity123 and the @entity124 from june to december last year , he said
" as a result of the changed circumstances following the divorce , we were not able to see each other as often as we did prior to the divorce
" still , @entity2 said , he was able to see his daughter several times during that period
" but even during the times when i was working overseas and was not able to see @entity4 in person , we were ( and continue to be ) extremely close , " he said
" we spoke on the phone nearly every day , and i regularly asked for and received updates concerning her friends and school life , which i then discussed with her during our regular phone calls
" e-mails with @entity5 prove that he " was a constant presence in @entity4 's life during the time that defendants claim falsely that i abandoned her , " he said
the tabloid headlines suggesting that @entity4 was " feeling abandoned " by him are " patently false , " he said
" while i 'm sure my daughter misses me when i am not with her ( as i miss her ) , she is a very happy child , and we have a wonderful relationship and cheerful phone calls , " he said
" she has never indicated , in words or substance , that she has ever felt abandoned by me
" a hearing in @entity153 in @entity0 is set for november 26 for arguments about the tabloids ' sources for the stories
@entity2 's lawsuit is asking for $ 50 million in damages from the publisher
@entity161 makes ' amicable ' deal with child 's dad @entity2 lawyer : ' @entity166 ' malicious garbage ' @entity2 lawyer @entity169 sent two letters informing the publisher that the headlines were false and demanding retractions , but he was refused in each case , the lawsuit said
" these serial defamers are foreign - owned companies with their global headquarters in @entity178 ( @entity179 ) , " @entity169 said in october 2012 , when he filed the lawsuit
" they take money from unsuspecting @entity182 by selling their malicious garbage
having to pay a libel judgment may slow them down
" since the magazines are displayed at supermarket checkout lines , " millions of people each day must see their covers which feature screaming headlines in huge , brightly colored letters that are typically of a false , lurid and titillating nature , and that are often entirely unsupported by the stories buried in the magazines ' interiors , " the suit said
" @entity2 does n't go around suing people , " @entity169 said
" he 's not a litigious guy
but when these sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies about his relationship with his child , you bet he 's going to sue
" @entity2 will " undoubtedly " donate any judgment proceeds to charity , @entity169 said
