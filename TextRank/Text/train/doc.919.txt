-- @entity1 was always overweight
when he visited his relatives in @entity4 , they would jokingly say , " the sumo wrestler is back
" their comments were meant to be funny , but @entity1 still felt the sting
@entity1 and his wife @entity9 had their daughter @entity10 in 2006
like many toddlers , @entity10 would run around their @entity15 , @entity14 , home , and @entity1 would trail behind her , trying to catch up
but as she got older , keeping up with @entity10 became a struggle for him , both physically and mentally
" i would oftentimes be so out of breath that i would almost pass out , " he said
at this point , his diet mainly consisted of burgers , fries and sub sandwiches , and at least six cans of soda a day
by 2010 , the 37 - year - old , standing at 5 ' 10 , hit his peak weight of 270 pounds
" it was the lowest point of my life , " he said
he had to start wearing @entity32 shirts because the xxl was too small
@entity1 became reclusive -- even to his family
often he would shut himself in the basement where he could be alone to eat while sitting at the computer with the curtains drawn
but @entity10 , then 4 years old , would find her way down to the basement and beg him to play with her
seeing the strain he was putting on himself and his family depressed @entity1 , and by @entity43 , something snapped
he did n't want to miss out on his daughter growing up
he did n't want to be tired and alone anymore
he did n't want to feel bad about himself
he wanted to change his life
but like so many , he had a horrible track record of failed diets and exercise attempts
he had tried countless diets in the past , and had joined a handful of gyms , that he paid for despite never going
" i would try crazy fad diets like eating tofu for two weeks
i would cling on to anything to lose weight with the least amount of work , " he said
but those fad diets would never last more than a few weeks , and his weight would rebound
even his wife was skeptical of his newfound inspiration to lose weight
" she would eat those types of ( rich ) foods in front of me jokingly , but that skepticism was the fuel
i wanted to prove people wrong , " he said
he was determined to not make the same mistakes again
this time , he was going to focus on losing weight by restricting his diet first
then he would slowly incorporate exercise
part of that decision came from the fear of hurting himself after spending years without working out
committing to healthier foods kirimoto drastically cut down on his sugar and carbohydrate intake six days a week , and used saturday as his cheat day where he could eat whatever he wanted
his breakfast burrito was replaced with a light yogurt and a hard boiled egg or an apple
he started taking a salad to work , a dramatic shift from the fast food lunches he used to consume during his workday
although his dinners at home had always been relatively healthy -- stir fry or cooked vegetables with white rice -- @entity1 would typically eat too much , sometimes consuming two or three meals ' worth of food in one sitting
" i would eat a whole bowl of rice or big servings of stir fry
i would eat ' til i was full , then you sort of become numb to the fullness , " he said
that changed as he started making a conscious effort to watch his portion sizes
he remembers the intense feeling of withdrawal
" my body really was asking for richer and fattier foods , " he said
it was a struggle to resist delicacies like pizza and pasta , or even pantry staples like rice and bread
but the cravings slowly subsided and he noticed that even on his cheat day he was eating smaller portions
at the start of 2011 , @entity1 began a fitness routine
he started lifting weights three days a week at the gym before work
it felt awkward at first , as he tried to get used to the rhythm of his body , but those feelings dissipated as he gained more energy and confidence
@entity133 through the year , he incorporated running into his workout routine
he was now running and lifting weights five days a week
it was a momentous step for @entity1 , who says he used to treat running like a joke
" unless i was being chased by a bear or axe murderer , it was never something i did , " he wrote in his @entity139
by december 2011 , he had dropped 81 pounds
but @entity1 felt like his treadmill runs were getting him nowhere -- literally
" i just felt like a hamster on a wheel , the only thing missing was the water bottle , " he recalled
he told colleague @entity149 about his frustrations
making fitness an adventure @entity149 , a @entity154 - born @entity14 transplant , is a fitness enthusiast
she is known around the office for using her lunch breaks at work to escape into the @entity14 trails for a quick 30 - minute run
she became a person @entity1 confided in throughout his fitness journey , whether it was about struggles he had at the gym or nutrition advice
" i am a big believer of eating food in its purest form , " @entity149 said
" he used to make fun of me when i ate an apple or vegetables for a snack , but as he started losing he changed his diet , and started eating pure , natural foods too
" when it came to running , @entity149 told @entity1 : " we live in @entity14
one of the most beautiful states with many trails , and you need to take advantage of it , " he recalled
that piece of advice inspired him to start running outside
the first run was tough
the ground was n't as soft as the treadmill 's belt back at the gym , and gravity seemed to pull him down , @entity1 said
what he did n't expect from running outside was the sensory overload
he had lived in @entity14 for more than 25 years , and this was the first time he had run outside
the vibrant colors of the leaves , the green grass , the blue sky -- it hooked him
as soon as @entity1 started running @entity14 's trails , he fell in love
outside , he could finally breathe
his 15 minute runs transformed into 30 minutes and he gradually found himself running longer and faster
by february 2012 , @entity1 ran his first @entity203 race
" i never entered a race before
i was alone and nervous
i had no idea if i was going to finish , " he said
" when i crossed the finish line ... i felt so fantastic
" that year he did 10 races
at the end of 2012 , he had shed a total of 94 pounds and was now running as far as 6 miles on his running days
the following year , he took his trail runs to a new level and joined a local running group
in january of this year , he encouraged his wife and daughter to partake in physical activities as well
they had a day during the week where they would do short runs around the neighborhood , usually around a mile of jogging
eventually those 1 - milers with his daughter @entity10 became 2 miles ; then she was regularly running 3 miles with him
in march , the father - daughter - duo entered a 4 - mile race in @entity228
@entity10 , now 7 , was nervous because she had never run more than 3 miles before
but that did n't stop her from crushing the race , @entity1 said
@entity10 ran without stopping , clocking a 12 - minute and 39 - second mile pace
today , he and his daughter go on 6 - mile runs together every sunday
it 's become a father - daughter bonding time for them
" it is a million times more satisfying to run with her
to see my own child run and have fun is incredible , " he said
by july , @entity1 's weight was down to 168 pounds
he has lost a total of 102 pounds since 2010
through all his achievements , @entity1 has inspired a lot of his closest friends and co-workers , @entity149 said
" i think everyone is very impressed , " she said
" he made that choice for himself and for his family
" passing that inspiration on to others is what motivates @entity1 to continue staying in shape
" so many people supported and inspired me at the beginning of my journey
inspiration is contagious and a continuous cycle
" for others trying to lose weight , @entity1 says do n't forget to enjoy the journey you 're on
" make ( exercise ) an exciting adventure , " he said
consistency is the key to both weight loss and fitness
you may not see results immediately , but keep at it and you will be rewarded
