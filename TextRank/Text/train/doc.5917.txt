-- the blue clay used at this year 's @entity2 which was severely criticized by world @entity3 and @entity5 has been banned from all @entity7 @entity7 events in 2013
the announcement was made after a meeting of the @entity7 board of directors in @entity11 on saturday
" after careful consideration , i have decided that blue clay courts will not be allowed next year
i very much believe in innovation and exploring ways to enhance our sport
while the blue clay may have offered better visibility on television , there were clearly issues with the quality of the courts in @entity2 this year ... " executive chairman and president @entity26 said in a statement
" regardless of color , we must first ensure that courts are safe and fair for players , " he added
@entity32 : ' tennis without pressure is boring ' it brings an abrupt end to the use of the surface pioneered by former @entity40 tennis star turned businessman @entity41 as a way of improving visibility for television viewers
" @entity45 has been a great supporter of the game for many years and i continue to encourage his ideas , including the testing of blue clay at @entity53 events
at this time , however , it 's clear that further development is required before it can be considered for use at the @entity7 @entity7 level , " @entity26 said
can @entity3 and @entity32 emulate @entity59 greats ? the move ensures that both @entity5 and @entity3 will return to play in @entity2 next year after threatening to boycott the event if the blue clay was retained
after losing to fellow @entity63 @entity62 in straight sets on the surface last month , @entity3 said he wanted to " forget this week " and move on to " real " clay courts
' you can not be serious ! ' @entity69 ' top tantrums " it took me at least a week to try to get used to this surface and somehow find a way to win matches and play a decent level of tennis
there is no discussion in my eyes , it 's very simple
no blue clay for me , " @entity3 said
@entity82 player @entity81 also joined the chorus of disapproval tweeting in may that the " blueclay court 6 " was " the worst court of @ @entity87
" " @entity88 ! blue clay
. it looks like something @entity94 would play on , " ran another tweet from @entity92 @entity91 .
