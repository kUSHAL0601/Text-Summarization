@entity0 -- for @entity5 , the daily bus ride through the streets of @entity4 provided a respite from a hardscrabble existence juggling two low - paying jobs
" it was his time to relax , " his wife 's cousin , @entity11 , said saturday
" his time to take the load off
he usually listened to music or talked on the phone
it was a few minutes of calmness
" that peace was shattered thursday evening as @entity5 shuttled between jobs , hoping to make a quick stop at home to see his wife and two children
it was his final bus trip
a young man boarded the bus , police said
in the rear , a 14 - year - old boy police described as a member of a street gang called the @entity33 allegedly spotted a member of a rival gang and pulled out a .357 - caliber revolver
shots were fired , the bullets missing the intended target , police said
@entity5 , 39 , was hit in the head and declared dead later at a hospital near where his bus trip began

he is to be tried as an adult
" just as everyone in @entity0 probably feels terrible about it , we feel terrible about it too , " @entity48 's lawyer , @entity55 , told reporters , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity57
" i 'm just going to ask everyone not to rush to judgment
" @entity48 allegedly belonged to @entity33 and targeted a rival from another group known as @entity66 , police said
" the stupidity of those gangs that basically , over nothing , are trying to kill each other and , unfortunately , in the process , kill innocents as they did with this hard working young man trying to raise his family , " @entity44 said
" a life needlessly lost , taken by a 14 - year - old who felt it necessary to carry a gun on a city bus and shoot it
" on saturday , @entity5 ' wife was raising money for a wake and to fly her husband 's body home to his native @entity86
" he was the sole provider , " @entity87 said
" she never thought she would have to bury her husband and raise the children alone
" the couple has two children : a 12 - year - old son , @entity95 , and 8 - year - old daughter , april
" why he did that to my dad ? " @entity95 asked , according to @entity57
@entity87 said , " he was just sitting on a bus
he had nothing to do with this
" @entity5 and his wife came to @entity0 from the @entity86 about five years ago , @entity87 said
she held occasional part - time jobs ; he stocked shelves at two @entity4 bodegas
" he was a hard worker and a family man devoted to giving his family a better life , " @entity87 said
" he was the funniest man you would ever meet
his laughter and his presence stayed with you
