-- patients whose fungal tests are negative may still be at risk in a meningitis outbreak , as the fungus involved can be difficult to detect , federal health officials said thursday
cases of the non-contagious fungal meningitis rose to 170 in 11 states as of thursday , the @entity7 said
the cases have been linked to injections of contaminated steroid injection made by the @entity16 - based @entity15
meningitis outbreak : what is a compounding pharmacy ? some 14,000 people may have received the injections , the @entity7 said thursday , an increase from its previous estimate of 13,000
health officials have been able to contact more than 90 % of the patients to warn them , officials said
but " we are n't out of the woods yet , " said dr. @entity27 , incident manager of the multistate outbreak for the @entity7
while the investigation is ongoing , 50 vials of the injection have tested positive for fungus
those vials were found in the @entity15 facility , as well as in clinics that received the medication

@entity39 is new territory for health officials , as it 's not typically seen , @entity27 told reporters thursday
however , it can be difficult to find , meaning a patient whose fungal test is negative is not in the clear
doctors are encouraged to be diligent in following up with patients , he said
meningitis outbreak : your questions answered in addition , symptoms from @entity39 can take a long time to develop
patients who received the injections should remain vigilant for " at least several months after injection , " @entity27 said

curing the infection requires a long course of treatment
the @entity7 is recommending two anti-fungal drugs , which are very strong and can be difficult for patients to tolerate , @entity27 said .
