-- remember " @entity1 " ? the anti-gun documentary that attempted to politicize the tragic school shooting at @entity4 , @entity5 , was wildly successful , both critically and commercially , and even won its writer / director , @entity6 , an @entity8
but while the film was certainly entertaining , and may have even got some folks thinking about gun violence , it did little to move the needle on its presumptive goal : curbing gun ownership and weakening the @entity15
that 's because gun owners and the powerful lobby that represents them do n't care what @entity21 thinks of them , a lesson producer @entity16 will learn soon
@entity16 " reluctantly " told @entity24 that he 's planning a movie that will make the @entity15 " wish they were n't alive
" on friday night , in an exclusive interview pre-taped with @entity28 , he says that none other than @entity30 will star as an anti-gun senator
for so many reasons , @entity16 deserves a good , hard reality check
for one , there 's the obvious and almost comical hypocrisy
@entity16 's profited immensely from portraying graphic gun violence in films such as " @entity38 " and " @entity39
" his sudden attack of social conscience is astounding and curiously timed
in the same @entity28 interview , he says he 'll stop making movies that glamorize guns
but according to @entity46 , " @entity45 " and " @entity47 : a dame to kill for " are in the works
maybe he means starting ... now
for another thing , overtly ideological films -- think " @entity52 " and " @entity53 " -- bomb at the box office
theatergoers do n't want to be lectured by @entity21 for two hours on what they think is wrong with the country
opinion : when will @entity61 wake up to gun violence ? if we 're to assume @entity16 is motivated by a deep concern about gun violence ( and not sheer arrogance ) , then it 's also worth pointing out that he 's got the wrong target
the @entity15 represents law - abiding gun owners , not criminals
a gangbanger in @entity73 does n't care about the @entity15 , is n't motivated or supported by the @entity15 , and may not even know what the @entity15 is
in vowing to take down this powerful organization supported by millions of law - abiding citizens , @entity16 will simply end up empowering and emboldening it
and lastly , the effort most certainly wo n't rid the country of guns ( a goal he 's admitted to having , unless there 's another @entity83 in which case he very much wants a gun , or something
the @entity87 , a trade association for the @entity61 firearms industry , calculates that from 2002 , the year " @entity1 " came out , to 2011 , there 's been a 54.1 % rise in the number of federal background checks , one way of measuring an increase in gun sales
and remember , that movie was actually successful
proving the nation 's gun owners not only do n't care about @entity21 's dictates but @entity101 's either , in the year since the tragic @entity102 , @entity103 , shooting -- and despite significant efforts from the @entity106 administration and other @entity107 to push increased gun control , gun sales are up 8 %
@entity16 may find this lamentable and even reprehensible
he 's entitled to his opinion
and he 's also entitled to spend @entity21 money on a movie in which @entity30 is paid to rail against a constitutionally protected right and a robust and defensive @entity61 community
but i promise , every penny he makes will be multiplied manyfold in @entity15 contributions
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity122 .
