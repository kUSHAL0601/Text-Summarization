@entity1 was hacked late friday by someone who made " cosmetic " changes on the popular petition website , officials said
no personal information was stolen , spokesman @entity5 said in a written statement
he added that none of the 12 petitions targeted had its number of signatures affected
the modified petitions included one calling for officials to end the prosecution of a @entity17 teen charged in connection with a same - sex relationship with a 14 - year - old ; a petition to close the detention center at @entity23 ; and a petition to allow gay @entity26 leaders , said @entity27 , a spokeswoman for @entity1
change.org officials believe the petitions were selected because they were all in a featured section of the website and were n't picked because of the causes they represent , she said
@entity5 said the hacker exploited a " minor vulnerability " and made changes to text and photos on the petitions
the flaw was fixed while the website was offline , he said
@entity1 , based in @entity41 , @entity42 , says it has 35 million users in 196 countries
successful @entity1 campaigns have included one in which a petitioner asked @entity49 to rescind a $ 5 - per - month fee on bank cards
the petition received more than 300,000 signatures and helped to spark wide media coverage .
