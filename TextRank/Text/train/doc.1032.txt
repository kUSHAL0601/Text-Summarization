@entity0 , @entity1 -- world powers meeting friday in @entity1 called for a political solution in @entity5 and what one diplomat called a " tsunami wave " of pressure to peel away internal support for the embattled regime of @entity12
" we agreed on increasing the pressure on @entity12 , getting humanitarian aid in as quickly as possible and preparing for a democratic transition , " @entity14 secretary of state @entity13 told reporters
" that was my message , and that was the message of the chairman statement that reflected the consensus reached here
" that consensus was reached during a day of meetings by the " @entity26 " in the cradle of the @entity28 , where participants laid out the groundwork for a political transition in @entity5 , not unlike the international planning that preceded the changes in @entity34 , where @entity36 's regime was toppled last year
representatives of dozens of countries and entities developed a plan to deliver immediate humanitarian aid , to give political legitimacy to the @entity44 opposition and to endorse the idea of a joint @entity48 - @entity47 peacekeeping force
as the conference unfolded , @entity52 volunteer rescue crews evacuated seven wounded people in the besieged @entity44 city of @entity56 to @entity57 on the outskirts of the city 's @entity56 neighborhood , a spokeswoman for the @entity50 said
twenty unhurt @entity44 were also taken to safety , she said
the evacuation of victims marks a glimmer of hope for residents who 'd been pinned down under shelling and sniper fire for weeks
@entity50 spokeswoman @entity69 told @entity2 that the organization planned to ask @entity44 authorities for a pause in the fighting every day
" we would prefer to have a two - hour humanitarian pause daily , where we would enter the different affected areas , including @entity56 , and deliver much - needed humanitarian aid , " she said in a telephone interview from @entity75
asked whether international journalists wounded in the city would be taken out , @entity69 said the mission was " to evacuate all wounded and sick in urgent need of medical assistance without any exception
" the state - run @entity86 ( @entity86 ) , citing an official source at the @entity89 , said @entity52 vehicles were dispatched friday , " for humanitarian considerations , to retrieve the foreign journalists who entered @entity5 illegally
the source added that the armed groups in @entity56 declined to hand over an injured journalist and the bodies of two others , which jeopardizes the life of the injured journalist and thwarts efforts to return the two bodies to their countries
" activists acknowledged that they had declined to turn over the journalists ' bodies or the wounded journalists unless civilians also were taken to safety
they said the wounded journalists agreed with that decision
in addition , they said , friday 's ambulance runs were carried out as shelling continued in the area
the meeting in @entity0 took place as @entity44 security forces continued a nearly year - long crackdown on civilian protesters
@entity121 foreign policy chief @entity120 said friday that the " humanitarian situation and lack of access for food and medical supplies is our most urgent and immediate concern
" at least 103 people were killed friday
the dead include 18 corpses found in the @entity133 town of @entity134 and 30 people in @entity56 , the epicenter of resistance that has endured 21 days of daily shelling , according to the @entity139 , a network of opposition groups
@entity86 said terrorists shot and killed a law enforcement member and wounded two others friday in @entity56
it also said that dozens of members of " armed terrorist groups " in the city had surrendered and given their weapons to authorities
regarding events in @entity0 , @entity44 state television was dismissive
" it is quite ironic that in a conference called ' @entity154 , ' we have n't seen one @entity44 delivering a speech , " said an anchor , who added that the conference was dominated by " icons from the colonial era who are conspiring against @entity5 and the @entity48 world
" a guest implied that some of the countries in attendance had been paid , bribed or ordered to show up against their will
at the conference , @entity167 said the end of @entity12 's regime " can mark a new beginning
" she urged a negotiated political solution and a democratic transition for @entity5 , and announced that the @entity14 is providing $ 10 million for humanitarian efforts
@entity167 also said the " crimes against humanity must stop
" in a statement , the @entity178 said it was seeking international recognition " as the legitimate representative of the @entity44 people
" the group formed last october as a coalition of local coordinating committees , political , ethnic and religious groups
it asked for humanitarian assistance and the creation of safe havens inside @entity5 to protect refugees seeking sanctuary
" the clear goal of the @entity178 and one for which tens of thousands of @entity44 have died or suffered is to achieve full regime change through a process controlled by the @entity44 themselves , " the statement said
@entity167 gave the group qualified support , calling it " a leading , legitimate representative of @entity44 seeking peaceful democratic change
" she continued to hold out hope for a political solution
" @entity12 can still make the choice to end the violence , save lives and spare his country from descending further into ruin but , if he continues to reject that choice , we and the @entity44 people will keep pressure on him until his deadly regime cracks and collapses , because it will , " she said
and she appealed to @entity12 's security forces to end the killing
" their continuing to kill their brothers and sisters is a stain on their honor , " she said
" their refusal to continue this slaughter will make them heroes in the eyes of not only @entity44 , but people of conscience everywhere
they can help the guns fall silent
we know from many sources there are people around @entity12 who are beginning to hedge their bets
they did n't sign up to slaughter people , and they are looking for ways out
" she made no reference to helping the militias fighting the @entity12 regime
but @entity245 foreign minister @entity244 said that arming the @entity44 opposition is an " excellent idea
" @entity14 officials have said they are not ready to take that step but they have not ruled out other options
@entity167 said she would address the issue later
in @entity254 , @entity14 president @entity253 said he was " encouraged by the international unity " displayed in @entity0
" we are going to continue to keep the pressure up and look for every tool available to prevent the slaughter of innocents in @entity5 , " he said
neither @entity261 , which is a @entity263 - era ally and arms dealer to @entity5 , nor @entity265 is participating in the @entity1 meeting
both countries vetoed the @entity47 resolution
the nations participating in the meeting unveiled a plan for delivering emergency aid
it called on @entity12 to " immediately cease all violence " and allow unimpeded access for aid , an effort that would be spearheaded by the @entity47
the @entity47 is expected to play a major role in a @entity5
former @entity47 secretary - general @entity279 was named thursday joint special envoy of the @entity47 and @entity281 on the @entity44 crisis
the @entity26 stressed that an alternative to @entity12 exists and it believes it can persuade traditional regime supporters , such as business elites , the military and minority @entity287 -- who prevail in the military -- to switch allegiances
" to those @entity44 who still support @entity12 , especially members of the @entity44 military : understand that this regime has no future , " @entity167 said
" the longer you carry out its campaign of violence , the more it will stain your honor
but if you refuse to take part in attacks on your fellow citizens , your countrymen will hail you as heroes
" a senior @entity306 official said members of the council told @entity167 they were pleased with the conference turnout and the initiative
" the @entity44 people have not surrendered , nor will they give up , " @entity178 leader @entity311 said
" a free people was born in @entity5 and it does not fear death , nor does it accept any bargain to give away its long - deprived rights or give up its sovereignty by any definition
" the @entity26 intends to address economic issues by creating a working group on economic recovery and development , a diplomat said
the diplomat said the conference communique will endorse the @entity281 's request to the @entity326 to form a joint @entity48 - @entity47 peacekeeping force after the cessation of violence
@entity2 's @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity338 contributed to this report .
