-- world no. 1 @entity1 lost his cool in the midst of a heatwave at the @entity6 as @entity7 stepped up his challenge to usurp the 2011 @entity10 champion at the top of the rankings
@entity1 , from @entity13 , struggled to a two - over - par round of 74 on the opening day at the @entity16 course while @entity7 , the defending champion , sits within striking distance of the leaders on four - under
@entity7 can regain the no. 1 spot with victory at the tournament and must finish in the top eight to have a chance of overtaking @entity1
his six birdies helped him into a tie for eighth place
@entity29 's @entity28 and @entity13 's @entity30 lead on six - under after day one with @entity32 's @entity31 and @entity33 , from @entity34 , in a group of five players one shot back
@entity7 targets no. 1 spot after @entity39 award @entity1 's round included a run of four bogeys in five holes and at one stage he hurled a club to the floor in frustration after a poor shot
" it 's a bit of deja vu from last year , " he told reporters
" i kept getting off to good starts and sort of making a few bogeys around the turn and not getting any momentum back
" two under through seven , feel like i 'm playing well , then i make four bogeys in five holes
it 's pretty disappointing and i feel like i 'm playing pretty well , i just need to go out there and shoot a score
" @entity1 's compatriot @entity61 's round turned sour shortly after he 'd walked off the 18th green as his ball was shown to have moved prior to hitting his second shot from the rough on the closing hole
the 2010 @entity10 champion was unaware the ball had moved and he was penalised two strokes -- one for not replacing the ball into its original position and one for striking it from the wrong place
it turned his round of level par into a round of two - over
he told reporters : " how are you supposed to attempt to place the ball when you 're not sure it 's moved in the first place ? it 's just a harsh one -- one of those freak scenarios in golf
" it 's my fault
i probably should have called for a referee
that would have saved me one shot , but what are you supposed to do -- the whole area was sort of bouncing
" i was aware of it and asked for it to be looked at
the rules are there for everybody 's protection
" three - time major champion @entity98 , from @entity99 , is on four - under and compatriot @entity100 , the @entity100 champion , finished on three - under
former world no. 1 @entity101 , who was beaten by @entity7 in a playoff at last year 's tournament , birdied the last to finish two - under .
