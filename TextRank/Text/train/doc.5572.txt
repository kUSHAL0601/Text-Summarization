-- smartphones are n't just smart , they 're personal computers
unlike a desktop or even a laptop pc , those devices and other mobile phones can easily slip out of a pocket or purse , be left in a taxi , or get snatched off a table
they let you store photos , access e-mails , receive text messages , and put you one browser click away from potentially malicious web sites
in effect , gadgets like the @entity18 and those running @entity22 's @entity21 software can be as risky to use as pcs , except that the wide variety of mobile platforms has deprived malicious hackers of one dominant software element to target , such as they have with @entity31 's @entity30 operating system on desktops and laptops
here is a look at the different types of threats that affect smartphone users and what people can do to protect themselves
what 's the biggest security threat to my mobile phone ? losing it
" you are way more likely to leave it in the back of a taxi than to have someone break into it , " @entity46 , a principal analyst at consultancy @entity47 , said in a recent interview
the best way to protect data in the event of losing a device is to not store sensitive information on it , he said
if you must store sensitive information on it , use a password on the phone and encrypt the data
devices can be configured so that they ask for a password every time e-mail or a vpn is accessed
use a strong enough password that a stranger ca n't guess it
and back up your data frequently
there are also ways to lock the phone remotely or wipe the data if it is stolen
@entity81 spokesman @entity80 said users who lose their phone should call the company immediately and " with just a keystroke , we can prevent anyone else from using the phone -- and from running up charges
" a number of companies offer software and services to protect mobile phones
one of them is a start - up called @entity93 that offers a web - based service that backs up the data , remotely wipes the data if stolen , can help locate the device , and includes antivirus and firewall protection
mobile device users should also be careful about leaving the phone unattended , or loaning it to people
spyware can be installed without you knowing it if someone has physical access to the device and knows your password -- if you have one set
for instance , the @entity111 program can be used with @entity114 devices to remotely turn the microphone on to eavesdrop on nearby conversations
however , a spokesperson for @entity114 maker @entity118 points out that if the application is installed , the user would be able to see it running and could then remove it
can mobile phones get viruses ? yes
@entity126 viruses , worms and @entity128 have been around for years
they typically arrive via e-mail but can also spread via sms and other means
mobile phone users should be diligent in installing security software and other updates for their devices
all the major desktop security vendors have mobile antivirus and related offerings
in november , several worms hit the @entity18 , but only devices that had been jailbroken so they can run apps other than those approved by @entity146
one worm changes the wallpaper on affected devices to a photo of 80s pop singer @entity152 of " @entity154 " fame
the second , more dangerous worm attempts to remotely control affected iphones and steal data such as bank login ids
jailbroken iphones have also been directly hacked via sms , including by one @entity161 hacker who was demanding $ 7 from victims for information on how to secure their iphones
@entity46 says : " do n't jailbreak your phone
it breaks all the security , basically
" if you simply must jailbreak it , you should change the default root password and not install @entity172 ( @entity172 network protocol )
what are other types of attacks ? just like with computer users , smartphone users are vulnerable to e-mail and web - based attacks like phishing and other social - engineering efforts
all attackers have to do is create a malicious web page and lure someone to visit the site where malware can then be downloaded onto the mobile device
people should avoid clicking on links in e-mails and text messages on their mobile device
read faq : recognizing phishing e-mails @entity131 offers another avenue for attack
last year , researchers demonstrated several ways of attacking phone using sms messages
in one , they exploited a vulnerability in the way the @entity18 handles @entity131 messages
researchers also showed how an attacker could spoof an sms to make it look like it comes from the carrier to get the target to either download malware or visit a site hosting it
in another proof - of - concept attack , a text message was used to launch a web browser on a mobile device and direct it to a site that could host malware
when the attack is used to phish for personal information it is referred to as " @entity222
" is it safe to use @entity224 and @entity225 ? yes and no. if you are doing something sensitive on your phone , like checking a bank account or making a payment , do n't use the free @entity224 at a coffee shop or other access point
use your password - protected @entity224 at home or the cellular network to avoid what is called as a man - in - the - middle attack in which traffic is intercepted
pairing a mobile phone with another @entity225 - enabled device , like a headset , means any device that can " discover " another @entity225 device can send unsolicited messages or do things that could lead to extra fees , data being compromised or corrupted , data stolen in an attack called " bluesnarfing , " or the device being infected with a virus
in general , disable @entity224 and @entity225 unless you absolutely need to use them
which is safer : the @entity18 or @entity21 ? @entity146 vets all the apps that are used on the @entity18 , and that tight regulation of the apps store has kept users safe from malicious apps so far
nothing is foolproof , however
once apps are approved they can do any number of things
for instance , @entity146 removed free games in november developed by @entity265 that were found to be collecting users ' phone numbers
from an architecture standpoint , @entity21 offers more granular access control
but the open - source nature of the @entity21 platform means apps are n't as controlled as they are on the @entity18 and holes can be introduced by any number of parties
for instance , @entity46 found a vulnerability in the @entity21 mobile platform last year that could have allowed an attacker to remotely take control of the browser , access credentials , and install a keystroke logger if the user visited a malicious web page
the hole was not in code written by @entity22 , but was contributed by a third party to the open - source @entity289
however , any risk was mitigated by an application sandboxing technique @entity22 uses that is designed to protect the device from unauthorized or malicious software that gets onto the phone , @entity22 said
@entity46 recommends that @entity21 users only download software from trustworthy vendors and reputable sites
are standard mobile phones safe ? obviously regular mobile phones do n't pose the web - based threats that smartphones do
but they are still used to store sensitive information that can be accessed by gaining access to the device
for instance , the inbox and outbox for text messages can contain information that can be used for identity fraud , said @entity315 , a senior analyst for consumer mobility at @entity317
" regardless of what type of cell phone , the most dangerous current threat is through a cellphone 's in / out message boxes , " he said
" @entity323 ( them ) out regularly
do not transmit full account numbers , pin or passwords within a text message unless you immediately delete the out box message
" standard phones that support @entity332 can be susceptible to certain threats that smartphones are
for instance , scammers in @entity336 and @entity337 are hiding a @entity128 in pirated software that surreptitiously sends sms messages to premium rate numbers - costing as much as $ 5 each , thus racking up huge bills , said @entity343 , a senior antivirus researcher at @entity344 and what about spam ? that 's a growing problem on mobile devices
