-- in a twist of fate , the hosts ' vanquishers became the heroes
@entity7 's @entity6 's late , late strike made the difference in the final against @entity10 , and his sublime goal prevented @entity13 's neighbors and arch - rivals from lifting the trophy
the two finalists played out an entertaining match that left both the teams ' fans and neutrals on the edge of their seats until almost the last kick of the game
ultimately , all it lacked was the goals that these @entity13 crowds have come to expect
huge street party the @entity30 capital came alive at the final whistle , with cars taking to the packed streets , waving @entity30 flags and scarves
up to 500,000 fans packed into the huge fan zone in the center of the city , which was extended to 1.3 kilometer from the city 's iconic @entity40 to accommodate the throngs of expectant fans
the city , whose mood was n't dampened by the rain that fell throughout the match , hosted fans from all over the country , and beyond
the crowd in the @entity53 district of @entity54 erupted as @entity6 's goal went in on the 113th minute
the @entity57 star took @entity59 's pass on his chest before displaying exquisite technique to volley the ball past @entity63
the raucous street parties that followed were intermittently interrupted by celebratory car horns
it is the country 's fourth @entity67 , and its first as a unified @entity7
fans in the capital told @entity0 that they planned to party well into the early hours of the morning
traveling fans celebrate in @entity72 outside @entity72 's famous stadium , @entity30 fans were equally delirious
" i feel very , very good , this is the best day of my life , " a exuberant fan named @entity76 told @entity0 outside the stadium
" we say before the @entity81 , this is an amazing place , but i must say this is a fantastic day for my whole life
" many of the @entity86 spectators at the @entity81 in @entity72 left before the award presentation was over , distressed and angry at their team 's narrow defeat
the heartbreak continues , at least for another four years , when the tournament will kick off again in @entity92
in the end , though , no one could begrudge @entity7 their fourth @entity67
the team which triumphed also scored the highest number of goals , and produced arguably the most exciting football -- including that 7 - 1 blowout against the hosts in the semifinal

here , @entity7 weathered the storm of @entity10 chances

" they left everything on the pitch
" the @entity30 players marveled at a result which stemmed from many years work , which began under the previous coach , @entity148
lasting legacy " it is unbelievable , " @entity30 keeper @entity152 , who also picked up the tournament 's @entity154 award for best goalkeeper , told @entity30 football magazine kicker
" the team has done superbly , not only the players , but also the team behind the team
at some point we will stop celebrating , but we will always stand up again with a smile
" the feeling of incredulity was echoed by his teammate , captain @entity166 , who lifted trophy in front of thousands of fans in @entity72 , alongside ten world leaders , including the @entity30 chancellor , @entity172
" it 's unbelievable what we have achieved , " said the @entity57 defender
" we improved throughout the tournament and did n't get down when things did n't always go our way
" we just stuck to our path and at the end we 're standing here as world champions
it 's an unbelievable feeling

" positive press the world 's sports media praised the @entity30 victory , with @entity191 of @entity193 @entity192 tweeting , " @entity7 deserving winners , on the night and overall
thoroughly satisfying final between two really good sides , though
" @entity198 ' @entity197 tweeted his agreement

began by thrashing @entity202 and ended by beating both @entity204 giants
" @entity206 , named @entity208 winner for an outstanding tournament , could n't fulfill his destiny in the final
plagued by comparisons with that other @entity86 great , @entity213 , @entity206 could n't replicate his usual form in this match
however , @entity128 dismissed suggestions that this left him short of @entity213 's achievements
" he 's already an all - time great , " he said
" he 's very tired after a long season
" coping with loss @entity10 's @entity222 , who kept his team 's hopes alive with a heroic , last - ditch tackle on @entity225 during the semifinal against the @entity227 , said that the pain of losing was " immense
" the teary - eyed vice-captain , who has likely seen his last @entity67 finals , said that while his team had the lion 's share of chances , they could n't convert them
" we wanted to win this for the people of @entity10 , for those who came here to support us , but we lost
" we have represented our country the best we could , though
we have to lift our heads despite the pain
we gave everything we could out there
" and we only had to last another five minutes at the end
we just did n't have that little bit of luck that you need in a final
" bizarre moments at the @entity67 final four takeaways from @entity67 2014 correction : we originally stated that @entity6 scored in the 119th minute , not the 113th
this has now been amended .
