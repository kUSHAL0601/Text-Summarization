@entity0 -- president @entity3 's critics have the right to be upset by his decision to shield from deportation , at least temporarily , some groups of undocumented immigrants
but they do n't have the right to twist the facts , use inflammatory language and create confusion
they 're the ones who are most confused
they do n't appear to have the foggiest idea how the process would work
that 's their own fault
they should have paid closer attention two years ago , the last time the administration did something like this , with the program known as @entity26
simply put , @entity3 is using the executive power granted to him by the @entity28 to reshuffle the immigration enforcement deck and prioritize deportations so that , for instance , the undocumented parents of @entity33 - born citizens get a temporary " deferred " status and thus ca n't be removed for three years
but you should read the fine print
there are a lot of strings attached , and there is no guarantee that some of these people wo n't be deported
it 's a crap shoot for undocumented immigrants , which explains why only a little over half of the young people who were eligible for @entity26 took the risk and applied for it , according to the @entity51
no one can say what will happen when @entity3 's new deferment expires
a lot will depend on the political mood at the time , and what the new president will decide , in 2017 , to do with immigrants who are holding these deferments
there could be extensions offered , or it could be the end of the road
if it 's the latter , a large number of undocumented immigrants -- media reports have put the potential figure at 5 million , although the actual figure is likely to be much lower , given the response to @entity26 -- will be deportable once again
the administration has said that the new program -- which it is calling @entity74 , @entity75 -- would work much the same way as its predecessor , @entity26
@entity3 announced that program in june 2012 and it took effect about six months later
under @entity26 , undocumented young people brought here as children can apply for a two - year " deferred action " that lets them remain in the country temporarily without fear of being deported
yet there is a catch -- when you deal with government , there 's always a catch
i 'll explain what it is in a minute
but first , let 's listen to what has been coming from the sky - is - falling chorus in the @entity99
@entity3 's conservative critics really do say the darnedest things
a recurring theme is that @entity3 is acting outside the law , rewriting the law or ignoring the law
when i asked one conservative commentator to explain , he said : " well , there was a law on the books that said a person ca n't be in the country illegally ? now they can
he did no such thing
@entity3 merely applied to the enforcement of immigration laws something that all police , prosecutors and judges have : discretion
now it turns out i have to explain this simple concept to @entity3 himself
this week , the president responded to hecklers at a speech in @entity130 who were demanding that he ease up on deportations by insisting that he had just taken action to " change " the law
meanwhile , law professors and other legal experts have come forward to say that @entity3 did not , in fact , change the law and that he has the @entity28 on his side when it comes to using executive power
conservative critics are wrong that he went so far as to " change " the law , and @entity3 was wrong to agree with them
other critics went even further and suggested that @entity3 was n't just changing the law but actually " canceling " it
no president can cancel a law , or repeal a law , or strike down a law
only @entity149 can do that
but this brings us back to the " catch " in @entity3 's executive action
those of us who have interviewed @entity26 recipients and studied how that program works will find it difficult to take seriously the concerns raised by critics who are unfamiliar with the subject matter
you see , while the administration has n't yet released the procedures for applying for @entity74 , @entity163 officials have said that the new program will be modeled on @entity26
this means that qualifying for this temporary reprieve from deportation wo n't be a walk in the park
here 's what happens under @entity26 : the first thing that an undocumented immigrant must do is contact the friendly neighborhood office of @entity177 and declare that he or she is in the country illegally
immigrants who do that are then subjected to background checks and fingerprinted
files are created with their names on them , where the government will keep their home addresses , the names of their employers , if any , the names of everyone else who lives in their houses , etc. then each application is considered by @entity177 officials , and either approved or denied
if the application is approved , under @entity26 the immigrant could remain in the @entity33 for three years -- unless the policy is rescinded by a future president
if it is denied , there is no appeal and the government has all of the immigrant 's personal information
so much for staying in the shadows
so tell me again how @entity3 is " canceling " existing immigration law
if that is the case , then how it is that the whole process for obtaining deferred action for @entity26 -- and likely for @entity74 too -- begins with undocumented immigrants , in essence , surrendering to authorities ? if immigration law is really no longer in effect , why do these people have to bother turning themselves in at all , getting fingerprinted and all the rest ? also , if immigration law is really being repealed , then under what authority will immigration agents be deciding the fate of @entity74 applicants ? in fact , if the immigration law is canceled , would n't these agents be out of a job ? after all , once you strike down a law , it 's difficult to enforce it
you think all this makes for a sweet deal for the undocumented ? not exactly the free ride that @entity3 's critics think it is -- that is , if they were thinking at all .
