after staying away from the news of the attack , @entity0 felt so outraged that she had to say something
" being a mother , having a 6 - year - old daughter , how do i explain it to her ? ' no , this is not us ? ' " said the @entity5 from @entity6
the immigration worker 's powerful video message hit on the emotions some @entity5 around the world were feeling : outrage , disgust and shame
" i am just livid , " said the 31 - year - old
" i do n't know why we feel that it 's ok to kill innocent people in the name of protecting something that does not need or require protection
i am really sorry to the whole world as a @entity5 that we have some ignorant people that have taken some very ignorant actions in the name of faith
" to be clear , @entity32 and other @entity5 who spoke to @entity3 were not apologizing for their beliefs -- some are apologizing to the world on behalf of their religion , sullied by the few @entity5 extremists who attacked @entity38 satirical magazine @entity37 this week
of the 12 people who died , four were cartoonists and one was a @entity5 police officer on the scene
@entity43 , a self - described feminist , converted to @entity44 two months after september 11
the @entity46 resident wears a hijab and says she has felt more stares than normal after the @entity50 terror attack
" i fear the attack will mean that people will be more likely to sneer at me , to call me names in public , or even attack me , " she said
" but i hope that it means that people will ask me questions about my faith and that i can make it clear that these attacks have no place in @entity44
" i 'm a feminist and i converted to @entity44 perception is also playing into @entity65 's mind
the 20 - year - old student from @entity67 , @entity68 , is no longer thinking of studying abroad in @entity38
the attack made him suspect that some @entity38 might look upon @entity5 differently after wednesday 's attack
meanwhile , @entity72 , an @entity74 living in @entity75 , @entity76 , was initially angry at the " hijackers " of her religion
but she became angrier when she realized she would have to reassure the people around her that " this is not @entity44
" " i want to reaffirm my intense alarm and disheartening at the deaths of the @entity37 staff members
but i will not apologize for my beliefs or my religion , " she said
@entity72 sees this time as an opportunity to educate people
" it means i will persevere even harder to learn more about my faith so i can counter misunderstanding and discrimination in a positive manner , the way @entity94 did it
