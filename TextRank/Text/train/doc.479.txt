-- amputees will soon get help from a groundbreaking bionic arm , thanks to the inventor of the segway and a little inspiration from " @entity7
" after almost eight years of research and testing , the @entity8 has approved the @entity12 arm , a prosthetic controlled by signals from the brain
unlike most current prostheses , the @entity12 can perform such delicate tasks as zipping up a coat , unlocking a door with a key or handling an egg without breaking it
funded by @entity24 , the research branch of the @entity25 , the @entity12 project was overseen by @entity26 , who invented the @entity5 personal vehicle
@entity26 nicknamed the @entity12 arm " @entity29 " after @entity29 , the " @entity7 " hero who was fitted for a prosthetic after losing his right hand in a light - saber duel with @entity33
the @entity8 is calling the device the first prosthetic arm that can perform multiple , simultaneous movements via electromyogram electrodes , which detect electrical signals from the contraction of muscles close to where the prosthesis is attached
the battery - powered arm is about the size and weight of a natural limb and has six different grips
a computer in the device can tell what type of movement its wearer wants to make
" this innovative prosthesis provides a new option for people with certain kinds of arm amputations , " said @entity53 , director of the @entity8 's @entity54
the @entity12 arm " may allow some people to perform more complex tasks than they can with current prostheses in a way that more closely resembles the natural motion of the arm
" the @entity12 bionic arm can be configured for people with limb loss at the shoulder joint , mid upper arm or mid lower arm , the @entity8 said
it can not be fitted for someone whose arm was amputated at the elbow or wrist
one of the device 's first users was double amputee @entity79 , who lost both arms in an electrical accident
@entity79 has been demonstrating the @entity12 arm on national tv news programs since at least 2009
" i never thought in my lifetime i 'd see something this functional come out , " he told @entity0 's @entity85 in 2010
" it 's definitely going to change my life , and more importantly it 's going to change the life of my family
because ... i 'm going to be less dependent on them
" in considering whether to approve the device , the @entity8 reviewed a @entity96 study involving 36 participants fitted with @entity12 arms
the study found that about 90 % of participants were able to perform activities they were not able to perform with their current prosthesis , such as using keys and locks , preparing food , feeding themselves and brushing their hair
a video demonstration on @entity24 's website shows a man using the bionic arm to transfer eggs from one carton to another without breaking them
the device was developed by @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118
@entity8 approval means that @entity12 can now legally market and sell the bionic arm in the @entity121 .
