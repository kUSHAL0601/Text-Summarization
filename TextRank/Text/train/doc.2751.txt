@entity0 -- the newspaper that published an online , interactive map of handgun permit holders in two suburban @entity0 counties hired armed guards to protect its office after negative backlash from the map publication , according to a local police report
the january 1 report from the @entity13 police department in @entity14 confirms the presence of armed private security guards at the @entity17
the incident report stemmed from e-mail responses to the newspaper 's online map
the police statement says @entity23 , the paper 's @entity14 editor , reported " that she received an e-mail from an unknown subject who wrote that he wondered what ( she ) would get in her mail now
" " the e-mail was brief and did not contain any threats , " the police report continues , adding that the officer who wrote it told @entity23 " the e-mail did not constitute an offense
" the report adds that a private company " is doing private security work on location at the @entity17 ... ( the company 's ) employees are armed and will be on site ... through at least january 2 , 2013
" @entity45 gun background checks hit record highs the @entity17 did not immediately respond wednesday when asked by @entity1 for comment
the armed guards ' presence at @entity17 comes after gun - owning blogger @entity50 posted the home addresses of newspaper staffers on his blog in response to the map , which was published online on december 22
@entity50 spoke to @entity1 's " starting point with @entity59 " last week to explain his reasoning behind the posting
" i felt they were using this ( the interactive map showing gun permit - holders ' addresses ) to harass gun owners , " @entity60 said
" so i harassed them back
" @entity60 posted the name , home address and phone numbers of the @entity17 ' publisher , editor , visual editor and several other staff members
@entity60 told @entity1 's " @entity75 " that he was offended by the newspaper 's actions and " wondered how they would like it if their addresses were published
" the map , published by the @entity17 , allows readers to zoom in on red dots that indicate which residents in @entity85 and @entity14 counties are licensed to own pistols or revolvers
blue dots indicated permit holders who " have purchased a firearm or updated the information on a permit in the past five years
" airport screeners discover more than 1,500 guns in 2012 the paper 's publisher , @entity96 , president of the @entity97 , defended the decision december 26 in a statement
" one of our roles is to report publicly available information on timely issues , even when unpopular
we knew publication of the database ( as well as the accompanying article providing context ) would be controversial , but we felt sharing information about gun permits in our area was important in the aftermath of the @entity108 shootings , " she said , referring to the school shooting in @entity108 , @entity109 , in december .
