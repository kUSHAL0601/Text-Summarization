the rockets start raining down at her kibbutz usually around late morning
that leaves @entity4 precious little time to walk her two dogs and then dash into the shower
because when those rockets arrive -- triggering air raid sirens that fill the air with short , shrill howls -- she has to be ready to duck and take cover in her indoor bomb shelter
there , all she can do is wait
* * * * on the other side of the border , across the security fence in @entity19 , @entity17 has no safe room to run to
the fighter jets can come any time , day or night
and in this place , one of the most congested on earth , there 's a high probability that if a bomb falls nearby , it might destroy her house , too
so , all she can do is pray
* * * * this is n't what life was always like for either woman
but ever since the long simmering tension between @entity37 and @entity38 flared up this week , rockets and airstrikes have crisscrossed between @entity19 and @entity37
neither woman cares for the politics of hate
they just want to live a life of peace and safety
but the new normal has upended everything -- for them and for those around them fear for daughter 's border wedding one fence , two fates @entity4 lives in @entity56 , a @entity58 community in @entity59 , just over a mile and a half from the border with @entity19
the fortified safe room has become the focus of @entity4 's life around the clock
" everything is ready to make it easy to run ( to the safe room ) , " she says
she has shoved her coffee table , her carpet , anything that blocks her path off to the side , so she can make it there in seconds
authorities warn that it takes a rocket just 15 seconds to land after the warning has sounded
" it 's not 15 seconds
it 's closer to 10 , " she says
" sometimes you hear boom and then you run
" @entity17 lives in @entity84
she 's afraid to use her real name
she does n't want her identity published , because she worries someone might misconstrue what she says as political statements , take offense and come after her
like @entity4 , the attacks have consumed her , without her wanting it to
she sits at home all day
when the power goes out , she sits in the dark , listening to sounds of bombs dropping
" the sound is very strong , " she says
close calls @entity4 is an online trainer
she works a lot from home
so , unlike many others , she does n't have to step outside much for work , and risk her life every time
but there have been close calls
since tensions spiked , the kibbutz store has kept minimal hours
it 's open for an hour in the morning and one in the afternoon
so raemer popped by recently to pick up rations
" i ran into the refrigerator room , " she says
four rockets have landed within the borders of @entity121 this week
she is also afraid of @entity123 digging tunnels underneath the kibbutz and filling them with explosives
collateral damage in @entity84 , neighbors poring through the ruins of what were homes has become a familiar sight
it happened again on tuesday when @entity37 warplanes flattened a house
it belonged to a member of the militant group @entity123 ' military wing
and several men were forming a human shield on the roof
before most strikes , the @entity37 military makes warning calls , known as a " knock on the roof , " to minimize civilian casualties
but , as cramped as @entity84 is , collateral damage is sometimes inevitable
seven people died in the tuesday attack , including two boys , ages 10 and 11
" in that house lived an old man and his wife and his five sons and their wives and their children and they hid , " said @entity153 , who does n't live too far from @entity17
" any @entity38 is a target
" when she hears about the deaths -- and she hears about them more and more each day -- @entity17 is overcome with emotion
" for the @entity38 , the people of @entity19 , all the people , " she says
it 's making everyone around have to get used to dying
monitoring news both she and @entity4 obsessively monitor the news
" i have three tvs in my house , " @entity4 says
" sometimes all three are on
" the news these days is depressing , discouraging , dread - inducing
more than 130 rockets fired at @entity37 civilians
more than 200 airstrikes in @entity19
more than two dozen @entity38 dead
about 1,000 @entity37 reservists called up for military service
and yet , they ca n't tune it out
@entity17 's daughter wanted to get out of the house tuesday and go to the university
but there were too many explosions outside
so she stayed in , with the tv on
they only have about six hours of spotty electricity a day , so they often fall back on their battery - powered radio to keep up
jittery nerves at @entity121 , every boom or hiss makes @entity4 jump
she thinks she and her neighbors have signs of post-traumatic stress
she fights it with humor , posting instructions online about how to cook in the middle of a rocket attack
run ! @entity205 , cook
run ! " she jokes
" it takes a lot longer to cook your meal that way
" since tuesday , most of the rumbling around her has come from outgoing fire -- @entity37 fire into @entity19
those booms and roars come without warning and shake her
it 's worse for the children
@entity223 and her husband , @entity224 , live in @entity225 , a community next door to @entity121
they have two daughters , ages 5 and 2
every time a door shuts hard or a loud car goes by , they flinch
she tries to keep them busy and takes them to a fortified kindergarten , for summer classes in arts and crafts
when sirens scream while they are on the road , she plucks the children from their @entity244 sedan , and ducks and covers with them on the ground
her 5 - year - old has caught on to what the sirens mean -- the hissing and crashing sound of rockets , the booms from across the border in @entity19 , shaking their windows
so common are the sounds that their parrot has learned to imitate them
from her home , @entity259 can see the bombs bursting over @entity19 and fears for parents there
" it 's hard not to think about the same situation with little kids over there , " she says
before @entity259 hangs up the phone she says that she still needs to get the most important thing off her chest : peace
" this is what we want and need for both sides ' sake
" staying put it did n't used to be this way
@entity4 has lived in @entity56 since 1975
she remembers a different time
she used to drive to @entity19 in her car
a man from @entity19 built her house
" they are not my enemies , " she says
" i have no doubt they want safety for their children
" @entity4 is rooted in the kibbutz
her grown son and daughter also live there and have safe houses in their homes
but after the first rockets fell , they left for central @entity37
@entity4 could have gone , too , but decided to stay back with her dogs
she interrupts the phone interview
" there was just a boom
did you hear it ? " waiting for the war @entity17 ca n't leave even if she wants to
the border crossings out of @entity19 are closed
" in all the world , there is nowhere like @entity19 , " she says , " a big jail for 2 million people
" so , she reads the @entity309 and waits for the war , which she is certain will come
another day when night falls , @entity4 hastily brushes her teeth , then hurries to bed in the safe room
the fighting heats up at night , and she feels safer in the fortress than in her bed
in @entity19 , sleep does n't come easy , @entity17 says
children curl up to sleep in their mothers ' laps , too scared to fall unconscious lest the bombs drop
when the sun comes up , @entity4 will spend her day running for her life
@entity17 will spend it , she says , waiting for death
flare - up in @entity37 - @entity38 violence : why now ? has the @entity329 crisis reached a tipping point ? @entity331 exhausted by crises , wars , clashes , upheavals
