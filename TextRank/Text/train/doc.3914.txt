-- @entity2 teams will face a different challenge at this weekend 's @entity4 as a new tire compound will be used in a race for the first time
official supplier @entity8 announced on tuesday that the medium and soft tires will be used for the event in the @entity13 port city of @entity14
the @entity17 firm 's motorsport director @entity15 said the decision was a result of the track surface on the street circuit and also the likelihood of warm weather
" tire wear on this circuit is likely to be quite high because of the track layout , the nature of the surface , and also the weather conditions , " @entity15 told @entity2 's official web site
latest @entity2 standings " for all these reasons , we 've selected the medium and soft tires , which should provide the teams with a good level of resistance , plenty of different opportunities for strategy and about a second per lap difference between the compounds
" although the medium compound was not used in any of the 2011 season 's opening seven races , the teams did get a chance to test it during a friday practice session ahead of the @entity47 @entity4
@entity48 , chief technical officer for the @entity0 - sponsored @entity49 , was satisfied with what he saw from the medium tire in @entity52 and is hoping his drivers can take advantage of the speed difference between the two available compounds
" the prime tire here is the medium which we are racing for the first time this season , " the 48 - year - old said
" we ran it in on friday in @entity47 and it behaved pretty well ... we will be looking closely at how it performs and how we can take advantage of the time difference between the primes and the options on saturday and sunday
" @entity8 took over from @entity70 as the sole tire supplier to the elite division of motorsport at the end of 2010
reigning world champion @entity75 leads the drivers ' standing for @entity78 , 60 points ahead of @entity81 's @entity80 in second place .
