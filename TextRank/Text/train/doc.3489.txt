editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- march 11 marks the one - year anniversary of the largest @entity20 catastrophe since @entity21 the unforgettable triple disaster was triggered by the 9.0 - magnitude @entity24 earthquake , resulting in a devastating tsunami and subsequent nuclear meltdown at the @entity28 power plant , the effects of which are still being felt today
three months after the earthquake , we set out for @entity31 with @entity33 - winning singer , songwriter and producer @entity35 , who has a strong affinity for @entity20 culture and has been strongly involved in @entity24 's music and fashion scenes for the last decade
we wanted to see how the young population of this iconic city was coping with the aftermath and ongoing elements of the crisis
what was most memorable in the capital was a darkened @entity47 , arguably the most famous crosswalk in the world , and a symbol of @entity31 the same way @entity52 is to @entity8 or @entity53 to @entity54
to see it with all the lights and advertisements and video screens turned off was profoundly unsettling , and immediately recalled the eerie quiet of lower @entity60 in the weeks after september 11
the rolling blackouts and voluntary power outages to conserve energy added to an atmosphere of nervous desolation already fostered by the flight of foreigners to their home countries and native @entity20 further south , as worried @entity31 residents tried to come to terms with the scope of the disaster and fear of the very air around them
at the same time , the city kept going
the spirit of post- 3/11 @entity24 and the resilience and stoicism of its citizens has drawn comparisons to the reaction of @entity8 and @entity85 residents in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , but it is also a testament to the more celebrated aspects of @entity24 's national character
the @entity20 people live in one of the most volatile regions in the world
the country 's islands are situated on the westernmost edge of the @entity98 and are regularly subjected to earthquakes , storms , and floods
the threat of calamity and exposure to the violence of nature is part of the daily fabric of @entity20 life
disaster is ingrained in the national psyche and has been an object of consistent cultural fixation -- it 's in their art , movies , and literature , and has been for centuries
see the rest of @entity120 at @entity5 what was exciting to witness amid the organized efforts at recovery and general collective response , was how the events of march 11 have spurred @entity20 youth to an interrogation of traditional society
for the first time in years , the national government and media are under widespread scrutiny , leading many citizens -- especially those in their 20s and 30s -- to turn inward and rely on each other for information via social media like @entity140 , blogs , @entity142 and @entity143
a noticeable shift has taken hold of @entity31 's creative class -- young @entity20 seem suddenly possessed of a social and political consciousness at odds with their generation 's portrayal as detached , passive and apathetic
there 's a fire in the hearts of the young creatives we spoke with and new questions that are just starting to be asked out loud
through art , creativity , entrepreneurship or protest , @entity31 's youth have begun asserting an active and individualistic will that runs counter to much of traditional @entity20 thinking
undeniably , @entity24 is at a crossroads
many of the old systems that governed the accepted @entity20 " life path " had already lost their clout long before march 11 -- assumptions like lifetime employment , job security , financial security started coming into question with the economic downturn of the previous decade
this is the story of the youth of @entity31 beginning to peer over the wall of the established structures to look for the other possibilities their society has to offer
and in the process , redefine their @entity20 identity and what it means to be young and creative in @entity24 today .
