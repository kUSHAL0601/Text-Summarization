-- @entity2 scientists revealed friday a first - of - its - kind image from space showing reflecting sunlight from a lake on @entity8 's largest moon , @entity9
it 's the first visual " smoking gun " evidence of liquid on the northern hemisphere of the moon , scientists said , and the first - ever photo from another world showing a " specular reflection " -- which is reflection of light from an extremely smooth surface and in this case , a liquid one
" this is the first time outside @entity28 we 've seen specular reflection from another liquid from another body , " said @entity23 , a scientist analyzing data from the @entity26 unmanned space probe
@entity23 said he was surprised when he first saw the photos transmitting from @entity26 , orbiting @entity8 about a billion miles from @entity28
" it was great because if you look at photos of planets , you mostly see nothing is happening
but in two hours we saw a glint of light getting brighter
" @entity9 's similarities to @entity28 have attracted @entity2 's attention for decades
it 's the only body besides our own in the solar system that is believed to have liquid on its surface
like @entity28 , @entity9 has an atmosphere which is mostly nitrogen
experts believe the presence of liquid on a planet or moon improves the chances that some kind of life could develop there
the photo comes from the spacecraft @entity26 , which has been searching for this kind of reflection since it began circling @entity8 in 2004
scientists with the @entity63 were able to use previous data from @entity26 to learn details about the reflection 's location on @entity9
the glint appears to be coming from the southern edge of a lake called @entity71 -- a massive body of methane that covers about 150,000 square miles ( 400,000 square kilometers )
that 's larger than the @entity75 , which is the largest lake on @entity28
the hunt for the specular reflection took five years , @entity2 said , because the moon 's northern half had been shrouded in winter darkness
" next , we want to find out more about @entity9 's liquid , " said @entity23
" do we have some kind of weather there ? do we have changes with seasons ? does it rain ? how does the liquid methane run across the surface ? " but @entity23 sounded a note of caution regarding the prospect of life in this case
" the temperature on @entity9 's surface is something like minus - 180 degrees @entity99 , " he said
" that means it 's very cold
" the project is based out of @entity2 's @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106
this is not the first evidence of liquid on @entity9
in 2008 , project members used infrared technology to discover a large lake in the moon 's southern hemisphere
but this recent discovery is a sure sign that liquid exists on the moon 's northern half
that region is believed to include larger basins that could hold more liquid .
