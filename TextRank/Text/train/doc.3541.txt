-- you probably know him best from season 11 of " @entity4
" but trainer @entity5 is more than just a temporary @entity7 replacement
the martial arts expert has a background in biomedical science and uses his knowledge of @entity13 and @entity14 fitness disciplines to train celebrities from @entity17 supermodels @entity18 and @entity19 to rap artist q - @entity20 when he 's not sweating with a-listers , @entity5 is traveling abroad to teach his favorite workout , capoeira
this mix of martial arts and dance was created by slaves in @entity29 and uses participants ' body weight to tone and strengthen
" it 's different -- that 's why i like it , " @entity5 says
" you know , it 's like i can out - swagger in capoeira
having swagger lifting ? uh , kind of
but i can really put my signature and personality and my stance on my capoeira
you 're going to know you 're doing it with @entity5
" @entity5 's also a judge on the online reality show " @entity49 , " where contestants compete to be the next big celebrity fitness trainer
he took a break on set to speak with @entity0 about the show , the art of motivation and our biggest nutrition downfall
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : why did you join " @entity61 " ? @entity5 : i think the fitness industry needs something like this
i think this is a great way to motivate ( new trainers ) and get them inspired and actually learn how to better themselves , not only as a personality but also as a business and a marketable commodity
truck driver dances off 97 pounds @entity0 : is there anything on the show that you 've really been shocked by or impressed by ? @entity5 : definitely shocked
i think there 's definitely been more newbies coming in that really have no clue about what they have to offer
what we 're judging is on five categories : the concept , marketability , user base , personality and star power
and a lot of people come in and do not have a concept
they do n't have any idea what the brand is , or they do n't have a name chosen out for it
that , to me , is pretty shocking
if you 're going to step up in the auditioning process for a show like this and want to get chosen as the next fitness star with a $ 150,000 grand prize , you 've got to really come in with a clear ( idea )
so it 's been a little frustrating
@entity0 : @entity107 is april 7 , and the theme this year is hypertension
what can people do to prevent high blood pressure ? @entity5 : foods that are high in sodium or salt are some of the things that you really have to control
anything that 's packaged , especially meats , are generally going to be higher in sodium
so you really should try to eat fresh foods
it may take a little more time to prepare the foods , but you 're guaranteed to have a lot less sodium
i generally , with my clients , try to stick under 1,000 ( milligrams ) a day
if you look at some ingredients , let 's say on a ramen noodle thing , it 's got 1,000 ( milligrams ) just in one serving
so you 've got to read food labels
something that a lot of people do n't realize too is ( that ) sugar can retain a lot of water in the body , and that can affect your blood pressure
worst fast - food meals for sodium @entity0 : what are some of the biggest traps for sodium ? @entity5 : if you really want to be low - sodium , you have to prepare your food
@entity152 is one of the flavors that makes food taste good -- salt , sugar and fat
so it 's a natural thing for all chefs and cooks to add salt , because it enhances the flavor of the food
if you go out to eat , i guarantee you 're going to be eating a lot of salted foods that you are going to have no idea
how are you going to read a food label on a plate of food that 's handed to you at a diner ? you ca n't
the new restaurant fat traps @entity0 : you were all about tough love on " @entity4
" is that still your style ? @entity5 : put it this way : i think when it comes to love , you 've got to give love and you got ta give tough love
so my philosophy is if somebody does a great job , you have to commend them , give them a fist bump , congratulate them
they gave you a good effort and it 's positive reinforcement
but if they 're slacking , i am definitely going to call them out on it
i 'm going to be their accountability , in their ear until they stop doing it
@entity0 : high - intensity interval training is all the rage
what is it about @entity209 sessions that really work ? @entity5 : when you do these types of intense workouts , they cause a big metabolic disturbance in your body
think of race car driving -- there 's the normal race car and then they have the little nitrous oxide switch that turns on the turbo
you do n't need ( the turbo ) when you 're taking , like , a @entity225 class
but now think about doing sprints on a hill
you can not do those for an hour like you can in a @entity225 class because the intensity is too high
you 're not doing aerobic training , you 're doing anaerobic training
in anaerobic training , the body tends to have to call on the nitrous oxide because the intensity is so hard it needs the extra boost
( that ) causes a big disturbance in the system
as a result , when you 're trying to get your metabolism back to normal , it does n't happen for free
it takes energy to do that , and it takes calories
and that 's what you want
you want to be burning calories after you work out
the problem becomes for most people -- it 's not pleasant , it 's painful
you have to have the pain tolerance to be able to deal with that , which a lot of people do not
@entity0 : what 's the biggest weight loss or fitness obstacle you see people encounter ? @entity5 : really , no. 1 is diet
most people want to think it 's a fitness thing or a nutrition regimen , and i 'm like , it 's a mental and emotional thing
we are in a society where we 're exposed to food so much of the time , and what people do n't realize is that food is a drug
chemicals make up drugs ; chemicals make up food
food is the most over-prescribed drug we have today
food is a lot of people 's therapy -- when we say comfort food , we really mean that
it 's releasing dopamine and serotonin in your brain that makes you feel good
and as you ( indulge ) more and more and more , it can become a little bit addictive
after you do that for too long , it can no longer be a choice -- you really change the physical structure of your brain and it 's going to be harder to quit
( but ) the food addiction is only part of it
the emotional issues are the deeper thing , and if you do n't fix that , it 's just not going to work
journaling helps woman lose half her body weight @entity0 : how do you get clients over mental barriers ? @entity5 : i think what i try to do with everyone is build self - confidence and accountability
you want people to be self - motivating , in a sense
if you can build accountability and confidence in people , the little switch will go on inside of them
they 're going to show up on time
their diet is going to change
but how you do that -- that is the art form
that 's the emotional intelligence you have to have
you have to ask the right questions
these are the intangibles you ca n't necessarily teach trainers or motivators
@entity328 champ : your mind matters more @entity0 : what 's your weakness ? you have to have at least one
@entity5 : peanut butter -- i ca n't even buy peanut butter anymore
i had to switch to powdered peanut butter because it 's less calories , but that 's definitely one of my big vices
@entity0 : any last piece of advice for our readers ? @entity5 : if i could give one tip for people -- it 's not an exercise or nutrition regimen
it 's to walk your talk and believe in yourself , because at the end of the day , the dumbbell and diet do n't get you in shape
it 's your accountability to your word .
