-- a 63 - year - old man accused of sexually assaulting and impregnating his young relative is in federal custody , following his arrest three decades after and about 1,800 miles from where the alleged crime occurred
deputy @entity7 and law enforcement officers in @entity10 arrested @entity11 on wednesday , about two years after his alleged 13 - year - old victim came forward to authorities
she waited several decades to tell her story because , at that point , her daughter was an adult and she felt that both were old enough to defend themselves , @entity7 spokesman @entity13 said thursday
" she did n't tell anyone leading up to that , for fear of her life and her child 's life , " said @entity13
the alleged assaults occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in @entity26 , @entity27 , according to the @entity7
authorities said that , after learning that the victim was pregnant , @entity11 kidnapped her and together they fled to @entity30
it was not until 2009 that the victim came forward and law enforcement authorities opened their case
by then , she was back in @entity27 , more than 1,500 miles from @entity11
it was n't immediately clear when the two separated
soon thereafter , @entity11 was tracked down in @entity30
after he refused to provide a dna sample , law enforcement tried to serve him a court order demanding as much
but by then , he 'd fled the state -- prompting a warrant , issued in march of 2009 , charging him with kidnapping and sexual assault of a minor , according to the @entity7
@entity11 was eventually found again in @entity45 , @entity10 , where he was living with a granddaughter
by thursday , authorities were awaiting clearance to extradite @entity11 back to @entity27
the @entity7 ' office was not aware if , at that point , he had yet retained or been assigned an attorney
@entity0 's @entity53 and @entity54 contributed to this report .
