-- the blowout is stopped
the oil disaster that began with an explosion 100 days ago has not ended by any means
but we seem to be seeing a murky ending to the beginning of the crisis
we have an enormous amount of floating oil , and @entity12 waters polluted by oil and dispersant
most estimates range from 2 million to 4 million barrels ( 84 million to 168 million gallons )
the higher end would make it the largest unintended release of oil ever
( in 1991 , @entity21 's army intentionally released about 400 to 500 million gallons into the @entity12 to slow @entity23 troops
) added to the @entity25 's troubles : about 2 million gallons of dispersant , a major intentional pollution event in itself
what now ? as a naturalist , i 'd say the wildlife effects remain hard to grasp
the damage to people is most easily observable , best quantified and perhaps even most acute
regionally there 's been further damage to @entity37 marshes already assaulted by decades of channel - cutting , shipping , water direction , erosion and sinkage
for resident wildlife , undersea oil and dispersant endangers countless sea creatures -- from plankton to whale sharks to dolphins and whales -- including reefs and the eggs and larvae of corals , fishes , crabs and oysters
watch a talk by @entity59 at @entity60 of hemispheric importance are creatures that range widely but funnel through the @entity12 to migrate or to breed
two of the most important breeders are the world 's most endangered sea turtle -- the @entity67 -- and the giant bluefin tuna , one of the most overfished of the world 's giant ocean fishes
migrants include millions of shorebirds , ducks and geese ; herons and egrets ; gannets , loons , terns , skimmers and other seabirds ; peregrine falcons , ospreys and @entity12 - crossing songbirds that often land exhausted on beaches and marshes
how many of these creatures , and what proportion of their populations , were damaged or spared , no one can say
every oiled carcass found may suggest 10 to 100 undetected deaths
but it 's also true that at this point -- with much of the oil yet to go somewhere -- there remain numerous clean - looking pelicans , gleaming gulls , and immaculate egrets along @entity12 shores and marshes
people , though , have taken deep and immediate hits
closures have meant an end to fishing , cessation of a way of life and of the way thousands of people understand who they are
some may say the closures are artificial , that there are still plenty of fish , probably safe to eat
others say the seafood safety is unreliable , and that , anyway , future consumer confidence is the most important thing to preserve
there 's truth to both sides
the mere tainting of beaches has been enough to send beachgoers fleeing to other destinations , creating a real - estate implosion , hordes of refunded deposits , halted construction and thousands of service jobs lost
nationally , we 're all connected by the loss to the nation 's seafood supply and by taxpayer funded government expenses related to agencies such as the @entity141 and @entity142 , as well as lost attention on other issues , and added unemployment costs that wo n't be covered by @entity146
no one knows whether the seafood and tourism and fisheries will be clean and healthy again next year or in a decade
we should be willing to learn some lessons
one is that this catastrophe was n't just an accident
it was the result of reckless corner - cutting by the oil company and scandalously compromised oversight by the government
as @entity23 rep. @entity163 , @entity164 , observed , " @entity146 appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure
" the compromised oversight included the @entity166 failing to require a backup shutdown system required in much of the rest of the world , failing to require offshore drillers to file plans to deal with major oil spills and specifically allowing @entity146 to drill without a detailed environmental analysis
the @entity175 administration gave top @entity177 jobs to former lobbyists of the fossil fuel industry
now the inspector general finds that @entity177 had " a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity
" another lesson : preparedness is near zero
the only two things responders could quickly muster were booms that ca n't handle open water , and dispersants
but dispersants sink oil , defeating the idea behind booms , polluting much more water , making the oil more widely toxic to marine life and making it impossible to recover or clean up
absent preparedness , @entity146 and other companies responding to the spill made stuff up as they went ; during weeks of blundering , hare - brained schemes like using shredded tires and golf balls to " top kill " the well , and fabricating new slap - dab caps and domes that did n't work
meanwhile people sent their hair clippings to the @entity12
that is not a response plan
obviously , reforms are needed
rig regulations should now require that the best equipment and procedures are used
to eliminate guesswork and argument , these procedures must be specified and quantified
for instance , blowout preventers should have a specified number of valves for drilling in a particular range of depths , all spelled out as requirements
further , there should be explicit checklists and decision trees
if the driller detects a possible problem , the operation must be shut down ; they must not retain the option of arguing about whether it 's probably ok to keep going
a culture of safety and best practices must replace the culture of risk
we should never again be subjected to the comment , " we 've never tried this at this depth
" it 's as if , after the house is on fire , they set about devising and then building a truck capable of spraying water
with all the contracting companies servicing thousands of rigs , you 'd think the oil giants would have , say , two or three pieces of equipment in a warehouse somewhere capable of stopping and controlling a blowout at one of their wells -- and capturing the oil
this should be devised and required
because an oil company 's interests are not aligned with the public 's interests , the oil company must be liable , but not in charge
allowing an oil company to run the response to a spill makes it possible for it to try to hide the amount of oil and the numbers of wildlife killed , to suppress scientific data and hamper journalists
the federal government should nationalize major spills , avail itself of the best pooled talent in the oil industry , and send the offending company the people 's bill
once it 's on our property , the offending oil company should not touch anything unless specifically directed to do so
as it is now , things are so insanely backward that at the end of june the @entity141 made it a felony for boats to get within 70 feet of boom
we need to stop putting the murderer in charge of the crime scene
the mortgage bubble , banking collapse , taxpayer - funded bailouts and this blowout all stem from a three - decade assault on government effectiveness , the consequent deregulation @entity311 , and the unleashing of corporate greed and corporate " personhood
" corporate capture of government away from the public 's interests is the basic poison
campaign finance reform and publicly funded elections would be the antidote
lastly and probably most important , to honor the scale of this catastrophe , we need to create a historic moment that begins to give us some energy options and creates a graceful phase - in of greater reliance on the clean , eternal energy that actually runs our planet
there are many reasons to do this
blowouts and dead workers and the awful environmental destruction wrought by coal mining and oil are some
helping weaken petro - dictators and gaining @entity23 energy independence is major
helping stabilize world climate and the acidifying seas , and securing agriculture , are yet others
providing jobs , incentives for construction and investment opportunities are others still
the basic vision is to reduce oil subsidies , create a level playing field for clean renewable energies like wind , solar , tidal , geothermal , algae fuels , etc ; construct a national smart grid capable of carrying power produced by any energy source whether dirty or renewable from where it 's abundant to where it 's needed
electric cars would be the grid 's storage battery
other countries -- @entity372 and some in northern @entity373 -- are doing this
but i 'd rather see @entity23 leadership regained
the nation that owns the future of energy will own the future
i want that nation of the future to be the @entity23
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity59 .
