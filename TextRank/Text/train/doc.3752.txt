-- @entity4 needs international help to fight @entity2 extremists battling for power in the lawless @entity9 nation , the country 's moderate @entity2 president said monday
sheikh @entity10 was recently appointed @entity4 's transitional president
" i am calling on the international community to help @entity4 defend against foreign militants who have invaded the country , " president sheikh @entity10 said
speaking at a news conference in @entity4 's capital city , @entity17 , @entity10 called several times for international help in fighting foreign militants whom he claims are the same fighters who have fought the " international community " in @entity22 and @entity23
" wherever they come , they fuel violence , " the president said
" the @entity4 people can not and should not accept that their countries should be a launching pad for these militants to attack
" @entity10 told local journalists that he feared these foreign fighters would turn @entity4 into another @entity22 or @entity23 , where @entity36 - led forces are fighting @entity38 extremist groups
he also praised local militias in the two regions of @entity41 and @entity42 for struggling against the foreign militias
last week , @entity45 militants advanced to the presidential palace in @entity17 , sparking sporadic fighting and shelling in the @entity4 capital
the recent fighting has killed more than 40 civilians and wounded about 150 others , according to sources at the scene
@entity45 -- once the armed wing of the @entity56 -- has been designated as a terrorist group by the @entity36 , which says it is affiliated with the @entity59 terrorist network
@entity10 participated in seizing control of @entity17 in 2006 along with the @entity56 before it was ousted by @entity63 forces later that year
he has since split from @entity4 jihad movements and was recently appointed @entity4 's transitional president through a process shepherded by the @entity68
