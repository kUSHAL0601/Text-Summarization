@entity0 -- whether or not we witness a " @entity4 " from the @entity6 football on friday night , it is surely a delicious irony that @entity8 and @entity9 are squared up
i stopped in at my local toy store friday morning , where a @entity8 flag has been waving proudly above the door all week
according to the owner , it 's not if @entity8 wins or loses this game , it 's how @entity8 wins or loses
pride and dignity need to be at the fore , in other words
i think this has been true through the entire euro crisis
you can not help but see that some @entity8 feel humiliated by the whole process
many @entity8 tell me they know the pain is necessary , but not this way
truth is , i think both sides in the @entity8 versus @entity9 drama are correct when it comes to how we got here
@entity8 did not modernize their economy while other countries did -- there are far too many state employees at far too many state - run firms
frankly , it 's hard to see how politicians could have done that in @entity8 given its legacy
leadership failed in @entity8 and the people let it happen
@entity8 's economic turmoil hits team on the other side , the @entity8 ( and the @entity46 and @entity47 ) splurged on a decade of cheap credit and low interest rates
part of that party money was spent on buying @entity9 - made goods and on money loaned by @entity9 banks looking for growth outside their natural borders
the fuel was easily on offer and everyone soaked it up
so , the crisis is not just the fault of the @entity8 , the @entity47 , the @entity46 and so on
they were allowed to get away with it for far too long
a common problem needs a common solution
yes , @entity68 moves painfully slowly and yes , they only seem to make major decisions when the crisis flares up
but at least they do make those decisions
@entity6 in pictures i suspect we are on the cusp on a new round of decisions
they may benefit the @entity46 and @entity80 more than others , given how important those economies are to the eurozone
my hope is that @entity8 falls off the radar of the markets and media again , for a number of months , while they get on with the painful restructuring
but it also needs to be done without humiliating the @entity8
they will certainly play with pride on friday night .
