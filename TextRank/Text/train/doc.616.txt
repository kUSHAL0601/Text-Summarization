tuesday night , @entity1 ceo @entity39 said four of its 18 employees at the plant remain unaccounted for , and " it is with great sadness that i now have to say that we fear the worst for them all
" the company said its offices worldwide will hold a minute of silence wednesday " as a mark of respect for all of those who lost their lives at @entity13
" at least 37 hostages were killed in the four - day ordeal , which began december 16 and ended saturday
" many of us have friends and colleagues , both in @entity1 and in other companies , who have worked at @entity13 or in similar facilities , " @entity39 said in a company statement
" we are all thinking of our missing colleagues , those who endured the ordeal and their loved ones
" the plant employed about 790 people , including 134 foreign workers -- among them @entity72 , one of three @entity73 known to have been killed
family members said @entity72 , ever the family man , was excited about the job
he got 28 days off for every 28 days he put in , time he could spend with his wife and two children in @entity78 , @entity79
yes , it was in a remote natural gas facility in @entity6 , but @entity72 assured his family it was safe
and it was in @entity85 , a place the 57 - year - old seemed to love
" he felt something there , " his daughter , @entity87 , told reporters tuesday
" he was so excited to go there
i do n't really know why , but he just loved it
" but 10 days after he returned to the complex from a visit home , terrorists sped in on pickups , overtook the compound and made hostages of its workers
" it 's just unfair , " @entity72 's brother , @entity103 , said tuesday
" my brother did n't deserve to die
" in addition to @entity72 , @entity73 @entity106 and @entity107 also died
seven @entity73 citizens survived the crisis , the @entity109 said
it did not elaborate , citing privacy concerns
like @entity72 , @entity106 , too , felt safe working there
he said " we 're in a compound in the middle of nowhere , and we 've got security , and i 'll be fine , " @entity106 's former neighbor , @entity115 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity120 in @entity121
" i guess you ca n't really be secure any place
" opinion : @entity6 hostage crisis shows jihadists on rise meanwhile , @entity6 authorities hailed as a hero the only one of their compatriots among the hostages who died in the attack
while few details about his contribution were available tuesday , @entity6 authorities said he had raised the alarm that allowed plant workers to shut down operations and go into hiding
militants shot the man between the eyes just as he alerted plant workers of the attack , @entity6 prime minister @entity141 said
@entity146 , the @entity30 branch of the terrorist movement , has claimed responsibility for the attack
in @entity150 , @entity109 spokeswoman @entity149 said that @entity73 officials " do n't have any reason to doubt " the group 's involvement
@entity149 said @entity150 has no reason to believe any @entity73 are among those still unaccounted for
@entity6 said the attack was retaliation for its decision to let @entity160 to use its airspace for an offensive against @entity164 militants in neighboring @entity165
but regional analysts said that would appear to be unlikely ; the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned in the few days between @entity160 's intervention in @entity165 and the attack on the gas plant less than a week later
the @entity6 government has said the attackers came from @entity6 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity165 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177
@entity73 and @entity6 officials are still trying to confirm the identities of those involved , according to a federal law enforcement official -- and it was unclear whether the terrorist identified as a @entity176 was carrying authentic or false identification
" the level of co-operation between two countries has been good , " the official added
the @entity187 has additional investigators in @entity6 , where there is an established legal attache office , but authorities declined to say how many agents are there or identify their location
@entity194 : family seeks answers after @entity78 man killed in @entity6 @entity6 officials said the attackers drew on the expertise of a driver from @entity175 who had once worked at the plant
one former hostage , @entity204 , told state - run @entity206 broadcaster cctv about militants flooding into the compound , taking it over bit by bit , searching door to door for workers
he also described rescue efforts
" the experience was too terrible
i heard the sounds of gunshot , bullets hitting doors , " he told @entity205
" i heard the governmental forces and terrorists fighting in the distance
judging from the sounds of gunfire , the fighting was very intense
" the @entity6 initially moved in on thursday after concluding the militants planned to blow up the gas installation and flee to @entity165 with the foreigners as hostages
the incursion succeeded in freeing some hostages -- but not all -- and several of them died
@entity72 survived thursday 's raid
and if his family knew him at all , he was likely biding his time , coolly trying to find a way to help himself and others out of the unthinkable predicament they found themselves in
' we felt in our hearts that he was coming home ' " he would n't be the person who is crying and screaming and begging , " @entity243 said
and after the initial exhilarating news , the family felt sure he would pull through
" we all believed , we felt in our hearts that he was coming home , " his daughter said
but then , on saturday , @entity6 special forces backed by helicopter gunships raided the plant for a second time
they finished off the militants but were unable to save the remaining hostages
militants may have executed them , @entity103 said he 'd been told
the news , @entity243 said , was " devastating
" bloody @entity6 hostage crisis ends after ' final ' assault @entity103 said he 's angry with the terrorists who took the compound his brother thought was safe , resulting in the deaths of people who had traveled there merely to make a better living for their families
but he said things maybe could have been different had @entity6 allowed @entity73 or @entity38 special operations forces to take over
maybe , @entity103 said , the @entity272 or @entity38 's @entity274 commandos could have taken out the militants while sparing the hostages
" we all feel it could have been handled differently , " he said
however , @entity6 's @entity279 said security forces were compelled to intervene quickly " to avoid a bloody turning point of events in this extremely dangerous situation
" officials said monday that had the terrorists succeeded in blowing up the plant , it would have caused death and destruction in a 5 - kilometer ( 3.1 mile ) radius
on tuesday , @entity73 officials reiterated their support for @entity6 officials
" the blame for this tragedy rests with the terrorists who carried it out , " @entity295 spokesman @entity294 said
nations scramble to account for missing after @entity6 hostage crisis as the family awaits the return of @entity72 's body , and more answers about how he died , @entity103 said he 's determined not to let his brother 's legacy die with him
he said he intends to press @entity308 to keep up the fight against terrorism
" i 'll be angry for a long time , " he said
@entity0 's @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 contributed to this report .
