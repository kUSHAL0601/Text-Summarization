@entity0 , @entity1 -- the body of accused triple killer and @entity1 professor @entity6 was claimed by a relative friday , nearly a week after @entity6 was found dead , the @entity3 said
a studio proof shows professor @entity6 and his wife , @entity9
a mortuary shipping service in @entity12 picked up @entity6 's body at the request of a son from a previous marriage , @entity3 spokesman @entity10 said
details on plans for the body were n't immediately available
earlier friday , @entity10 had said @entity6 's body -- found saturday in a self - dug shallow grave -- could be headed to a pauper 's grave if the family did n't claim the body from the @entity0 - @entity28 coroner 's office by saturday morning
such a grave is typically reserved for unidentified bodies , unclaimed bodies or people without family members
@entity10 said the situation was rare and that it was unclear why the family had taken that long to claim the body of the professor , described by colleagues and acquaintances as aloof and eccentric
neighbor @entity41 remembers a lot of " forced moments " with @entity6
the last such interaction came the afternoon of april 24 , the day before witnesses said @entity6 , 57 , killed his wife and two others outside a community theater in @entity0
@entity41 was walking down the driveway of his @entity51 home to check the mail
@entity6 had just done the same and was walking back to his house
@entity41 said hello and told @entity6 that his son , a @entity1 student who used to mow the @entity56 ' lawn , had recently seen @entity6 on campus
" he said , ' yeah , that 's where i hang out , ' and turned and walked into the house , " said @entity41 , who lived next door to @entity6 for eight years
" that 's mostly what it was with @entity6 , forced moments
" it was odd for @entity6 to say more than five or 10 words before disengaging , while his wife , @entity9 , was the " polar opposite , " @entity41 said , describing the 47 - year - old thespian as engaging and vivacious
despite the contrasts in personalities , @entity41 never saw evidence that there were problems between the two , he said
" he never raised his voice at his kids
i never heard him raise his voice at @entity9 , " he said
neighbors , students and fellow faculty members all concur that @entity6 was standoffish , but their accounts also paint a contradictory image of the marketing professor who would occasionally walk the halls of @entity1 's business college barefoot
some faculty members were quick to defend @entity6 , but reluctant to do so on record
one said he felt it was a university matter
another was reluctant to be on record defending an accused mass killer
" he 's being painted as an ogre , which does n't fit , " said the former
two faculty members said @entity6 was introverted but friendly
he was close to some colleagues
he remembered their birthdays and was generous with gifts at @entity104
his quirky behavior was generally overlooked because of his brilliance , a colleague said
one fellow professor went so far as to call him a genius , and not just with marketing , either
@entity6 apparently was well - versed in a wide range of topics -- art , opera , architecture -- and he loved sports
faculty members recalled that the strapping 6 - foot - 2 @entity6 played on the intramural softball team with some of his graduate students , and he liked to boast of his home runs
he also loved his son , 8 , and daughter , 10 , and regularly brought them to work
neighbors said they saw him outside playing soccer with the kids on a miniature goal that still sat in the yard this week
a basketball goal with a rim a foot or two below regulation stood over the @entity135 ' driveway , and a miniature yellow house sat dormant in his wooded backyard
a neighbor who asked not to be named said the cedar front door on the house tuesday was new
a swat team had burst through the old front door shortly after @entity6 allegedly shot @entity143 ; attorney @entity6 , 40 ; and @entity144 , 63
@entity143 was the president of the board of the @entity146 , a theater group holding a reunion picnic on the theater 's deck when the shooting took place
@entity6 and @entity144 were identified as set designers for the theater
@entity41 saw @entity6 shortly after the april 25 slayings
he was grilling bratwursts for lunch when @entity6 rang the doorbell
" he asked if i 'd mind watching the kids because there 'd been an emergency , " @entity41 said
he thought it was strange when @entity6 immediately sprinted out of the garage , but did n't pay it much attention because @entity6 said he had an emergency
the children , @entity41 said , seemed oblivious that their mother had just been slain
it was less than an hour later , when @entity41 's wife noticed two police officers with shotguns behind the hedges in a nearby yard , that @entity41 learned his neighbor was accused of a triple killing
the police told @entity41 they were looking for @entity6 in connection with the shootings
" i was incredulous , " he said
@entity41 's daughter , who had baby - sat for the @entity135 , drew a floor plan of the @entity6 home for police and told them where the spare key was hidden
@entity41 allowed police to use his home in their stakeout and summoned @entity6 's daughter to see whether she knew anything about what had happened
it was clear the girl had n't seen the slayings , but one of her remarks was chilling , @entity41 said
asked what her father 's emergency involved , she replied , " something about a firecracker
" though many expressed astonishment that @entity6 was linked to the slayings , some @entity1 faculty members said they suspected @entity6 was having problems at home before police confirmed it this week
he lost an estimated 50 pounds in the two months before the shootings , they said
to others , the signs of problems were more obvious
professor @entity210 , who had once worked under @entity6 , wrote an e-mail to her colleagues at the business school saying she went into protective custody after police found a map to her house in @entity6 's vehicle
in the e-mail , she said she had told previous department heads , deans and provosts " that @entity6 was dangerous
" " many people in this college and this department have known about @entity6 's ' troubled past ' and did nothing about it
those people also bear responsibility here , " she wrote
@entity229 did not return phone messages or open her door for reporters tuesday
however , one of @entity6 's former students said he and his classmates also thought @entity6 was more than just odd
@entity236 , 43 , was a graduate student and took classes with @entity6 in 1996 and 1997
@entity6 's lectures were delivered in monotone , his teaching style was dry and he did n't seem to care what was happening in the classroom , @entity236 said
when students convened outside the classroom , they surmised that something darker than a lack of enthusiasm drove @entity6 's behavior , he said
" if anyone asked any of my classmates if there was one professor who 'd go on a rampage , who would it be ? they 'd unanimously say @entity6 , " @entity236 said
" he was strange , definitely
" in her e-mail , @entity229 told colleagues they may never know the whole story
indeed , police have said only that one of the victims , @entity6 , " appeared to be a specific target in the shootings and was shot first
" the prospect of learning specifics about what could have propelled a painfully private introvert to homicide probably died in a shallow grave behind a @entity51 elementary school
@entity2 's @entity274 contributed to this report .
