@entity0 affiliate @entity37 said @entity38 was allowed breaks during her swim so she could eat , but she had to stay in the water
the teenager did her swim for charity , aiming to raise $ 30,000 for @entity44 , a childhood cancer center
as of 5:23 p.m. sunday , she had raised close to $ 80,000 , according to her parents , who were updating her progress online each step of the way
" unbelievable ! ! ! ! ! " her parents wrote on her website , @entity10 's @entity51
" we are so proud ! ! ! " the first person to swim across @entity4 was 16 - year - old @entity53 in 1954 , according to @entity54 , the sport 's provincial governing body
nearly 50 other swimmers have completed the swim since then , but @entity10 is the youngest , according to @entity59 of @entity4 , a non-profit group that monitors the safety of long - distance swims
one of the solo @entity4 swimmers was @entity64 , who on sunday was attempting to swim from @entity31 to @entity30
the 62 - year - old @entity64 -- who completed her @entity4 swim in 1974 at the age of 24 -- was a third of the way to her goal as of sunday evening
in @entity10 's last blog post before setting off , she said she was well rested after sleeping nearly 12 hours the night before
she wrote , " @entity71 says he thinks i have ice in my veins : ) i guess we 'll find out because the lake flipped yesterday and i 'm looking at very cold water in @entity12 now ! i 'll do my best to deal with anything that comes my way ... not just the cold ! " @entity10 says on her site that she has swum competitively since she was 4 and that distance swimming has always been her passion
she began swimming in the lake three or four years ago and said competing in open water is " way quieter " than in a pool
she says she chose @entity4 for her swim because it 's one of the hardest open - water swims in the world , and she wanted to " accomplish something difficult " for children who fight cancer
