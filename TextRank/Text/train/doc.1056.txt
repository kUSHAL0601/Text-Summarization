-- seven - time world champion @entity1 , quadruple title winner @entity2 , and contemporary pacesetters @entity4 and @entity6 were all contenders in @entity0 's quest to find the greatest @entity10 driver of all time
but in the eyes of @entity10 's great and good it was two icons of the sport -- @entity16 and @entity17 -- who proved inseparable
@entity16 's three world championships in the late 1980s and early 1990s made him an idol for modern stars like @entity21
@entity22 the @entity24 's death following a crash at @entity26 in 1994 led to three days of mourning in his homeland and his genius has gained almost mythical status with the eponymous documentary on the driver , which brought the @entity36 legend to a new generation of fans in glorious @entity39
@entity17 graced f1 tracks in the early days of the sport , in the sepia - tinged 1950s , an era when the @entity45 's talents could not be truly captured on camera
but if you crunch the numbers , the @entity45 shunts @entity16 over to the curb
@entity17 collected five world championships , two more than @entity16 , winning a record 45 % of the grands prix he entered compared to 25 % for @entity16
the @entity45 started an unrivaled 55.8 % of his races from pole position -- @entity4 's current record is just over 33 % -- while also qualifying for 92 % of his grands prix on the front row
no one can match @entity62 's record of winning the championship with four different teams , while he is also the oldest @entity10 champion , taking the 1957 drivers ' title aged 46 years and 41 days
although that comparison is arguably unfair as fate cruelly robbed @entity16 of the chance to match that particular achievement
one criticism that has been leveled at @entity17 was that he always drove the best car , but as @entity73 told the sport 's official website it was " because he was the best bloody driver ! " " the cheapest method of becoming a successful grand prix team was to sign up @entity17 , " added @entity73
blog : @entity6 , @entity4 on track for greatness ? perhaps what @entity16 inspires within those who admire him is not measurable in numbers
he was a maverick , driving with a cavalier flair which was best summed up when he proclaimed , " if you no longer go for a gap , you are no longer a racing driver
" his six wins at the famous @entity90 is an unparalleled feat , while his championship duels with @entity93 teammate @entity2 were pure sporting theatre
@entity16 's win - at - all - costs approach was epitomized in 1990 when he led @entity96 in the championship heading into the year 's penultimate race -- the @entity99 @entity90
@entity2 , starting in second position , overtook polesitter @entity16 off the line
but , knowing if neither driver finished @entity16 would be crowned champion , the @entity24 forced @entity2 off the track at the first corner and cemented a second world title success
" when you had @entity2 and @entity16 fighting it out in the same team , there 's no question to the caliber of each driver , very different personalities and great drivers , " 1996 world champion @entity108 told @entity0
" those epic battles stand the test of any sporting rivalry
" @entity16 was a perfectionist , taking risks which could turn certain victory into abject failure -- notably his crash at the 1988 @entity90 when he was holding a 55 - second lead over his nearest rival
if @entity16 took the sport to the very edge of sportsmanship , @entity17 conducted himself with " a sense of honor never seen before or since
" he shot to global fame in 1958 when he was kidnapped in @entity134 by @entity136 - led revolutionaries
as was the case with everyone who met him , his captors were charmed by @entity17 and they released him unharmed , " it is claimed in a tribute to him on the sport 's official website
when describing what made @entity17 so special , three - time drivers ' champion @entity145 said : " i think the dignity and style , the way he went about his business
" @entity62 is the one that , for me , would have written the whole book
you would want to do what he did and how he did it
" over the course of their illustrious careers , the pair astonished with their ability and courage , pushing their vehicles to the limit in pursuit of the checkered flag
perhaps it is fitting , then , that these two legends of motorsport proved inseparable .
