@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 held by @entity6 rebels for more than three months will be released " imminently , " @entity4 civil rights leader @entity3 said saturday after meeting in @entity1 with rebel leaders
@entity9 guerrillas captured @entity11 veteran @entity10 on june 20 while he was traveling in @entity6
@entity3 said @entity9 invited him to @entity0 , where the group has been holding peace talks with the @entity6 government since last october
" it 's a humanitarian gesture of their own volition , demanding nothing in return , " @entity3 said at a news conference in the @entity1 capital
" i consider it as a gesture to reinforce the peace negotiation
" @entity9 guerrillas said in a statement saturday they had previously offered to free @entity10 but that " the @entity6 government did not provide the minimum necessary conditions we need for this procedure
" there was no immediate comment from the @entity31
@entity6 officials previously said they feared @entity9 would use @entity10 's release to garner media coverage
@entity3 said he hopes the @entity35 in @entity6 will provide a helicopter to remove @entity10 from the remote area of the country where he is being held and that the @entity6 government will designate the area a cease - fire zone during his release
despite the 10 - month old peace talks , the @entity6 government has resisted calls for a cease - fire with guerrillas , saying the rebels have used previous cease - fires to strengthen their forces
@entity10 served in the @entity11 from november 2009 to march 2013
he served in @entity49 for a year starting in november 2010 , according to the @entity50
he is from @entity51 , @entity52 , and won a number of awards , including an @entity55 and a @entity56
the @entity50 lists his rank as private
despite @entity10 's military background , @entity3 said the @entity11 veteran had peaceful motives for visiting @entity6
" the fact is , he is a tourist , " @entity3 said
@entity9 , whose name in @entity65 is the @entity9 , began fighting the government in the 1960s , making it @entity69 's oldest guerrilla force
there have been sporadic peace talks between the rebels and the government since the 1980s
the last attempt failed in 2002
