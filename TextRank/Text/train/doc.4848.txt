when does a romantic anniversary trip with your hubby to celebrate five years of marital bliss become an international kerfuffle , complete with calls for you to be prosecuted for treason ? well , when it 's @entity9 , where @entity10 are banned from traveling to for tourism , thanks to one of the most enduring embargoes in the history of mankind
yesterday , @entity17 stopped by @entity19 's " @entity18 " and confessed the outcry over her and @entity22 's trip to @entity23 was " quite shocking
" welcome to the land of cray cray , @entity26
emotions run deep , high , and very bizarre when it comes to the subject of @entity9
when photos of the celebrity couple strolling @entity23 were released , a political tumult of epic proportions erupted in @entity34
sen. @entity35 and a small band of conservative @entity38 - @entity10 politicos released a statement vociferously demanding an investigation of the trip by the president and the @entity43
one anti-castro activist went as far as to threaten to file a petition against the celebrity couple to be formally prosecuted
@entity22 and @entity17 's crime ? chilling in @entity23
there 's little doubt the collateral damage and suffering on both sides of the @entity52 -- families divided , innocents killed , fortunes lost -- has been profound
but it 's high time we stop the madness and bring sanity to this debate
for a long time , i 've been of the opinion that the @entity38 embargo policy in general is for @entity38 on the island and the @entity66 to resolve
those of us who have not suffered directly should stay out of it and let cubanos figure their way out of this mess
but , what happens when political views of a few trample on an entire nation ? and , what are the ramifications when these opinions border on the irrational ? the few but very influential pro-embargo lobby have put a stranglehold on a lucid discussion surrounding @entity9
five decades of failed policy later , our nation is being held hostage unable to have a cogent discussion on anything @entity9 - related
the @entity10 embargo has not and will not work
put in place in 1962 by president @entity91 , the policy is stuck in a time warp that has nothing to do with modern - day reality
the most enduring embargo in modern day history is a remnant of a @entity98 past when the @entity99 was the enemy and the world was on the brink of nuclear war
the thinking was that financial sanctions , which included a ban on travel by @entity10 citizens , would collapse the island economy and force people to revolt against @entity111
over the years , these sanctions have been eased or toughened depending on political winds
in 1992 , disgraced @entity115 rep. @entity114 was behind one the cruelest acts which banned , among many things , food and medicine sales to @entity9 and prevented @entity38 - @entity10 families from sending cash to their relatives
these were tough times and seeing many friends and families suffer because they could n't visit their elderly mothers more than once every three years , or being prevented from sending them needed supplies , was very painful
restrictions have eased under president @entity129 but there is still a major ban
it 's 2013 and we need to debate @entity38 policy earnestly
members of @entity137 must stop the cowardice around the issue and stop humoring the delusions of passionate folks stuck in the 1960s for political votes and favor
the pro-embargo folks are ignoring the policy 's epic failure and fail to recognize that @entity10 policy has played into the hands of the @entity111 brothers , who have sinisterly used it to make the case to their people that if @entity9 is starving and the island economy ca n't grow , it 's because of this @entity10 policy
in 1995 , i won an @entity158 for producing a show that explored the @entity38 embargo
what was special about the program , " @entity9 , " was that it gave an opportunity for the many different opinions in the @entity38 debate to be heard
the voices of everyday @entity38 families caught in the quagmire of policies that make their family members the " enemy " were allowed to surface
these are the folks -- cubanos to the core -- who will tell you , if they had a mic and a safe forum , that the current @entity10 policy is stupid
we hardly hear from these normal cubanos and for that matter , other average @entity10 on this issue
@entity9 policy is steeped in dysfunction on both sides
last week , the @entity189 denied @entity111 's niece @entity190 a visa to travel to @entity192 to receive an award for her gay activism , no reason given
a @entity189 official said visa applications are confidential
fifty - one years into the policy , another @entity111 is in power and the island is still communist
the @entity10 still trades with communist @entity201 despite its human rights violations
the @entity10 still trades with communist @entity204
we , the hip - hop generation , see right through the political hypocrisy and we want change
there are some bright lights in @entity137 giving hope
@entity10 rep. @entity212 held a news conference after visiting @entity9 on a three - day fact - finding trip recently
the @entity216 @entity215 announced that she found the island has made economic reforms and called for the @entity10 to promote these positive changes
@entity212 is part of a new group of audacious politicians , some from @entity34 , who are pushing to normalize relations and bring constructive dialogue with @entity9
@entity129 stands to make history by using his pulpit to encourage a more sensible dialogue around a @entity9 policy that has been futile
i doubt that he 'll step into this issue willingly
it will take gigantic political cojones to do so and on @entity9 , sadly , the president has n't expressed a willingness to " go there
" the best hope for sanity rests on the voices of reasonable @entity10 and @entity38 - @entity10 to demand change
real democratic progress in @entity9 will happen when the gates of travel are opened
you want democratic transformation in @entity9 ? there 's nothing more compelling than a bunch of celebrities sporting @entity251 bags in one hand and smoking puros in the other to inspire revolutions of capitalistic proportions .
