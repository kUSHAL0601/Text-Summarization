@entity0 , @entity1 -- tanks , troops and police pushed through the streets of two shantytowns in northern @entity8 sunday in a move to retake control of some of the city 's most crime - ridden areas
in the predawn operation , state authorities targeted the slums , or favelas , of @entity19 and @entity20 with more than 2,000 military troops and police
they have a larger long - term goal : securing 40 slums before the @entity25 in 2014 , and keeping them safe for the @entity26 two years later
police said they seized automatic weapons , guns and grenades and arrested dozens of people in a series of slum raids over the weekend
there were no reports of deaths or injuries sunday
on saturday , police said five suspected drug dealers were killed during a slum raid
police have already taken over about 30 favelas since they began operations in 2008 , but it 's an uphill battle
about one - fifth of @entity8 's residents live in the city 's 1,000 shantytowns , many of them perched on steep hills overlooking beachside condominiums
@entity19 and @entity20 are smaller favelas , far from tourist hotspots , but they became centers for organized crime and drug dealing after other slums were taken over by police
sunday 's operation there stands in stark contrast to the invasion of the @entity60 in 2010 , when more than 30 people were killed in shootouts
police now announce days in advance when they 're going to go into a community , to avoid major violence
but critics say it simply gives criminals a chance to escape to another slum , or the suburbs
authorities said they planned to set up a " police pacification unit " in @entity74 by december , and in @entity19 by january
three years ago , they took a similar approach in the notorious @entity77 , or @entity78 , slum where military police backed by the army seized control from drug traffickers
" they were abandoned for 40 , 50 years , " said maj. @entity84 of the police pacification unit there
" you ca n't recover that in three years
" but now , @entity84 told @entity2 last month , they plan to prove to the slum 's 40,000 residents that they 're here to stay .
