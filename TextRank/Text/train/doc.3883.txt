-- as smoke clears from two deadly bombings near the finish line of the @entity5 on monday , focus turns to identifying those responsible
and that 's no easy task
the massive number of cell phones and closed circuit cameras on the street provide an incredible wealth of video and photo
" this is probably one of the most well photographed areas in the country , " said @entity16 police commissioner @entity15
the wealth of photographic and video evidence available is both a challenge and an opportunity
" we intend to go through every frame
" the @entity16 marathon extends over 26 miles of streets and is largely open to the public
the crime scene around the bombing covers 12 city blocks
" this is the most complex crime scene we 've ever had to deal with , " said @entity15 at a press conference tuesday about the bombings
" we are processing all the digital photographic evidence we can , " says @entity37 , the special agent leading the @entity39 's @entity38
he asks that " the public continue submitting whatever they have to police
" there 's a huge amount of video evidence to process , he says , creating a logistics issue
@entity48 is a forensic video analyst and instructor at the @entity52 and @entity51 ( @entity53 ) in @entity54
@entity53 is the only digital multimedia evidence processing lab in the world designed to train video investigators and analyze massive amounts of forensic video evidence , @entity48 says
which is exactly what 's needed in @entity16
@entity48 says there 's no standard in law enforcement to acquire video from the public in the wake of a tragedy such as yesterday 's marathon bombings
but the best example of mass video collection for investigative purposes occurred in june 2011 , when riots occurred after the @entity74 lost the @entity76 finals to the @entity77
the @entity78 of @entity79 set up a system in which the public could provide video evidence , such as photos and videos from cell phones , anonymously to police
in response , @entity79 police received 5,000 hours of video from the public
considering the size of the @entity5 and the growing prevalence of smartphone video cameras , the raw volume of footage after this tragedy could be much larger
after gathering those 5,000 hours of footage , @entity79 police then contacted leva through the @entity98 to go through all that video
@entity48 says 52 analysts then spent 14 days processing that footage , identifying 15,000 criminal acts perpetrated by 300 rioters
the analysis is not magic , @entity48 says
three shifts of video forensics experts distributed the raw video evidence to analysts , who then put the evidence into a single interoperable format , and uploaded it into a central management system
from there , it was watched and coded — meaning that anyone perceived to commit a criminal act was profiled and then attached to a special code that would identify , for example , whether they were wearing a backpack or a hoodie , whether they were carrying anything with them , and any other physical attributes that could be identified
( @entity0 describes the first potential suspect in the @entity126 as " seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt " and " trying to get into a restricted area about five minutes before the first explosion
" ) the purpose of this is to tag people so they can be identified later — to say , " hey , this is the same person " identified in previous videos , he says
@entity48 notes that @entity16 police are likely now going through a similar process , collecting every piece of digital media available from transit and nearly 600 closed circuit television cameras covering the @entity142 alone
according to the @entity149 of @entity150 , " stored video can be easily shared with other [ police departments ] over standard web browsers using a system protected by a basic username and password
" in a post tuesday , @entity151 quoted the study , inferring : " if the bomber ( s ) took public transportation , there 's a good chance those steps can be retraced through video footage
" but does this profiling open the possibility for wrongful arrests ? recall the tragedy of @entity164 , the security guard falsely accused of bombing @entity166 's @entity165 during the @entity167
" the thing about profiling is that you 're not profiling an individual , you 're profiling a type , " @entity48 says
in @entity16 , authorities are now combing video evidence for " anyone with a backpack
" in other words , it 's not the video analyst 's role to worry about whether people are wrongly accused of involvement in the @entity126 ; it 'll be up to law enforcement to get evidence before they start arresting people
" the video officer is just a technician , " @entity48 says
in an email to @entity190 , @entity191 , a video analyst with @entity193 in @entity194 , sees where improvements might be made in the future to make the process easier
" what needs to be developed is a solution for governments to accept public video and images for such situations , as there were likely several @entity208 who captured evidence , " he writes , referencing the famous film of the @entity200 assassination
" it needs to be far more comprehensive and useful than just random submissions to the 911 centers
" he suggests that such a system should accept wireless , web , and email submissions when activated
each submission should include basic contact information , camera info , as well as a time sync reference
" this would provide a quick bigger picture , " @entity191 writes
and beyond the video evidence , @entity48 says federal authorities will already have a list of potential terror suspects who could be involved
" they 'll ask , ' who 's in town , who are we tracking ? ' " those people become instant suspects before video evidence is analysed
" the message is this : the most prolific source of evidence available to law enforcement comes from video evidence , comes from video sources , " he says
" these kinds of cases really underscore that the general public is collecting video evidence every moment of every day
so when you have a major incident in a major area like this where you have a huge gathering of the public , everyone there with a cell phone now has an evidence collection device that can be used by law enforcement
" " law enforcement just needs to get that video
" @entity266 : " the @entity39 has set up a tip line — at 1 - 800 - call - @entity39 — for anyone who has information , images , or details relating to yesterday 's explosions along the @entity5 route
we are particularly interested in reviewing video footage captured by bystanders with cell phones or personal cameras near either of the blasts
in an investigation of this nature , no detail is too small
