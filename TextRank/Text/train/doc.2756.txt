-- @entity2 president @entity1 and the first lady parted ways saturday , with the leader declaring it 's over and his partner of several years bidding farewell to the staff of the presidential residence
the breakup occurred in the wake of a media account earlier this month about @entity1 allegedly having an affair with actress @entity15
@entity1 told a @entity2 news outlet saturday he is ending his relationship with his partner , @entity18
" i wish to make it known that i have ended my shared life ( partnership ) with @entity18 , " @entity1 is quoted as saying to @entity19
@entity18 sent a goodbye message saturday via @entity24 to the staff at the presidential palace
" all my gratitude goes to the extraordinary people at the @entity29 Â© es. i will never forget the devotion or emotion at the time of leaving , " she wrote
@entity1 's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the @entity2 magazine @entity36 claimed this month he was having a two - year affair with @entity15
speculation about the split swirled saturday after a @entity2 national weekly reported that @entity1 was expected to announce his separation from @entity18 on saturday , a day before @entity18 travels to @entity42
the story was picked up by several @entity2 media outlets
but the @entity2 presidency initially denied the report that an announcement would be made
" it is a rumor that circulated on the @entity49 today
there is absolutely no confirmation of the publication of a statement today , " the palace press officer told @entity0
@entity56 trip planned for february @entity1 has not confirmed or denied the alleged affair but did threaten legal action
at his first press conference of the year , @entity1 said he and @entity2 's first lady were going through " painful moments
" the allegations had left @entity18 's position in some doubt , namely ahead of a planned trip to @entity66 in february
she has been @entity1 's partner for several years
an arts columnist for weekly magazine @entity69 , she is not married to @entity1 but assumed the role of first lady at official functions following his election in may 2012
her attorney , @entity74 , told @entity2 daily newspaper @entity75 this week that the couple were working to issue a " clarification " concerning their relationship
last weekend , @entity18 left the hospital where she 'd spent a week being treated for stress and fatigue , @entity69 magazine reported
the same magazine also said she would recover for " several days " in an official residence in @entity86
@entity1 , 59 , has seen his personal approval ratings plummet since his election , although this has been attributed to dissatisfaction with his leadership rather than disapproval of his private life
a recent survey by @entity2 pollster @entity95 with @entity97 found that more than 80 % of respondents had not changed their opinion of the president based on the allegations of an affair
@entity1 has four children from a previous relationship with @entity105 , a senior member of his @entity106 and a 2007 presidential candidate
@entity105 announced their separation just after she lost the 2007 election to @entity110
