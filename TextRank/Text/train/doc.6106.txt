-- @entity1 slaughtered and mutilated soldiers on a scale the world had never seen
it 's little wonder that its vast numbers of returning crippled veterans led to major gains in the technology of prosthetic limbs
virtually every device produced today to replace lost body function of soldiers returning from our modern wars -- as well as accident victims , or victims of criminal acts , such as the @entity21 bombings -- has its roots in the technological advances that emerged from @entity1 i. the war , which began nearly 100 years ago , produced its own crop of bionic men
in previous wars , severely injured soldiers often succumbed to gangrene and infection
thanks to better surgery , many now survived
on the @entity36 side alone , there were 2 million casualties , 64 percent of them with injured limbs
over 4,000 amputations were performed on @entity42 service personnel according to the @entity42 @entity43
how a century - old war affects you in all nations involved in the war an emerging generation of so - called " war cripples , " as they were referred to in @entity36 , loomed ominously over the pension and welfare system , and many government bureaucrats , military leaders and civilians worried about their long - term fate
one solution was returning mutilated soldiers to the workforce
various prostheses were designed to make that possible , pushing prosthesis manufacturing in many countries from a cottage industry towards modern mass production
in the @entity42 the @entity64 was established in 1917 at the @entity65 , in conjunction with the @entity67 , with the goal to give every amputee soldier a " modern limb , " enabling them to pass as able - bodied citizens in the workplace
while the @entity42 remained the largest producer of artificial limbs worldwide , @entity36 's prosthetic developments incorporated a particular quest for efficiency
@entity36 orthopedists , engineers and scientists invented more than 300 new kinds of arms and legs and other prosthetic devices to help
artificial legs made of wood or metal , sometimes relatively rudimentary , and often recreating the knee - joint in some way , enabled leg - amputees to stand and move around unaided
glass eyes and a variety of facial prostheses allowed those with defacing injuries to appear in public
for example , a galvanized and painted copper plate could fill in the missing eye socket and neighboring maxillary bone
a lost arm or hand was particularly difficult to replace
in the @entity42 engineers had designed a mechanical arm for that purpose that came into wide use after the war
the so - called @entity110 arm was not optimal for mechanical work , but it imitated the natural limb and was relatively easy to mass produce cheaply
it became a huge business success
how @entity1 gave us ' cooties ' in @entity119 , the @entity118 evaluated prosthetic technologies , such as the @entity122 arm
positioned at the confluence of medicine , engineering and the new science of ergonomics , the test center offers a particularly striking example of the setting that made modern prosthetics possible
the center 's head , the engineer and professor @entity132 , was an adherent of @entity137 's " scientific management " -- an approach that applied scientific methods to optimize work flows and labor productivity
his idea of a proper prosthesis was something functional and efficient , an exchangeable and mass producible replacement device that would fit with the human body
while earlier prostheses often tried to replicate body appearance , or to follow the inner structural plan of the original appendage -- its shape , muscles , sinews -- @entity132 saw no need to do that
he reasoned that airplanes could fly without imitating birds ' wings , so why did prosthetics have to mimic arms and legs ? the @entity162 , invented in 1916 , was a remarkable example of functional efficiency
it was basically a tool - holder with interchangeable parts
its " hands " ranged from a simple hammer to cutlery with elongated handles to inserts whose ends could be attached to machines
it could serve the carpenter , farmer , draughtsman , locksmith , lathe - turner , cabinet - maker or tinsmith
many of these prostheses literally merged man and machine , leaving the disabled man firmly attached to his work station
an amputee veteran would arrive at his work place in the factory , hook up the remaining part of his limb to the prosthesis , which in turn would be linked to one of the industrial machines in the factory
he would work for hours like this as a link in a functional kinetic chain
the image of men tied to their work resonates unsettlingly with @entity205 's prediction that the urban proletariat would one day become a mere " appendage of the machine
" it 's an example of how military and industrial conceptions of the body were extended to dehumanize the body itself
some visionaries , of course , embraced prosthetics as a means for human transformation , as if the body were a malleable object that could be dignified and enhanced by technology
and some thinkers go even further and interpret technological enhancement as a next step in human evolution
reality might not be so far behind : in 2008 runner @entity226 , a double - leg amputee , sought to compete in the @entity228 , but his running blades , made of carbon fiber and modeled after a cheetah 's leg , were seen by some as an unfair advantage
four years later in @entity235 , he did compete in the @entity236 , embodying a development that had its origins 100 years earlier , in @entity1
