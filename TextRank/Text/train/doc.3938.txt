-- no prominent world leaders at the @entity2 in two months ? no problem , according to @entity6 's @entity5 chief
@entity8 president @entity7 , @entity10 president @entity9 and @entity12 president @entity11 -- among others -- are all staying away from the winter games but @entity15 is n't concerned
" the point is the competition and not that 20 or 30 leaders come to the opening ceremony , " @entity15 , @entity6 's former deputy prime minister , was quoted as saying by @entity6 news agency @entity16 on tuesday
it was announced last week that @entity7 would n't be attending because of his schedule
in august , however , he openly criticized @entity6 's anti-gay propaganda law
" nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you 've been seeing in @entity6 , " he said
" i 've spoken out against that , not just with respect to @entity6 , but a number of other countries where we continue to do work with them , but we have a strong disagreement on this issue
" and @entity7 last week named tennis great @entity39 , who is gay , to the @entity8 delegation at the @entity5
@entity11 reportedly is giving @entity41 a miss to protest against human rights violations while @entity10 foreign minister @entity44 said last week @entity9 's attendance at the @entity46 had " not been planned
