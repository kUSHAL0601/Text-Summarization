" after several days of searching , @entity20 's body was found in a @entity22 storage unit late saturday
@entity27 said repeated witness interviews and " very aggressive investigation " led authorities to the storage unit
he said the cause and manner of death was not immediately known , but an autopsy was being conducted monday
when the body was found , it was wrapped , he said , and authorities avoided disturbing it as much as possible , he said
the cause and manner of @entity20 's death , when determined , could result in additional charges being filed or the modification of existing charges , he said
investigators are focusing on several areas , including a hotel where media reports said @entity11 was thought to have stayed and the storage unit where the body was found
authorities are not sure whether @entity20 was abducted or left the tavern willingly with @entity11 , @entity27 said
" just trying to rehash miss @entity100 's steps ... led us to mr. @entity11 , " he said
authorities believe @entity20 was killed shortly after she was last seen , and her body had been in the storage unit for a couple of days , @entity27 said
when a reporter from @entity0 affiliate @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity10 , approached @entity11 's relatives over the weekend , they refused to go on camera
" he has n't been here in six years , " an unidentified man told the station
" @entity27 said authorities had not found a connection between @entity11 's relatives and the house where he was located
" i want to ask my law enforcement brothers and sisters across the country to help me with this , " @entity44 said monday on @entity122
" i 'm trying to stay strong , and they know what it means because the cameras are on -- but he took my daughter , guys
and play it right , play by the rules , but y'all get out there and find this guy for me , and when it comes my way , i 'll pay you back
" @entity11 is a registered sex offender with a 1996 first - degree sex offense conviction out of @entity10 , according to the state sex offender registry website
@entity143 and the @entity145 newspaper reported he had served time in prison
he also has a lengthy police record in @entity4 , including drug and weapons charges , @entity22 - @entity28 police spokeswoman officer @entity148 said
@entity27 said police had gotten word that @entity11 knew he was wanted
" i do n't think it came as any real surprise to him that authorities were able to locate him , " he said
neighbors of @entity11 's family described their @entity17 neighborhood as a quiet one , where families remain for a number of years , @entity143 said
@entity47 is " a very close - knit community , " mayor @entity166 said on " @entity49
" he said there had been a " tremendous outpouring " of support for the chief and his family
@entity45 told @entity122 young women should remember the safety lessons they have been taught
" it carries into when you 're in your 20s , " he said
" ... make sure these men treat you with respect , and be safe
" asked to describe his daughter , the chief said , " she was a good kid
she was a wonderful kid
she lived her life to take care of children
that 's all she wanted to do
she was the perfect daughter , and i miss her , and i need justice for her and i need folks to be looking for this guy
