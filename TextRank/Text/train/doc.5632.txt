-- ah , the ' 80s
in popular memory , which is forever determined to turn everything to kitsch , the @entity1 is now reduced to pastel colors , overworked synthesizers and parachute pants
@entity8 , left , and @entity9 formed one of the most successful duos in pop music history
and @entity13 ? a tall guy with feathered blond locks , a short guy with a fat mustache and the ever - present beat of " @entity18 " on @entity19
perhaps it 's time to set the record straight -- which is what @entity9 and @entity8 have in mind with " @entity35 " ( @entity25 / @entity24 ) , a four - cd boxed set that spans their career , including rare tracks , live cuts and all the hits that made them one of the top - selling duos of all time
the set is out tuesday
" it always has bothered us " to be dismissed as shallow popsters , adds @entity36 , 60 , in a phone interview
" early rock journalism tended to fluff us off as prefab hitmakers with some sort of formula
... [ but now ] we have a whole new respect and a whole new generation of musicians and fans who look at our music from a much broader , much more objective point of view
" fellow musicians have been some of the first to pay tribute
in the boxed set 's liner notes , there is praise from @entity57 , @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity61 's @entity60 ( who says 1984 's " @entity64 " was the first record he ever bought with his own money )
@entity0 caught up with @entity9 , just turned 63 , and @entity36 on separate calls and asked them about their first meeting , the stories behind some of their songs and what they 've been up to recently
herewith a few answers ; supply your own beat
in the beginning ... both men were raised in the @entity77 , @entity78 , area and attended @entity79 in the late ' 60s , but did n't formally meet until their respective bands were set to play an @entity82 teen dance in 1967
@entity83 : " we were waiting backstage to go on and a big gang fight broke out and we went down the service elevator and we left
and as we were going down we kind of met
" gang fight ? gunfire and clubs and dog chains ? hall : " typical @entity77 scene
we did n't even blink an eye
" developing a sound the pair 's work is known for its combination of smooth r&b and punchy rock
the blend comes from their backgrounds , with @entity9 originally on the " b team " ( his words ) for @entity103 and @entity103 's @entity105 productions and @entity36 ' roots in folk and rock
hall : " we were just putting together the sounds that were around us and trying to put our version of it together
one reason we did n't stick around in @entity105 -- i remember having a conversation with @entity103 , and he said , ' why do n't you come and be artists on @entity116 -- we 're starting this new label
' and i said , we want to do our own version of the @entity105 sound , so we need to separate ourselves from you
and so we moved to @entity121 with that idea in mind
" creating " she 's gone " hall : " i heard @entity8 playing this chord progression on an acoustic guitar , going ' she 's gone , whoa i , whoa i ' ... it sort of reminded me of a @entity131 song
so i said , let 's get funky with it
so i sat down at my @entity136 piano and started playing that riff ... and we sat down and wrote about the things that were happening to both of us at the time
" that evocative line about " let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away " ? " that was coming straight from living in the streets , " says @entity9
" an @entity147 person once said , ' you know , it 's carbon monoxide , not carbon and monoxide
' and i said yeah , but it does n't sing right ! " ( the song , unsuccessful upon first release in 1974 , became a huge hit on its second try in 1976
) how @entity13 changed though the group continued to have hits through the ' 70s , it was n't until 1981 and " @entity160 " they became blockbuster hitmakers
@entity36 attributes the change to moving back to @entity121 from @entity163 , @entity164 , and assuming production duties
@entity36 : " we worked with @entity167 [ @entity168 ] on an album called ' along the @entity173 , ' and during that time we were going back to @entity121 and getting involved in the punk and @entity172 scene
... and then we did one more album called ' x-static , ' and i remember distinctly while we were making the album , @entity167 said , ' why am i here ? you know what you want to do
' ... " and we went on to produce ourselves , and we never looked back
the next album was ' voices ' and you know the story from there
" what @entity186 borrowed during the making of " @entity188 , " @entity9 crossed paths with @entity186 , who told him he nicked a @entity13 song for his own ends
@entity9 recalls , " @entity186 was trying to break the ice with me -- i 'd never really talked with him much , i 'd met him -- and he said , ' i hope you do n't mind
i took " [ @entity194 ] no can do " and made " @entity195 , " the groove , out of it
' and i said no , of course not
it 's all part of [ the process ]
" two sides of " @entity202 " @entity203 took this @entity9 tune to no. 1 in 1985
hall : " i thought he made a great pop record out of a song that i 'd never really related to , in the beginning , as a pop song -- it was a gospel song to me , with secular words
... it has a lot of similarity , in spirit , to ' @entity216
' " and the hits just keep on comin ' @entity13 ' record includes 29 top 40 hits -- including six no. 1s -- but they say they never knew what would make the charts
@entity36 : " the hits were a byproduct of the albums that we made
we never really set out to have all these hits
that was just a bonus
" ireport.com : @entity9 , @entity36 on " @entity216 , " social networking method of modern music @entity9 , who 's doing " quite well " after a bout with @entity235 several years ago , lives in @entity236 ; @entity36 in @entity237
the two are friendly and do occasional concerts , including the final show at @entity105 's @entity242 arena october 23 , but in general stay busy with solo projects , including @entity9 's " @entity245 " and @entity36 ' songwriter series
still , @entity36 says there 's something special about the combination of their talents , and he 's happy others appreciate what they 've done -- whether through covers , sampling or simply listening
" we 've done what we 've done , it 's a moment in time , we 've put it out there for the world , and i think for other artists to then reinterpret it is in the great tradition of pop music , " he says
" it 's very much in the tradition of how pop evolves
