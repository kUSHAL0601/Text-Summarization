@entity0 -- @entity2 , formerly the finance chief at @entity4 's investment advisory business , pleaded guilty in federal court in @entity6 on tuesday to 10 charges including securities fraud and international money laundering
@entity2 , center in this courtroom sketch , said he knew for about 20 years he was engaged in wrongdoing
the charges carry a maximum sentence of 125 years
with his guilty plea , @entity2 waived his right to a trial
as tuesday 's hearing commenced , @entity19 district judge @entity18 explained that for him to accept @entity2 's guilty plea , @entity2 would have to sufficiently convince him that he was , in fact , guilty
that set the stage for a dramatic statement from @entity2 about his history at @entity4 's firm , his personal relationship with @entity4 , and the mechanics of a multibillion - dollar ponzi scheme for which @entity4 was convicted in june
while @entity2 's guilty plea and the judge 's acceptance of it were expected , both the defense and the prosecution were surprised by the judge 's decision to reject @entity2 's bail agreement -- and to have him escorted from the courtroom in handcuffs
the defense and even the prosecution pleaded with the judge not to order @entity2 into custody
prosecutors told the judge they believed remanding @entity2 would impede the " efficiency " of their @entity4 investigation
@entity48 , the lead defense attorney , stood multiple times to dispute the decision , variously suggesting to the judge that @entity2 instead be put under house detention , that he wear an electronic monitoring device , and that the decision on his bail agreement be postponed for 48 to 72 hours
he added that @entity2 's family was " completely unprepared " for this outcome
while @entity18 patiently heard out @entity48 's many counterproposals , he refused to back down from his decision , asserting that @entity2 was too serious a flight risk given the " astronomical " maximum sentence he may receive
the judge also said that he could not " overlook the conduct [ @entity64 ] admitted to " despite @entity2 's avowed determination to do the right thing henceforth
though @entity2 remained outwardly calm for much of tuesday 's proceedings , the judge 's decision not to grant him bail appeared to stun him
he seemed in a daze as it became clear he would leave the courtroom in handcuffs , cupping his head in his hands and rubbing his temples
earlier in his testimony , @entity2 recounted how he joined @entity4 's company as a newly minted high - school grad in 1975
he held numerous jobs during his 33 - year tenure -- options trader and research analyst among them -- but above all he was a " guy who did whatever he was told to do around the office
" working side by side with @entity4 for decades , @entity2 developed a tight bond with his employer
" @entity93 was a mentor to me and more , " he said , adding that he was " loyal to a terrible , terrible fault
" his sense of loyalty led him to falsify documents for his boss for years on end , he said
using a financial program , he looked up historical prices of stocks and then drafted customer statements showing bogus stock transactions
he calculated theoretical commissions that the business should have received from the trades that it did not actually make , and then wired money from account to account to make those commissions appear , he said
and as a principal point of contact for investors in @entity4 's investment advisory business , @entity2 said , he also regularly fielded calls from investors curious about how their money was being managed , knowing that the trades he told them about were entirely fictitious
he said he had been aware that what he was doing was wrong since the " late ' 80s , early ' 90s
" " i do n't know how i went from an 18 - year - old kid who happened to have a job [ to ] standing in front of you today , " he said
@entity2 repeatedly stated that he perpetrated the massive fraud in collusion " with others , " though he specified neither who those other were nor how many they numbered
@entity2 said he rationalized to himself that @entity4 's victims would have a soft landing if the @entity134 ever came crumbling down
he said he thought @entity4 had assets he could liquefy in a worst - case scenario
" i know my apology means nothing , " @entity2 said
his voice quavered as he expressed remorse for his part in swindling charities that had invested with @entity4
@entity143 , a @entity4 victim who said she lost 40 years ' worth of personal savings in the scheme and was now on the brink of homelessness , asked the judge to reject @entity2 's guilty plea
she insisted that the " full truth " would come out only if @entity2 stood trial
both legal teams said they expected sentencing to happen in may
each side will have the opportunity to submit documents and testimonies in support of or against @entity2 before @entity18 hands down the sentence
@entity2 is the second person involved in the @entity4 scheme to land behind bars as a result of the fraud
in june , @entity4 pleaded guilty to 11 counts and was sentenced to 150 years in prison for masterminding the scheme
prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud committed by a single person , totaling billions in losses to investors .
