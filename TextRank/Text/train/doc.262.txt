@entity0 -- testimony given by the director of the embattled @entity4 on tuesday appears to conflict with the news that broke hours after @entity7 's testimony -- that a private security contractor with a gun shared an elevator with president @entity11 , in violation of protocol , during his trip to the @entity15 in @entity16 two weeks ago
in her testimony before the @entity20 , @entity17 said she is responsible for briefing the president whenever there is a serious breach of his or his family 's security
when asked how many times she had to take such action in 2014 , she said it was only after the september 19 incident in which a man armed with a knife jumped the @entity31 fence and made it into the mansion 's @entity32
not long after the hearing adjourned , the @entity35 and then the @entity36 reported the incident in @entity16 on september 16
an agency official confirmed the incident to @entity1 in which a security contractor operating an elevator at the @entity15 was carrying a gun in the presence of @entity11 and his @entity4 detail
the contractor was taking pictures of the president and otherwise behaving in an unprofessional manner , the official said
when the security worker was confronted about his behavior , it was revealed that he was armed
asked about the apparent inconsistency in @entity17 's testimony , a spokesman for the @entity4 , @entity55 , told @entity1 " we are n't going to discuss private conversations the director may have with the president
" can the @entity4 actually change ? according to @entity4 protocols , it is up to the agency to decide who is allowed to possess firearms in the presence of the president
the agency official said that the elevator operator was determined not to be a threat to @entity11 after he was interviewed by officers
@entity31 officials did not respond to requests for comment from @entity1
" i believe the president 's security was unnecessarily compromised , " rep. @entity74 , @entity75 , told @entity1
" a convict with a gun in an elevator with the president put his life in danger
the director should have informed the president , yet she testified she did not
did she lie to @entity85 or fail to inform the president ? " @entity74 at the hearing specifically asked @entity17 " what percentage of the time do you inform the president that his personal security has in any way , shape or form been breached ? " " percentage of the time ? " @entity17 responded
" a hundred percent of the time we would advise the president
" " you would advise the president , " @entity74 specified
" yes , " she said
" in calendar year 2014 how many times has that happened ? " asked @entity74
" i have not briefed him ... except for one occasion for the september 19 incident , " she said , referring to the @entity31 intruder who was able to breach @entity31 security and get into the @entity32 of the @entity31
@entity74 clarified that the only time she had only briefed the president about his or his family 's personal security in 2014 was the one time
" that is correct , " she said
the elevator incident happened three days before the fence - jumping intrusion at the @entity31
@entity1 's @entity113 contributed to this report .
