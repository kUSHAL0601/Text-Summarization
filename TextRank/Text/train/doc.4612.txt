there are 34 years of reasons to be skeptical about any negotiations that may emerge from friday 's historic phone call between president @entity4 and @entity6 president @entity5
there are scores of broken promises and outright lies about @entity6 's nuclear program itself
there is @entity6 's state sponsorship of terror and its efforts to extend its influence across the @entity17 at the expense of peace , human dignity and @entity22 's allies
but there are no reasons not to be appreciative of the significance of the call , the courage it took for president @entity4 to seek it , or the good common sense that is to be associated with the @entity22 talking to its enemies
earlier this week , a flurry of speculation surrounded a possible meeting between @entity4 and @entity5 on the edges of the @entity37 meeting in @entity38
during a session with @entity22 media that i attended , @entity5 said a handshake between the two leaders did not take place because the @entity6 did not want the gesture without a plan for following up on it
he said the @entity48 had proposed the meeting but @entity6 declined simply because there was not enough time to prepare such a plan , and added that he welcomed better communication with the @entity22
frankly , i was skeptical
but then , after two days of exchanges , the two countries hammered out a preliminary plan
with that in place , the historic exchange , the first by leaders of the two countries since 1979 , took place
both agreed to instruct representatives to begin negotiations toward an agreement regarding @entity6 's nuclear program
the @entity22 seeks to ensure the program does not lead to @entity6 's development of nuclear weapons
@entity6 , according to @entity5 , seeks to have the ability to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear power and nothing more
there have been negotiations in other forums in the past
@entity78 here and abroad have long asserted that @entity6 has been trying to move closer to the capability to develop nuclear weapons , despite years of passionate denials by its leaders
president @entity4 has said he would use whatever means necessary to stop @entity6 from acquiring nuclear weapons
@entity22 's closest ally in the region , @entity89 , has declared @entity6 's pursuit of such weapons an existential threat
@entity6 's neighbors in the @entity94 have watched its programs warily and offered telling indications that a nuclear @entity6 would trigger a nuclear arms race in the region
president @entity4 came into office citing this as a top national security concern
even as other @entity22 policy initiatives in the region have met with mixed success , he and his team stepped up a sanctions program that squeezed the @entity6 economy hard , contributing to a national economic crisis in that country
it was one of the things president @entity5 was elected to help fix
( of course , the choice of who could run in that election and what he could then do once in office was ultimately determined by that country 's ruling clerics , most notably , @entity122 ayatollah @entity121
) whether there was a benefit to be had from direct contact between @entity6 's president and @entity22 's was raised as early as the 2008 presidential campaign
strong voices in both @entity22 political parties counseled against such exchanges
@entity4 argued as president - elect that there was merit to more rather than less interaction , telling @entity136 's @entity135 in january 2009 , " we are going to have to take a new approach ( regarding @entity6 )
and i 've outlined my belief that engagement is the place to start
" since then , having overseen @entity22 's withdrawal from @entity142 , having set a date for withdrawal from @entity145 , and having appeared hesitant to aggressively engage in crises from @entity147 to @entity148 , @entity4 has found himself using " engagement " in a different , more defensive sense
critics , including myself , have argued he appears to be leaning away from the region and its myriad , complex problems
this week at the @entity156 he said , " the danger for the world is that the @entity22 , after a decade of war , rightly concerned about issues back home , and aware of the hostility that our engagement in the region has engendered throughout the @entity167 world , may disengage
i believe that would be a mistake
" now , it seems , at a time when the president has seen his foreign policy approval numbers hit new lows , he has reverted to his old idea of actively speaking to our enemies as the best way to prove he is not turning away from the region
he has collaborated with circumstances to choose this option in @entity148 -- and @entity6
both situations defy easy solution
the @entity6 have changed their tone but must go a long way to prove they are changing their intent , embracing transparency and adhering to international standards
even if they do , if they continue to support terrorist groups like @entity191 they will be at loggerheads with the @entity22
but as @entity195 said , " to jaw - jaw is always better than to war - war
" if talks come with the skepticism they deserve -- and a tough timeline that does n't let @entity6 use them as a stalling tactic to further develop weapons programs -- they are a risk well worth taking
and they may just demonstrate that the best adviser of the new @entity4 is the old @entity4 .
