@entity0 -- testimony on day three of proceedings about the future of presidential assailant @entity5 turned to whether @entity6 , @entity7 , is the right place for him to eventually live as an outpatient
" i think it is right now , " said dr. @entity11 , a psychiatrist whom @entity5 sees during his trips to his mother 's home in @entity6
" it always requires constant assessment , but i think it is right now
" but @entity19 testified monday that @entity5 has had difficulty forming new relationships there
she said @entity5 does regularly talk with a female neighbor of his mother , and with both his female supervisor and a female co-worker at his volunteer part - time job at a hospital library
@entity19 said @entity5 , who likes to paint , has given paintings to both his supervisor and the co-worker
but she said that is something that is not unusual at that mental health care facility
according to the psychiatrist , @entity5 also offered her a painting for her office but she declined , saying she already has enough artwork
" he does n't have a romantic relationship in @entity6 , " @entity19 added
@entity5 's relationships with women have always drawn scrutiny because he hoped to impress actress @entity43 with his attack on @entity45
@entity5 , 56 , currently spends 10 days a month visiting his mother in @entity6
a plan proposed by @entity47 , where @entity5 has been treated since being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of president @entity45 and three other men , calls for the visits to be expanded and , if no problems develop , for @entity5 's eventual release to live as an outpatient
prosecutors oppose the plan , which initially calls for two visits of 17 days each , followed by six visits of 24 days
a key question posed during the hearings is what will happen to @entity5 when his widowed mother , @entity62 , is no longer alive
she 's 85 years old and sat in court monday listening to testimony
according to @entity5 's lawyer , @entity65 , his mother is in good health
@entity5 caregivers have not fully answered the question of what would happen after his mother is gone
@entity5 has been seeing @entity19 in october of 2010 , she said , and she estimated she has seen him no more than a dozen times
she agreed with doctors from @entity47 who testified last week that the most serious illnesses he had been diagnosed with -- depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder -- are in remission
however , the psychiatrist said @entity5 should continue taking his medicines , which include an antipsychotic drug called @entity80 and @entity81 for anxiety
@entity19 also agreed with other doctors who say @entity5 still suffers from narcissism but it has improved
@entity5 has been listening quietly to testimony
his brother and sister are expected to testify tomorrow
in march of 1981 , @entity5 shot @entity45 as he left a @entity0 hotel after making a speech
also wounded in the attack were @entity45 's press secretary , @entity92 , @entity93 agent @entity92 and @entity0 policeman @entity94 .
