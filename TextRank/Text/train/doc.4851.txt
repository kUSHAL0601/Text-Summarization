@entity0 became the first sitting @entity2 president to visit @entity3 on monday , praising the courage of fellow @entity6 winner @entity5 while also providing a symbolic nod to initial reforms in a nation once notorious for political repression
later , @entity0 traveled to @entity11 for a summit of regional leaders and held what an aide called a " tense " meeting with the host country 's prime minister that emphasized the need for improving human rights there
the president 's trip , his first overseas since winning re-election this month , foreshadowed the focus his administration will place on @entity27 in a second term as part of a strategy to blunt @entity32 influence in the region
@entity11 is an ally of @entity32
monday 's highlight was the several hours @entity0 spent in @entity3 , the formerly secretive country also known as @entity3
the president met with @entity5 at the lakeside villa where she spent years under house arrest for her pro-democracy activism
@entity0 called the meeting a new chapter between the two countries
" here , through so many difficult years , is where she has displayed such unbreakable courage and determination , " @entity0 told reporters , standing next to @entity5
" it is here where she showed that human freedom and human dignity can not be denied
" @entity3 was politically and economically isolated from the rest of the world for decades until it ended military rule last year
in a diplomatic show of support , @entity0 referred to the country by the government 's preferred name -- @entity3 -- rather than the colonial name of @entity3 used by @entity5 and democracy activists
@entity5 warned that @entity3 's reform process would be difficult
" the most difficult time in any transition is when we think success is in sight , then we have to be very careful that we are not lured by a mirage of success , and that we are working toward its genuine success for our people and friendship between our two countries , " she said
opinion : @entity3 faces unfolding crisis before meeting @entity5 , @entity0 spent an hour with @entity3 president @entity77 , whose reform drive has seen the release of hundreds of political prisoners and steps to open the country 's economy
the democratic and economic reforms started by the president could lead to " incredible development opportunities , " @entity0 said
@entity77 , who wore a long purple sarong and white shirt , told @entity0 he was committed to strengthening bilateral relations
the name @entity3 was introduced by the former military regime 23 years ago and is preferred by the country 's current leaders
until monday , the @entity0 administration had largely stuck to the @entity97 colonial name of @entity3
deputy national security adviser @entity98 told reporters that @entity0 exercised " diplomatic courtesy " in referencing @entity3 instead of @entity3 when meeting with @entity77
the official @entity2 position continued to be that the country 's name is @entity3 , @entity98 said
as well as meeting @entity77 and @entity5 , @entity0 delivered a speech at the @entity105 in which he urged the country to continue its " remarkable journey
" " the flickers of progress that we have seen must not be extinguished , " @entity0 said
" reforms launched from the top of society must meet the aspirations of citizens who form its foundation
" after leaving @entity3 , @entity0 traveled to @entity11 for a summit of the @entity119 that began with a first round of talks monday followed by an evening dinner
the president also discussed human rights issues in the host country with prime minister @entity127 , highlighting the case of a @entity11 radio broadcaster sentenced to prison for something he said on air about land seizures , according to @entity98
he described the meeting as " tense , " in keeping with past @entity2 efforts to raise human rights issues with @entity11
@entity127 offered no promises , but expressed a desire for closer economic ties with the @entity2 , @entity98 said
in essence , @entity98 said , @entity0 was delivering a similar message in both @entity11 and @entity3
at the dinner monday night , @entity0 and the other regional leaders wore shirts of batik , the colorful cloth that express @entity27 's tropical culture
the president sat between @entity151 prime minister @entity150 and @entity127 the visit to @entity3 created " @entity0 fever " in @entity153 , with crowds waving @entity2 flags lining the street from the airport to greet the @entity2 president
his meeting with @entity77 took place in the nation 's largest city , rather than the isolated capital
@entity0 's image also featured on t - shirts and mugs for sale in city stores
before his trip , @entity0 insisted the visit was " not an endorsement of the @entity3 government
" " this is an acknowledgment that there is a process under way inside that country that even a year and a half , two years ago , nobody foresaw , " @entity0 told reporters in @entity175 on sunday , the first stop on his @entity27 trip
he added that the country was moving " in a better direction
" @entity188 governments have responded to @entity3 's progressive efforts by easing sanctions that targeted the military regime
on friday , the @entity2 eased restrictions on imports of most goods from @entity3
but the country has also witnessed bouts of turmoil in recent months
violence between @entity200 muslims and local @entity201 broke out in the western state of @entity203
what 's behind sectarian violence in @entity3 ? during the latest eruption of tensions , the @entity206 said at least 89 people were killed over two weeks of violence and 110,000 were displaced
@entity0 urged @entity3 to use its " diversity as a strength , not a weakness
" " i believe deeply that this country can transcend its differences , and that every human being within these borders is a part of your nation 's story
" he met briefly with representatives of civil society organizations , including an advocate for @entity3 's @entity200 population
however , some aid organizations questioned whether now is the right time for @entity0 to add legitimacy to @entity77 's government
@entity3 exile leaders and human rights advocates have expressed concerns that the visit is too soon , and may not yield the additional reforms that a presidential visit can deliver if it happens at the right time .
