-- @entity1 became the fifth boxer to win major world titles in five different weight divisions after demolishing @entity6 welterweight champion @entity5 in @entity7 on saturday night
the @entity8 , dubbed " @entity1 " , stopped the @entity9 in the 12th and final round to boost his claims to be known as the world 's best pound - for - pound fighter with a victory in his seventh weight category -- his @entity18 and @entity19 crowns are not universally recognized
@entity5 weighed in at 145 pounds in front a 5,000 strong crowd at the @entity21 , with @entity1 tipping the scales at 144 pounds
the fight began well for @entity5 as he delivered several powerful jabs , despite @entity1 's speed
but @entity5 found himself on the canvas in the second round after @entity1 struck him with a flash knockdown @entity29 followed this in the fourth round with a right - hook left - hook combo , and continued to punish his opponent , who suffered swelling above both eyes
@entity5 lasted until the final round , when referee @entity36 stopped the fight following another onslaught from @entity1
" i heard that he was bigger than me and stronger than me and that 's why i tried to be more aggressive and fight toe to toe and try to ( negate ) his power , " @entity1 said
" our strategy for the fight was not to hurry , take our time , because we knew his strategy was that he was going to counter
we were very careful in the early rounds then i controlled the fight and tried to put him under pressure
" we tried our best to knock him out because that 's what my trainer said
i thought they were going to stop the fight in the 11th round and i was surprised he made it to the 12th round
" it was @entity1 's first fight since a stunning knockout of @entity64 's @entity63 sixth months ago at the same venue , having convincingly defeated the legendary @entity66 in his previous outing
@entity1 , who has won 49 fights , lost three and drawn two , is being lined up for a money - spinning fight with @entity71 @entity70 , who has also won five major titles in five weight divisions
@entity1 was rated as favorite by @entity7 oddsmakers , but @entity5 -- who has held a world title every year since 2004 -- had just one defeat in 35 fights with 27 knockouts going into the bout .
