-- perhaps @entity1 really did win the @entity2
according to @entity5 , the @entity4 - winning singer is set to return to the charts after his halftime performance on sunday
it reports that sales of his latest album , " @entity10 , " rose by 164 % after @entity1 took to the @entity2 stage with the @entity13
the album was released in december 2012
such an increase in sales is not rare or unexpected
last year 's halftime performer , @entity18 , reportedly saw a bump in sales of her " 4 " album by 123 %
and @entity1 is not an unknown quantity , though some of sunday 's viewers may have just discovered him
in 2010 , he won a grammy for best male pop vocal performance for his song " @entity28
" in january , " @entity10 " won @entity1 his second @entity4 , this time for best pop vocal album
7 things we love about @entity1 the album may re-enter the top 10 when sales figures are released by @entity35 on wednesday
this year 's @entity2 drew a record - breaking 111.5 million viewers
as is customary , @entity1 did not receive an appearance fee for his @entity2 performance
artists do it for the exposure , and that has clearly paid off for @entity1
@entity44 from @entity45 writes that the singer may see the most return in increased ticket prices and sales for his @entity50
" in 2013 , the singer grossed $ 72.4 million on 84 shows ; his average ticket price sits at about $ 66 , " @entity44 writes
" with the added exposure from the @entity2 , he could easily push prices closer to the $ 120 average of his halftime show predecessor , @entity18
