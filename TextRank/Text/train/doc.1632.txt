@entity0 -- if the @entity5 administration had known there were no weapons of mass destruction in @entity8 , it probably would n't have decided to invade in 2003 , former defense secretary @entity2 said in an interview broadcast sunday
speaking on @entity1 's " @entity11 " program , @entity2 noted there were multiple reasons for attacking @entity8 and ousting @entity14 from power
however , intelligence reports -- now shown to have been false -- that @entity8 possessed wmds were the main reason for going in , @entity2 said
" no question it was the big one , " he said
asked if the @entity21 would not have invaded if the administration had n't believed @entity8 had the weapons of mass destruction , @entity2 said : " i think that 's probably right
" he criticized the source known as " @entity27 " -- an @entity8 defector who admitted his claims that @entity8 possessed wmds were false -- but stopped short of condemning the @entity21 intelligence community
" the intelligence community talks to hundreds of people , " @entity2 said
" they have human assets , such as this man
some are honest , some are dishonest
some do it for money , some do it for self aggrandizement
some do it , apparently , to lie
" now peddling a book , four years after being replaced by @entity47 as defense secretary following heavy @entity50 losses in the 2006 mid-term elections , @entity2 maintained the swagger and bravado that were his hallmarks when dealing with the media as a @entity57 member
he said said the @entity59 administration was " wrong in attacking the @entity5 administration 's structures that have kept this country safe for almost a decade now , " including the detention facility at @entity61 , @entity62
president @entity59 campaigned on the promise that he would close the facility known as @entity68 in his first year in office , but it remains open
" they now have switched from the campaign mode , and they are keeping @entity61
they are keeping indefinite detention , " @entity2 said
" they are keeping military commissions
so obviously , they 've come to the conclusion that their campaign promises -- easier to campaign than it is to govern
" @entity2 also rejected the premise that the @entity21 is viewed more favorably around the world with @entity59 as president
" no , and i do n't think there 's data that supports that , " @entity2 said
" i think he had made a practice of trying to apologize for @entity21
i personally am proud of @entity21
" he was also critical of the @entity90 awarded @entity59 in his first year in office in 2009
" well , he had not accomplished a thing when he got the @entity94 , " @entity2 said
" it was given to him on hope
had to have been , because there was n't anything that he 'd done
" despite receiving some boos when he recently was honored at the @entity100 , the annual gathering of conservative activists , @entity2 said the @entity104 movement has brought " a lot of energy into public life and public affairs
" he said he was " deeply worried about the budget " and that the country needs to start saving money now
some of those savings can come in the @entity114 budget he formerly oversaw , he said
" my goodness , every year the @entity115 was stuffing $ 10 billion down the @entity114 's throat that we did n't want , " @entity2 said
" there 's no question that there 's money there
