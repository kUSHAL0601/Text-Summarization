-- @entity1 raced to a record eighth @entity3 title sunday with a straight sets 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 3 dismissal of fellow @entity7 @entity6 in a final briefly interrupted by a protestor brandishing a lighted flare
@entity1 was serving for the second set at 5 - 1 when a shirtless man with a white mask ran onto the @entity13 and came to within a few meters of @entity1
he was swiftly tackled by security staff -- @entity1 shook the hand of one of them -- but when play continued red smoke was still billowing over the court
perhaps shaken , @entity1 dropped his service but quickly regained his composure to close out the set in the next game
protesters aside , the weather looked the only other obstacle to another @entity1 triumph at @entity3
persistent drizzle was in evidence throughout the match , but the heavier rain held off long enough for the reigning champion to wrap up victory in two hours 16 minutes
it was his 12th grand slam title and particularly sweet after his prolonged eight - month absence from the game with a knee injury -- only returning to the @entity41 circuit in february
he also becomes the first man to win the same grand slam title eight times -- breaking out of a tie with @entity46 and @entity47 , who have seven wins apiece at @entity49
@entity1 's reputation as the " @entity1 " was further enhanced by his epic semifinal victory over @entity52 , but his friend and long - time rival @entity6 was to prove stiff opposition despite the scoreline
the 31 - year - old fourth seed briefly led in the first set after an early break , but @entity1 was soon back on track and claimed two breaks of his own to take the advantage
the second set was more one - sided , @entity6 making his only gain against service after the protest
clearly impatient to close out his victory , @entity1 immediately broke at the start of the third , but in trying to press made mistakes to be broken back
he broke through again to take a 5 - 3 lead and duly served out comfortably for victory , falling back on to the clay in trademark fashion to celebrate after a whipped forehand winner on championship point
" it 's one of the most special ones , " said an emotional @entity1
" in the last year i have had some low moments but without my family i would not have done this
without my physio i could not have done this
i never realized something like this could happen for me
" @entity6 , who was playing in his first grand slam final , conceded he had been up against an inspired opponent
" i enjoyed the two weeks here
i congratulate @entity1 , he 's the best , " he said
" but i will try my best to have another chance to play in a final and win a grand slam
this tournament is very special to me
" @entity1 was presented with his trophy by @entity96 sprint champion @entity95 , who had been sitting in the @entity97 with @entity99 actor @entity98
watch : @entity100 turns novelist both had born close witness to the earlier court invasion , which appeared to be linked with a simultaneous incident on the nearby @entity106 , where several protestors also lit flares and displayed banners opposed to @entity111 's same sex marriage legislation
two people were also ushered from the main stadium court after holding up a signs opposing the measure , which was passed last month amid widespread opposition in @entity111
it is 20 years since the infamous incident at a tournament in @entity120 when @entity100 was stabbed in the back on court by @entity123 and did not return to tennis until 1995
the 2009 @entity3 final was also held up when a man ran on the court and tried to put a red hat on the eventual winner @entity46
he was tackled by security but only after jumping the net .
