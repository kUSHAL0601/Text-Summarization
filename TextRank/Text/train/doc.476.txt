-- as @entity3 prepare for @entity4 , our community has been hauled into the violence that plagues our nation
at this moment , we do n't know for certain whether the killings sunday at two @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , were aimed exclusively at @entity3 , but it certainly feels that way
in a larger sense , we have been victimized by the random , hate - filled violence that steals lives and futures in this country daily
perhaps it is no coincidence that this hateful attack occurs at @entity4
it surely threatens @entity3 ' sense of security and multiplies the fear that we are persecuted
i wish , however , that you could know of the loving calls i am receiving from friends and clergy all over the wider metropolitan area and indeed around the world
our neighbors : jews , @entity34 and @entity35 are outraged that senseless murder would be aimed at our community
we live among friends , and that is very different from @entity40 's @entity39 , @entity41 or any other place in which @entity3 have suffered persecution
we are being singled out , but in a larger sense we are not , because this is no longer a unique act of terror
rather , the scourge of violence in @entity49 threatens us all
those who hate as a way of life must be rooted out , isolated and punished
as @entity3 , we are no strangers to violence or wanton hatred
many of us grew up with the fear of persecution
but we are not alone , either in our suffering or in our fears
our newspapers report daily murderous acts against one group or another : blacks , gays , children , @entity35 , minorities of all sorts
many of the perpetrators are not sane ; many of the victims are unsuspecting
the more proximate we are to the event , as the @entity3 of @entity9 were on sunday , the more vulnerable and violated we feel
but look at the reality
at least two of those killed were not the apparent intended targets : jewish people
they attended a nearby methodist church
they were , tragically , in the line of fire because they had come to the @entity83 to be part of an event , further evidence that this nation does not single us out as a hated minority but accepts us as beloved members of society and friends
rather , our fear and our concern should be directed at a society that will not spend the resources to provide care for the mentally ill , will not limit the means by which violence is perpetrated and does not share common social purpose sufficient to protect us all from these random killings
for that , we are all guilty
we need to search our souls to ask why we , as a society , allow these daily murders to continue
on sunday , @entity3 were apparently singled out
tomorrow , it could well be another group , and @entity9 will recede in memory
but the truth is that we are all bound by our human experience and the tragic violence that is overwhelming the @entity49 , ending lives and destroying families
our prayers are with the victims and their families
they must be our main concern , as well as those who feel threatened by random violence
sunday demonstrated that any of us could be singled out , and therefore we see we are one people that must be united in our conviction that we will not tolerate the hatred that murders innocent people and tears at the body of our nation .
