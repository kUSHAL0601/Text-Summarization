-- attorney general @entity1 on tuesday praised top state prosecutors who have followed his lead by declining to defend state bans on same - sex marriage
the speech to a gathering of state attorneys general was the latest by @entity1 in his ongoing effort to build an activist legacy on issues ranging from gay rights to changing sentencing laws for non-violent crimes
@entity1 cited the @entity17 administration decision in 2011 to quit defending the @entity18 , which eventually led to last year 's @entity20 ruling striking down the law that required the federal government to deny recognition of state - sanctioned same - sex marriages
since then , attorneys general in several states , from @entity27 to @entity28 to @entity29 , have similarly decided not defend their state laws banning same - sex marriage
such decisions should only be done in " exceptional circumstances " @entity1 said tuesday
" i believe we must be suspicious of legal classifications based solely on sexual orientation
and we must endeavor -- in all of our efforts -- to uphold and advance the values that once led our forebears to declare unequivocally that all are created equal and entitled to equal opportunity , " he said
in recent weeks , @entity1 announced plans to extend spousal benefits to same - sex married couples in all federal legal matters
for @entity1 , 63 , it 's a way to carve out a modern civil rights legacy
in discussing his gay - rights efforts , he often mentions his sister - in - law , who in 1963 made history as one of the two black students who integrated the @entity54 under federal armed guard
a portrait of a @entity58 prosecutor who stood watch on the university steps that day hangs in @entity1 's personal office in a fifth - floor corner of the @entity58 headquarters named for @entity64
@entity1 and his supporters have eagerly embraced the @entity64 legacy as a comparison
" when you look at his entire record , @entity1 will have done more to expand justice in the @entity74 than any attorney general since @entity64 , " says @entity68 , a former aide to @entity1 who remains close to the attorney general
it 's not the way his critics have portrayed him , particularly during some of the rocky periods of his tenure
for a time , he was involved in fights with @entity83 and @entity85 rivals over a variety of national security issues
and he survived a bruising battle with @entity85 @entity83 over the " @entity90 " gun trafficking controversy , including becoming the first sitting @entity92 member to be held in contempt of @entity94
" i 've had some days that have been better than others , " @entity1 told @entity0 in a november interview
but added that now , " there 's the ability to focus on issues now that really matter to me
" among those issues is working to change sentencing guidelines to give prosecutors more flexibility in certain non-violent criminal cases , pushing for rehabilitation instead of warehousing of prisoners , and getting rid of the disparity in the way the justice system deals with defendants charged in cocaine and crack cocaine crimes
@entity1 also recently made a public push for states to more quickly restore voting rights to felons after they 've completed their sentences and probation
he is joined in that effort by sen. @entity122 and other conservatives who 've similarly view it in line with their views on expanded individual rights
following @entity1 's plea , @entity129 's @entity83 governor said he could support such an idea , and a modified proposal in @entity122 's home state of @entity134 has begun moving through the legislature
but @entity1 's moves to use administrative memos to make effective changes before @entity94 passes new laws have also generated criticism
former attorney general @entity141 told @entity0 's @entity142 in an august interview that " i generally agree with the goal of getting rid of mandatory minimums
... but the way to do that is to pass a law , not to say you 're going to disregard the law
" sen. @entity151 similarly has criticized @entity1 and the @entity17 administration for taking action without waiting for @entity94
@entity1 's most notable moves have come in recent weeks with an aggressive interpretation of last year 's @entity20 ruling on same - sex marriage
after much internal debate , @entity1 decided the department would give full equal treatment to same - sex married couples , going so far as extending the right to refuse to provide incriminating testimony against a spouse , a bedrock right for married couples
earlier this month , @entity1 basked in applause in a @entity170 hotel ballroom where he announced the department 's latest decision on same - same marriage legal rights
the @entity175 , which held the event , praised him , by saying the decision " cements his place in history alongside @entity64 , another attorney general who crusaded for civil rights
