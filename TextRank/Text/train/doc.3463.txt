-- it 's inevitable these days
if you fly , you 're going to have to spend a good amount of time at the airport , either waiting to take off or between flights
thankfully , more and more airports are sympathetic to your situation and are adding unique amenities to help keep you entertained
of course , you can always whip out your laptop and check your e-mail or stop into the nearest newsstand and pick up the latest @entity15 thriller , but we think you 'll find these options a lot more exciting
@entity19 , @entity20 , the @entity21 : @entity19 certainly is n't the only airport to feature its own museum , but it was the world 's first
the terminal houses an annex of the city 's famed @entity28 , the national museum devoted to @entity21 art , history and more
exhibits change every few months and admission is free
@entity34 @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 : fliers with a sweet tooth can make their own sundaes at the self - serve @entity42
simply step up to the interactive touch screen , key in your choices from the 96 combinations of ice cream and mix - ins , and , in less than a minute , out pops your tasty made - to - order frozen concoction
@entity52 amazing first - class air cabins @entity55 - @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 : another interactive touch - screen concept has just recently been introduced in @entity55 , but instead of ice cream , it dishes out movies
at 11 @entity63 kiosks , travelers can download , via flash drive , digital versions of more than 500 movies ( from classics to new releases ) , that they can then watch on their laptop or tablet while in flight or just hanging around the terminal
the flicks can be either rented or purchased , and since the service is digital , new releases are always in stock and there 's nothing to return
in addition to @entity55 , there are kiosks at the airports in @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity85
@entity86 @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 : @entity88 claims to be the live music capital of the world , and to prove their point , visitors do n't even have to leave the airport to catch a show

flight get in late ? not a problem , as flood lights let you play after dark
@entity132 @entity133 , @entity82 , @entity83 : @entity82 is widely regarded as one of the nation 's most bikeable cities , so it 's only logical its airport would want to install a bike assembly station
the space provides a handy place for travelers to assemble or disassemble their bikes before and after their flight
travelers can even take a quick spin along the bike path that connects to the airport
basic bike tools can be borrowed from the airport 's @entity150 , along with information on local cycling resources
@entity154 @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 : travelers connecting through @entity155 can make the most of a long layover by joining one of the airport 's guided transit tours

the trained therapy dog is outfitted with a " @entity185 " uniform and her own business cards ( e-mail her at casey@miami - airport.com )
@entity178 and @entity180 give passengers directions and generally try to ease the travel experience
and if you 're flying with a pet in tow , you 'll want to make note of the growing number of animal relief areas , like those at the @entity176 airport that feature patches of real grass and a bright yellow fire hydrant
@entity200 @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 : it 's game on at @entity202 's @entity201 , where a ping pong table installed last summer as part of a special event has been so popular that they decided to make it a permanent fixture
just try not to lose the balls
@entity212 @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 : @entity215 's beer brewing history is long and storied , and passengers at the @entity214 airport can sample the country 's savory suds at @entity221 , a @entity222 - style tavern complete with outdoor beer garden and its own on - site brewery
thirsty patrons can even watch the brewmaster as he works his magic on the more than 110,000 gallons produced there each year
@entity230 @entity231 , @entity231 , @entity232 : @entity232 chocolates and watches are n't the only thing you can pick up at the @entity231 airport

thousands of regular books , magazines and newspapers are available as well
@entity266 @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 : @entity271 travelers can practice their sun salutations at the new yoga room at @entity267
the 150 - square - foot , mirror - walled studio is simplistic ( just a few chairs and mats ) , but it 's a nice , quiet place to work out the kinks and calm the nerves
@entity280 ! www.flysfo.com @entity281 , @entity282 : when it comes to ways to entertain yourself at the airport , @entity281 takes the prize
routinely voted among the world 's best airports , it features a laundry list of enticements , including five themed gardens , one of them home to more than a thousand butterflies ; free calf - massage stations , as well as a spa at which you can get one of the crazy treatments where tiny fish nibble the dead skin off your feet ; a free movie theater that plays first - run films ; free @entity306 and @entity307 game consoles ; a 40 - foot - high slide that you can zoom down at 19 feet per second ; a rooftop swimming pool ; prayer rooms ; designated napping facilities ; and a mobile post office that makes sending home those " wish you were here " postcards a breeze
