-- " @entity5 " runner - up @entity2 was in " the battle of his life fighting mental illness " when he killed himself friday , his family said sunday
his family blames the lack of mental health treatment facilities and the easy access to guns as factors in his tragic death
" it is overwhelming to think that with proper , intensive treatment , @entity2 may still be with us , " his lawyer , @entity16 , said sunday
" he was a jewel with so much talent to offer this world
but , in his state of mind , he turned to the streets for a gun and easily got it
" @entity2 , 26 , died from a gunshot wound to his head
his death has been ruled a suicide , a spokesman for the @entity30 , @entity31 , medical examiner said sunday
he was charged with aggravated battery in july after scuffling with police officers who were called to the scene after he suffered serious facial wounds from a self - inflicted gunshot , according to his lawyer
his mother believed that incident was a call for help , not a suicide attempt , @entity16 said
but getting @entity2 help was not easy because of the lack of full - time mental health facilities in @entity31 that would accept his insurance , she said
@entity52 ' mother , @entity51 , found him dead in an alley on @entity56 's south side friday evening after a neighbor called to say he was walking around with a gun , @entity16 said
his family is now hoping to help others suffering from mental illness by talking about what happened to @entity2 in the three months since his arrest , she said
' the battle of his life ' marks -- who , at 7 feet 2 inches tall , was known by friends as a " gentle giant " -- was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago , the same month he lost to to winner @entity72 in the final round of the @entity76 reality cooking competition 's third season
a doctor diagnosed @entity2 with schizophrenia just last week , @entity16 said
" @entity2 was so kind , so gentle , " his mother told @entity4 sunday
he would never hurt anyone ; never
he was just a gentle , sweet soul ; but he hurt himself
that breaks my heart , that he hurt himself
" " but , behind that huge smile , @entity87 was in the battle of his life fighting mental illness , " a family statement said
" it was extremely tough , but @entity87 was always positive , focused on his faith in @entity94 and determined to win ; pushing forward through his illness to follow his passion for cooking and dream of being a renowned chef
" that battle apparently began just as @entity2 was achieving celebrity status on television
" i had n't noticed any signs of anything wrong or any mental illness until after @entity87 completed filming ' @entity5 , ' " his mother said
" the time he was away filming was extremely stressful on him
" @entity52 ' stepfather @entity109 , in a statement to @entity4 , described " the toll that being on a reality show puts on people
" " @entity87 had a following of fans and was put on a ' celebrity ' type pedestal , with the expectation from others that there was money and fame ; but , his personal reality was that he was struggling mentally and financially , " he said
" i think people expect that you come away from a reality show and have it made
that 's not necessarily the case
" @entity2 spoke about his mental illness in a public service video he recorded in february for the @entity129 , a nonprofit suicide awareness project
the project promotes " how to use music as an alternative to the crazy thoughts you may have going in your mind , " @entity2 said in the video
" me , personally , i have bipolar disorder , so , you know , i 'll get a little anxious sometimes
and how i cool out is , i listen to music and just listen to the words and just relax and , you know , find my melody
i wish we had some music going on in here right now
" ' a mental break ' but last summer @entity52 suffered " a mental break " that led to his arrest on july 29 , his lawyer said
marks told police he had been possessed by " @entity5 " judge @entity153 , who turned him into @entity94 , the @entity150 reported
" what people do n't know is that on the night @entity87 was arrested in july , he had just shot himself and had called police for help from the emergency phone , " his mother said
" he was n't himself , he was in a manic state , calling the police to help him after having shot himself
" when police arrived , a scuffle ensued
" they said that @entity87 lunged at them and attempted to disarm an officer , " his other said
" in addition to his gunshot wound to the face , @entity87 suffered a fractured jaw and injury to his face and head
" he was treated at a hospital for the facial and ear wounds caused by a bullet that he fired and then transferred to the @entity179 , where he was placed in the general population , his lawyer said
he got no mental health treatment and no medications while in jail , @entity16 said
" i think people look at mental illness as if it is a crime instead of treating the illness , " @entity109 said
" they knew of his mental illness , yet they throw him in jail with no treatment ? " his mother , a @entity56 public elementary school teacher , bailed him out after more than a week
she desperately sought a full - time mental health program for @entity2 , but she could not find a one with an available bed , @entity16 said
" after this , @entity87 was determined to get well , " his mother said
@entity109 " continually ran into roadblocks " as she put her focus into finding help for her son , @entity16 said
" access to long - term , in - patient mental health care is extremely limited
how can you appropriately treat your loved one 's mental health challenges if access to necessary care is virtually non-existent ? " she " felt as if her hands were tied " but " she was doing everything she could to get him in treatment , " @entity16 said
@entity109 enrolled her son in an outpatient program that was " the best available through insurance , " she said
a new diagnosis : schizophrenia that program concluded thursday , with a doctor informing @entity52 that he believed he was suffering from schizophrenia
the new diagnosis upset him , @entity16 said
" that 's not what i am , that 's not what i am , " he told his mother , the lawyer said
" he was very distraught by this new diagnosis , " his mother said
" he was just coming to terms with having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder , but he just could n't handle this new diagnosis
" @entity109 stayed home from her teaching job friday to be with her son
" i was concerned about him ; he just was n't himself , so i stayed with him at my dad 's home thursday night after we left the hospital and all day on friday , " she said
" i only left for a couple of hours to pick up my daughter from school friday afternoon
" she was stuck in @entity56 's rush - hour traffic when she got a call from her brother saying that a neighbor saw her son walking around an alley with a gun
" i rushed back to the south side to get to the neighborhood , and just started driving through the alleys near my dad 's house looking for him , " @entity109 said
" all i could think was i have to get to him in time
" she frantically drove through alleys searching
" i saw @entity2 laying there in the second alley that i turned down , " his mother said
" i screamed for help and held him
i just did n't get to my boy on time
i did n't get to my boy
" @entity109 is determined to set up a foundation in her son 's memory to help people with mental illness to address the same issues as @entity2
" i am not done , this is not over , " she said
" i am going to make sure that @entity87 's voice and dream live on by fighting for mental healthcare treatment
" while police work to trace how @entity2 got the handgun he used to kill himself , his family is also seeking answers
" we live in a country where anyone can buy a gun on the streets at will , " @entity16 said
" we know that @entity87 paid little or no money for that gun , because he just did n't have it ; he was unemployed and in treatment full time
so with no money , how did he get this gun ? " for help please contact the @entity283 or call 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 and they will put you in touch with someone in your area
