@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 said friday that he regrets the deaths of 35 civilians in a military airstrike in a @entity8 area on the border with @entity10
speaking to reporters in @entity0 , he said , " it is an unfortunate outcome
it is a sad outcome
" pledging a full investigation , he said those killed late wednesday were smuggling cigarettes and fuel , with almost half of them below the age of 20
@entity2 said @entity3 's military had been monitoring the area because it was in constant use by terrorist groups and that security forces had become suspicious because of the size of the group and number of donkeys used
the funerals of the victims , who all came from three villages in the @entity35 area of @entity37 province , should now have been conducted , he said
his words came a day after a senior member of a @entity8 separatist group urged @entity8 to rise up against @entity3 authorities over what he called a massacre
@entity44 , a member of the command council of the armed wing of the @entity47 , or @entity47 , issued the call for action on the group 's official website
" we urge all the people of @entity8 , especially the people of @entity55 ( province ) and @entity37 , to react to this massacre and seek a settling of accounts through uprisings from the perpetrators of this massacre , " @entity44 said in a statement
some observers have sounded the alarm in recent months about escalating tension between @entity3 and its @entity8 minority , warning it may reignite a conflict that has simmered since 1984 and claimed more than 30,000 lives
@entity3 has been going on the offensive against @entity8 separatists based across its border in northern @entity10 with bombings and incursions
@entity44 dismissed comments made by the @entity3 military general staff thursday , however , as having " nothing to do with reality , " saying the attack occurred inside @entity3 , not in northern @entity10 as the general staff said
the general staff statement said the airstrike late wednesday was in the @entity84 - @entity83 area of northern @entity10 , where many militant training camps are situated and there are no civilian settlements
surveillance by unmanned aerial vehicles showed a group moving from @entity10 toward the border with @entity3 in an area " mostly used by terrorists , " it said
@entity44 disputed that claim , saying the strike by @entity3 air force jets was 30 kilometers ( 19 miles ) away from @entity98 in @entity35 , in a @entity8 - populated area of @entity3
" we do not have any camps , bases , activity or movement in the area as claimed
this massacre is an attack against our patriotic people of @entity111 , " he said , using the @entity8 term for the @entity37 area
@entity3 foreign minister @entity112 said friday that @entity3 did not discriminate between its citizens , only between civilians and terrorists
" every citizen is so valuable for us , " he said , quoted by the semi-official @entity117 news agency
he described wednesday 's airstrike as an " exceptional incident " that should be investigated according to the law
@entity3 's president @entity123 also said the incident was unfortunate , @entity117 reports
a senior member of @entity3 's governing @entity126 ( @entity126 ) also said thursday that indications were that those killed were civilians smuggling cigarettes
" these people were thought to be terrorists ; however , the first initial investigative information we have from the local authorities , especially from @entity37 governor 's office , indicate that these people are involved in cigarette smuggling , " said the @entity126 's deputy chairman and spokesman @entity131
he said the strike had killed many members of the same family
" even if there was a situation 100 % that these people were smugglers , these people should not have been subjected to this , they should not have been bombed
it is out of question , " he said
@entity131 promised a full investigation into the incident
the general staff statement released thursday said the military had received intelligence that militants were planning to attack border outposts following recent action against @entity8 separatists
in october , an attack killed 24 @entity3 soldiers in the southeastern section of the country , where @entity3 borders @entity10
the @entity3 government blamed terrorists for that attack , and the @entity168 pinned responsibility for the attack on militants from the @entity47
earlier this month , @entity3 police detained dozens of people in a wave of raids focused on @entity177 media organizations
the @entity8 represent the largest ethnic minority in @entity3
for decades , they were the target of repressive government policies , implemented by officials who sometimes referred to them as " mountain @entity3
" the @entity47 is designated as a terror organization by @entity3 and the @entity168
@entity1 's @entity185 contributed to this report .
