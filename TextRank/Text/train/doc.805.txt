months after a surprise ruling from a @entity4 judge made him a free man , @entity1 authorities have placed a new bounty for the capture of accused @entity4 drug lord @entity9
the @entity10 says it will pay up to $ 5 million for information leading to @entity9 's arrest or conviction
@entity9 , 61 , once leader of @entity4 's now - defunct @entity14 , is accused in the 1985 kidnapping and killing of @entity18 agent @entity17 and his pilot , @entity19
he 'd served 28 years of a 40 - year sentence for the killings when a judge in @entity4 's @entity24 state overturned his conviction in august
" @entity9 was the organizer and mastermind of this atrocious act , and his unexpected release from a @entity4 prison was shocking and disturbing to law enforcement professionals on both sides of the border , " @entity18 administrator @entity26 said in a statement tuesday
she said the @entity1 government " will utilize every tool available , including the @entity36 , to bring @entity9 to justice
" after a meeting in @entity41 in september , @entity4 attorney general @entity39 promised that authorities in his country would reapprehend @entity9
but there 's been no word on the accused drug lord 's whereabouts since then
the @entity18 described @entity9 as fugitive from the @entity49 for the @entity50 on felony murder and kidnapping charges , in addition to other criminal charges
on august 9 , a @entity4 federal court overturned @entity9 's conviction , ruling that he had been incorrectly tried in the country 's federal judicial system , when he should have been tried at the state level
the slayings decades ago profoundly damaged @entity1 - @entity4 relations and remained a sore spot in the drug war
and the drug lord 's release in august infuriated @entity1 officials once again
the @entity67 said freeing @entity9 was " deeply troubling " and it would " vigorously continue its efforts to ensure " that he faces charges for his crimes .
