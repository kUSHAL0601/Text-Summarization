editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of " the @entity3 : lessons for @entity5 from the people who 've lived the @entity7
" he spoke at the @entity9 at the @entity10 in september , 2009
his web site is @entity12 / for more @entity13 , click here in the same way organisms select for characteristics that favor the survival and well - being of its species over successive generations , so too do cultures
with organisms , we call this process evolution and it represents a sort of accumulated wisdom
there is no word for this process in cultures , but there is one for the result
and that word is tradition
for that past eight years , my team of scientists and @entity39 researchers have explored five parts of the world -- " @entity3 " -- where people live measurably longer lives
compared to @entity45 averages , we found a bronze - age culture in @entity48 's interior that produces about 10 times more male centenarians ; a remote peninsula in @entity51 where 50 year - olds have a three-fold better chance or reaching age 90 ; a @entity56 island completely free of @entity59 's ( about 50 percent of @entity45 over age 90 suffer from dementia ) ; and islands in southern @entity63 where people suffer one - sixth the rate of heart disease
how do they do it ? the @entity67 established that only about 20 percent of average lifespan ( within certain biological limits ) is dictated by genes
lifestyle explains most of the rest of the longevity formula
we found that all five @entity3 possessed the same nine lifestyle characteristics
among them : a low - meat , plant - based diet ( all of them ate a lot of beans ) and a ritual of " downshifting " each day
they experience the same stresses we do -- kids , health , finances -- but they managed it through daily prayer , meditation , ancestor veneration or city - wide happy hours ( like the @entity93 )
the secret to longevity , as i see it , has less to do with diet , or even exercise , and more to do with the environment in which a person lives : social and physical
what do i mean by this ? they live rewardingly inconvenient lives
they walk to the store and to their friends ' homes and they live in houses set up with opportunities to move mindlessly
they do their own yard work , hand - knead their own bread dough , and , in the case of @entity116 , get up and down off the floor several dozen times a day
they live in strong families that keep them motivated to support loved ones
centenarians are still living near their children and feel loved and the expectation to love
instead of being mere recipients of care , they are contributors to the lives of their families
they grow gardens to contribute vegetables , they continue to cook and clean
this has a powerful two-fold effect : children and grandchildren in these families benefit from their grandparents ' wisdom and care while the centenarians feel the motivation to stay active , to get out of bed in the morning , and live for a purpose
they live in cities where it is easy to walk to their friends ' houses , to the store or to church
so , we figured they get about 105 minutes of physical activity everyday -- and no health club membership ! we know from the @entity158 studies that happiness , smoking and obesity are all " contagious
" if your three best friends are obese , there 's a 70 percent better chance that you 'll be overweight
people in the @entity3 either proactively surround themselves with people who practice the right behaviors or are born into communities of people who do -- or people whose idea of fun is gardening , or bocce ball or swimming ; people who eat meat sparingly , who have faith , who are trusting and trust - worthy
why is this so important ? no supplement , hormone , antioxidant or pill of any sort has been shown to reverse , stop or even slow aging
the problem is two-fold : to do the study properly , you 'd need to follow two groups of people for life : one who takes the pill , the other that does n't
then you 'd have to control for all other factors and compare the average age of death for each group
no such study has ever been done on a " longevity " supplement
the second problem is adherence
people in general just do n't stick to doing anything for very long
are you taking supplements ? how long have you been taking them ? i 'll bet not more than a few years
@entity10 ( and hucksters ) have offered us countless diets but research done by the @entity214 's dr. @entity213 has shown that fewer than 2 percent of people adhere to diets for more than two years
for anything to really impact your life expectancy positively , you need to do it for most of your life
friends , unlike pills or diets , are much more likely to be much longer - term undertakings
the secret to solving much of @entity45 's health care crisis and battle with chronic diseases lies in emulating the environment in @entity3
is it possible ? last year , my partners and i made @entity3 - inspired changes to the environment of an entire @entity45 town -- @entity234 , @entity214 , ( see @entity236 article )
we made the town more walkable and bikeable , dug public gardens , made it easier for kids to walk to school and people to expand their face - to - face social networks to include more people motivated to change their health habits
if the trends continue , life expectancy for the average participant would rise about three years and health care costs for city workers would decrease by 48 percent
the wisdom of the world 's @entity3 represents centuries or even millennia of observed human experience
as @entity257 and @entity258 argue over how to solve the health care crisis , perhaps they should take a moment to consider the wisdom of their grandmothers
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
