-- telling a dirty joke or spouting political slogans : which can get you in trouble faster at the office ? @entity7 can get heated when your co-workers pick political sides at the office and try to argue others into the ground
" @entity15 is not the place to discuss controversial topics , because you do n't know where everyone in the group stands , " says @entity13 , author of " @entity14 : etiquette essentials for @entity22
" " when you talk about it , you can make some people uncomfortable and not everyone is as passionate as other people might be
" political talk can upset co-workers and create barriers in the office
giving your opinion on controversial topics can quickly taint the atmosphere
people who do n't agree with you might avoid you
while most employers do n't prohibit talk of politics , says @entity37 , principle of @entity39 , companies tend to differ in policies and regulations regarding political discussion
" in hard times , people become passionate
my recommendation : while we as a company can not prohibit political discussion , the company can provide recommendations and expectations , " says @entity37
when @entity53 from accounting comes around spouting his opinion about the gubernatorial election , you can do a couple of things : avoid him completely , argue or say something to end the conversation
saying " i 'm not well versed in that subject , " or " we can agree to disagree " are nonconfrontational ways to avoid the discussion , @entity13 says
but sometimes just listening is better than engaging -- especially if you work in the service industry
@entity13 gives the example of voicing political views at a beauty salon where tips make up a part of your income
" your client might bring it up , and as a hairdresser of that person , you sit and listen , that 's one thing
but if your co-worker brings it up , you do n't necessarily have to take part , " says @entity13
certain jobs do include a clash of opinions
political blogger @entity89 is not afraid to hurt your feelings , stating on his website , " if you like @entity86 , chances are you wo n't like this entry , possibly this whole blog site
" @entity92 has argued with lawyers , peers , republicans and @entity96 about anything from the health care bill to racism to the state of the economy
his advice ? " be honest and sincere , but keep it civil
be open to someone 's viewpoint , you might actually learn something from them , " @entity89 says
@entity37 also says a political discussion can be a learning experience for both the supervisor and employees
" i kind of like to divide and conquer , and discussion with employees is a pretty impactful way to address potential conflict , " says @entity37
" that 's a teaching moment
" he suggests that supervisors should address employees ' political conversation by joining in , " i just hope and expect that you are using the opportunity to have this discussion , refraining from conflict , and using this to listen to each other
" acting as a fundraiser for your political party or candidate may not be acceptable at your company
so you might want to check before e-mailing or posting solicitations on the break room bulletin board
" it really depends on if the company has a no soliciting policy
if they do , then they can ask the person to tear it [ poster ] down , " @entity37 says
it also depends on if a person is creating conflict
" address the fact if the person is offending anyone or making an uncomfortable work environment , " says @entity37
if you are unsure about your company 's policy on political conversation , contact your human resources department .
