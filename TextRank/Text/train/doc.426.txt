-- this weekend marks the kickoff of what millions of @entity2 have been looking forward to since the final minutes of @entity6 's @entity5 victory in early february -- another football season
players , primed and ready , will take to the field , inspired to make their mark on the new season
loyal fans , football - starved from a long offseason , will tune in to cheer on their hometown teams
no one can avoid the nervous energy that defines the start of a new season
but one thing fans should never have to worry about is whether or not this week 's game will be impossible to watch due to a tv blackout
it is unfortunate that we will kick off yet another football season with federal rules on the books that serve only to protect the leagues at the expense of sports fans
one of these rules is the @entity33 's ( @entity33 ) sports blackout rule , which prohibits a cable or satellite company from carrying a game that is blacked - out within the local broadcast area
while this affects leagues beyond the @entity41 , it occurs most often when , under the @entity41 's rules , a home game does not sell out at least 72 hours before kickoff
under the @entity33 's sports blackout rule , cable and satellite companies are unable to televise that game in the local broadcast market , leaving local fans in the dark
while the blackout rule was originally cast as a way to encourage ticket sales , this rationale is no longer supported by the facts
the @entity33 is aware of this and voted unanimously last december to propose elimination of the rule , acknowledging that the record does not support the argument that blackouts increase ticket sales and that " the sports blackout rules have become obsolete
" the comment period for this change concluded long ago , and the well - developed record clearly supports erasing the blackout rule from the books
but we are still waiting on the commission to cast a final vote
we wrote @entity33 commissioner @entity71 in june , urging him to bring the rule to a final vote before the start of the new @entity41 season and he indicated the @entity33 will do so by " early fall
" that time has now come , another season is upon us , and there is no reason to further delay
this is not a partisan issue , as a clear majority of @entity33 members from both political parties supports striking the rule
in an increasingly divided government , it would be a breath of fresh air for @entity92 and @entity93 @entity91 to unite with football fans and vote to spike this outdated regulation
it is not surprising that since the vote last december , the @entity41 has launched an expensive lobbying and public relations campaign aimed at ensuring the blackout rule stays on the books
their efforts have obscured the facts , arguing erroneously that the sports blackout rule has worked since its inception nearly 40 years ago
unfortunately for the league , facts are stubborn things
research by sports economists indicates there is no link between the blackout rule and stadium attendance
the league has even threatened to move games from free broadcast tv to pay services like cable if the @entity33 carries through with the vote
this last - minute pitch is all for the purpose of protecting the @entity41 's bottom line and preserving the status quo , which netted the league over $ 9 billion in revenues last year
further , the @entity41 enjoys nonprofit status -- meaning it pays no income tax -- and many games are played in stadiums financed in large part with taxpayer dollars
federal regulations should n't favor multi-billion dollar sports leagues over consumers , especially when those leagues have benefited so greatly from those very same taxpayers and sports fans
as the new season begins , we hope the @entity33 will do the right thing , and immediately vote to eliminate this outdated anti-consumer rule
at a time when @entity145 does n't seem capable of achieving much , making sure fans are n't left in the dark this season could count as a real accomplishment , one deserving a cheer from the @entity2 people .
