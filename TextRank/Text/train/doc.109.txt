-- newer threats , such as pirate skiffs chasing freighters and desperate regimes mining harbors , have intensified the @entity7 's need to handle an array of " real - world " scenarios
meeting the challenges requires robust training on the use of sonar and explosives and the testing of gear that will protect shipping and counter traditional naval forces
the environmental impact of those technologies resurfaced friday with the publication of new estimates on the number of whales and dolphins off @entity27 and @entity28 that could die or be injured as a result of their use
the @entity34 @entity33 , in a draft study , said the use of sonar and explosives in those regions from 2014 to 2019 could cause up to 200 deaths and 1,600 injuries each year , including hearing loss , among marine mammals
the death estimates are based on the use of explosives or animals being struck by ships
but , @entity7 officials told @entity0 , those numbers -- a result of mathematical modeling -- are worst - case scenarios
" we believe ... with our mitigation efforts and the @entity7 commitment that those injuries and mortalities will be none , " said @entity51 , @entity33 senior environmental planner in @entity53 , @entity27
the @entity59 requires such data before it issues permits the @entity7 needs to conduct training and exercises
the @entity7 contends improved mitigation efforts , including the posting of lookouts and the practice of turning sonar power down or off when marine mammals are spotted , are making a difference
and , they said , today 's sailors are boarding vessels with environmental sensibilities
" they have the awareness the entire nation has , " @entity51 said
" and they bring it with them
" at a time when officials expect training and testing to likely increase in the deep , blue waters off @entity27 and @entity28 , environmentalists are keeping a wary eye on the @entity7
" i am not saying they are not well - intentioned , " said @entity86 , staff attorney with the @entity87
" but i am not sure their choices make them the best environmental stewards they could be
" the debate over sonars and whales has gone on for years
it centers on balancing the need to defend the @entity34 , while safeguarding its natural resources
it has also played out in court
in 2008 , for example , the @entity34 @entity101 lifted sanctions placed on the @entity7 over its underwater sonar testing
environmental interests , said chief justice @entity106 for the majority , " are plainly outweighed by the @entity7 's need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines
" @entity86 argued that the use of lookouts aboard @entity7 ships is not fully effective
" most marine mammals do n't spend much time at the surface , " he said
" when they do , you better have good weather conditions to see them
" @entity86 points to other consequences from the use of sonar and other acoustic sources off @entity28 and @entity27
government estimates for 2014 to 2019 indicate there may be about 2 million cases of temporary hearing loss among marine animals , @entity86 told @entity0
" marine mammals use hearing the same way we use sight " to find food , he said
" this kind of constant barrage and harassment is not a recipe for healthy populations , " @entity86 added
@entity51 challenged @entity86 's assessment , saying the 2 million number includes all behavioral and " temporary " responses , such as an animal turning its head , stopping feeding or moving out of the area
" the animal fully recovers , " @entity51 said
the report also indicated monitoring in 2009 - 2010 off @entity27 and @entity28 showed 162,000 marine mammals with no evidence of distress or unusual behavior during @entity7 activities
the older @entity7 analysis , for 2009 - 2013 , estimated about 110 marine mammals would be injured or killed in @entity27 and @entity28
@entity51 and @entity159 , environmental impact statement project manager with the @entity33 , urged caution when making comparisons between the studies
they cited additional research , a wider geographic area , updated computer models and different study areas in the new analysis
" it is clearly not our intention to harm any animals , " @entity51 said
three , perhaps four , dolphins , died in 2011 during a @entity7 training exercise involving underwater explosives near @entity177
the area had been cleared but dolphins moved in too late for divers to be able to turn off a charged timer , @entity159 said
" the dolphins were at the wrong place at the wrong time
" after the incident , the size of the mitigation area was increased
" we learned from this lesson and moved forward , " @entity159 said
" the limited impacts we are expecting are to individual animals , not to the species population , " he said
@entity86 , of the @entity87 , said the @entity193 is trying a different approach
the agency is identifying marine mammal " hot spots " with a high population density , @entity86 said
the @entity7 , he said , should do a better job of not using disruptive sonar and explosives in such zones
@entity51 said the @entity7 already identifies areas for special protection , including a humpback whale sanctuary off @entity206
crews also are aware of calving season and areas
the @entity7 is seeking public input over the next 60 days as it moves forward in the permit process
" we encourage the public to engage with us so we can do a better job , " @entity51 said
" this document is very robust , very defensible and people will see that
" while the @entity7 's chief mission is defending the country , it has " a long history of environmental stewardship , " @entity51 said
@entity0 's @entity222 contributed to this report .
