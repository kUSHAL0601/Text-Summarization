@entity0 -- federal prosecutors said the defendants had a " hatred and thirst for violence , " while defense attorneys argued that an @entity6 informant was the real culprit as opening arguments got underway tuesday in the trial of four men accused in an alleged bomb plot
prosecutors say the men plotted to detonate explosives near two synagogues in the @entity20 section of the @entity21 in may 2009 and also sought to fire missiles at planes at an @entity25 base
@entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 were arrested on may 20 , 2009 , allegedly after having placed what they thought were bombs at two sites and before making their way to @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity0
but no bombs went off that night
the men were part of a year - long sting operation led by a paid @entity6 informant
the bombs and missiles were not , in fact , armed , but were rather part of the @entity6 's masquerade
and defense attorneys are calling the situation entrapment
assistant u.s. attorney @entity50 painted a picture in court of the defendants -- specifically , @entity26 -- as having a " hatred and thirst for violence
" he described the four men as having cased and photographed targets , planned their escape , and talked about public reaction
all the while , a fifth man in their group , a man they knew to be " @entity66 " and from whom they were receiving all their funding , was actually an @entity6 informant who had been taping their conversations and meeting with the @entity6
@entity50 described the informant , whose real name is @entity74 , as having been hired by the @entity6 to go to a certain mosque and listen for talk of violence against @entity78
according to @entity50 , @entity80 and @entity74 met several times over a period of months , during which time @entity74 convinced @entity80 that he was a representative of the @entity82 , a bogus international terrorism ring he said was based in @entity84 and was looking for recruits
@entity50 further charged that @entity80 expressed his desire to " kill @entity87 " and make @entity78 " pay for @entity88 and other @entity90 countries , " recruiting @entity28 and @entity27 -- who are not related -- along with @entity29 to be part of the mission to target @entity87 institutions and military operations in the @entity78
but defense attorneys argued that it was @entity74 , not the four defendants , who planned , funded , and directed the entire operation , seducing the poverty - stricken defendants with food , gifts , and promises of a significant payday
the defense painted a picture of @entity74 as a convicted felon who began working for the @entity6 as part of a plea bargain that kept him from jail and deportation , and paid him $ 100,000
defense attorneys alleged that @entity74 pressured the four men , whom , they said , he saw as his meal ticket , to agree to be a part of the mission , promising large sums of money and expensive cars and not taking no for an answer
they further alleged entrapment , as the defendants did not have violent pasts and " could not and would not have been involved in such a conspiracy without @entity74
" @entity126 , attorney for @entity80 , called the 100 hours of videotaped conversations between the men " not a documentary but a work of fiction ... a movie produced , directed , starred in , and edited by @entity74 and the @entity6
" @entity133 , attorney for @entity28 , suggested the @entity6 was more interested in instigating and initiating , rather than investigating
the trial will resume wednesday in @entity135 in @entity136 at 9:30 a.m. et
