she 's said it once , and she 'll say it four times : sen. @entity5 is not running for president
asked four times by @entity9 's @entity8 on monday morning whether she was running for president , @entity7 held her ground , repeating each time : " i am not running for president
" " that 's not what we 're doing
we had a really important fight in the @entity21 just this past week , and i 'm putting all my energy into that fight , into what happens after this , " the @entity19 @entity18 said
@entity8 pointed out that she was speaking in the present tense , and that she had n't said she would " never " run , but @entity7 did n't change her tune , eventually becoming so exasperated she demanded , " do you want me to put an exclamation point at the end ? " the questions came in the context of a growing movement to draft @entity7 into the presidential race , launched by a handful of progressive groups that see her as a transformative figure on the left
and they follow a weekend in which she emerged as a powerful figure on the left as the leader of @entity47 opposition to a must - pass government spending bill that included policy riders that progressives found unpalatable
one rider rolled back a key provision of the @entity54 financial reform bill , a pet priority of @entity7 's
and defections from both @entity47 and @entity57 in the @entity58 threatened passage of the bill and brought @entity21 to the brink of another shutdown this week
it eventually passed both the @entity58 and the @entity64 , however , and @entity7 said monday morning that " we do n't want to shut down the government , " suggesting she has no plans to take @entity21 past the brink to defend her priorities
but the newly - minted member of @entity64 @entity47 leadership hinted she 'd continue to stoke controversy within the party
" i am grateful to have a place at the table , but my priorities have n't changed , " she said
" i 'm gon na stand up and fight for what i believe in
" hundreds of @entity79 alums urge @entity7 to run
