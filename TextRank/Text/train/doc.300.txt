@entity0 -- @entity2 wore a white dress for her big day , @entity4 , braces , a hat and bow - tie
the couple , now wife and wife , tied the knot during a small ceremony led by an unregistered celebrant on a farm west of @entity14 , @entity15
it had all the hallmarks of a " real " wedding
except this one was n't valid , at least under @entity15 law
@entity15 is one of many countries around the world where same - sex couples are not permitted to legally marry
and the law does n't seem likely to change any time soon
prime minister @entity24 , who has long opposed gay marriage , made it clear thursday that her mind had n't been nudged by a politically risky move by @entity30 president @entity29 to back same - sex marriages wednesday night
" my view has n't changed and when a bill comes to the parliament later this year , moved by private members , @entity36 , one of our @entity38 members ... when that bill comes to the parliament this year i wo n't vote for it , " @entity24 told the @entity40
@entity36 is one of two members of parliament who have submitted a private member 's bill that calls for the legalization of gay marriage , however neither @entity24 nor main opposition leader @entity49 support it
" obviously at this stage we 've still got more work to do , " said @entity51 , spokesman for campaign group @entity52
" but we are confident that this issue has the support of the majority of @entity15 and it will eventually be supported by the leaders of our major parties
" @entity29 's decision to openly endorse same - sex marriage won plaudits from campaigners worldwide who have been pushing for more liberal laws since the first same - sex couples walked down the aisle in the @entity68 in 2001
same - sex marriages are now allowed in a number of @entity30 states and in countries including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , according to @entity52
wedding bells are close to ringing on same - sex marriages elsewhere : leading human rights activist @entity84 hailed @entity29 's move as evidence that support for same - sex marriage was " an unstoppable global trend "
" gay marriage is all about love , " he said
" the love of same - sex couples is just as real , strong and committed as that of married heterosexual men and women
prohibiting same - sex marriage devalues and denigrates the love of lesbian and gay couples
it signifies our continuing second class legal status
" @entity105 prime minister @entity104 has said he supports their legalization in the @entity105 , where authorities are currently consulting on the issue , having permitted civil partnerships since 2005
however the issue 's omission this week from the @entity113 , which outlines laws to be introduced in the coming months , dismayed campaigners
@entity117 , of gay rights charity @entity116 said he was " disappointed , " and pledged " to push both coalition parties to deliver on their promise ... by 2015
" after becoming the first country to legalize same - sex unions in 1989 , @entity121 is close to doing the same for same - sex marriages
in 2007 , @entity126 's @entity125 ruled that the rights of lesbian , gay , bisexual , transsexual and intersex ( @entity128 ) people should be protected and that a committee be formed to draft laws on same - sex marriage
while the government has made some progress -- such as allowing a third gender option on the census -- full protections and marriage rights have yet to be enshrined by law
however , in many countries @entity128 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) campaigners are nowhere near close to reaching for the confetti on gay marriage
simply being able to live without fear or prejudice is the aim of activists in countries where homosexuality remains taboo or illegal
according to a report released in may 2011 by the @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , same - sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries , and in five of those countries the death penalty can be applied
the countries with the harshest penalties are in @entity76 and the @entity168
mps in @entity170 have repeatedly tried to introduce an anti-homosexuality bill which would make homosexual acts a capital offense ; prominent gay rights activist @entity174 was beaten to death in the country in 2011
and even in @entity76 , where single sex marriage was legalized in 2006 , and where the post-apartheid constitution bans prejudice on the grounds of homosexuality , attacks on gays and lesbians -- including instances of so - called " corrective rape " -- still occur
in other regions too , attitudes have been slow to change
in @entity191 , efforts to frame a @entity190 were resisted by campaigners who said that gender equality could open up room for legalizing same sex unions , according to @entity196
last month , a court in @entity198 backed police over its ban on a gay rights festival which officials argued could disrupt public order
and in @entity0 , the sexuality of pop star @entity205 made headlines when he confirmed , after years of speculation , that he was gay
it was said to be the first time in nine years that a pop star had come out as homosexual in @entity213 's @entity212
" @entity0 does n't have the gay bashing that a lot of countries have ... but at the same time you still have people who are very ignorant , " said @entity217 , chairman of the @entity218 which is organizing a concert @entity205 is due to perform at on saturday , may 12
the rally is part of an event to mark @entity226 ( @entity226 ) , which is observed in 60 countries
the official date is may 17 , the day in 1990 that the @entity229 removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders
" they gossip about you , or they make suggestions that hurt you very much
so it 's that kind of discrimination and the fact that the @entity0 government has not moved forward at all in terms of legislating against discrimination against sexual minorities , " @entity217 said
separately in @entity15 on saturday , campaigners will be holding a @entity245 when thousands are expected to march through major cities calling for same - sex marriage
" a lot of people are getting exasperated that we do n't have it yet , " said @entity249 who is organizing the @entity251 march
" i think it is a matter of time but it 's not going to happen without a push
" @entity2 said she and @entity4 were n't willing to sit around and wait " and hope " for same - sex marriage to become legal
" i did n't want to miss out
i just wanted it to be the way that we wanted it to be , despite the fact that my partner is a woman , " she said
" eventually , when it becomes legal , we 'll legally bind it
" @entity1 's @entity269 contributed to this report .
