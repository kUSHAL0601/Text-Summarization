my daughter graduated from @entity2 to traditional @entity3 when she was 5 , around the time the iconic building blocks maker released its @entity6 line based on five female characters
my daughter was interested in science and art , but @entity3 was interested in selling her pink beauty salons and cupcake bakeries
when we went @entity3 shopping , she expressed frustration over the lack of female " minifigures " in her favorite @entity3 , such as the blue - and black - packaged @entity18 set or the yellow - boxed @entity20 world
@entity3 has expanded the @entity6 line by introducing activities such as biking , camping and playing sports
but now at 7 , my daughter is very much aware of the gender disparity in toy marketing
she sees it in the color - coded toy aisles , where male characters outnumber females , and she 's frustrated that she does not see more female characters in toys she likes
the friends line encapsulates my problem with @entity3 : the lack of female minifigures in the yellow , blue and black boxes and the lack of males in the @entity6 sets
it 's obvious from walking through a toy store that @entity3 has focused its licensing and product development around boys
to capture the girl market , @entity3 created the alternate , girl - only world of @entity51 for friends instead of incorporating more females into existing @entity3 sets
@entity3 says the line was one of its most successful to date , " surpassing early projections to triple the number of girls building with @entity3 bricks " in 2012
but that still leaves the market wide open for children such as my daughter , who want more female " minifigs " in gender - neutral packaging
instead , @entity3 clearly distinguishes which sets are aimed at boys or girls , and our children take in the colors on the packaging and placement on the shelves through a cultural lens
they get the message loud and clear
@entity3 is the second - largest toy manufacturer in the world ; gender parity matters in a product that is consumed and loved by so many children
when kids play across gender lines through my business and blog , i frequently discuss gender stereotypes in children 's products
a few weeks ago , a dad in @entity92 pointed out the @entity94 competition site , which allows @entity3 enthusiasts to submit product ideas on which the community may vote
the father asked me to use my social media following to promote a project called the " @entity101 , " comprising 13 ideas for female minifigures engaged in astronomy , chemistry , geology , zoology , firefighting and law enforcement
i loved the project 's focus on women in science , technology , engineering and mathematics
these are examples i want for my daughter and son
if my daughter sees females in these roles , she is more likely to believe that she can fill these roles as an adult
if my son grows up with females occupying an equal amount of space in his toys , he is more likely to become an adult who respects women and sees them as equals
@entity136 says pink easy - bake oven discourages boys from playing kitchen research shows that when women make up 25 % or more of a group , stereotypes begin to drop off , according to gender activist group @entity143
about 16 % of @entity3 minifigures are female , and this number includes the friends line , according to @entity143 analysis
the project reached 10,000 votes on june 13 , thanks in large part to social media
@entity3 said the project will advance to the review phase , where a @entity3 review board will examine the idea
during the campaign to get 10,000 votes , i noticed how many times people commented they would buy these sets because their sons and daughters wanted them
i drafted a @entity164 petition to aggregate these consumer voices and let @entity3 executives know that if they make the @entity101 , we will buy it in droves
the petition asks @entity3 's decision - makers to consider the voices of more than 9,000 petition signers who say they would buy female @entity173 for our sons and daughters
while gender equality in toys is largely seen as a girl - power issue , dozens of comments on the petition indicate that parents understand it 's important for boys and girls to see female characters doing smart and daring things
i think @entity3 is a wonderful toy with a few not wonderful parts
@entity3 gives my son and daughter a chance to play side by side
and in the end , that is what i am after , a space that is equal for boys and girls .
