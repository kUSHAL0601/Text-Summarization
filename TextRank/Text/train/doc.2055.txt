@entity0 is not officially on speaking terms with @entity3 president @entity2
but on thursday , in his @entity5 's address , he said that could change
last week , @entity8 's government news agency branded @entity10 's election as fraudulent and her father -- himself a former president -- a dictator
but in his televised speech , for the first time ever , the communist leader said he 'd talk with @entity10 , @entity3 news agency @entity13 reported
" depending on the mood and circumstances to be created , we have no reason not to hold the highest - level talks , " @entity0 said
@entity8 's state news agency did not publish those remarks in the official transcript of @entity0 's speech
his words may represent a small glacial budge , but that does n't mean things will keep moving , @entity13 cautioned
still , @entity0 spoke in detail about the need to improve @entity34 relations
moments of thaw in between bellicose bantering -- particularly against the @entity34 's military partnership with the @entity39 -- there have been momentary thaws
three months ago , some of the @entity8 's highest officials paid a snap friendly visit to the @entity34 that sparked excited live television coverage
and this past monday , @entity45 's unification minister , @entity44 , sent a fax to @entity47 suggesting cabinet ministers on both sides to meet in january , @entity13 reported
" the @entity34 and the @entity8 will have to meet each other and discuss ways toward peaceful reunification , " @entity44 later told journalists
both want reunification reunification is what both sides are pushing for
" we should make fresh headway in the national reunification movement for this year , " @entity0 said in thursday 's address , according to the official transcript published by the @entity8 's @entity61
but they have pursued it on starkly different terms
president @entity68 last year announced a 2015 road map to reunification , which she laid out in a speech in april in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity13 has reported
@entity73 was part of @entity74 , back when @entity74 was divided between the democratic @entity76 and @entity77 , and @entity3 have drawn hope from that country 's reunification for the possible realization of their own
@entity10 's talk has been called the @entity84
free market support since then , the @entity34 has sought support from its international allies for @entity10 's reunification plan , selling a single @entity8 as an economic boon to a global free market , @entity13 has reported
the @entity8 has railed against this , fearing the economically muscular @entity34 , aided by other capitalist countries , would , in a reunification , effectively digest the @entity8
@entity0 does not want @entity45 's allies involved and criticized the @entity34 's diplomatic efforts again on thursday
" to go on a tour around foreign countries touting for ' international cooperation ' in resolving the inter-korean relations issue , the one related with our nation , is a humiliating treachery of leaving its destiny in the hands of outside forces , " he said
but @entity0 's conciliatory words following after the @entity34 's offer to talk again , and his hints of moving talks up to the highest level could be significant
@entity44 , who extended that invitation , is also @entity10 's right hand in her reunification effort , @entity13 reported
he said his offer to talk was in line with the 2015 road map
fragile situation but @entity0 's speech was not all conciliatory
some of it was bellicose
he commended his forces ' " showdown with the imperialists , " possibly a reference to caustic reactions to @entity3 - @entity39 military exercises
the dictator also praised political killings in his own ranks
" @entity132 detected and purged the @entity133 , counterrevolutionary factionalists at an opportune time and with a correct decision , " the @entity61 speech transcript said
@entity3 intelligence officials said that members of the @entity8 's ruling party were shot by firing squad for viewing a @entity3 soap opera
and there are additional pressure points that have derailed @entity45 - @entity47 agreements in the past , such as the floating of messages via balloon by activists in the @entity34 into the @entity8
@entity8 soldiers opening fire on these balloons last year struck @entity3 territory
there were no reported injuries or damage
the @entity8 sees the balloons as a violation of its borders
the @entity34 sees them as an exercise of free speech
the @entity34 imposed an economic sanctions package on the @entity8 in 2010 over the attack on a @entity3 navy ship that killed 46 sailors
@entity45 demands that @entity47 take responsibility for torpedoing the vessel before it lifts the sanctions .
