@entity0 -- hindsight is 20/20 , they say , but some people may need backwards - looking glasses in debating whether the @entity5 under @entity6 erred two years ago by not designating @entity7 a terrorist group
the question arose thursday as part of the international focus on last month 's abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by the jihadist group in northeast @entity15 that threatens to sell them into slavery
a @entity19 article raised the issue
it quoted an anonymous @entity23 official who criticized the @entity6 @entity5 for rejecting calls in 2012 by some in @entity26 , the @entity27 and others to add @entity7 to the terror list as a threat to @entity23 interests and homeland security
at the time , @entity5 officials argued such a move could cause more harm than good by enhancing the group 's standing and making @entity23 and @entity39 interests a target of @entity7 attacks
after @entity6 stepped down and was succeeded by @entity42 , the @entity5 designated the group as a terrorist organization in november 2013
with global outrage and frustration over @entity7 mounting , here are some questions and answers on what happened and why : how did this all begin ? in 2009 , the small and scattered @entity7 -- an @entity53 extremist group advocating @entity55 law -- killed two police officers and a soldier in an attack on a police station in @entity60
the @entity15 military responded with a brutal and indiscriminate crackdown that killed 700 people , including @entity7 leader @entity64 in what a congressional committee report described as an extrajudicial execution
such violence hardened already bitter divisions between the remote and mostly @entity71 northern regions of @entity15 and the southern and more @entity73 southern areas
a year later , @entity7 re-emerged with a more violent profile , according to the report by the @entity76
the group 's attacks escalated and spread beyond its northeast stronghold , including the august 2011 suicide bombing at the @entity82 headquarters in @entity83 , the capital , that killed 23 people
" a number of factors have been attributed to fueling @entity7 's violence and fanaticism , including a feeling of alienation from the wealthier , @entity73 , oil - producing southern @entity15 ; pervasive poverty ; rampant government corruption ; heavy - handed security measures , and the belief that relations with the @entity98 are a corrupting influence , " said the @entity76 panel 's report compiled in november 2011
" these grievances have led to sympathy among the local @entity71 population despite @entity7 's violent tactics
" what was the response ? the @entity15 government continued to respond with brutal military repression , while voices in @entity26 warned that @entity7 was getting support from @entity111 affiliates elsewhere in @entity112 that could make it a threat beyond @entity15
in its report , the @entity76 called for @entity6 to " conduct an investigation into whether @entity7 should be designated a @entity116 " under federal law
such a move " may be required to provide our intelligence and law enforcement communities the tools necessary to ensure @entity7 does not attack @entity23 interests and the @entity23 homeland , " the report said
a few months later , amid increasing violence by @entity7 , the top @entity127 on the panel wrote @entity6 to urge its immediate terrorist designation
in a letter to the secretary , @entity131
@entity132 and @entity133 of @entity134 cited support by the @entity27 and military intelligence for such a step
@entity5 officials opposed the move , as did 24 academics with expertise in @entity143 affairs
what were the arguments ? in their letter , @entity132 and @entity133 said @entity7 could be growing into an @entity111 affiliate capable of attacking the @entity23
other @entity111 affiliates , such as @entity150 and @entity111 in the @entity151 , had started as local or regional groups that became international threats , the legislators noted
adding @entity7 to the terror list would give @entity23 intelligence , law enforcement and economic officials a wide range of tools against the group , according to @entity132 and @entity133
opponents of the terrorist designation argued that @entity7 posed no threat to the @entity23 , while adding it to the terrorism list could make @entity0 and @entity39 interests more of a target
a letter to @entity6 by the 24 academics , including former @entity23 ambassador to @entity15 @entity171 of the @entity172 , said a terrorist designation would raise @entity7 's international profile and possibly link the @entity23 to abuses by @entity15 forces cracking down on the group
" secretary @entity6 's response was entirely consistent with the position of the government of @entity15 , " which hired a @entity0 lobbying firm to oppose the foreign terrorist organization designation for @entity188 in 2012 , said @entity178 , an @entity179 professor and among the academics who signed the letter
what did @entity6 's @entity5 do ? in june 2012 , the @entity5 added three @entity7 members to a terrorist blacklist , including @entity192 , who took over the group 's leadership after @entity64 's death
meanwhile , the @entity198 administration offered various types of assistance to @entity15 , @entity5 spokeswoman @entity196 told reporters thursday
" designations are just one tool we use to fight terrorism , " @entity196 said
" there are a range of steps including under @entity6 that secretary @entity42 has continued , stepping up counter-terrorism cooperation with not just the @entity15 government but other governments in @entity112
" in a conference call with journalists wednesday , former assistant secretary of state for african affairs @entity213 explained the thinking on whether to designate @entity7 two years ago
" there was a concern that putting @entity7 on the foreign terrorist list would in fact raise its profile , give it a greater publicity , give it greater credibility , help in its recruitment and also probably drive more assistance in its direction , " @entity213 said
such a designation provides greater access to a group 's finances and more ability to limit its movements , " but none of their finances are here in the @entity23 and none of them are coming here , " he noted
whether coincidence or not , @entity7 has again increased its attacks since the @entity5 under @entity42 added it to the list of terrorist organizations last november
despite a multimillion - dollar bounty on his head , @entity192 has avoided capture and @entity7 operates with virtual impunity in northeast @entity15 and some parts of the northwest , as well as its incursions as far south as @entity83 , @entity171 told the wednesday conference call
a videotape made public recently showed a man believed to be @entity192 threatening to sell the recently abducted schoolgirls into slavery
what 's the fallout ? the political right immediately embraced the @entity19 story to enhance its attack line against @entity6 , the overwhelming favorite for the @entity264 presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run
with @entity6 polling well so far against possible @entity127 challengers , @entity127 seek to exploit any political vulnerability they can find
they seek to use the @entity7 case as well as the september 2012 terrorist attack in @entity270 , @entity271 , that killed four @entity23 , including ambassador @entity272 , to depict @entity6 as complicit in what they argue is a weakened @entity23 foreign policy under president @entity198
@entity277 chairman @entity276 said thursday that it was " sad " that @entity6 " refused calls to designate @entity111 - linked @entity7 as a terrorist organization
" the conservative @entity281 political action committee alerted journalists to the @entity19 story when it was published , then featured it atop its website
such attacks mimicked @entity127 tactics during @entity198 's 2012 re-election campaign , when @entity277 nominee @entity287 criticized the administration 's response to the @entity270 attack shortly after it occurred
on @entity7 , the letter from @entity132 and @entity133 to @entity6 urging the group 's terrorist designation came amid the campaign primaries in march 2012 as @entity127 sought to weaken the president 's perceived advantage over @entity287 on foreign policy -- mostly due to the killing of @entity111 leader @entity299 on @entity198 's order
democrats focused their comments thursday on calls for the government to help @entity15 rescue the kidnapped schoolgirls
@entity6 supporters referred journalists to the 2012 letter from the 24 academics but otherwise avoided commenting on @entity5 steps then
to @entity213 , who served under @entity6 at that time , the convoluted socio - economic dynamics of @entity15 require a more holistic and nuanced approach than the security focus of anti-terrorism efforts
" this is a very complex situation , " he said
" we all know what has happened with the girls , what happened with the number of terrorist attacks that occurred , but this is being played out against a backdrop of domestic politics and lots of social and economic immiseration in the north
" @entity1 's @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 and @entity331 contributed to this report .
