-- @entity2 rebels released a top military general and two other hostages sunday in a move that could allow stalled peace talks to resume
gen. @entity9 , who commands a 2,500 - soldier counterinsurgency group and previously headed the @entity2 army 's anti-kidnapping unit , was among the hostages handed over to mediators in a rural area in western @entity2 , the @entity8 said
the released hostages are " in perfect condition , " @entity2 president @entity16 said in a @entity20 post sunday
@entity2 's @entity21 said they were being transported to the country 's capital sunday evening to reunite with their families and undergo medical checkups after 14 days in captivity
local media reported that @entity9 was the highest - ranking officer to be taken prisoner by guerrillas from the @entity32 during the country 's bloody , five - decades - old civil war
the high - profile capture two weeks ago sent the peace talks in @entity37 between the government and the rebels , who are known as the @entity32 , screeching to a halt
@entity2 president @entity16 suspended the peace talks , demanded @entity9 's release and called on the country 's military to investigate why the general had apparently broken protocol by venturing into rebel territory
@entity9 was traveling by a boat along a river in an area known to be a hub for drug smugglers and rebels when he , an @entity57 lawyer and a corporal were captured , @entity2 government officials said
a second soldier traveling with the group managed to escape and told officials that @entity9 and his companions had been in the area to inspect an energy project
but @entity32 leaders told reporters in @entity37 earlier this month that no such project exists in that area and that they were baffled by @entity9 's presence there
rebels released @entity9 , the corporal and the army lawyer sunday to representatives of the @entity75 and @entity76 governments and the @entity77
they were transported via helicopter to @entity79 , where they were handed over to the @entity2 army , the @entity77 said
on @entity20 , @entity2 's @entity21 posted a photo of the three freed hostages meeting with the defense minister and other military leaders
the @entity87 government has provided @entity2 's military with billions of dollars in training and aid to battle @entity32 guerrillas , who authorities accuse of massive - scale drug trafficking to finance their insurgency
at the beginning of the peace talks in 2012 , @entity32 leaders said they had released all their prisoners and hostages as a sign of good faith
but president @entity16 has resisted their offers of a ceasefire , saying a previous armistice allowed rebels to seize large swathes of territory
@entity16 said in a statement that he would be meeting with his government 's negotiators to discuss the terms of their return to @entity37
the release of the hostages sunday , he said , " contributed to restoring a climate conducive to continuing the talks , demonstrates the maturity of the process and permits us to unite our voice to those of millions of @entity2 who express their solidarity with those freed
" the rebels renewed their calls for a ceasefire in a written statement released sunday , saying the guerrilla group must now " redesign the rules of the game
" " it is time for a bilateral ceasefire , an armistice , so that no bellicose event on the battlefield can be used to justify the interruption of such beautiful and historic work as it is to agree on peace for a nation that longs for this destiny , " the @entity32 said
after the hostages ' release , a @entity77 official said he hoped the peace talks would start up again
" we hope that the peace talks between the @entity2 government and the @entity32 will resume soon , " @entity146 , who heads the @entity77 delegation in @entity2 , said in a statement
" we continue to support this process , with a view to alleviating the suffering of all the victims of this long conflict
" freed @entity2 hostages carry pets tamed in the jungle @entity0 's @entity160 and @entity161 contributed to this report .
