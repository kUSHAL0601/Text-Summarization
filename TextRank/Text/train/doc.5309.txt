-- the pastor of a @entity3 church says his congregation has decided to call off the burning of the @entity6 that was to be held saturday -- the ninth anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 attack on the @entity9 by the @entity11 terror network
" we will definitely not burn the quran , " the rev. @entity14 told @entity15 's " today " on saturday " not today , not ever
" the burning had been planned for 6 p.m. @entity14 arrived in @entity17 late friday night and was working to set up a meeting with the imam in charge of the @entity22 center planned near ground zero
the planned meeting , @entity14 had said , helped persuade him to halt the burning
earlier friday , @entity14 gave mixed messages about whether he intends to carry out his plans , which have sparked international controversy and protests in the @entity22 world
@entity9 military leaders said the event would imperil the lives of troops abroad
president @entity35 said friday that the idea that " we would burn the sacred texts of someone else 's religion is contrary to what this country stands for
" he said he hopes @entity14 " prays on it " and refrains from doing it
the government has to send a " very clear message " that burning the @entity6 would endanger @entity9 troops and serve as a major recruiting tool for @entity11 , @entity35 added
on saturday , @entity17 police commissioner @entity49 said police met with @entity14 and plan to keep a " close tab on him " for his own safety
" his safety could be an issue , and we emphasized that to him last evening
and , he seemed to agree
we would like to make certain that he remains safe while he 's in this city
