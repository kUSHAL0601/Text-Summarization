-- with @entity2 bowing out of his feud with @entity4 , it seems @entity5 is more than willing to take his place
in a leaked snippet from a new @entity5 song called " vegas , " the controversial rapper appears to tell @entity4 to put away her " rape whistle
" " unless you 're @entity13 / grab you by the wrist let 's ski / so what 's it gon be / put that s * * t away @entity4 / you do n't wan na blow that rape whistle on me , " @entity5 raps
those lyrics come on the heels of @entity5 taking shots at singer @entity24 in a freestyle , saying that he 'd punch her " right in the face twice " like @entity29 player @entity28 , who was suspended from the league after he was seen on video knocking his then - fiance unconscious
that kind of lyricism is n't surprising from @entity5 , whose rhymes have been called homophobic in addition to misogynistic and violent
the rapper has explained in the past that the words he puts on wax are part of the " personas that i create in my music
" to @entity4 , that approach is not only offensive , but uninspired
" i 'm bored of the old men threatening young women as entertainment trend and much more interested in the young women getting $ trend , " the @entity48 artist tweeted on thursday
" it 's especially awkward because my 14 year old brother is the biggest eminem fan and now the artist he admired says he wants to rape me
nice ! " besides , she adds , " women in music have the bigger b * * * s anyhow
" @entity4 is right that she 's come up against a wave of criticism as her star power continues to rise
last month , she went toe - to - toe with @entity2 when the @entity69 rapper posted a series of mean - spirited photos and comments about the " fancy " rapper , including calling her a " f * * * * ng c * * t. " it was n't until he had a chat with rapper @entity78 that @entity2 decided to fold on the feud , and offered @entity4 an apology .
