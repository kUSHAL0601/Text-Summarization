@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a recent commentary , i wrote that , as a @entity5 , the ugliness of the immigration debate offends me -- not as a @entity7 , but as an @entity8
@entity9 lists 10 things @entity8 - born hispanics find distasteful about the immigration debate
a woman wrote in and asked me to be more specific : just what was it about the immigration debate that was so ugly ? she came to the right place
after nearly 20 years of writing opinions and insisting that i do n't speak for all @entity11 , in recent months , i 've heard from hundreds of @entity11 who -- appreciative of my middle - ground approach to the immigration issue -- insist that i can speak for them anytime
so , with the authority vested in me , i 'll now share some of what other @entity11 are saying
it 's not far off from what @entity24 had to say
as president of the @entity27 , the largest @entity28 civil rights organization in the @entity8 , @entity24 recently delivered an important speech to the @entity30
the topic : the immigration debate and what she called a wave of hate sweeping the land -- one that is n't limited to illegal immigrants , but which is now affecting all @entity11 regardless of where they were born , what language they speak or what flag they salute
the way @entity24 sees it , immigration is " on the verge of becoming one of the largest civil rights issues of our generation
" and , @entity11 are playing the pi√±ata
@entity24 was right on the button
to borrow a phrase , it 's getting ugly out there
and @entity8 - born @entity11 see it as plain as day
here are 10 things they find distasteful about this debate : the hypocrisy
we have two signs on the @entity8 - @entity7 border : " @entity62 " and " @entity63
with lightning speed , the debate went from anti-illegal immigrant to anti-immigrant to anti-mexican
too many politicians are trying too hard to portray themselves as tough on illegal immigration
" a quick rule of thumb : if it fits on a bumper sticker , it 's not a workable policy
people ask why @entity7 wo n't help stop illegal immigration
@entity82 : last year , @entity7 in the @entity8 sent home $ 25 billion
dark skin and @entity86 surnames should n't be proxies for undocumented status
been to @entity89 lately ? the meanness
@entity93 - produced @entity92 video games let players shoot illegal immigrants crossing the border
@entity8 think grandpa was welcomed with open arms and that he plunged into the melting pot. @entity102
@entity8 love to blame @entity7 for their choices , yelling across the border : " stop us before we hire again
the same folks who have zero tolerance for illegal immigrants easily tolerate those who hire them
some of this is painfully familiar , recalling earlier versions of this debate as it played out a hundred or two hundred years ago
@entity11 are the new @entity116 , the new @entity117 , the new @entity118
but it 's also ugly
