militants with black masks stand by as 15 - year - old @entity2 watches a video of fighters cutting off a man 's head
" this is jihad for the sake of @entity11 , " the men with kalashnikov rifles say
@entity2 begins to feel lost , confused
" does @entity11 want me to do jihad ? " he wonders
this is @entity2 's eyewitness account , told to @entity13 on wednesday in a telephone interview
he was one of the more than 140 @entity20 schoolboys kidnapped in @entity21 last month by the @entity22 in @entity23 and @entity21 ( @entity24 ) and forced to take daily lessons in radical @entity27 theology , the @entity15 , a @entity17 - based monitoring group , and local activists say
@entity2 's account provides insight into the workings of an organization that has the stated goal of creating a single caliphate across @entity21 and neighboring @entity23
armed fighters in pickup trucks on may 29 stopped buses driving children back to their hometown of @entity39 from their junior high final exams in @entity41
" how can you sit with the girls ? it is forbidden ! " the men , many with foreign accents , yelled as they separated the female students and took only the boys
the convoy of fighters then forcibly escorted the all - male group to the @entity24 - controlled city of @entity54 in northern @entity21 , @entity2 told @entity13
nearly a month later , all the boys , ranging in age from 14 to 16 , remain hostages , except for @entity2 and three others who made a harrowing escape
" we were all so scared
on the way back , we were celebrating that we had finished our tests
we were excited to go home and see our families
we did n't know why they took us , " says @entity2 , who asked his full name not be used for fear of his safety
after five days in captivity , @entity2 and a friend asked their classmates to create a diversion
the boys slipped out a back door , climbed a fence and started running to safety
the pair went from shop to shop , asking for help , but several locals , frightened by possible retaliation , turned the teenagers away
one resident gave the boys money to take public transportation to the border town of @entity88 , where they contacted their families from an internet cafe
" i was so happy when i got home
my mother had no idea that i had escaped
i was so excited to see her , " says @entity2
he says he is now wanted for fleeing and fears he will be executed if @entity24 captures him
life under @entity24 ' iron thumb the boy recalled their first morning in captivity , which began at a mosque in @entity54
" if you try to leave , " the militants said , according to @entity2 , " we will cut your heads off
" @entity24 issued blankets and assigned a single room for every 17 boys to share
almost immediately the radical schooling began , @entity2 says
every day , local sheiks woke the boys up at dawn for prayer then held the students for several hours of @entity118 lessons , said @entity2
at night , @entity24 fighters spent about five hours preaching jihad and showing graphic videos of executions and suicide operations
" @entity24 and @entity126 have targeted children for recruitment by providing military training in school settings or as part of broader education programs run by the groups , " said a report this week from @entity125
" former recruits described how leaders gave children particularly difficult or dangerous tasks and encouraged them to volunteer for suicide attacks
" while @entity24 has not commented publicly about the mass abduction , it and other armed militia groups often recruit children for combat and battlefield support
a @entity21 doctor told @entity125 he treated a boy no older than 12 whose job was to whip prisoners in @entity24 detention centers
" they are trying to brainwash them , " a man identified as the father of one of the @entity20 boys told @entity13 in a telephone interview
" we have raised our children well , but we are worried how this will affect them psychologically
" the man said on condition of anonymity
the father , a well - known @entity20 leader living outside @entity21 , asked his identity be kept secret for fear @entity24 may punish his 14 - year - old son , who is still being held in @entity54
@entity24 totally isolates the children , even threatening local residents for peering at the boys from their balconies , he says
" my friends would cry quietly at night , " @entity2 says , " now i try to comfort their parents and tell them , ' no they were happy and playing , ' but all of us were depressed
" the @entity21 government refused to set up testing centers in the @entity20 - controlled city of @entity39 , forcing nearly 1,500 students to travel through treacherous territory to the government - controlled suburbs of @entity41 for yearend exams , the opposition @entity15 said
the @entity21 government has not commented on the claim or the abduction of the boys
" these children have nothing to do with the political crisis
they just wanted to take their exams
they are innocent of all this , " the father says
@entity190 threatened the @entity192 's @entity191 ( @entity193 ) , a @entity20 militia , rules the border city of @entity39 , but @entity24 controls much of the surrounding area , effectively imposing a siege on residents
" you go into @entity199 and there are no youths
all my friends are taken
i feel i can not smile
my whole life and all my days were with my classmates and now there is nothing , " @entity2 told @entity13
anguish plagues the homes of many families worried about the safety of their youngsters and the fate of the @entity20 enclave -- now that @entity24 has acquired heavy weaponry , @entity217 - made humvees and advanced military technology from its rampage on neighboring @entity23
" it is painful for our community
if the boys had been captured in a battle then we can justify it
" @entity226 , a @entity20 activist inside @entity39 , told @entity13
@entity24 demands @entity20 troops release its fighters in exchange for the release of the children , but with a lack of direct communication and distrust between the two parties , some are calling on the international community to intervene
" we as the families , we call on any entity that could help put pressure on @entity24 to free the children to please help us , " @entity226 , whose nephew is among the abducted , told @entity13
the @entity244 ( @entity244 ) , which controls @entity39 , is accused of committing violations against children and those held in its custody
the local @entity20 authority failed to provide due process , committed arbitrary arrests and used children within its ranks , @entity125 said last week
" the @entity20 - run areas of @entity21 are quieter than war - torn parts of the country , but serious abuses are still taking place , " said @entity255 , deputy @entity256 and @entity259 director for the group
@entity21 's scattered and long - oppressed @entity20 community fought and won its local autonomy during the country 's protracted civil war but distanced itself from the armed rebellion against president @entity271
a call for the world to pay heed the @entity192 's @entity191 ( @entity193 ) , which defends and administers the ethnic minority 's strongholds , predominantly in the north , often faces armed attacks by anti-government groups vying for resources and control
" isis want to take over the world by killing , terrorizing and hurting children , " @entity226 told @entity13
" the @entity20 people will insist on defending themselves , but the world must watch and be careful
" @entity24 has not issued any official statement on the incident or the alleged request for a prisoner swap
the group , so radical that @entity292 's central command disowned it earlier this year , controls several towns and cities in northern @entity21 and recently captured much of @entity23 's @entity296 heartland including the country 's second largest city , @entity299
" i want them to free my friends and bring them back to their families , " @entity2 says
" i want @entity24 to go because if they come here , i am dead
" @entity23 's parliament called to meet amid worsening crisis @entity304 looks to block @entity24 clothing sales
