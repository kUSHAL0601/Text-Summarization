-- for decades they have been showered with abuse from almost every corner of the football ground ; from managers , players and fans alike
but it seems that @entity10 referees have blown the whistle and decided that enough is enough
next weekend officials from the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) have voted to stage a walkout in protest at what they see as an unacceptable level of abuse they have received in recent months , abuse that they believe has threatened their safety
the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) immediately vowed to avert the planned action with president @entity22 calling the referees ' decision " a sad day for @entity10 football
" he told reporters : " we will do everything we possibly can to broker a deal before the weekend because it 's obviously important that officials are on duty
" we do not condone the strike but we must sympathize with the grievances of the referees
it 's built up until they could take no more
" the behavior of some people in recent weeks has tarnished the image of @entity10 football
it has demeaned the game
the climate of inference , innuendo and conspiracy theories must stop
" there have also been reports of referees receiving death threats and being abused in the street by supporters
last week , the @entity52 's sport spokesman , mp @entity51 , suggested @entity13 referees should be forced to declare which team they support , an idea backed by @entity57 chairman @entity56
@entity57 have been at the forefront of the debate , with @entity56 last week calling for the resignation of referee @entity61 after a controversial incident during the club 's 2 - 1 victory at @entity65 on october 17
@entity61 reversed his decision to award @entity57 a penalty after claiming his assistant @entity68 had alerted him to the mistake
but @entity61 later admitted that it was he alone who overturned the decision and was warned by the @entity20 as a result
@entity56 was quoted as saying : " if the @entity20 had any sense of their own integrity , they should look at it again
his position is completely untenable
the @entity20 's position on this issue is also untenable
" at his press conference @entity22 called @entity56 's remarks " unhelpful " and insinuated @entity57 's behavior over the past few weeks had contributed to the referees ' decision to strike
@entity22 said he hoped the strike would be called off but admitted that the @entity20 would look at bringing officials in from other parts of the @entity89 in a bid to ensure this weekend 's matches go ahead .
