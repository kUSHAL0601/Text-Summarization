-- @entity3 's hard - line @entity2 group @entity1 seized control of @entity5 , the president 's hometown , after a battle with pro-government forces sunday
an @entity10 fighter mans a position in the streets of @entity13 , @entity3 , on saturday
@entity5 is a major town 55 miles ( 88 kilometers ) southeast of @entity13 , the capital
" all businesses are closed and residents are already fleeing while @entity1 are roaming the streets , " a local journalist said
the town had been under the control of forces backing the transitional government , which is scrambling to cope with deadly advances from @entity1 in @entity13
@entity1 was once the armed wing of the @entity24 , which took over most of southern @entity3 in the second half of 2006
the @entity26 says the group is affiliated with the @entity29 terrorist network , and the @entity26 backed an @entity31 invasion that drove the @entity24 from power in 2006
after seizing control of @entity5 on sunday , the rebels started conducting " search operations in the police station and the provincial headquarters of the town , " the journalist added
the clashes extended into the suburbs of the town , where sporadic fighting was going on between the rebels and government forces , said the journalist , who requested anonymity for safety reasons
the town 's seizure comes amid escalating tension between @entity3 's transitional government and the @entity1 militia , which has waged days - long attacks in the capital
in the latest round of violence , one person was killed and 15 others wounded when mortars slammed into a police academy in @entity13 on sunday
clashes between the rebels and the government in @entity13 have left at least 103 people dead and 420 wounded , @entity3 officials said friday
the east @entity66 nation has not had an effective government since 1991
last week , a spokesman for the rebel group said that it had successfully recruited more fighters
" it is not only @entity3 jihadists that are fighting in @entity13 against the government , " said @entity72 , a spokesman for @entity1
" there are also foreign @entity79 jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us
" the new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia , or @entity2 law , the spokesman said
@entity3 's new president , @entity89 , recently approved implementing sharia , but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form
meanwhile , a powerful @entity10 warlord defected to the government saturday after he disagreed with rebel @entity10 groups on the war against the transitional government
the warlord , @entity98 , was the military commander of @entity99 , who is suspected by the @entity26 of being a terrorist .
