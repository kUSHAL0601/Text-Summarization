@entity0 -- @entity4 will review and possibly cut financial aid to @entity6 , in light of @entity9 's growing economic power , the nation 's foreign ministry said friday
" with @entity6 overtaking @entity4 in terms of gross domestic product , it is completely inconceivable for @entity4 , which has been outranked , to increase its @entity16 ( official development assistance ) , " said @entity4 's foreign minister , @entity10 , on the floor of the parliament friday
last year , @entity6 overtook @entity4 as the world 's second largest economy
@entity10 also said he has instructed the ministry to conduct an official review of @entity4 's @entity16 policy for other countries , in light of @entity4 's economic challenges
the @entity26 , the nation 's ruling party , has been under increasing pressure to cut the country 's spending deficit
@entity4 has the developed world 's highest debt to gross - domestic - product ratio , nearing 200 %
@entity34 is a broad measure of a nation 's economic output
the government is also struggling with a dwindling worker and tax base , as @entity4 ages faster than any other country in the world , because of its long lifespan and low birth rate
@entity0 started extending aid to @entity6 in 1979 , but stopped fresh loans in 2007
@entity4 loans to @entity6 during the 2008 fiscal year totaled 3.32 trillion yen or about us $ 40.5 billion , according to @entity0
