@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 feels anxious at night when she leaves her home , just a few blocks away from @entity6
she fears for her life
she lives near the epicenter of protests that erupted after the killing of @entity11 in this @entity13 suburb last august
@entity3 sought solace sunday at her church
" i feel calmer , but i 'm still deeply disturbed , " said @entity3 , 49 , after service was over at @entity17 , which has served as a sanctuary for protesters and will be a haven again if things get rough
@entity3 said someone in her apartment complex was shot a few weeks ago during protests
she fears that demonstrations could turn violent again
" i do n't know what the verdict will be , " she said about the grand jury investigating @entity11 's death
" i do n't know when it will come
" that 's a question that hangs heavily over @entity0 , a city that remains on edge as word spreads that a grand jury looking into whether to indict police officer @entity36 has yet to make a decision
jurors are set to reconvene monday
@entity39 , 26 , said everyone is doing their best to deal with this period of extreme anxiety
" i know @entity43 is protecting me and my family , " she said
@entity45 says she believes the grand jury decision on whether to indict @entity36 may be postponed because no one wants trouble during @entity49
" but they 've already ruined it , " she said
@entity52 : what do you want the world to know ? the rev. @entity56 , pastor at @entity17 , knew he would have to soothe troubled souls on this sunday
he was also keenly aware that reporters were in the house of @entity43
" i hope that i wo n't disappoint you , " he said before starting his sermon
" i 'm going to try my best not to say something juicy that for the rest of my life i regret
" @entity56 has hardly been guarded on what he deems as injustice and extreme police brutality in @entity11 's killing
he said that if there is no indictment against @entity36 , authorities will be sending a message that black lives do n't matter
he asked his flock to rely on their faith to get them through turbulent times
" the path to moving forward is not always smooth , " he told @entity2
" we must do it by faith
" a tale of two streets in @entity0 but , he said , it was n't enough for @entity86 to show their anger on the streets
he preached that black people must turn tragedy into empowerment
his sermon focused on every person 's obligation to vote and participate in the community
lack of @entity86 civic engagement in @entity0 , which is 68 % black , has been a key theme in discussions about reforming aspects of how the city operates
" the power to get what you need is already in our hands
we are part of the people , and we must participate , " @entity56 said from the pulpit
" @entity111 will force us to do something
" @entity56 , like other community leaders , appealed for calm from protesters and relief from @entity43
" you alone know what the grand jury will do , " @entity56 said , looking up
" you alone know what the marchers and demonstrators will do
we ask , oh @entity43 , for your protection
