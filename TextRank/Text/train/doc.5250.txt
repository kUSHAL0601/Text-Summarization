-- online social networking site @entity1 said thursday it will begin deleting users ' tweets in countries that require it -- but it will still keep those deleted tweets visible to the rest of the world
the move is significant because , until now , the only way @entity1 could comply with countries ' limits was to remove the content globally
@entity1 said it will now delete tweets only " reactively " and on a case - by - case basis and will let the affected user know why the content is being withheld
" we hold freedom of expression in high esteem and work hard not to remove tweets , " @entity1 spokeswoman @entity18 wrote in an e-mail to @entity0
" and just to be clear , this is not a change in philosophy and there are still countries to which we will not go , " she said
as examples of countries where tweets may have to be restricted , @entity1 mentioned @entity32 and @entity33 , which ban @entity35 content
@entity1 will operate in those countries while censoring @entity35 tweets , for example
but some countries are so restrictive with freedom of expression that @entity1 ca n't exist there at all , the company said
" one of our core values as a company is to defend and respect each user 's voice , " @entity1 wrote in a blog entry thursday
" we try to keep content up wherever and whenever we can , and we will be transparent with users when we ca n't
the @entity52 must continue to flow
" but one observer said the move is blatant censorship
" there 's no way around that
but alas , @entity1 is not above the law , " according to @entity60 , the director for international freedom of expression at the @entity63 , which defends free speech and privacy online
@entity66 said she acknowledges that @entity1 , like other companies hosting user - generated content , has at some point faced a government order or request to take down content
" @entity1 has two options in the event of a request : fail to comply , and risk being blocked by the government in question , or comply ( read : censor )
and if they have ' boots on the ground , ' so to speak , in the country in question ? no choice , " she wrote
the company is simply " doing its best in a tough situation , " she said
