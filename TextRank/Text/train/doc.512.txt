@entity2 and @entity1 , here performing at a 2007 gala , are planning to tour this summer

tour rehearsals begin in @entity16 in may and the tour will launch in @entity19 around the first week of june , according to the source
shows in @entity7 and possibly @entity22 will follow , the source said
@entity1 's manager , @entity25 , has asked the group 's musicians to clear their calendars -- which means canceling other shows -- from late may through june , the source said
@entity25 , in a statement to @entity31 magazine after the february show , hinted that a tour was in the works
no official announcement has been made and @entity1 's publicist has not responded to @entity0 requests for comment
" yes there have been conversations taking place , but nothing has been confirmed , " @entity25 told @entity31
@entity12 last reunited for their " @entity45 " tour in 2003 and 2004 , which @entity31 estimated earned $ 123 million
the duo , friends since childhood , is famous for breaking up and making up about every dozen years
their biggest hits together came in the late 1960s -- including " @entity51 , " " @entity52 " and " @entity53
