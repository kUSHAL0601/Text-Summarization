@entity0 -- it was a photo shoot that caught @entity4 's attention
five courageous survivors of acid attacks posed for portraits
in a country where victims of such attacks do not dare to come out of hiding , or show their disfigured faces in public , this was a " ground breaking " photo shoot , participants said
" after the acid attack i never took photos , " @entity17 , one of the models and a survivor said
" when the photos got circulated in the media , people started calling to inquire about me , i felt so good
after the photo shoot i want to go out meet more people
" @entity17 , now 22 , was 15 years old when she was attacked by her stepmother following a dispute about money
" that night , after acid was poured on my face , i could not see anything
i could not open my eyes , i was screaming , " she said
" but no one came to help me
my stepmother watched me suffering
" after that night , everything changed
" my studies stopped , i stopped playing
" it was only three years after the acid attack that @entity17 gathered enough courage to look at her face in the mirror
it was her childhood dream , to be a designer and @entity17 designed the outfits for all the models featured on the photo shoot including herself
the photos were first published on facebook page run by @entity51 , an organization raising awareness about the plight of acid attack victims but have since been featured extensively across the world
her next step is to open a boutique
currently she is living in @entity58 , a rehabilitation center for acid attack victims opened by the charity
new law in 2013 , the @entity63 passed laws aiming to control over-the - counter sales of acid
but the implementation has been poor though , said @entity68 , founder of @entity51
" yes , the law is on paper , but you can find acid easily in local markets , " he said
" we need the government to be active in enforcing the law to regulate acid sales
" according to the group , more than 200 acid attack cases have been reported since january 2013
but activists including @entity68 believe the real number is much higher
lacking support from family and society , many victims do not report attacks to the police
fearing social stigma , many do not even show their face in public
and that is what the group wanted the photo shoot to change
" we want the acid attack survivors to come out of hiding and tell their stories
it is okay to show your face , " @entity68 said
changing perceptions @entity103 , a professional photographer , was the man behind the camera
he wanted to showcase @entity17 's designs and help her motivate other fellow acid attack survivors across the world
his second goal : make the victims feel beautiful and change the way people define " beauty " in general
" in our society , there are lots of things said to the girls -- you are not beautiful , you wo n't get married because your skin is not white and fair , " @entity103 said
" i want to change the perception of beauty -- tell people that the real beauty is not about having a fair skin
" when you see pictures used in commercials , you just see and forget them after sometime , but when you see these pictures , you feel in love with them
you want to look at them again and again
" @entity133 , another acid attack victim and a participant of the photo shoot , was 17 when acid was thrown at her face
she is 19 now and going through treatment
she can not see with her left eye
" every acid attack survivor says they do not want to meet the attackers , " she said
" but i want to meet the guy ( who did this to me ) and ask : ' was it worth it ? ' " actress critical after acid attack @entity4 acid attack victim fights for justice @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .
