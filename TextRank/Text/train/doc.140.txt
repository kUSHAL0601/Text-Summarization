-- one senator who has survived the vice presidential vetting process described it this way : like having a colonoscopy without anesthesia
the probing , highly personal examination that a presidential candidate uses to pick a running mate is uniquely @entity10
yet it is entirely shielded from public view : those who submit themselves to it must bow to a secret , often uncomfortable " deep dive " for information by a small , exclusive tribunal of lawyers and accountants trying to wrest any skeletons out of a candidate 's closet
" it 's every aspect of your life , " former @entity26 2000 presidential campaign manager @entity25 said
as former @entity32 1996 campaign manager @entity31 put it , the examination includes digging into " sex , drugs and rock and roll
" since presumptive @entity40 presidential nominee @entity39 's vice president meetings and deliberations are secret , a typical campaign practice , it 's anyone 's guess who is actually being vetted
but if @entity46 sen. @entity45 , @entity48 sen. @entity47 , @entity50 sen. @entity49 , @entity52 gov. @entity51 , @entity54 gov. @entity53 , @entity56 gov. @entity55 , @entity58 gov. @entity57 and other potential candidates have been asked and have agreed to a vetting , they are virtually assured a process even more intense than the vetting they faced while running for office
who might run with @entity39 ? it 's " the most intimate examination known to politics , " sen. @entity67 's 2008 vetting chief @entity66 recently wrote in a @entity71 opinion piece
" no other candidate , not even the presidential nominee himself , is subjected to the same scrutiny
" @entity39 is intimately familiar with the process
in 2008 he submitted to a vetting to be @entity67 's running mate
simple process becomes a deep dive the process usually begins simply : drawing from various sources , such as a candidate 's preferred picks and names from others , a vetting team will draw up a list of potential vice president picks
in his book " an @entity93 , " written with his wife , @entity94 , @entity91 sen. @entity90 said that in 2000 , @entity96 presidential candidate former vice president @entity26 's initial list of potential running mates contained 30 or 40 names
similarly , @entity66 wrote that @entity67 's team prepared initial vetting reports on a list of more than two dozen people , none of whom knew they were being vetted
@entity106 gov. @entity105 shoots down vp talk acting essentially as private investigators , vetters mine the @entity110 and public records , like newspaper articles and disclosure forms , for information on the potential candidates
those chosen for further inspection will be asked to agree to a confidential vetting
if they agree , the candidates fill out a multiple - page questionnaire
how a candidate answers could generate a list of more probing questions
" they 're looking for things that could be embarrassing , " @entity31 said
in 2008 , @entity67 's potential vice presidents -- including then - @entity127 gov. @entity126 -- faced 70 questions
among them : have you ever paid for sex ? have you ever been fairly or unfairly accused of sexual harassment ? have you ever hired an illegal immigrant ? @entity66 talked about the questioning in his recent @entity71 opinion piece
explaining that he asked potential picks " questions i would not dream of posing in any other context , " @entity66 added , " yet , as in all campaigns , if we had allowed good manners to intervene , anything we missed surely would have been dredged up by someone else
" " we asked about infidelity , sexual harassment , discrimination , plagiarism , alcohol or drug addiction , delinquent taxes , credit history and use of government positions or resources for personal benefit
nothing was off - limits
" @entity66 wrote that he discussed other matters with @entity126 : including daughter @entity158 's pregnancy , " which the governor raised in a private discussion , " ethical allegations against the governor and whether she would authorize a strike against @entity165 if it meant civilian casualties
all vetting information is ultimately relayed back to the candidate
noting her lack of experience on foreign policy and defense matters , @entity66 said he advised @entity67 that " gov. @entity126 would not be ready to be vice president on january 20 , 2009 , but that i believed she had the presence and wherewithal to grow into the position
" @entity67 chief judged @entity126 ' high - risk , high reward ' " i summed up her selection as ' high risk , high reward
' i stand by that advice , " @entity66 wrote
@entity126 recalled her side of the vetting process in her book " @entity189
" of @entity66 's vetting , @entity126 wrote : " by the time his team of attorneys finished peppering me with questions , i decided that if a person had ever done a single dark and secret thing in their lives , @entity66 's people would not only find out about it but get eyewitnesses , photos and blood samples
" " these guys knew stuff about me that i had long forgotten : they knew how i had voted on issues during my days on the city council
they reviewed copies of my tax returns
they had transcripts of sermons that visiting pastors had preached at a church i had not attended regularly since i was a teenager
and they were the ones who told [ @entity67 campaign strategist @entity218 that @entity158 was pregnant
" " i was impressed
i also thought , ' good
they know exactly what they 're getting
' " by all accounts , candidates being vetted must divulge nearly every facet of their lives : surrendering tax returns , medical records , financial statements , court records , employment records , education records and enduring background checks and a thorough check of public statements and voting records
surviving the questionnaire and what @entity31 called the " deep dive " of information , potential vice presidents gain a reward : making it on the so - called " short list , " where vetters ramp up their efforts to pull skeletons out of a candidate 's closet
" if you get near the end , you usually get down to what i call , ' @entity252 , drugs and rock and roll , ' " @entity31 said
" where it 's usually a one - on - one conversation between the chief vetter and the potential candidate
" @entity31 said this could include " allegations of sexual relations , drug use , alcohol use , other medical conditions that may have been hinted at in medical records
you really have to drill down
" @entity94 recalled in his book the " exhaustive and demanding " vetting experience , led by former @entity268 secretary of state @entity268 on @entity26 's behalf
" when @entity268 called to tell me i had made it to the short list and that they would soon have to start vetting me , he warned , ' are you still willing to go forward with it , because it 's not easy , and it can be a painful process , and there 's no way i can reduce the pain ? ' " " so i said , ' @entity51 [ which is how he is known ] , you mean this is kind of like having a colonoscopy without anesthesia ? ' " " @entity51 laughed and agreed , " @entity94 wrote
eagleton in 1968 taught future candidates a lesson helping to guide @entity94 through the process was attorney @entity287
speaking to @entity0 , @entity287 used a historical reference to stress the need for a careful vetting
he discussed presidential candidate sen. @entity292 's selection of @entity293 sen. @entity283 as his running mate in 1972
@entity283 withdrew just 18 days later after his treatment for mental illness and electroshock therapy became public
" i think that was a lesson that people in both parties learned : that anything that could be considered important by voters needed to be considered important by vetters , " @entity287 said
in past times , vice president picks were chosen at the political conventions
only in recent years have running mates been chosen in a months - long , secret process that culminates in an announcement just before the convention
not all skeletons spell doom for consideration
as @entity26 's campaign manager , @entity25 was not involved in vetting @entity94
but in her decades - long career in politics , she recalled a multitude of times she has vetted candidates for public office
" in some cases " scandal can knock a candidate out of consideration , @entity25 said
" remember , this is the first presidential decision that a presumptive nominee , like a @entity39 , will make , like an @entity26 will make , " @entity25 said
" so you want to get it right
you will be judged by this individual throughout the campaign
" @entity25 added : " for a campaign , [ damning information ] can become an explosive part of a candidate 's biography , especially when they 're introducing themselves for the first time to the national media and to the public
" @entity31 echoed the sentiment
if scandal does emerge , @entity31 said , " it depends on how severe it is
" " you keep that confidential
but you go back to the candidate and you discuss it , " @entity31 added
" @entity32 had a very explicit rule to me : do n't do anything to embarrass anybody , " @entity31 said
" which means , if you find out information , you do n't leak it out to see how it gets vetted out in the court of public opinion
" in the final stretch , a potential running mate typically meets with the presidential candidate in a secret meeting
@entity94 explained his private meeting with @entity26
" my turn came early one morning in late july , when i was smuggled into the @entity359 , the vice president 's official residence , in the backseat of a van with darkened windows , " @entity94 wrote
" over breakfast , @entity26 said that this was awkward because we were friends , but he had to interview me
" " i told him not to worry
i knew how important this decision was , and he should feel comfortable asking whatever he wanted to know
" " he then proceeded to ask , in essence , ' why should i pick you ? ' "
