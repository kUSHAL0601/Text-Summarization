-- now it 's the @entity2 ' turn
@entity3 will headline a concert wednesday in @entity5 , @entity6
the @entity7 turned out the star power for its convention in @entity10 , @entity11 , right up to the final night , when the 80,000 - strong crowd attending sen. @entity14 's closing speech at @entity15 was serenaded by @entity16 and @entity17 , among others
the @entity19 , which begins monday in @entity5 , @entity6 , may not have the same oomph , but it wo n't lack for well - known visitors
after mixing and mingling in @entity10 with @entity7 , the nonpartisan @entity22 is scheduled to join the festivities in the @entity5
the organization is devoted to arts advocacy as well as issues such as health care and affordable housing
its spokespeople include @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35
the group is showing a film , " 14 women , " about the 14 female senators of the 109th @entity40
@entity22 executive director @entity41 told @entity42 that the organization was determined to present some steak with its celebrity sizzle
ireport.com : share your photos , videos from around the @entity19 " we have a great track record of bringing substance with splash , " she said
the group is sponsoring a @entity3 concert on wednesday
the @entity57 played the group 's @entity10 show
retail chain @entity60 is co-sponsor of both shows
also in @entity5 : a show titled " @entity64 : the songs we love , " which will feature performances by @entity68 ( who wrote " @entity69 " ) and @entity70 ( " @entity71 " ) , according to @entity72
the show is sponsored the @entity74 and its @entity74
among other celebrities expected to be present are the @entity76 -- who will be headlining a concert of their own monday -- @entity79 and @entity80
however , one of the @entity2 's biggest celebrity names , @entity84 gov. @entity83 , may not make the trip
@entity83 has said that state business may keep him in @entity87
not every event will be sanctioned by the convention , of course
the politically active band @entity90 , which played a free show in @entity10 , has scheduled a @entity5 concert , though it 's far from free : tickets are $ 60 for the show at the @entity96 on wednesday
rage guitarist @entity97 is also teaming with @entity98 for a union rally on @entity100
there are also several arts - related events in a lower key
according to the @entity106 , artists will be coming to @entity5 to mount various forms of political theater , from creating ice sculptures to inviting the public to perform karaoke versions of convention speeches
though some of the exhibits will be politically pointed , organizers are careful to characterize them as nonpartisan -- and expect some unusual discourse
" you expect people to respond by organizing a protest and throwing their fists in the air , and you also expect people to respond by flying 1,000 @entity129 flags , " @entity117 of @entity5 ' @entity118 , which is taking part in that city 's " @entity120 , " told the @entity106
" and those are two legitimate ways to respond to politics , but there is a whole in - between area that does n't get talked about
