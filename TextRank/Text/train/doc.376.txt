-- @entity1 have admitted their approach to the 2011 @entity4 season has been too conservative , after the @entity6 team failed to register a podium finish in the first three races of the year
@entity9 and @entity10 , are fifth and sixth respectively in the drivers ' standings , with the former trailing current leader and reigning world champion @entity14 by 42 points
the legendary marque 's team principal @entity16 said the problems stem back to the design of the @entity21 car
" our approach was not aggressive enough at the design stage , " the 45 - year - old told @entity1 's official web site
" there was a problem with the correlation between data gathered from the wind tunnel and what we saw on track so this did the damage in these first few months
" @entity16 , who has been with @entity1 since 1991 , said the team 's form must improve ahead of three races in four weeks , starting with the @entity38 on sunday
" if there is one thing you do n't want to do , it 's panic as it definitely does not help you do better
" now we are about to tackle three races in four weeks : it will be important to show that we are back on form and to make it to the podium , something that has escaped us in all of the first three races of the season
" @entity1 's chief designer @entity52 has called for a more aggressive approach in order to move @entity1 up the grid , and he claimed the current car can not challenge @entity57 and @entity59 's dominance
" we have tried to see if our approach was too conservative and we realized that , for various reasons , we were neither reactive nor aggressive enough in the development stages , " @entity52 told the sport 's official web site
" at the moment , we do n't have a winning car and , on those of our competitors we can see innovative solutions introduced in a more aggressive fashion than we have done
" maybe we were a bit too passive in our approach
we did not push hard enough in some areas of development and unfortunately , the results can be seen on track
" @entity1 have won the constructors ' championship on 16 occasions and provided 15 drivers ' champions since making their debut in the sport in 1950 .
