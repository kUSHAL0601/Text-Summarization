of counterfeit medicine and arrested 80 people suspected of illegal trafficking in six @entity7 nations , @entity1 said thursday
more than 300 premises were checked or raided in the two - month operation across @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , according to a news release from the international police agency
the confiscated loot included anti-malaria drugs , vaccines and antibiotics
there was also a significant quantity of government medicines diverted to illegal resale markets
it was the third such seizure operation in as many years in @entity7 , intended to curb the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit medical products
representatives of the six nations are scheduled to meet in @entity15 next week to discuss the seizure and the extent of the counterfeiting problem , @entity1 said
the @entity35 defines counterfeit drugs as " medicine , which is deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with respect to identity and / or source
" counterfeiting can apply to both brand - name and generic products , and forged products may include those with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients , without active ingredients , with insufficient active ingredients , or with fake packaging , @entity35 says
the @entity52 agency created a global task force in 2006 to deal with the problem , which has been growing as international markets expand and become globalized and internet commerce has taken off
the fake products can prove detrimental to public health efforts in disease - ridden countries and in worst - case scenarios can cause death , according to the @entity35 task force .
