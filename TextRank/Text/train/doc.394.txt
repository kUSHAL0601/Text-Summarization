@entity0 , @entity1 -- public transport in @entity0 is like an endless sightseeing tour , and not only for the amount of tourists on the central vaporetto routes
the waterfront architecture is truly spectacular , from @entity10 churches to private palazzos
and now during the @entity13 contemporary artworks and installations are scattered around the city
venturing along the waterways leads to some unmissable exhibitions , where art and architecture blend into a beautiful dialogue
baroque influence close to the @entity23 market on the @entity24 , an 18th century palazzo is home to @entity27 , where all three floors are open to the public for the first time
during the biennale it 's hosting a show curated by @entity34 , one of the leading figures of the 1960s anti-formal art movement @entity36
@entity34 has filled the rooms with a theatrical show
from 16th century musical instruments , clocks and mechanical curiosities to modern installation pieces involving performers , art or @entity45 explores both formal and conceptual ideas relating to music
you can witness the craft of historic pieces as well as works by key avant - garde artists from @entity54 's previous collaborations , such as @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58
their radical rethinking of art and the abstract condition of sound resonates throughout the exhibition
the unique @entity65 interiors add another level of interest to the show
it 's both raw and historical - unlike any other contemporary art space in the world - with ornaments , carvings and rich details
the @entity75 has a contract as a patron to rescue the building and bring the original frescoes and rare , fine materials back to life , " without trying to modify it through characterless facelifts " , @entity34 explains
modernity takes over on the other side of the water , after the @entity86 , there is the @entity89 , an exhibition space in a 15th century arms storehouse by the water front
here the @entity13 theme of @entity84 extends into a scientific narrative , looking at possible ways of existence on the @entity98 continent , a subject in total contrast to the surrounding architectural heritage in @entity0
the @entity102 , curated by @entity103 makes you think of lifestyle and tourism , as well as the ecological and political questions posed by those extreme conditions on the margins of civilization
further down towards @entity111 , a giant composition of 1,179 stainless steel bikes has been neatly stacked on the canal side courtyard garden of the @entity115 near the @entity116
this art installation , titled " forever " by @entity118 is part of the exhibition @entity122 , brought to @entity0 by the @entity123
the show continues inside the 16th century palace building with sculptures and installations by international artists including @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132
contemporary public art the rest is slightly more modest in scale than @entity118 's installation , but still spectacular examples of ideas addressed in contemporary public works
there is a sense of play with architecture and space , exploring the parallels between the two disciplines , such as @entity148 's work which deals with our spatial perceptions
this exhibition suggests that genius loci ' the special spirit ' can be found in the urban space through artworks , materials and forms ; a departure from the modernist obsession with functionality
a short hop on a vaporetto takes you across the lagoon from @entity111 to the island of @entity166 , which has become a site for displaying large public installations
this year a geometric sculpture entitled " @entity173 " dominates the waterfront square next to @entity172 's famous church
its surfaces are covered with golden glass mosaics , beautifully reflecting the @entity65 sun. the piece by @entity178 , who represented @entity179 at the @entity13 in 1970 , was commissioned by the @entity180
@entity178 is known for monumental installations : " my sculptures are objects of light in space " @entity178 said
behind the church , an exquisitely crafted pavilion has been erected in the garden of the @entity190 glass museum
the aquarium - like @entity191 is designed by @entity194 artist @entity193 , best known for his minimalistic photography
@entity193 's pavilion is the first in a series of commissions , supported by the @entity180 , which follows the model of the @entity201 in @entity202
installed inside a cedar wood fenced garden , the glass pavilion will also be the setting for a traditional tea ceremony , a performance which exemplifies the delicacy in @entity194 culture
all these shows run parallel to the @entity212 , overseen by @entity214 architect @entity213 this year
even if you do n't have time to visit the @entity219 and the national pavilions , these events outside the main programme are some fantastic cultural offerings , adding another level of meaning to visiting a city with such rich heritage
