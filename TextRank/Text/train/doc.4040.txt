-- it 's the million - dollar reward that 's raising a million - dollar question : who , if anyone , is entitled to the money offered in the hunt for @entity7 ? the catch is that @entity7 , the rogue former @entity9 police officer who sparked a massive manhunt , was never captured
he died after a shootout and fire at a @entity14 mountain cabin this week after , authorities say , he killed four people and wounded three others
the city of @entity9 put up the $ 1 million reward sunday , together with other jurisdictions , groups , and private donors
it had been a few days since @entity7 was last seen , and they wanted to generate tips
@entity7 died from single gunshot to head " collectively this group , led by my office , is posting a reward of $ 1 million for information that will lead to mr. @entity7 's capture , " said mayor @entity28
now that the hunt for @entity7 is over , the @entity34 says it 's deciding what to do with the reward money
" more than 20 jurisdictions and entities are involved in this reward , so all of them will be coming together to collectively determine whether any individual ( s ) qualify for it , " the @entity34 said in a statement friday
" our personal hope is that the reward will be distributed , but we must follow the rules and respect the procedures of each entity
" former girlfriend : @entity7 was stressed out the police department said they have had a lot of inquiries about the reward
it reminded the public that no money can be distributed until the investigation is complete
one person who feels he deserves the reward is camp ranger @entity61 , one of @entity7 's last victims
@entity61 was driving tuesday near @entity63 , @entity14 , when @entity7 approached him , put a gun to his head and stole his truck
@entity7 was on the run from @entity69 wardens who had spotted him on the area 's icy roads
@entity7 and the wardens exchanged gunfire before @entity7 crashed his car , carjacked @entity61 's truck and drove it to the nearby cabin
ex-lapd cop gains sympathizers on social media after @entity7 drove off , @entity61 said he ducked off the road and called his friend , a sheriff 's deputy , to alert him
speaking thursday to @entity0 about the reward , @entity61 said , " i do think i deserve it
i believe it was my phone call to that sheriff 's deputy that directed them to the location where @entity7 was , and i believe it was my phone call that put an end to the largest manhunt in @entity9 history
" @entity61 said he wants to use the reward money to set up college funds for the children of the two law enforcement officers killed by @entity7
he also mentioned possible improvements to the scout camp where he works , which he said is rundown
" did anybody ever believe that he was going to be captured and convicted ? i do n't think so , " @entity61 told @entity0 's @entity101
" i think they put that ( clause ) in there possibly to have an out for later
i believe that that money was put up by the private sector and basically corporate donors , not from taxpayer money or anything like that , and i believe those people wanted that money to go somewhere , and i 'd like to do some good with it
" @entity61 said he could split the money with @entity116 and @entity117 , the couple who encountered @entity7 in their big bear - area condo tuesday morning , before the carjacking
though @entity7 tied up the couple , they managed to free themselves and call 911
" if they want half of it , i believe they 're deserving of half of it , " @entity61 said
speaking wednesday after their ordeal , the @entity117 said they were simply happy to be alive and had n't thought much about the reward money .
