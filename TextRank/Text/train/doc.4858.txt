-- in the time it takes you to skim this piece , you could travel 95 stories into the clouds on the world 's new fastest elevator
the elevator will operate in a new supertall skyscraper being built in @entity10 , @entity11
with a top speed of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) , this lift will fling you nearly half a kilometer in just 43 seconds
that 's like riding a speeding commuter train -- into the sky
the elevator incorporates high - tech wizardry to give you a comfortable ride even as you 're shooting vertically toward the heavens
according to manufacturer @entity22 , special technology will regulate air pressure within the car to keep your ears from getting blocked as you fly skywards
" rollers " will keep the car from swinging wildly from side to side
and in case something goes wrong on the way down ? newly developed brakes are high able to resist extreme heat -- up to 300 degrees @entity35 , says @entity22
ca n't wait to ride it ? too bad -- the @entity38 skyscraper does n't officially open until 2016
at 1,739 feet ( 530 meters ) tall , the building will be one of the world 's tallest -- though not as tall as the current record - holder @entity42 , which stands at 2,717 feet ( 828 meters )
and even that building will be dwarfed by the upcoming @entity45 in @entity46 , expected to pierce the skies at 3,281 feet ( 1 kilometer ) high .
