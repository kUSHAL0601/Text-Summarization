-- it 's a good bet that millions of @entity2 on monday greeted president @entity4 's magnificent second inaugural address not just with applause and cheers of approval but with loud sighs of relief
gone were his first inaugural speech 's bizarre equal division of blame for the wreckage of real lives between the " greed of some " and the so - called " collective failure " of the rest of us
instead , @entity4 rang out his commitment to equality for all , not the " shrinking few and lucky " who call the rest of us simply " takers
" nor did our president chide us to put away '' childish things " by seeming to describe deep differences over " perpetual war , " climate change , immigration , equal rights , voting rights , rights to decent wages for honest labor and rights to " basic measures of security and dignity " as " petty grievances
" this time around , @entity4 offered us not song and dance morals from an old @entity44 musical comedy to " pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off and start all over again , " but solid , specific support for the serious @entity47 pillars of @entity48 and @entity49
opinion : @entity4 's ringing defense of liberalism almost for the first time as president , he dared to utter the word " poverty " in a major address , and declared '' we must be a source of hope to the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the victims of prejudice
" these moments and more earned his speech the warm response and respect it deserves
now it will receive the careful analysis it can not escape
this will reveal even more profound differences between @entity4 's second inaugural speech and his historic appearance on the steps of the @entity2 @entity74 as the president of color few believed they would see elected in their lifetimes
his first inaugural address was a puzzling disappointment after the passionate convictions he expressed so powerfully in both his primary and general election campaigns
some suggested that his finest moment was @entity87 in @entity89 's @entity88
no one who followed his campaign , including his opponents , could have been surprised by his second inaugural speech
monday 's words were those of a leader who has chosen to fight for the change he believes in over flailing attempts to placate that only produced astounding charges that he was unwilling to compromise when in fact he had given so much in doomed efforts to do just that
his repeated calls for " @entity106 " to work together were not - so - subtle warnings of who would be responsible if the @entity2 government is unable to do so
no blame - splitting this time
even @entity4 's delivery and demeanor conveyed conviction , not the sense that a press aide might soon emerge from @entity116 's tent beside the @entity117 to explain that his thinking is still " evolving
" opinion : how @entity4 made opportunity real in @entity2 in this second inaugural address , @entity4 the candidate became @entity4 the president without a trace of the bait and switch to which too many citizens have become so accustomed that in their cynicism they cease to vote at all
he spoke as a leader who has stopped splitting differences and is prepared to make choices and fight for them -- together as @entity106 if possible , alone as @entity4 the president if not
opinion : @entity4 's @entity2 , better than what founders imagined in fact , monday 's speech felt as if after four frustrating years of trying to appease his opponents , @entity4 had finally met @entity139 one night in the @entity140 and learned that when faced with two equally powerful opposing forces , a president must choose , or both will attack him
he sounded like a leader who knows now that the difference between making a choice and making love is that decisions do n't feel better the longer you can draw them out
as @entity4 goes from celebration to celebration , his supporters and his opponents have a much clearer idea of what he will do tomorrow , and for the next 1,000 - plus days he is president
this time when he tells banks and insurance companies that " a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play , " they will do well to believe him
because even with all the cash he collected to fill the coffers of his campaign , monday 's speech makes it clear he will not let it line the coffin of his presidency
it betrays no security measures to mention that the @entity172 chooses oddly accurate code words for the presidents it protects
after @entity4 's first inauguration , that could have been " dancer
" after monday 's address , it could legitimately consider '' leader
" if the president is able to act in accordance with his second inaugural address , it 's not impossible now to imagine " @entity184
" he was n't afraid to fight when the nation would not stay together
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .
