@entity0 -- @entity2 has never had a problem getting into the muck of politics
since leaving the @entity7 in 2001 and stepping into the role of the @entity10 ' elder statesman , the former president has continually shown why he rose from humble roots in rural @entity12 to president of the @entity14 in the first place : his political chops and willingness to use them
so when @entity19 , the uber - @entity20 strategist , floated questions about @entity23 's health , it was no surprise that @entity2 was the one to respond from " @entity25 , " not @entity23
" i 've got to give him credit , " @entity2 said of @entity19 on wednesday at an event in @entity0
" that embodies that old saying that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
first they said she faked her concussion
and now they say she 's auditioning for a part on ' @entity38
' " @entity2 went on to say he was " sort of dumbfounded " by the fact that @entity19 reportedly hinted last week that @entity23 may have suffered a " traumatic brain injury " when she fell and suffered a concussion in december 2012
as a result of the fall , she suffered a blood clot in a vein between her skull and brain and was treated at a @entity50 hospital for three days
@entity2 said he had no questions about his wife 's health
" look , she works out every week , she is strong , she 's doing great
as far as i can tell she 's in better shape than i am
she certainly seems to have more stamina now , " he said
" i do n't know but if it is you ca n't be too upset about it
it is just the beginning
they 'll get better at it
i am still waiting for them to admit there was nothing to @entity69
" fear factor : @entity19 comments show @entity20 's concerns about @entity2 @entity2 's response was mild , but there were undertones that there was more where that came from
according to one of the former president 's advisers , he considered @entity19 's comments a weak attack
" so stupid as to be a low hanging curve ball , " the adviser told @entity1 's @entity84
@entity86 slams ' @entity20 consultant class ' notably , however , @entity23 -- who has tried to remain above politics while she weighs a possible @entity7 run -- remained mum about the kerfuffle
at two events in @entity0 on wednesday -- one to a prominent @entity94 group and another at the @entity95 -- the former first lady did n't come close to addressing the @entity19 questions and instead left the job of responder - in - chief to her husband
the role is a familiar one for @entity2
" i think he says whatever he wants whenever he wants to , " @entity102 , a former @entity103 adviser , told @entity1 's " @entity105 " on thursday
" i think it is natural
" since his wife agreed to become @entity14 's top diplomat in early 2009 and now that she is weighing a run at the presidency , @entity2 has rarely shied away from getting into the political fray
he endorsed candidates who helped with his wife 's 2008 presidential run and looked to bury those who crossed the @entity115 during that failed campaign
@entity2 's role is put into full perspective in " @entity119 : @entity120 of @entity23 , " a book by @entity122 and @entity123 that details @entity23 's time at the @entity125
according to the authors , @entity126 , a former congressman from @entity127 , was the epitome of @entity2 's political retribution
@entity2 defends @entity23 over @entity131 " if there was a poster boy for the betrayal - and - revenge narrative , it was @entity126 , a tall , broad - shouldered former @entity136 football player who had won his western @entity138 seat in the midterm @entity10 landslide of 2006 , " the authors wrote , before describing the lengths the @entity115 went to in the run up to the 2008 election to win over the congressman
when @entity126 decided not to endorse anyone , the congressman was blacklisted and earned @entity2 's ire
" the bill for @entity126 's neutrality would come due nearly four years later , to the day , in the 2012 @entity127 @entity10 primary , " write @entity123 and @entity122 , when the former president choose to endorse @entity148 over @entity126
when @entity148 went on to win the primary , his victory was largely attributed to two things : his strong labor support and the endorsement he picked up from @entity2
although @entity126 's anecdote is a colorful example , the story is not totally unique
on wednesday , for example , the former president endorsed @entity160 gubernatorial hopeful @entity159 over his top challenger , @entity160 attorney general @entity161
@entity2 touted @entity159 's record and notes that he felt " enormous affection " for him
not surprisingly , @entity159 was a vocal supporter of @entity23 's failed 2008 bid and traveled to a number of states on the campaign 's behalf
@entity161 , on the other hand , was a proud supporter of @entity170 and co-chaired his 2008 primary campaign in @entity160
@entity2 's support was so potent that when the @entity159 campaign announced it in april , @entity161 felt it necessary to issue a statement that spelled out his " respect " for the former president and his strong support for @entity23 , " should she choose to run " in 2016
whether @entity23 will run is not the only question facing the @entity115 right now , though
in order for her to be successful , a number of @entity10 strategists have said , @entity2 's role will also have to be defined
in 2008 , @entity2 was a staple of the campaign trail and while he was a prolific fundraiser and campaigner , he also had a few notable blowups as things went sour
republicans -- some of whom would probably like to see less of @entity2 -- suggest that he would be a political liability for a @entity2 campaign
" @entity23 can not hide behind her husband on this
it was an interesting decision , if it was one , to have him come out and say anything , " said @entity198 , a @entity20 strategist , about @entity2 's response to @entity19
" i think they need to really pull @entity2 back
he is not as good at this now as he used to be
" @entity10 scoff at that assertion and point out that other than @entity23 herself , the former chief executive is probably the one closest to her thinking on political issues and whether or not she will run
@entity102 responded to @entity210 with this : " i do n't think we will be taking your advice
