this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity12 , @entity13 : i 'm @entity15 , and fridays are awesome , especially when they start with a former @entity18 star
@entity19 , @entity18 running back : what 's up ! i 'm @entity19 , and this is @entity0
check it out ! first up : @entity4 in crisis @entity25 : scenes of celebration turn to shouts of anger as the crisis in @entity4 takes a new turn
this political unrest in the @entity34 nation started late last month
thousands of protesters marching in the streets , calling for a change in leadership
their main target : long - time president @entity40
these protesters want him out of office now
yesterday , a huge crowd showed up in the downtown square where a lot of these protests have been going on
the people there were cheering , getting ready for a speech that president @entity40 was scheduled to make , and the rumors were that he was going to step down
during his speech , @entity40 said that he will keep his promise to leave office in the fall after new elections
he said that he 's delegating power to the vice president
and he said that he will respond to protesters ' demands
what he did not say was that he would immediately leave office
the response from the crowd in the square was immediate , and it was angry
crowds began chanting " get out " as the president spoke
this is a dynamic situation ; things are changing ; they 're developing all the time
we want you to go to @entity73 for the latest updates
is this legit ? @entity75 , @entity13 : is this legit ? the next @entity77 presidential election takes place on november 6 , 2011
not true ! it 's exactly one year after that , on november 6 , 2012
2012 contenders @entity25 : the election might be 21 months away , but the lines are forming for people who may want to get into the race
and a convention happening right now in @entity5 may offer some ideas about who will be on the ballot
it 's @entity91 , the @entity91
thousands of conservatives from across the country are spending three days in the nation 's capital
they 'll hear speeches from some big names in the @entity99 , and they 'll take part in a straw poll
it 's an unofficial vote , and this one includes 15 candidates
some analysts use these polls to make predictions about who might end up running for president
@entity110 is @entity73 's senior @entity111 correspondent ; no stranger to the presidential campaign trail
he 's here to help explain some of the pros and cons of running for the country 's highest political office
( begin video ) @entity110 , @entity73 sr. @entity120 : when we take a close look at the contenders for 2012 , we obviously need to include the sitting president of the @entity77
but while incumbency has its privileges , it also clearly brings some challenges as well
call it the power of the presidency
especially that 416 - ton , taxpayer - financed jet that helps you rally voters , rake in millions , and grab headlines from coast to coast
@entity137 , @entity139 strategist : when he goes into local markets -- you 've been all over with him -- he sucks all the oxygen out of the air
@entity143 : allowing president @entity144 to road - test a potential 2012 campaign slogan popping up on new t - shirts that say " we do big things
" @entity144 , @entity150 : we can do what this moment demands and focus on what 's necessary for @entity77 to win the future
@entity143 : but incumbency also has a downside
@entity158 , @entity160 chairman : they do bad things , and the policies that they 've imposed have not helped us get unemployment down to where it ought to be
@entity143 : the candidate of hope and change in 2008 was largely a blank slate
now , he has to defend a controversial record , which is why he tried to hit the reset button and focus on jobs in his @entity176
but the crisis in @entity4 is a reminder : sometimes incumbents set the agenda , other times it gets set for them
so far , there 's no sign of a serious primary challenge to the president
and he may also be helped by the @entity99 ' muddled field so far
but @entity158 argues that tough competition could help the @entity99 , just like the @entity139 primary of 2008
@entity192 , secretary of state : shame on you , @entity144 ! @entity143 : while the pundits warned that the long drama of @entity198 v. @entity144 would hurt the party , just the opposite happened
@entity200 : it made @entity144 better when he emerged as the nominee
he was a stronger nominee for it
@entity143 : by 2012 , the president will have had four years of hand - to - hand combat , this time with @entity99
the big question now is whether those battles have , once again , made him a stronger nominee
( @entity210 ) @entity211 @entity212 , @entity13 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity215 's 6th grade social studies students in @entity217 , @entity218 ! which @entity77 president is known as the " @entity220 " ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity5 , @entity224 or @entity225 ) @entity226 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! president @entity220 , or @entity220 , is also known as the @entity220
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity231 @entity25 : @entity220 got that nickname because he 's credited with freeing , or emancipating , the country 's slaves through his @entity235 in 1863
president @entity220 also pushed for the passage of the 13th amendment , which outlawed slavery in the @entity77
that was one of his big campaign issues when he ran for re-election in 1864
and @entity220 has a birthday coming up
this saturday , february 12th , marks the 202nd anniversary of the birth of the 16th president
the fact that @entity220 , the @entity220 , was born in february is part of the reason why february was picked as @entity251
@entity252 @entity25 : and our commemoration of @entity251 continues today
for this quick quiz , we 're focusing on @entity257 inventors
first question for you : ironing out wrinkles is a lot easier thanks to the ironing board
who created it ? was it @entity267 , @entity268 or @entity269 ? @entity270 is : on april 26 , 1892 , @entity268 received a patent for an ironing board made of a narrow wooden board , collapsible legs and a padded cover
next up , something you 're probably familiar with : the pencil sharpener
who came up with this invention ? your choices here : @entity283 , @entity284 or @entity285 ? here we go : it was @entity285 , patented his design for the pencil sharpener in 1897
last question , and this one 's gon na be tough
any of you who use a hair brush with synthetic bristles , who do you have to thank for it ? was it madam @entity299 , @entity300 or @entity301 ? our last answer : @entity300 did n't invent the hair brush , but she was the first person to make one with synthetic bristles
you can research all of these inventors and their inventions as part of your celebration of @entity251
and stay tuned for more coverage on @entity0 , including our interview with @entity19 , whom you saw at the beginning of today 's show
guiding the way @entity25 : you hear a lot about how you 'll use what you learn in school later on in life
but there 's a group of 7th graders in @entity322 that do n't want to wait that long
they 're using knowledge from their robotics class right now
@entity327 of affiliate @entity328 shows us how a class lesson turned into a lifeline for one of their fellow students
( begin video ) @entity336 , 7th grader : in 2007 , i lost my eyesight from a bad asthma attack
the worst one i 've ever had
@entity341 , @entity328 reporter : an asthma attack so bad that @entity343 not only lost his sight , but all feeling in his fingertips , making it difficult to learn braille
@entity348 , @entity349 : he was just telling us how it 's really hard for him to get around with a cane because people jump over it and run in front of it
@entity358 , @entity349 : he only has a cane and he 's walking through the halls , and people mess with him and play around and he ca n't see anything
@entity364 : and they found the perfect way to help
@entity367 , teacher : after i was told about his impairment and some of the abilities he does n't have , our thinking was get him in here , get him working with robotics , get his fingers to working again
@entity378 : robotics is a great class , the best class i 've ever been in
i 've got a lot of people helping me
@entity383 , @entity349 : we 're trying to get it to go to each one of his classes , and i think he would love that
@entity364 : not only is @entity343 finding his way to class , he 's also found a group of friends
@entity396 : we 're kind of like a little bit of a family
@entity378 : i have n't been happy in a long time
( @entity210 ) make us your home page ! @entity25 : it 's an excellent story
you can watch that -- or any of our shows -- again at @entity406
just one reason why you should make us your home page
links that take you more in depth into stories from the program
and our @entity414 section , where you can find all of our @entity251 materials
@entity406 : a one - stop spot for everything you need
before we go @entity25 : before we go , we want you to check out a business model that 's designed for all seasons
when the temperature gets colder , the drinks get warmer , and you end up with the winter version of a lemonade stand
the igloo supposedly maintains a steady 55 degrees
would be a little worried that the hot chocolate might melt the walls , but i 'm sure these enterprising entrepreneurs have a solid plan in place
and it seems like they 're making at least one sale
goodbye @entity25 : though you might chocolate of that up to being the only game in town
today 's sign - off line from @entity444 / @entity443 comes from @entity445 : i 'm @entity15 , and up next is your teacher speaking
have a great weekend !
