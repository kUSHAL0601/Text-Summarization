editor 's note : @entity2 , a senior political contributor for @entity4 , is senior presidential fellow at the @entity5 for the @entity6 at @entity7
he was @entity8 political director for president @entity9 and chairman of the @entity11
@entity2 says @entity12 appeased @entity14 delegations " led by tyrants and petty dictatorships
" @entity17 ( @entity4 ) -- the president had his first foray into the byzantine world of @entity14 politics last week and walked away cheered on by the @entity23 crowd
he appeased the delegations led by tyrants and petty dictatorships by condemning president @entity25 and spelling out how his administration is going to be different
president @entity12 was applauded by @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 ( no friends of ours ) when he said he wanted a " new era of engagement in the world
" are either of those three dictators going to be better world citizens or kinder , gentler leaders as a result of @entity12 's outreach ? put me in the doubtful column
no @entity43 president has ever stood before the @entity14 body and condemned his predecessor or @entity43 foreign policy in such a way
president @entity25 , like every president before him made some mistakes , but he did not deserve this put down
and let 's not forget @entity43 was attacked on september 11 , 2001 , and thousands of @entity43 lives were lost
president @entity25 and his team got us through all that and kept us safe for the rest of his terms
and i hope mr. @entity12 realizes the " haters " of @entity43 are still out there
historically , @entity43 foreign policy has been pretty consistent whether a @entity61 or @entity62 occupies the @entity63
president @entity12 's style may be different and more pacifying but at the end of the day he hopefully will be conducting business that benefits @entity43 interests and not the lowest common denominator interests of the @entity14 membership
if not , he will join his fellow @entity61 , @entity70 , as a one - termer
we know president @entity12 loves lofty rhetoric and he does it well
the public 's question should be can he deal with reality ? and can he relate that reality to us as he makes the very tough decisions he faces in the weeks and months ahead ? last thursday , the president , chairing the @entity14 @entity79 , pushed through a six - page resolution that was approved unanimously 15 - 0
the resolution urged a world without nuclear weapons
president @entity12 stated : " we must never stop until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the earth
" some may see that as an admirable goal but the hard truth is that the five permanent members of the @entity79 : @entity90 , @entity91 , the @entity92 , the @entity93 and the @entity43 all have nuclear weapons and none of them -- including the @entity43 -- are giving them up
they may downgrade and diminish the stockpile a little , but nobody 's going " no nuke
" you add the other three nuclear powers -- @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 ( although they do n't admit or deny ) -- and nobody is disarming
@entity92 , which along with us has the largest stockpile , could n't get out of the room fast enough before saying " not us ! " the real work of the @entity111 should have been condemning and again warning @entity112 and @entity113 that they are not welcome into the nuclear club and that every effort is going to be used to stop them from continuing on that path
it took @entity91 president @entity120 to call the @entity79 exercise weak and to chastise its members , including president @entity12 , for not condemning @entity113 and @entity112 more forcefully
" how , before the eyes of the world , could we justify meeting without tackling them ? " he went on to say : " we live in the real world , not a virtual world
and the real world expects us to take decisions
" @entity113 's reaction to their " view of the real world " was to walk away from the @entity14 meeting and test - fire missiles with sufficient range to strike @entity106 and parts of @entity139 and @entity43 bases
far from being humbled , a senior @entity142 official told the semi-official @entity144 news agency , " @entity113 missiles are able to target any place that threatens @entity113
" i for one would like to remind them that we have a lot more missiles then they have and we can strike any place they fire a missile from
of course , i am not a diplomat and never have been one -- for obvious reasons
the second exercise in reality is the very tough decision the president must make on gen. @entity162 's recommendation for more troops to get the job done in @entity165
gen. @entity162 is the president 's handpicked commander of forces in " the war of necessity " ( president @entity12 's term ) in @entity165
the acclaimed and well - respected general was allowed to pick his team and was asked in very short order to make an assessment
he has done that and his assessment -- as everyone else including the @entity93 and the @entity178 , who has ever gone to war in @entity165 found out -- is that the going is tough and without more troops defeat is a very real possibility
the president wisely is getting the best counsel possible from his foreign affairs team , an experienced group that will have many opinions as to the direction he needs to follow
this maybe the toughest decision of his presidency and whatever direction he takes he will be widely criticized by his friends and enemies alike
the important thing to remember , is this is where he needs to educate the public
if he expands this war , he needs a skeptical public to support him
if he tries an alternative to gen. @entity162 's plan , he will be judged on the end results and that may be very risky
you combine this with the president 's promise to close @entity209 by the end of the year , ( not going to happen ) get health care passed , eliminate ear marks ( the @entity214 defense appropriations bill has nearly 800 at a cost of $ 2.65 billion and no threat of a veto anywhere ) , and you can see a tough fall ahead
as if he does n't have enough on his plate , he is flying off to @entity221 to head the lobbying effort for his hometown @entity223 's final presentation to the @entity225 to host the 2016 games
he will once again find out if his powers of persuasion work on foreign leaders and hopefully for the hometown they will work better then they did last week
at least the president will quickly find out this week if he 's as good a salesman as he and his team think he is because the @entity225 makes its decision friday
international @entity235 politics is as tough as @entity223 politics , and being loved has nothing to do with getting results
the outcome will be awaited with great anticipation
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
