when @entity2 singer @entity1 and @entity3 met in a @entity5 hotel lobby , the supermodel told @entity7 's @entity6 , " it was kind of like two magnets
" the model - turned - mogul , tv superstar and mother of four is a guest on friday 's " @entity12
" @entity3 said that she was sitting in the lobby with a mutual friend of hers and @entity1 's , and that @entity1 did n't even recognize the internationally famous model
@entity3 told the story of the couple 's engagement , in which the singer had an igloo built on a mountaintop in the @entity23 , to which he whisked her by helicopter
" and then we get there , " @entity3 said
" we hop off and the helicopter leaves , and there we are in the middle of nowhere
and then he had his guitar with him
and he sang a song for me and he went down on his knee
" @entity3 described the igloo as " a full - on igloo with a bed inside with pillows and blankets and candles and rose petals
" when @entity6 asked @entity3 how the couple manages to sustain such a happy relationship , @entity3 said " i just think because we love each other
we have fun with each other
i let him do his thing , even though that 's hard for me sometimes
" @entity3 , 38 , admitted that she had to forgo her propensity for controlling things and " learned how you have to , like , let him do his creative thing , because i am quite bossy in my industry
" when @entity6 asked if the couple was planning on having more children , @entity3 answered , " no , we have four children , and we 're complete now
" with the ninth - season finale of " @entity65 " coming up , @entity3 told @entity6 she never imagined the series would last so long
" no way , " she said
" no. you just do n't when you get into something like that
you know , when we first created ' @entity65 , ' it was @entity73 , @entity74 , my publicist for the last 15 years and myself , and we just shopped it around
we went to all these different networks and tried to explain to them what we wanted to do was a show about fashion
" @entity3 said that she had a hard time convincing networks that they had a hit for them
" everyone was like , ' well , why is that interesting ? why would we want to watch how people make clothes ? ' " @entity3 said
when " @entity65 " finally found a network to call home , she said , what really led to success was word of mouth
@entity3 told @entity6 that audiences love the show " because it 's really about talent
" when @entity6 asked @entity3 if she grew up dreaming of being a model , the @entity97 native told the @entity7 host that as a child , she did n't even know that modeling was a career option
" i did n't even know that that was a job , to be honest , " she said
" i wanted to be a fashion designer
" @entity3 called her entr√©e into fashion modeling " pure luck " and likened it to " winning the lottery " when she told @entity6 the story
" i entered a competition , " she said
" i , literally , out of a fashion magazine , cut out a coupon with my girlfriend , sent some random photos in that she took of me , entered this competition
and it went on for six months
it was a model search
" @entity3 , who also host 's " @entity97 's @entity119 " in her native country , told @entity6 that she counts getting " @entity65 " on the air among her most cherished business successes
she also called designing her real passion and said she continues to design : there 's a @entity3 for @entity128 line of apparel and sneakers , wildlife by @entity3 is sold on @entity132 , @entity3 on @entity133 , shine by @entity3 , a fragrance with @entity136 , and more
@entity3 , who has lived in the @entity137 since 1994 , became an @entity137 citizen before the 2008 presidential election so she could vote for @entity140
she holds dual citizenship and remains a @entity142
" i 've been paying quite a few taxes in this city -- in this country , " she said
" and i felt that it would be right for me to vote for the next president
