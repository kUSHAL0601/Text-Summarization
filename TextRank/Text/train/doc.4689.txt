-- smartphones just got smarter - or at least more expensive
with a price tag of $ 250,000 , @entity3 smartphones come complete with 18 - carat white gold casing encrusted with precious diamonds
it 's as much a piece of jewelery as a gadget
the mission of its makers , the @entity12 - based jeweler @entity3 , was to " elevate a phone into haute couture
" " it 's the most important object one has with them all the time -- it 's in your hand , it 's in your pocket , it 's next to you when you sleep , you can touch it 100 times a day , " @entity3 , the firm 's ceo , told @entity0 's @entity18
the jeweler is hoping to win the hearts of luxury shoppers , with the brand focusing exclusively on women
" i think our customers are really looking for something special , really a beautiful object which they use every day and is extremely visible and really makes part of their persona , " @entity3 said
the limited collection features 11 smartphones powered by @entity42 system and decorated with luxury materials , such as sapphires and emeralds , and finished off with ostrich , python and iguana leather
the two most expensive models are limited to only 27 pieces
the hand - made @entity51 , is embellished with 18 - carat rose gold and 400 brilliant - cut emeralds , while @entity54 features 75 baguette - cut emeralds on white gold
the same techniques and materials used in jewelry manufacture are used to produce the phones , @entity3 said
" we do n't really see the mobile phone industry as a competitor , " @entity3 said
" we see more the watch and jewelery as our universe
" after launching in @entity68 , the brand is now looking towards the east and emerging markets , such as @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , where the luxury business is booming .
