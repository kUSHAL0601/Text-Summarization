-- it was n't a trick
but for space geeks , it sure was a treat
an image , taken by @entity7 's @entity6 on october 8 , captured the sun getting into the @entity10 spirit
" active regions on the sun combined to look something like a solar jack - o ' - lantern 's face , " said @entity11 of @entity7 's @entity12
there 's no cause for alarm -- it 's just the center of our solar system 's spooky @entity10 costume
big solar storm hits earth " the active regions in this image appear brighter because those are areas that emit more light and energy , " explained @entity11
" this image blends together two sets of extreme ultraviolet wavelengths
" and that 's what gives the sun that freaky feel
@entity39 has millions gazing at the skies
