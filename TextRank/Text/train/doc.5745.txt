@entity0 -- parents who say that a range of preventive vaccines given their young children can cause serious health problems will have their appeal heard by the @entity9 @entity8
the justices monday agreed to decide whether drug makers can be sued outside a special judicial forum set up by @entity13 in 1986 to address specific claims about safety
the so - called vaccine court has handled such disputes and was designed to ensure a reliable , steady supply of the drugs by reducing the threat of lawsuits against pharmaceutical firms
the questions in the latest case are whether such liability claims can proceed , if the vaccine - related injuries could have been avoided by better product design , and if federal officials had approved another , allegedly safer drug
oral arguments in the dispute will be held in the fall
the lawsuit was brought by the parents of @entity37 , a girl from the @entity39 , @entity40 , area
they said she was in fine health as an infant in 1992 when given a series of @entity47 shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria , pertussis ( whooping cough ) and tetanus
after the third series , according to court briefs , the child began having seizures and became disabled
now a teenager , @entity37 continues to suffer what is described as " residual seizure disorder
" the @entity61 alleged @entity62 failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine
the vaccine court rejected the initial claim , so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in the federal courts
their lawyers said the 24 - year - old law does not ban all lawsuits , especially those filed when the harmful side effects were avoidable
a federal appeals court eventually ruled for @entity77 , now owned by @entity78 , concluding that all design - defect claims were barred under statute
despite that victory , the company urged the high court to hear the case , saying it seeks final resolution on broader legal questions
the @entity88 administration also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question
@entity77 and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe , but side effects can occur in very rare cases
they also say that the vaccine industry is generally not profitable , but that the health benefits for society in general have kept them in the business
for that , they say , legal protection provided by @entity13 is essential to ensure such drugs are widely available and affordable
the high court did not act immediately on a another related , pending appeal
the @entity111 @entity8 last year became the first appeals court in the @entity9 to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court
that case involved @entity117 - area parents who said their son @entity118 suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots , by @entity77 and @entity121 , containing the mercury - based preservative thimerosal
now 12 , the boy is unable to speak , say his parents , @entity125 and @entity126
the preservative has since been taken out of nearly all standard vaccines
despite winning at the state level , the family has since withdrawn its case , but the liability on drug companies resulting from that decision remains in force in @entity111
the @entity137 was passed to establish a nationwide strategy to ensure a secure vaccine supply , promote safety and future research , and compensate innocent victims
those goals were listed at the time as a " top public health priority
" lawmakers acknowledged the vaccine supply was suffering under rising company costs from potential liability claims
despite @entity150 approval for the vaccines , companies said they were being driven out of the market
the special federal court created under the legislation was a liability shield , designed to be a reliable , relatively quick , no - fault solution to various claims
unresolved over the years is whether and when certain exceptions to liability should be in play in specific cases
the case accepted is @entity37 v. @entity77 ( 09 - 152 )
the pending case is @entity77 v. @entity164 ( 08 - 1120 ) .
