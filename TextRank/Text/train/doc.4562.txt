the most persistent holiday health myths are based on kernels of truth
here are often - repeated adages and why they 're off the mark
myth 1 : you gain massive weight during holidays
between @entity12 's turkey , heaps of holiday cookies and weeks of parties , you 're bound to gain some extra padding over the holidays , right ? people tend to gain weight -- about one to two pounds on average , according to several studies
so holiday weight gain may not be as dramatic as it sounds
before giving yourself license to eat whatever you want this week , do the math : one or two pounds a year can add up quickly
and that one to two pounds is likely only if you 're a person with a normal body mass index
if you 're overweight or obese , the weight gained is more likely to increase -- up to five pounds
-- children gain about 1.2 pounds during the holiday break , according to a 2010 study published in @entity27
but they also grew about 0.32 inches , which decreased their body mass index by 0.04 %
when researchers analyzed their findings among the 90 kids , they found that the overweight and obese kids gained significantly more weight and @entity37 units than children with normal bmis
-- during the six weeks between @entity12 and @entity41 's , adults gained about 0.8 pounds , according to a 2000 study published in @entity43
in the study , 14 % of overweight and obese individuals gained more than five pounds during the holiday
in the abstract , the researchers wrote , " holiday weight gain may be an important contributor to the rising prevalence of obesity , even though absolute values for weight gain in this study were less than anticipated
" @entity56 , co-author of " @entity57 " said non-holidays are more important
" the big problem is what people are eating day in and day out , " he said
" people are getting obese and it 's from that day - to - day diet
there are some estimates that @entity67 drink 600 sodas a year
" what you eat when it is n't @entity12 or @entity74 " plays a much bigger role than your holiday eating , " @entity56 said
essentially , holiday weight gain occurs , but in small increments that can add up over the years
myth 2 : suicides increase during the holidays
the notion that suicides increase during the holidays is widespread
maybe we 've watched too much " it 's a @entity82
" dr. @entity83 , assistant professor of pediatrics at @entity85 , regularly examines widely held notions about health
she and colleague @entity88 have written books about common medical myths -- " do n't @entity91 ! myths , half - truths , and @entity94 about your @entity95 " and " @entity97 ... they 'll get stuck that way ! " back in medical school , @entity83 and @entity88 had heard about suicides increasing during the holidays
" it 's often what we heard , " she said
" many of our holidays are in the cold , dark winter months
it made sense that people commit suicide
the holidays might be depressing if you lost a loved one , you 're disappointed , and things are n't matching up to expectation
" although it 's a popular assumption , it 's not true
" @entity83 and @entity88 have published two articles on medical myths in @entity120
they looked through studies that examined suicide trends throughout the years
one study from @entity125 during the 1970s to 1990s found lower rates of suicide before the holidays
a @entity67 study examining 35 years of data showed no increase in suicides before , during or after the holidays
" it 's interesting to realize that 's a myth , " @entity83 said
" i always want to say we take very seriously people who are having suicidal thoughts
it does n't mean it 's possible that someone commits suicide
we should take it seriously
" at the same time , the statistics show that people are n't committing suicide on the holidays as much as the perception
" it completely goes against what we would predict , " she said
" there are peaks of suicide in the warmer months , and they are fewer in the winter
it 's true around the world , which is an interesting thing to think about

myth 3 : the most dangerous day to drive in the @entity67 is @entity163
lots of people will toast the new year , drink and then drive
but @entity163 is not the most dangerous day for traffic fatalities
according to a report by the @entity169 , a nonprofit funded by auto insurers , the most dangerous day for drivers is july 4
the group looked at deaths in auto crashes from 2005 to 2009
july 4 topped the list with 144 average deaths
it was followed by september 2 -- around @entity177 -- august 13 , july 15 , may 20 and november 11
new year 's ranked no. 7 , with 130 average deaths
the @entity179 also reached similar conclusions
in its analysis of 2000 and 2009 data , more people died in motor vehicle crashes on july 4 than any other day of the year , according to its press release
but there is a grain of truth in drunken - driving dangers on @entity41 's
while the @entity169 tallied total auto - related deaths , @entity179 looked at a subset of deaths -- specifically drunk driving - related deaths
in that category , @entity196 had the highest number of deaths in one day for deaths related to driving under the influence , according to @entity179
it 's also the most deadly day to be a pedestrian
according to a 2005 article in the journal @entity206 , @entity196 had more pedestrian deaths than @entity208 -- largely due to alcohol
in a study examining data from 1986 to 2002 , 58 % of pedestrians who died had high alcohol levels in their blood
january 1 might not be the most dangerous day to drive , but it could be the most dangerous day to walk .
