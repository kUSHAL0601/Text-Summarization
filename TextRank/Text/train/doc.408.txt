@entity0 -- two men have been arrested in a bold and bizarre jewelry store robbery involving crooks who disguised themselves in @entity7 attire , complete with hats and false beards , police announced tuesday
but all was not as it seemed , according to police
the heist was actually an elaborate inside job set up by the store 's owners , who were $ 1 million in debt and six months behind on their rent , police said
the @entity20 announced tuesday that @entity23 , 43 , and @entity24 , 43 , both of @entity22 , have been arrested on charges of grand larceny , insurance fraud and falsifying business records
the two men , co-owners of the @entity32 jewelry store in @entity34 's diamond district , are in custody , authorities said
the costumed robbers connected to the crime remain at large
according to @entity20 deputy commissioner @entity39 , two armed men casually walked into the commercial office building where @entity32 was located on the afternoon of december 31 , 2008
they were dressed in traditional looking @entity42 - style clothing and quickly gained access to the store 's safe , spray - painting two security cameras in the process
the two thieves appeared to make off with about $ 4 million in diamonds and other jewels
immediately after the robbery , @entity23 told the @entity51 that his insurance company had instructed him to refrain from commenting about the heist
" they told me i can not say anything right now , " he said at the time
but police said tuesday that investigators became suspicious of the incident when it was discovered that @entity23 and @entity24 got a new insurance policy just before the apparent robbery
the owners of the jewelry company hired the two men " to play the armed robbers and dressed them up as @entity7 to avoid causing suspicion , " @entity61 said
the robbery and security camera footage of the two supposed orthodox outlaws gained particular attention because of the similarities between the staged robbery and the 2000 movie " @entity73 , " in which diamond thieves donned similar outfits for their burglary .
