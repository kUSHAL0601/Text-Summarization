it 's been seemingly nonexistent in @entity1 for weeks , as @entity2 and @entity3 squabbled about funding the government and whether to raise its borrowing limit
both sides drew their lines in the sand and talked vociferously at each other , but not to each other
on thursday , 10 days into the government 's partial shutdown , the tide appeared to turn
@entity15 @entity2 offered a plan to temporarily stave off the threat of a first - ever @entity19 debt default
president @entity20 listened to them
both sides agreed to keep on talking
said rep. @entity22 , a @entity24 @entity23 : " we 're all working together now
" sessions spoke early thursday evening after he and fellow @entity2 talked with @entity20 at the @entity15
afterward , the @entity20 administration described the session as " good " -- saying the president listened to @entity23 proposals and the two sides discussed " potential paths forward
" and @entity15 majority leader @entity32 called it " very useful
" " we 're going to have more discussions on both sides tonight , " the @entity34 @entity23 said
the fact the two sides are talking , though , does n't mean they have agreed to anything yet
after all , they have been bitterly divided on party lines for weeks , routinely throwing barbs but rarely trading proposals
@entity15 @entity2 initially passed a series of measures tying government funding to defunding or dismantling @entity46 , the president 's signature health care reform
and they 've insisted that they wo n't increase the nation 's borrowing limit without cuts first
@entity20 , meanwhile , has been just as firm in his position : pass " clean " -- meaning no add - ons or qualifications -- bills to fund the government and raise the debt limit , and only then will we talk
one big deadline passed without an agreement -- october 1 , when the partial shutdown began no funding had been authorized to keep the government running
and there seemed little movement toward addressing the next one -- october 17 , when the @entity68 has said the government will run out of money to pay its bills unless something is done
now a plan from @entity15 @entity2 to temporarily boost the nation 's borrowing limit and start talks about reopening the government shifted the dynamic
what it did n't do was meet @entity3 ' demand to fund the government right away
asked after attending a @entity15 meeting of his own thursday with the president about the prospect of the debt limit lifting while the government stays partially closed , senate majority leader @entity83 did n't mince words : " it 's not going to happen
" @entity20 made clear , during his session with @entity92 , that he wo n't give concessions to reopen the government , according to a @entity3 source familiar with the meeting
yet no less than @entity15 spokesman @entity97 cheered the movement , saying @entity20 was " happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the @entity15 " over the need to avoid a possible default
will 2014 election solve anything ? deep into thursday night , these heads were getting together to try to find a resolution
the @entity15 hopes these initial staff - level discussions will let it know exactly what @entity2 want , the @entity3 source said
rep. @entity109 , a @entity110 @entity23 , said both sides are talking " in good faith " about not just the debt ceiling , but what it will take to restart the government
" there was not a timeline set , " said @entity109
" but we want to move quickly
" anti-obamacare provisions no longer in @entity23 plans optimism in @entity1 triggered relief on @entity123 as the @entity124 posted its biggest one - day gain of the year at 323 points
investors have been nervous over the political stalemate and the possibility of a debt default and its potential economic consequences
this came a day after @entity20 said in a separate meeting with @entity15 @entity3 that he would consider a short - term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit , a @entity3 lawmaker told @entity137
" if that 's what ( @entity141 ) @entity140 needs to climb out of the tree that he 's stuck in , then that 's something we should look at , " according to the lawmaker , who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity
some congressional democrats have balked at the outline of the @entity23 offer , saying the government must reopen and the debt ceiling must be increased to get broader talks going
" one way or another both of those have to happen , " said veteran sen. @entity155 of @entity156
another @entity160 , rep. @entity161 of @entity162 , said @entity20 " needs to press for the opening of the government
" " without a doubt the default would be much more catastrophic , but i 've got constituents , a lot of whom work for the federal government who are going through catastrophes every hour , " @entity161 said
@entity173 steps into budget fight one thing any budget resolution wo n't include , it appears , is provisions targeting the @entity179
@entity173 , who was the @entity23 's vice presidential nominee last year , did n't mention @entity46 in a @entity181 op - ed -- saying instead that politicians from both parties should focus on " modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code
" as others have done in recent days , @entity23 rep. @entity187 of @entity188 told @entity137 on thursday that going after the president 's signature health reform is " currently off the table
" yet sen. @entity193 of @entity24 -- one of the most vocal republicans in the debate -- was n't so ready to let the health care issue go
speaking thursday on @entity137 's " @entity197 , " he said " democrats in this town do not want to discuss @entity46
" on @entity20 's signature health care reform and what 's happening in @entity1 generally , @entity193 said that it 's @entity2 who " are listening to the millions of @entity19 " to do what 's best for them
according to a @entity23 source , it 's not certain whether @entity140 can gain support from some or most of his @entity23 caucus to support a plan without anything to do with @entity46 or other concessions
that could mean -- if a proposal like the one floated thursday proceeds -- the speaker may need @entity3 votes to pass it
@entity140 demands cuts for debt limit increase failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week 's deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history
and absent a breakthrough , the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $ 50 billion a month
all of it is taking a toll on @entity1 's reputation : a national @entity137 / @entity236 survey released monday indicated that @entity19 were blaming all parties in the fight , though @entity2 got the worst of it
