-- as many as 200,000 state workers in @entity2 could see their pay scale slashed to minimum wage , if orders from the governor 's office are followed
in a letter to the state controller thursday , gov. @entity9 's administration ordered the department to reduce the payment of state workers to the hourly rate of $ 7.25 unless a budget is reached soon
" these are preparations for the prospect of not having a budget passed this month , " said @entity17 with the @entity18
without a budget , the july payroll , sent to go out the end of the month , would be cut , she said
" this is not a scare tactic , " she said
" this is based on a very real legal requirement
" the legal requirement was ordered in 2003 , when the @entity2 @entity29 ruled that the state controller had no legal authority to pay wages in the absence of a budget
" his role is to process the payroll that we give him , " @entity17 said
but the state controller disagreed
" i will not be following the governor 's orders , " @entity40 told @entity0 , calling the governor 's actions dangerous
" i do n't understand why we would continue to impose greater hardships upon the good workers here in @entity2 and delay the economic recovery that needs to take place as soon as possible
" it 's my responsibility to protect the state 's pocketbook , " @entity40 said , " and even though the governor is trying to fix a budget , he understands that he had that opportunity , he still has that opportunity , and he should not put people in harm 's way
" @entity40 said he is willing to work with the governor to come up with a better solution
the wage cut directive would not affect state employees who already have a contract , @entity17 said
" thirty - seven thousand employees are under a contract that protects them , and the state is currently in negotiations with its largest state employee union , the @entity70 , " she said
that union has as many as 95,000 workers , she said
if the governor 's order is followed , the pay cut would take effect this month , according to @entity17
the workers will get their missed wages once a budget is enacted , she said
