read a version of this story in @entity2
@entity3 was crying , shirtless , shoeless and smelling of alcohol when police caught up with him walking the streets of his hometown of @entity9 , @entity10
his family did n't understand what he -- a @entity12 veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder -- was going through , he told the officer last september 2 , according to a police report
he had a simple message that was as much a plea as it was a complaint : i 'm hurting
that visit -- which came after @entity3 , angry that his father was going to sell his gun , left the house and threatened , his mother told police , to " blow his brains out " -- prompted him to be placed in protective custody and sent to @entity27 ' @entity26 for a mental evaluation
six months later , the 25 - year - old @entity3 is in custody once again -- this time in a central @entity10 jail , facing murder charges in the deaths of @entity36 's self - proclaimed most deadly military sniper ever as well as the sniper 's friend
he is on a suicide watch and under 24 - hour camera surveillance , @entity40 county sheriff @entity39 said monday
should vets with @entity44 , mental illness still have access to guns ? and he 's already run into further trouble , becoming aggressive with guards in his cell after refusing to give up a spork and dinner tray sunday night , according to the sheriff
so who is @entity3 ? @entity39 has said @entity3 was in the @entity12 for four years , though it is unclear how much of that time , if any , was in combat zones
@entity57 , a lawyer appointed by a judge monday morning to represent @entity3 , said his client spent roughly the last two years in and out in @entity60 medical facilities for treatment of mental issues
his personal history and psychological make - up has come under the spotlight after the bloodshed saturday
it was then , officials say , @entity3 killed two men on a gun range located in a remote part of the @entity72 and @entity73 's vast 11,000 acres
this was , @entity39 said , after @entity3 's mother " may have reached out to " one of the victims -- @entity77 , author of the best - selling book " @entity77 " -- " to try and help her son
" the suspect was " a troubled veteran whom they were trying to help , " said @entity84 , a company founded by @entity77 , who since retiring from the @entity85 in 2009 had sought to assist ex-troops with @entity44
why might @entity3 have killed these men ? he " is the only one that knows , " @entity91 's capt. @entity89 told reporters on sunday
" i do n't know that we 'll ever know , " @entity95 said
victims hailed as dedicated , caring patriots no one else saw the shooting of @entity77 and his friend , @entity101 , according to @entity95
it occurred sometime after 3:15 p.m. ( 4:15 p.m. et ) saturday , when all three men together entered the expansive resort in @entity105 , some 70 miles southwest of @entity106 , and headed toward a gun range
@entity108 told @entity109 that @entity77 , his friend , had gone to help @entity3 get " out of the house ( and ) blow off some steam
" another @entity77 friend , former @entity113 sniper program instructor @entity112 , explained that a range was a " familiar environment " for " military guys
" around 5 p.m. saturday , a hunting guide alerted authorities @entity77 and @entity101 's bodies had been discovered " lying on the ground , covered in blood , " according to @entity3 's arrest warrant , which was posted on @entity109 affiliate @entity124 's website
by then , @entity3 had taken off in @entity77 's black @entity126 pickup , stopping first at his sister 's house about 70 miles away in @entity129
there , he told his sister and brother - in - law what he had done , telling them he had " traded his soul for a truck , " the arrest warrant said
how the violent mentally ill can buy guns police finally caught up with @entity3 near his home in @entity9 , about 15 miles south of @entity27 , around 8 p.m. saturday
despite a swarm of law enforcement , he managed to speed off in the truck -- but after spiking his tires , authorities were able to detain him without a scuffle by 9 p.m. , @entity39 said
the story got intense , widespread attention in large part due to the victims , especially @entity77
while serving as a sniper in @entity152 , the @entity113 wrote he personally had 160 confirmed kills from a distance of up to 2,100 feet -- more than any other @entity36 serviceman , in any conflict
this helped led @entity152 insurgents to nickname the 6 - foot - 2 , 220 - pound @entity10 " the devil " and put a bounty on his head , he said
in interviews promoting his book , @entity77 offered no regrets , " i had to do it to protect the @entity12 , " he told @entity166 a year ago
" you want to lose your own guys , or would you rather take one of them out ? " after his retirement from a decade 's service in the @entity85 , @entity77 became a businessman , a reality tv personalty , a supporter of fellow vets , an avid hunter and an outspoken opponent of gun control
he leaves behind a wife and two children
his new ventures included joining other former seals in starting @entity84 , a security company with the motto " despite what your momma told you , violence does solve problems
" he also helped established the @entity192 foundation , a charity that helps @entity36 war vets " who have survived combat but are still fighting to survive post-traumatic stress disorder , " the group 's website said
thousands pledged to toast him and @entity101 on monday night , and hundreds expressed condolences on @entity77 's @entity202 fan page
" @entity77 , thank you for your service ; not only to the country you loved , but also to your fellow warriors that needed a helping hand , " one woman wrote
" rest in peace brave hero , patriot and warrior
" the facebook page also included a tribute to @entity101 , who the page 's administrator wrote " felt deeply about the values of family , compassion , friendship and loyalty , and was equally as passionate about his love of @entity226 and country

" @entity226 has brought another angel home
" @entity77 , @entity36 's deadliest sniper correction : earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of @entity101 , who was killed with @entity77
@entity101 was not a veteran
