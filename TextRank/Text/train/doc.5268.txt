-- for those on a quest to visit all 50 @entity4 , each one is like a jagged piece of a very large jigsaw puzzle
fitting in all 50 states is an impressive achievement
in fact , anyone who knocks 35 off the list is eligible for membership in the exclusive @entity13 , an organization that recognizes individuals who make it to every state with a plaque or certificate to commemorate their accomplishment
to " visit " a state , a person has to step outside the airport and breathe the air , according to the organization 's website
those who are truly passionate about making it to all 50 states often have their own criteria for crossing them off the list , from a hard - core requirement of staying in a state for more than a month to simply hopping out of the car to snap a picture at the border
@entity4 odyssey : 50 states in 31 years @entity0 asked avid 50 - staters to run down their requirements
here 's how it 's done : go beyond the border back in 1976 , @entity43 of @entity44 , now 53 , and his friend @entity45 made a bet to see who would be the first one to set foot in all 50 states
at stake was a six - pack of beer
in order to count a state as " visited , " the two men agreed that they had to spend at least one full hour in a state during the day , be outdoors at least part of the time , set foot on the actual ground , and go beyond the state 's border
airport property also did n't count
the bet lasted 15 years , until @entity43 received a postcard from @entity45 declaring he had reached his 50th state
@entity43 was still two states shy of completing his goal , making sure he followed the criteria they set when they first made the bet
it took seven more years for @entity43 to visit @entity73 , the one state he needed
" being one state shy annoyed me
i needed to take matters into my own hands , " he said
sent to @entity77 on business in 1998 , he extended his stay to rent a car and drive north to @entity73
" i was sure to send @entity45 a card , " @entity43 recalled
it simply said , ' 50 ! ' " 50 states , 50 spots to visit in 2014 let the kids choose together the @entity87 family of @entity88 has traveled to 40 states
their oldest child , @entity90 , is barely a teenager
@entity87 says that she and her husband , @entity92 , have been taking their 13 - year - old daughter @entity90 and 7 - year - old son @entity45 on trips since they were infants
once @entity90 and @entity45 were old enough , @entity87 and her husband started letting them take turns deciding where the family would go each year
because the family often drives to their destinations , they try to stop in as many states as they can in one trip
" we 're not competitive , " @entity87 said , but they are strategic
" we do have plans on which states to visit over the next few years so that we do hit 50 before our daughter leaves for college
" @entity87 keeps track of the states they 've seen in an @entity117 spreadsheet , using the list to plan what stops they 'll make on future trips
" we drive so much on our vacations and camp a lot
we 've actually gotten out and seen the states
" the family typically stays in each state they visit for three days , but apart from how long they stay , there 's really only one other agreed - upon criterion
" my husband has ( visited ) 46 states
he 's not allowed to get to 50 unless we 're all together
" go back to fill in the blanks @entity134 had a deadline to meet
he and his wife , @entity136 , had been taking long road trips during their summers off from teaching since 2009
it was n't until their second big road trip in 2012 that they saw how close they were to visiting all 50 states , and they decided to go for it
but @entity134 wanted to push this goal even further
the deadline : his 30th birthday
" i used ( turning ) 30 as a reason to do this , to keep traveling places i might not go otherwise , " he said
on an old road atlas he keeps in the glove compartment of a baby blue @entity158 , @entity134 kept track of all the states he and his wife visited
at the bare minimum , he considers getting a snapshot at a state 's border beneath the welcome sign enough to circle it on his map
but on average he and his wife try to stay in each state at least two days
they even took seasonal jobs at @entity171 in @entity172 for seven weeks so they would have the opportunity to really witness its wildlife
when they got back home to @entity178 after their @entity172 trip , @entity134 's deadline was fast approaching
with only three weeks until he turned 30 , the couple packed up and raced to hit the two states they had yet to see : @entity183 and @entity184
despite their short stay in each state , @entity134 was not disappointed
" no matter how much time i stay in a state , i 'm never going to see the whole thing , " he said
these road trips are " highlight trips
" now that he and his wife have seen all 50 states , they 're able to stay in one place a little longer
" on the road trips we saw what all the states were known for , and now we can go back and explore them in depth
" connect with people long - time friends @entity204 and @entity205 , both 29 , have put their lives on hold to embark on a seven - month journey across the country , volunteering in each state they visit
" we were both at points where we needed direction in our lives
we were both in ruts and needed a change to do something else , " said @entity204 , who quit her job before leaving on this trip
since the two women started on their journey from their homes in @entity224 on april 28 , they have already picked up nine states
they have been staying in each state for anywhere from three to five days , devoting one full day to volunteering and staying at campsites or with other volunteers they work with
in @entity232 , the women worked in a community garden with @entity234 , a group of @entity236 students and @entity238 residents who grow food for local pantries
in the @entity241 in @entity242 , they found a local farmer and helped him grow tomatoes
next , they 're volunteering in @entity246 with @entity247 , baking snacks for the families of cancer patients
they 're journaling and blogging about their experiences in each state , and they use a calendar to keep themselves organized and on track
but they 're really in no rush to finish their journey across the country
they want to live in the moment and see where it takes them , @entity204 says
" we want to connect with the different people we meet on this trip , " @entity204 said
" there are so many people who have opened their homes and their hearts to us , and that 's how we get a true idea of what a place is really like
