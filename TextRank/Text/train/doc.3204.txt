do n't try to drive over these bridges
these rocky natural spans were formed over millennia by the flowing waters of a stream or other water source , which slowly eroded away the rock to create the shape of a bridge
but are they arches or bridges ? the @entity12 and @entity13 , whose @entity15 - like members go hunting for these rock formations around the world , makes this distinction : a natural arch is made of rock , with a hole formed by natural forces , they say
a natural bridge is a type of arch , where water is the natural force making the hole
erosion created these magnificent structures , and erosion will eventually take them down
one such wonder was @entity35 's @entity34 , which was first formed by pounding surf eroding its coral limestone
the 100 - foot - span gave way and collapsed in 2005
( the smaller @entity40 is still standing nearby
) here are 15 spectacular natural bridges around the world
@entity44 's crazy rock formations @entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 one of the most famous spots in @entity46 , the @entity45 of @entity46 and the rocky @entity50 coastline , are part of a national park
nearby you can also spot the @entity54 , known as the @entity54 in @entity46
eventually it 's expected that the ocean will wear away the @entity45 and the middle will collapse , turning it into stacks
visitors who continue along the coast to see @entity61 should note that it 's in a @entity64 range and must be visited through walks organized by the @entity54
@entity34 , @entity66 not all the glory of @entity66 is found at its two internationally famous @entity68 and @entity69 in the northwestern part of the state
less well - known but worth the visit is the majestic @entity34 in eastern @entity66 , about 40 miles east of @entity73
the 50 - foot tall , 100 - foot - long natural bridge over @entity75 is the star of this 22 - acre park
@entity78 , @entity79 as streams cut into the canyon walls and flash floods further weakened them , the three mighty bridges at @entity78 in the southeastern corner of @entity79 were carved over millions of years
the area was declared a national monument in 1908 , and the three bridges were given the @entity89 names " @entity90 , " " @entity91 " and " @entity92 " in 1909
further erosion has made the once thick and mighty @entity94 more delicate
while still massive and strong , @entity95 did lose 4,000 tons of rock in 1992
@entity97 , @entity98 a natural bridge formed by the @entity100 in the south of @entity98 , the @entity97 has a world - famous neighbor : the @entity105 cave paintings , the world 's oldest known such works , which date back 36,000 years
top 25 amusement parks around the world discovered in 1994 , the site was named a @entity110 this year
but the region 's natural beauty is also a national treasure
classified as a @entity98 national heritage site in 1982 , the 54 - meter - long ( 177 - foot - long ) natural arch is the only @entity98 example of a natural bridge spanning a still - flowing river
it 's also a gateway to the river canyon
@entity121 , @entity122 a famous natural bridge anchors this @entity125 beach , which is best known for its tide pools -- go exploring at low tide -- and seasonal monarch butterfly residents
up to 100,000 monarchs typically move into the state beach 's @entity131 in mid-october , and they depart the following january or february
there 's a party in october to welcome them , and seasonal tours are available
@entity137 , @entity138 @entity138 's @entity139 is best known for the @entity140 , towering limestone rock stacks carved by the @entity142
the ocean is still working on the rock , with seven of eight formations still standing
but there 's another gem in this park about 275 kilometers west of @entity149 : @entity137 , a natural offshore rock span that partially collapsed in 1990 and became a bridge without a connection
( people standing on the rocks were stranded when the middle collapsed and had to be rescued via helicopter
) it 's a good idea to stay on the accessible walking paths and scenic drives along the coast
spectacular waterfalls around the @entity44 @entity162 , @entity163 @entity163 has quite a collection of natural bridges , including one that experts say has the longest span of any natural bridge in the world
the @entity162 ( @entity172 ) , in southwestern @entity163 's @entity173 near the border with @entity175 , has a 400 - foot span
not that the bridge made of limestone karst is easy to measure
members of the @entity12 and @entity13 took a boat to the site in 2010 and used laser equipment to measure the span , calling it the " longest known natural arch in the world , by a wide margin
" @entity187 , @entity188 @entity189 wrote part of " @entity191 " in @entity192 , and several scenes from the @entity194 were shot here
it 's no wonder : the fairytale landscape of this region , now part of the @entity188 , is magical
go see its most well - known symbol : the @entity187 , a natural bridge standing tall in @entity192 , now part of the @entity188
while there are many rock formations rising up amid the forests and valleys in the park , @entity187 is the largest stone bridge on the @entity210 continent , with a span of 27 meters ( nearly 90 feet ) and a height of 21 meters ( nearly 70 feet )
@entity213 , @entity214 bedouin tribes still live in goat - hair tents in the @entity217 of southern @entity214 , which is 720 square kilometers ( about 278 square miles ) of mostly desert wilderness
among the sandstone and granite mountains and valleys are natural bridges rising up to greet you
although visitors can take private cars or hike on foot to explore the bridges and the region , @entity225 cooperatives offer tours via basic jeep or pickup trucks
and if you want a real adventure , book a camel ride to explore the area and overnight in a @entity225 camp
cliffside beaches around the world @entity34 at @entity241 , @entity242 while many nature loving explorers head to @entity242 's famous @entity246 , there are tall peaks , amazing waterfalls and a spectacular natural bridge to be found to the west at @entity241
located on the western slopes of the @entity252 in @entity253 , @entity241 definitely lives up to its name ( a @entity257 expression of awe and wonder )
travelers can witness @entity261 still carving its path through this natural bridge
@entity264 , @entity265 it 's true that southeastern @entity265 's @entity264 , named a @entity110 in 1982 , is better known for more than 15,000 drawings and engravings dating back to 6,000 b.c. the drawings record climate change and human life in the region
but tucked away in this tense region at the edge of the @entity276 , near the border with @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 , this spot was also recognized as a @entity282 site for its remarkable collection of natural bridges and rock formations dense enough to be called " rock forests
" the eroding sandstone " forests of rock " document the environmental changes , marking major climate change and geological transformation over the millennia
water and wind have shaped this magical , lunar - like landscape
@entity34 , @entity298 long considered sacred by the @entity299 , @entity298 's @entity34 was one of this @entity303 colony 's earliest recognized natural wonders
the bridge was created by an underground stream flowing through a cave , whose roof collapsed , according to the arch society
it even had a famous owner : @entity312 bought the surrounding land and bridge from @entity315 of @entity303 in 1774 , before the young republic 's founding
a @entity318 , the land in @entity320 remained in the hands of private owners for centuries
now the state of @entity298 has announced plans to turn the land into a park by the end of 2015
@entity329 , @entity330 in the western @entity330 province of @entity332 lies the @entity329 , a cavernous area near the @entity333
the @entity334 flows beneath a natural bridge , which is connected to a cave that served as one of revolutionary leader @entity338 's hideouts during the 1962 @entity340
the area is now popular with birdwatchers
@entity343 , @entity344 when @entity347 researchers traveled to @entity344 in 2010 to conduct a wildlife survey in the troubled country , they discovered an enormous natural bridge that may be one of the largest in the world
they returned to @entity343 , in the central highlands of @entity344 , in 2011 to take measurements
the bridge , which is named after a local village , is more than 60 feet high , has a span of more than 200 feet across its base and rises more than 3,000 meters ( nearly 10,000 feet ) above sea level
it was created over the millennia by the then - flowing waters of the dry @entity364
@entity365 , @entity366 is it a natural bridge ? a cornerstone of @entity371 in @entity366 , the @entity369 may actually be a bridge
there 's evidence to suggest that the waters of @entity376 flowed through a cave in the canyon wall long ago , expanding the tunnel that 's now @entity380 the question as you marvel at one of the few natural arches in the west made of limestone rather than sandstone .
