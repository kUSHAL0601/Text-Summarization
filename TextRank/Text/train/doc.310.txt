few fooled anymore , but the annual tech ritual is still fun to watch

they 're a way for the companies to show they know how to have to have a little fun , while conveniently getting in some free marketing at the same time
@entity19 continues to be the undisputed champion of april fools ' tomfoolery , with elaborate offerings and high - production - value announcement videos across various @entity19 products
@entity25 is following up last year 's 8 - bit maps overlay with an old - timey treasure map
the real , interactive overlay comes complete with sepia - tinged @entity30 images and a detailed backstory
it seems the 315 - year - old map was found by divers capturing @entity25 underwater street view images
it belonged to pirate @entity37 and contains hidden clues and symbols
the company invites people to help search for treasure , admire the hand - drawn landmarks and look out for pirates
@entity19 's iconic search page unveiled smellable search results with @entity48

@entity79 celebrities such as @entity90 of " @entity91 " and @entity88 , @entity92 make special appearances in the video announcing the contest

part - time vowel " y " will continue to be free , and the length of tweets is being expanded to 141 characters
" we 're doing this because we believe that by eliminating vowels , we 'll encourage a more efficient and ' dense ' form of communication , " the company announced in its april fools ' blog post
