-- @entity1 has vowed to bounce back from his second successive defeat against a man who has gained a recent edge over the 17 - time grand slam champion
@entity6 made his name by beating @entity1 in the 2009 @entity9 final , and won again at that year 's @entity10 , but lost seven in a row before toppling the then world no. 1 in the final of his home event in @entity15 last month
the @entity16 , who towers over most opponents at six foot six inches tall , followed that up on saturday with a 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 4 - 6 6 - 3 victory to qualify for the semifinals of the season - ending showpiece in @entity23
" it 's disappointing , " said defending champion @entity1 , who was already assured of a place in sunday 's semifinals after beating @entity26 on thursday
" i had a good feeling going into the match , definitely the right game plan
it 's indoor tennis , he has a big serve and all those things
but still i expect myself to get more returns into play
" but it 's important to move on right now
mentally , it 's important to look ahead and rest because it 's a quick turnaround
" i tried everything i could and was a bit frustrated at times , but it should n't affect me tomorrow
" @entity44 's recovery gives @entity46 focus by losing the first set , @entity1 ended the hopes of 2007 runner - up @entity26 -- who beat @entity51 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 1in the final match of the round - robin stage on saturday
@entity26 's victory means that @entity1 faces world no. 3 @entity56 on sunday in a rematch of the @entity59 and @entity60 finals , while @entity6 plays no. 1 @entity46 -- who won all three of his @entity63 games
@entity64 is one of the @entity67 's in - form players this season , with a leading seven titles -- including his last two outings in @entity71 and @entity72 , where @entity1 relinquished his title and the no. 1 ranking when he decided to skip the season 's final @entity76 event
the @entity78 now has a tour - leading 74 match wins this year , one more than @entity46
" i really wanted to give him a chance and give myself the best possible preparation for the semis
i really hoped i could win , " said @entity1 , who is seeking a record - extending seventh title at the elite eight - man event
" it 's not that i prefer @entity26 over @entity6 -- not at all -- but i think he 's had a stellar season
" it was a given i was going to give my very best
but i 'm more disappointed for him than i am about losing today
" @entity46 edges @entity56 at @entity10 finals @entity6 is appearing at the @entity10 for the first time since 2009 , when he lost in the final in the tournament 's debut year in the @entity95 capital
" beating @entity1 is not easy for sure
but i did n't think about trying to qualify for the next round , " said the 24 - year - old , who has battled his way back into the top - 10 after long - term wrist problems
" i was just thinking about my match and doing the same things like @entity15
at the end i was thinking maybe it could be my last service game of the year
" so i put all my concentration into serving and that helped me to make fantastic first serves and many aces
but he 's still the favorite to win the tournament , with @entity56 and @entity46
" now you have three big names in the semifinals and one big guy
i 'm the number four for sure
i beat @entity1 , @entity117 and @entity56 a long time ago , so maybe if i am lucky i can repeat that here
