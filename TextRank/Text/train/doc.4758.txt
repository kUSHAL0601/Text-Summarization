@entity0 -- secretary of state @entity2 used a foreign policy talk to weigh in on hot button political issues wednesday , slamming a @entity7 pastor for his " disgraceful " plan to burn the @entity9 and strongly criticizing @entity11 's fiscal record
@entity12 warned about the long - term consequences of rising federal budget deficits , arguing that they will eventually diminish @entity17 power and impair @entity17 's ability to act effectively in the global arena
her remarks came during an appearance before the non-partisan @entity22
it was her second major foreign policy speech there as secretary of state
@entity12 noted that @entity26 , the @entity7 pastor , is the head of a small congregation , and said she wished his plans to burn the @entity9 on the anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks had n't attracted so much media attention
but sadly , " that 's the world we live in right now , " she said
@entity26 's plans could potentially harm @entity17 troops , she asserted , echoing a recent warning from gen. @entity40 , the top @entity17 commander in @entity41
the pastor 's plan does n't represent broader @entity17 views on @entity45 , @entity12 declared
" it 's not who we are , " she said
@entity12 also slammed @entity26 's plans on tuesday night at a @entity50 dinner in honor of the @entity45 holy month of @entity53
@entity26 has so far rebuffed pleas to call off the event , saying radical islamists are the target of his message
on fiscal matters , @entity12 had harsh words for @entity11
cutting taxes while fighting wars in @entity41 and @entity64 without paying for them was a " deadly combination " in terms of " fiscal sanity , " she said
she said that rising debt poses a national security threat in many ways , and warned that " responsible " authorities on fiscal matters " are not being heard right now
" " there is no free lunch and we ca n't pretend that there is ... without doing great harm " to the country , she said
@entity80 have tried to turn the tables on @entity82 in recent months on the issue of fiscal responsibility , arguing that the administration 's fiscal stimulus plans have significantly added to the national debt while failing to effectively restore economic growth
@entity12 also expressed frustration with the treatment of sensitive foreign policy issues in domestic politics , urging a partisan " d√©tente " that cuts " across the partisan divide
" among other things , she cited the start nuclear arms reduction treaty , which is slated to be taken up by the @entity98 in september but faces significant opposition among key @entity80
the treaty has become a " political issue , " she said , but " i wish it were n't
" the accord is seen in @entity103 as an important symbol of @entity17 's commitment to work with @entity106 , she said
turning to the @entity107 , @entity12 said she thinks we " have a real shot " at a successful conclusion to the new @entity112 - @entity111 peace talks
@entity12 will travel to @entity114 and @entity115 next week for the second round of negotiations
last week , she formally reopened the peace talks at the @entity50 , where , among other meetings , @entity112 prime minister @entity120 and @entity122 president @entity121 huddled alone behind closed doors for an hour and a half
on efforts to block @entity127 's nuclear program , @entity12 said the @entity17 believes @entity130 " is beginning to feel the full impact " of recently imposed sanctions
" international financial and commercial sectors are ... starting to recognize the risks of doing business with @entity127 , " she told the @entity22
sanctions " are the building blocks of leverage for a negotiated solution , " she said
" we will see how @entity127 decides
" the @entity17 has repeatedly lobbied other nations to step up sanctions against @entity127
the @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 are among those that have done so
@entity127 , however , is continuing its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of @entity150 resolutions , according to a report released monday by the @entity152
@entity127 has rebuffed international demands to halt its uranium enrichment program , saying it wants the nuclear fuel for peaceful uses
@entity152 officials , however , have not been convinced
@entity12 said the @entity17 is continuing to support freedom and human rights inside @entity127 by speaking out against the regime , and by equipping @entity127 with the technological tools they need to communicate with each other and spread their views
" we want to be helpful , but we do n't want to get in the way of it , " she said
" so that 's the balance that we try to strike
" @entity12 's speech at the @entity22 -- which was followed by a question - and - answer session -- touted what she characterized as the multiple successes of president @entity176 's foreign policy agenda
it also detailed a multi-pronged process of how the administration is putting the president 's agenda into practice
@entity12 said the president 's approach includes strengthening the @entity17 economy , " ensuring we have the resources we need , " and helping other countries obtain the tools and support they need " to solve their own problems and help solve our common problems
" @entity1 's @entity195 and @entity196 contributed to this report
