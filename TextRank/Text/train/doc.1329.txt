@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has indefinitely blocked travel for convoys , carrying food and military supplies to @entity8 troops in @entity9 , through a key mountain pass
armed militants pose next to a captured armored vehicle near the @entity1 - @entity9 border
but in a statement , the @entity15 - led @entity14 in @entity9 said , " we do not expect any impact on @entity14 's ability to carry out operations
" the decision to suspend travel through the @entity22 in northwest @entity1 was taken due to security concerns , said @entity24 , a security official in @entity25 , on sunday
the mountain pass links @entity1 to its neighbor , @entity9
it is in the @entity25 , one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the @entity9 border
because @entity9 is landlocked , many supplies for @entity15 - led troops fighting @entity35 militants there have to be trucked in from @entity1
officials said militants aligned with the @entity39 and @entity40 have carried several attacks there
the @entity1 central government has little control in the area , and the area is believed to be a haven for militants
on tuesday , as many as 60 to 70 armed militants launched back - to - back assaults on convoys
the militants seized 13 trucks -- 12 carrying wheat into @entity9 as part of a @entity57 convoy , and one transporting humvees to the @entity8 - led coalition , @entity25 officials said
@entity24 said the decision to suspend travel came after local leaders met with representatives of some of the shipping firms
he said trucks will be allowed through the pass once the security situation improves , but did not specify a date
dozens of trucks idled by the side of roads sunday in the @entity25 and in @entity75 waiting for the green light
in its statement , @entity14 said it has " multiple , robust and complementary lines of support
" it added that for security and geographical reasons , " the movements of civilian convoys destined for @entity14 are coordinated with @entity1 authorities and border crossing points
the current temporary adjustments in convoy movements are as a result of this coordination
" @entity2 's @entity93 contributed to this report .
