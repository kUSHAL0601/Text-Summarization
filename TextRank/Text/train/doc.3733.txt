-- the @entity2 prosecutor called for a delay in the @entity6 president 's trial , saying there is no longer sufficient evidence to charge him with crimes against humanity
the trial against president @entity13 was scheduled to start in february
@entity13 is accused of funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks during the 2007 post-election violence
the case has suffered major setbacks in recent months
a key witness is not willing to testify while another one confessed to giving false evidence on a critical event in the case , according to prosecutor @entity24
" having carefully considered my evidence and the impact of the two withdrawals , i have come to the conclusion that currently the case against mr. @entity13 does not satisfy the high evidentiary standards required at trial , " @entity24 said in a statement
more than 1,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates battled one another after the election
@entity13 's deputy , @entity39 , faces similar charges
his trial started in september
@entity43 leaders have accused the court of targeting their continent , and have demanded charges against sitting leaders be dropped
last month , the @entity48 rejected a resolution to suspend the trial .
