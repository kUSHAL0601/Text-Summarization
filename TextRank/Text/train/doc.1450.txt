in @entity2 on february 27 , 2015 , a lone gunman killed @entity3 , a former deputy prime minister and a powerful and charismatic opposition leader who stood as an alternative to @entity6
in @entity8 on december 1 , 1934 , a lone gunman killed @entity9 , a powerful @entity10 who stood as an alternative to @entity13
@entity13 's involvement in the murder was denied , and never proved
it goes without saying that the @entity17 also was quick to deny @entity6 's involvement in @entity3 's death
the parallels are worth considering
the murder of @entity22 marked the beginning of the great purges , the period in which high - level elites were so thoroughly " cleansed " that the @entity27 stood unprepared for @entity29 's invasion
similarly today , @entity6 's actions in @entity31 and his refusal to share power with a modernizing elite has condemned @entity35 to another generation of economic backwardness and political isolation
of course , @entity9 was n't the first political opponent to fall , any more than @entity3 was
rival political party leaders had been sent by @entity41 to camps in the 1920s , and opposition political movements , including in @entity31 , had struggled to defeat @entity10 collectivization in the early 1930s
but this was the first top - level political assassination of a person who could have become party leader
similarly under @entity6 , political opponents have been killed , like journalist @entity51 and @entity52 , but they did not aspire to the presidency
and certainly much of the @entity6 era has been absorbed with the suppression of opposition political movements , whether in @entity35 , by keeping rival party leaders from registering for elections , or abroad , by invading @entity59 , @entity60 and eastern @entity31 to prevent democratic regimes from succeeding in neighboring states
in the death of @entity3 , irrespective of who is ultimately found responsible , we once again have the assassination of a person who could have become the leader of the country
@entity13 's search for @entity22 's murderers led to a second set of crimes , the escalation of repression against the @entity76 and the show trials of the mid- 1930s
over a dozen of the founding members of the @entity80 were found guilty of complicity in the murder in trumped - up show trials and executed
the question now becomes whether @entity17 's leaders imagine that they can take the country down a similar path of isolation and ultimate destruction ? or more likely , is the @entity17 thinking at all , or just allowing the terrible logic of this system they have created to unfold ? when the @entity17 publicly labels the opposition leaders as enemies , and spews out nothing but hatred toward those who have a right to demand freedom , then killings -- irrespective of who pulled the trigger -- are a logical result
the @entity6 regime has succeeded over the last 15 years in establishing a regime that historically is unparalleled in its thievery
@entity3 himself had been the first person to start a systematic analysis of @entity6 's corruption that , he claimed , includes the building and renovation of 20 palaces , the receipt of $ 700,000 in watches , his unlimited access to yachts , planes , and a @entity17 property management department with a staff of more than 60,000 , and an annual presidential office budget of $ 2.41 billion
this all leaves aside the billions he is reported to have stashed abroad
the regime hides successfully behind @entity17 - controlled patriotism and expansionism , making its actions in @entity31 out to be a response of local @entity35 - speaking populations to @entity128 aggression in support of a fascist junta in @entity131
the perfidy of the regime is quite unparalleled since @entity29 hid his expansionism behind the desire to reunite german - speakers in the @entity136
there is however an optimistic side
the population in @entity35 as a whole and in the large cities of @entity2 and @entity8 in particular is not like the first - generation peasants of the @entity13 era
they have traveled , they know what rule - of - law systems look like , and they know what property protection feels like
they can ( for now ) still connect with each other on social media
@entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , and @entity157 are all alive with information , commiserations , and expressions of extreme anger against the @entity17
@entity3 had thousands of followers on social media , and many of his friends also have thousands of followers
other opposition leaders like @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , and many more remain , and they are both shocked and defiant
former prime minister @entity171 wrote on his blog : " bastards , you killed my friend in the center of @entity2 ... with four bullets , to make the point to all of us free - thinking people ...
the country is rolling off the cliff
" the march against the war in @entity185 had planned for sunday has been rescheduled as a march in his memory
one can only hope it will attract large numbers
the spokesman for the @entity192 , @entity191 , cautioned the press not to jump to conclusions and then proceeded to put up a bewildering array of possible motives that included everything except @entity17 jealousy : he called the act a political provocation perhaps perpetrated by @entity202 extremists angered over his stand on the @entity205 killing ; or a " sacral sacrifice " by the opposition itself to destabilize the country ; or related to his views on the @entity31 war ; or a business conflict ; or an assault related to his personal life
the fact that @entity3 's girlfriend was @entity31 and she was with him when he died was immediately picked up by @entity35 media
@entity6 called the assassination an apparent " contract killing " and stated he was taking charge of the investigation
and despite the fact that initial eyewitness reports stated that the killers were driving a white car without license plates , by noon the next day , @entity222 was claiming that the car had been found , now with license plates from the @entity202 republic of @entity230
the sad fact is that @entity233 powers did not understand the significance of the killing of @entity22
let 's hope that this time they will see @entity3 's death as the " shot that was heard around the world " and mobilize to deter further @entity35 oppression and expansionism
president @entity243 quickly condemned the murder and stated that " i admired @entity3 's courageous dedication to the struggle against corruption in @entity35 and appreciated his willingness to share his candid views with me when we met in @entity2 in 2009
" that would mean providing all forms of assistance to prevent the failure of @entity31 democracy , a dream for which @entity3 could well have died
how to help the @entity35 opposition depends on whether they will be able to help themselves in the weeks to come
no one would want to be in their shoes
but standing with them in their insistence -- echoing @entity3 -- that @entity6 's authoritarian regime is based on massive corruption , will be more important than ever .
