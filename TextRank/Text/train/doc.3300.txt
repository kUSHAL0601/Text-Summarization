@entity0 , @entity1 -- they 're lonely and hungry , condemned to a life of daily hardship with little to hope for
deprived of food , wearing old clothes , countless homeless children are living on the dusty streets of @entity0 , the lakeside capital of @entity1 , victims of a bloody civil war that wreaked havoc on the tiny east @entity14 country
scared and neglected , the children 's lives are fraught with great danger ; some of them suffer from abuse while others resort to a life of crime to survive , earning the name " kirobezo , " which means bad child
but not everyone sees them like that
one woman is responding to these young children not with anger but with love -- and a whole lot of food
affectionately known as " @entity35 , " which means " mama sunday , " @entity1 radio presenter and longtime children 's advocate @entity38 has made it her duty to feed as many homeless street kids as possible
every single week , she opens her house on sundays , providing free meals to @entity0 's vulnerable youngsters
" street children do not get enough to eat , they can spend two days without eating , " says @entity38
" they do n't have clothes and mostly they are not loved -- they are hopeless that 's why we find them joining armed groups , " she continues
" they can steal , they can rob , they can kill , " she says
" they can do any bad thing , living that kind of life , i hate it
that 's why i invite them every sunday -- so that we can share food and have a time to discuss

instead , everyone is made to feel welcome
before the meal , one teenager says a prayer for the group and then @entity38 hands out large bowls full of flavorful beans and rice
she pays out of her own pocket and , at one point , she even went into debt in order to feed and provide for these children
civil war @entity1 is one of the smallest countries in @entity86 and one of the poorest in the world
it gained independence from @entity91 in 1962 , but after years of tension and coups it descended into a vicious civil war that lasted from 1993 to 2005
the armed conflict left hundreds of thousands dead and many more displaced
everyone in the country suffered in some way because of the war , but especially children
half of @entity1 's population is under the age of 18 , while an estimated half a million children were orphaned by the civil war and @entity107 , with many of them living on the streets
read this : from the streets to break beats nearly 60 % of @entity1 's children under five suffer from malnutrition , a primary factor behind their desperation and move toward crime , according to @entity38
" i have children who are in prison because they have stolen and they do it to get something to eat , " she says
" that 's why i do my best to protect them so that they do n't end up in prison or in armed groups -- they go because they are without hope
" giving children a voice @entity38 , 58 , has been an outspoken advocate for @entity1 's children for several decades now
back in the late 1970s she began working at the only radio station in the country
after realizing how conflict was pushing children into violent crime , she decided to give them a voice by creating a show about young people and possibly convince them of a better life
during the war , when thousands of people were displaced to refugee camps in neighboring countries , @entity38 used her radio program " @entity147 " -- or " speaking with children " -- to comfort those fleeing to @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152
today she still invites a selection of homeless children to join her on her program and discuss anything they want
the more fortunate ones speak about the importance of an education , children 's rights and mutual support for one another
kids can even call in and ask anything they want
amongst those participating are @entity38 's success stories -- young people like @entity169 , a 17 - year - old boy who is doing his best in high school , for which @entity38 is paying
" there are many good stories , " says @entity38
" there are many children who have succeeded ; there is a story of one child whose job was to steal -- he was caught and put into prison but now he 's an artist , a singer ; there is another one who now is taking care of other street children -- he has an education center ; there is another one who is now in @entity189 ; another one is in @entity86
there are many stories that make me happy
" it 's because of all this work that the @entity196 embassy in @entity197 decided in march to honor @entity38 by naming her the 2013 " @entity200 " for exemplifying strength and leadership
" she is a generous , warm person who has committed her life to the betterment of children without asking for anything in return , " @entity196 ambassador @entity201 said at the time
since the award some small donations have started rolling in , but @entity38 says she 's not worried about finances
" the riches i have are in my heart , " she says
" you can have a lot of ( material ) things , but not help anyone -- the best riches are in the heart
" @entity38 says what motivates her are the children who 've grown up , avoided violence and improved their lives
" i say that the young people are the @entity1 for tomorrow , but tomorrow is impossible if we do n't live well today , " she says
" tomorrow starts today , that 's why we hug the children so that they can feel loved and never go back to do bad things
so @entity1 has a good future , surely
