the @entity0 has imposed sanctions related to the crisis in @entity3 on another 15 people , bringing the total number targeted to 48
the @entity0 said the people are collectively responsible for actions that " undermine or threaten the territorial integrity , sovereignty and independence of @entity3
" the targets include @entity12 , @entity13 's deputy prime minister ; @entity13 military chief @entity14 ; and @entity16 separatists in @entity3 , including @entity17 , the self - declared leader of the " @entity18
" @entity0 foreign policy chief @entity19 said she was alarmed by the worsening security situation in eastern @entity3 , and she called on @entity13 to take " concrete steps " in support of an international deal signed this month aimed at easing tensions
she warned that if necessary , the @entity0 " will look at possible additional individual measures " related to the crisis
@entity27 also condemned an attack on the mayor of @entity30 on monday and the continued detention by @entity16 militants of a team of military observers from the @entity35
" all persons still illegally detained by armed groups in eastern @entity3 need to be immediately released , " she said
on tuesday , @entity16 activists in eastern @entity3 took control of the regional government headquarters in @entity41
video shows them as they approach the building , smash doors , wave flags and chant " @entity13 ! @entity13 ! " pro-russia activists also tried to break into that city 's police headquarters by ramming a truck at the entrance , according to state - run news agency @entity51
a local reporter for @entity51 , who was on the scene at police headquarters , described a fight , involving an explosion and gunfire
the activists demanded that police surrender their weapons and exit headquarters
they also claimed that the @entity41 police chief had submitted his resignation and that a new " people 's police " chief had been " assigned , " though not everyone in the crowd agreed with the selection , the news agency reported
on his official website , acting president @entity72 said the events in eastern @entity3 " illustrated inactivity , helplessness , and sometimes criminal betrayal of the law enforcement agencies in the @entity78 and ( @entity41 ) regions
" he said , " it is hard to admit , but it is true
the vast majority of the law enforcement officials in the @entity85 are not able to fulfill their obligations to protect our citizens
" new heads of security have been appointed in @entity78 and @entity41 , he said
western nations accuse @entity92 of supporting the separatist gunmen who are occupying official buildings in cities across the region and are holding the @entity35 team hostage
@entity13 disputes that claim , saying it has no direct influence over the @entity16 activists
@entity13 : ' are n't you ashamed ? ' in a statement on its website tuesday , the @entity103 said the @entity0 sanctions " can not but cause rejection " and show a lack of comprehension of @entity3 's internal political situation
" instead of making the @entity115 faction sit at the negotiating table with southeastern @entity3 , our partners follow @entity118 's lead with new unfriendly gestures regarding @entity13 , " it said
the @entity0 action is " a direct invitation for local neo-nazis to continue to promote anarchy and outrages regarding the civilians of the southeast , " it said , repeating @entity13 's contention that ultranationalist groups are behind the unrest in @entity3
the statement concluded with the question , " are n't you ashamed ? " on monday , @entity13 promised a painful response to sanctions imposed by the @entity136
@entity137 , @entity13 's deputy minister for foreign relations , called the @entity136 measures " meaningless , shameful , and disgusting
" " it will only intensify all the processes in @entity3 which it intends to change or stop , " @entity137 told @entity139 , speaking @entity140
" the @entity136 does literally nothing to impress its cronies and clients in @entity115 on whom there is full responsibility for constant deterioration of the situation in @entity3
this is what needs to be changed and not the policy of @entity13
" a response of @entity92 will follow , and it will be painfully felt in @entity118
" @entity13 has not specified what measures it will impose against @entity157 interests
according to @entity13 's state - run @entity160 news agency , @entity13 president @entity158 said his government has proposed imposing sanctions against the @entity0 and the @entity136 , but that he has not yet authorized them
" the government of the @entity13 has already proposed some retaliatory steps
i think there 's not a need , " the president reportedly told journalists
" we would not like to resort to some steps -- retaliatory measures
i hope there will be no need , " @entity158 said , according to @entity160
@entity3 crisis : the full sanctions list @entity136 sanctions but @entity136 secretary of state @entity177 appeared unfazed
he pledged tuesday in an address to the @entity179 , a @entity118 think tank , that @entity180 would stand united to defend its members ' territorial integrity
in its latest round of sanctions , the @entity136 targeted seven @entity13 government officials and 17 companies linked to @entity158
the @entity187 said the seven @entity13 , including two from @entity158 's inner circle , are subject to a freeze on any assets they may hold in the @entity136 and a ban on @entity136 travel
the two seen as closest to @entity158 are @entity195 , chairman of @entity13 oil giant @entity197 , and @entity198 , director general of @entity199 , a state - owned industrial conglomerate in @entity13
the companies the @entity136 named are linked to officials and oligarchs who were designated last month , and the list included neither @entity197 itself nor gas exporter @entity205
in addition , the @entity136 will deny export license applications for any high - technology items that could contribute to @entity13 military capabilities
the @entity211 departments will revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions , the @entity187 said in a statement
the move , @entity215 told reporters in @entity218 , @entity219 , was intended to spur @entity158 to " walk the walk , not just talk the talk " in resolving the crisis in @entity3
if the latest round of sanctions does not work , the next phase could target economic sectors like banking , @entity215 said
in all , the @entity136 and @entity0 have imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 66 individuals , most of them senior @entity13 officials
the @entity136 has sanctioned 18 companies in total
analysis : sanctions - lite wo n't move @entity13 ' stolen assets ' meanwhile , @entity238 is hosting a two - day international meeting aimed at helping @entity3 's government recover stolen assets , following claims of widespread corruption within the government of ousted @entity3 president @entity244
@entity238 home secretary @entity245 , @entity136 attorney general @entity246 and the head of the @entity3 delegation , acting prosecutor general @entity249 , are all taking part in the @entity252 forum
" what we have committed to do is to persevere , to follow leads wherever we can find them , " said @entity246
@entity249 said investigators were focused on years when @entity244 and his associates were in charge
" the @entity3 society already demands results from the government , " he said
@entity244 fled to @entity13 in february after months of street protests that were sparked by his decision to drop closer trade ties with @entity265 and turn instead toward @entity92
in @entity3 , presidential elections have been called for may 25
but @entity267 said he had dropped out of the race
on his website , he said that he received death threats when he arrived in @entity115 and that @entity271 turned down his request to participate in televised debates
" in this regard , i have decided to withdraw my candidacy , because in such circumstances , being a candidate is not helpful , " @entity267 said
" we will seek other channels and opportunities to convey our thoughts and positions to residents of the central and western @entity3
