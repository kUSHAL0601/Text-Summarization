-- the assistant coach of @entity5 's national soccer team is among the victims of friday 's machine - gun attack on a bus carrying the squad to a tournament in @entity11 , the country 's official news agency reported saturday
as many as three people were killed and nine injured in the strike , which prompted the team to decide saturday to pull out of the @entity17 tourney
@entity11 's official @entity19 news agency reported that assistant coach @entity20 and a @entity5 journalist died saturday
there were conflicting reports about the driver of the bus
@entity26 -- regional medical director of @entity27 , a group that transports injured people to hospitals -- said the driver was among the dead , but @entity5 government officials indicated he was still alive
@entity26 said a third wounded person was being evacuated to @entity34 , @entity35 , for treatment
@entity19 reported that goalkeeper @entity37 , was sent to @entity35 for an injury to his back
it was unclear whether @entity26 and @entity19 were referring to the same person
the team was headed to @entity11 for the tournament when it was attacked near the border between @entity11 and the @entity45
an armed wing of a separatist group -- the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) -- has claimed responsibility for the attack and has threatened to strike again
@entity0 can not independently verify the claim
@entity53 , the @entity5 team 's captain and a star for @entity57 's @entity52 team , said he and his teammates met saturday morning " before deciding that they wished to pull out of the tournament , " the @entity52 web site said
he was not injured in the attack , @entity52 said
" it 's as if we 've gone to war , " said goalkeeper @entity62
" it 's deplorable for @entity35
i do n't know what other countries will decide , but it 's hard
too hard for us footballers
" @entity11 officials -- trying to assuage security fears that could dampen the war - torn nation 's sporting aspirations -- vowed to heighten security , particularly in @entity79 , a disputed oil - rich enclave located within the @entity81 and the site of eight matches in the tournament
@entity5 had been scheduled to play @entity85 on monday in @entity79
" we vehemently condemn the ignoble action , lament the loss of lives , and we reiterate our commitment to guarantee security so that the @entity91 2010 ( tournament ) will firm itself as a great sporting event and a manifestation of friendship and solidarity among the @entity97 people , " an @entity11 government statement said
arriving saturday with a high - level delegation to @entity79 , @entity11 's prime minister @entity98 insisted his government provided proper security
nevertheless ... we will provide more security and protection to the delegations , " @entity98 told @entity11 's @entity103
leaders of the @entity111 were expected to meet saturday with @entity98 " to take decisions to guarantee the smooth running of the competition , " a statement on that organization 's web site said
host nation @entity11 is scheduled to kick off the tournament against @entity116 on sunday in @entity117
the tournament -- one of the world 's biggest -- is @entity11 's first major sporting event since a 2002 peace deal brought the southern @entity97 country 's decades - old civil war to an end
it also marks the beginning of a year in the spotlight for @entity97 football , with @entity35 set to become the continent 's first country to host the @entity132 in june
the @entity11 tournament has been eagerly anticipated as an early chance to assess the form of @entity97 powerhouses such as @entity137 and @entity139 's @entity138 , @entity140 's @entity85 and @entity142 's @entity141 ahead of the @entity132
football world government body @entity132 said it was " deeply moved " by the incident and expressed " utmost sympathy " with the @entity5 players
it said it expected a full report from the @entity111 on the situation
@entity5 striker @entity149 , who plays for @entity151 team @entity150 , told @entity0 " armed rebels " with @entity153 had opened fire
" we were attacked by armed rebels who used @entity156
we had just passed the border and a couple of minutes later we were attacked from both sides
" we hid below the seats -- we had police protection in front and behind but we were attacked from both sides
as soon as i heard the bullets i went to the floor
... the attack lasted for 10 - 15 minutes , " @entity149 said
@entity79 is located within the @entity81
a strip of that nation separates it from @entity11 , one of the world 's largest energy producers and a major supplier of petroleum and liquefied natural gas to the @entity178 market
@entity11 , which was wracked by civil war for nearly three decades , brokered a peace deal in 2006 with separatists seeking an independent republic of @entity79
@entity5 is a strip of a nation that averages about 60 miles wide , nestled between @entity186 and @entity85 in @entity187
it is smaller than the @entity178 state of @entity190 .
