-- gay rights advocates in @entity2 hailed a judge 's sentencing of four men to 18 years each in prison for brutally slaying a 19 - year - old lesbian
@entity9 fueled the 2006 stabbing and stoning of @entity12 , who was targeted because of her sexual orientation , magistrate @entity8 ruled
four years ' credit was given to @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , meaning they will spend 14 additional years behind bars
" the sentence sent a strong message that hate crimes would not be tolerated , " national prosecuting attorney spokesman @entity21 told the @entity22
gay rights advocates celebrated wednesday 's ruling
" it was the first time discrimination based on sexual orientation was named as an aggravating factor in a @entity2 criminal trial , " the @entity31 gay and lesbian rights group said in a written statement
gay marriage is legal in @entity2 , which was the first @entity2 nation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation
homosexuality is illegal in most @entity2 countries , based on rules left over from the @entity43 colonial era , when sodomy laws were introduced
despite @entity2 's anti-discrimination provisions , attacks based on sexual orientation persist , rights groups say
after interviews in six of @entity2 's nine provinces last year , @entity49 - based @entity48 concluded that " social attitudes towards homosexual , bisexual , and transgender people in @entity2 have possibly hardened over the last two decades
the abuse they face on an everyday basis may be verbal , physical , or sexual -- and may even result in murder " this week officials from another rights group said they hope this week 's sentencing will set a precedent across @entity2
" we hope that this message is heard loud and clear across the rest of the continent , where homophobic discrimination is widespread and where homosexuality is a crime , " the non-profit @entity64 said in a statement
@entity0 's @entity73 contributed to this report .
