@entity0 -- @entity3 ' internal review of accusations of racial bias toward customers absolves employees of racial profiling and places the blame on the police
the review states that " @entity3 employees did not request , require , nor initiate the actions of the @entity14 " in stopping and detaining the two @entity16 customers who were wrongly accused of credit card fraud
the report by the retailer reviewed two incidents earlier this year -- one involving @entity21 , 21 , who was stopped after making a purchase at @entity3 , and @entity23 , 19 , who was detained for questioning after a purchase
both shoppers claimed they were targeted by @entity3 's employees and @entity14 officers because of their race
the report also claims to have found no @entity3 policy , written or unwritten , directing employees of the @entity33 department to engage in racial profiling and points out the department has a formal policy against racial profiling
@entity3 is not the only major retailer facing accusations of racial profiling
@entity41 , a former @entity14 officer who lost her job after a shoplifting , has filed lawsuit seeking $ 40 million in damages from @entity46 's
@entity47 was tried and found not guilty of shoplifting
at the trial , a @entity46 's detective admitted to lying on internal paperwork , saying @entity47 admitted guilt when she had not , according to court transcripts
@entity47 and her attorney claim she was stopped because she is @entity55
@entity47 and her mother were shopping at a @entity46 's store in @entity0 on november 23 , 2012 , when she was detained
her lawsuit , filed on november 13 , 2013 , is independent of the class - action lawsuit against @entity46 's and the @entity14 filed by " @entity61 " actor @entity60 , said @entity47 's attorney , @entity62
@entity60 's suit claims he was racially profiled while shopping at a @entity46 's store in june
@entity0 attorney general investigating racial profiling claims in the @entity3 case , @entity67 , who serves on the @entity68 , conducted the review of the high - end retailer 's actions and policies after public allegations of racial profiling , according to the retailer
@entity77 , an attorney representing @entity23 in a civil suit against the department store , disputed the findings and said the report is self - serving
" i can see how they 're trying to do damage control , " he said , " but it 's not like police officers are just hanging out in stores waiting for people to commit crimes
they 're in stores because people call them
" the @entity14 did not return requests for comment wednesday
opinion : @entity96 can fight racial profiling in retail
