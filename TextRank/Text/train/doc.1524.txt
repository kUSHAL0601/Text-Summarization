-- a major @entity2 contractor has ordered its employees in @entity4 to turn in their personal cell phones because " of a safety and security concern
" @entity8 says , " any individual using a personal cell phone will be disciplined
" @entity11 , @entity12 - based @entity8 , formerly @entity8 , issued a statement saying the company had sent a message with the order to its @entity4 employees , but it did not explain the concern that prompted it
" the matter giving rise to this message is still being reviewed by @entity8 management , so the company will not provide further comment at this time , " the statement said
according to an e-mail obtained by @entity0 , the company issued the order to all @entity8 employees in @entity4 , @entity30 and @entity31 -- although in its communications with @entity0 , the company specified only @entity4
in the e-mail , employees are ordered to stop using their cell phones as of 8 a.m. saturday and turn them in to the company 's human resources department
" any individual using a personal cell phone will be disciplined , " the e-mail says
" termination is an option of discipline
the cell phone will be confiscated
" according to the e-mail , employees will be given a receipt when they turn in their phones , which will be returned to them " when the individual departs the site
" @entity51 , the @entity8 quality manager in @entity30 who forwarded the e-mail to some employees , said he could not discuss the matter and referred calls to @entity8 's legal department
a @entity8 employee , who asked to remain anonymous , said he was " not aware of any security breaches involving the use of cell phones " and that employees were not given any reason for the order
he said he has no plans to comply and believes his personal security would be at risk without his cell phone
" @entity8 has a communication system , but as with any system it does fail and we can only communicate with another installation by use of the cell phones , " he said
" we pay for this use with our own funds
" some corporate employees have company - provided cell phones , he said , but at his location there is only one company - provided phone for use if the communication system fails
he said the @entity84 confiscates cell phones from @entity30 who work at military installations and returns them when they finish their daily duties
an @entity84 spokesman told @entity0 on saturday that the order is strictly a @entity8 initiative .
