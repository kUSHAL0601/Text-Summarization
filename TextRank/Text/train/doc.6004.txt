-- @entity1 , whose @entity3 team has won the drivers ' and constructors ' titles for the past three years , could have a home race in @entity9 from 2014
@entity1 founder @entity10 and @entity3 supremo @entity11 have struck a deal to return the race to the sport 's global calendar after an 11 - year absence
a statement from @entity1 's headquarters in @entity9 said : " @entity10 and @entity11 have reached an agreement which will see @entity3 return to @entity21 [ a state in south - east @entity9 ] as early as next year
" the race [ is ] to be staged at the @entity22 in @entity23
" pending all of the necessary official authorizations for the @entity22 , the race is scheduled for july 6 , 2014
" the agreement and date is provisional until the sport 's governing body , the @entity28 , ratify the calendar later this year
new circuits added to the @entity3 calendar also have to be pass the @entity28 's safety tests
the @entity22 staged the @entity9 @entity34 between 1970 and 1987 in its former guise as the @entity22
the fast , narrow circuit was dropped from the calendar because of safety concerns before reappearing as a shortened a-ring in 1997
@entity41 's @entity40 won the last race held at the circuit in 2003 before it again lost its place on the calendar because further planned redevelopment of the track had stalled
@entity10 bought and rebuilt the circuit , branding it the @entity22 , and now his long held hope of bringing @entity3 back to his homeland could be about to be fulfilled .
