-- @entity1 powered her way to the @entity4 title saturday with a straight sets victory over defending champion @entity6 of @entity7 in a compelling final
the top seed from the @entity10 ran out a 6 - 4 6 - 4 winner in one hour 46 minutes to clinch her 16th grand slam crown
@entity6 put up a brave fight but could not prevent @entity1 from claiming her first @entity4 title since her maiden triumph in 2002
the 26 - year - old had not beaten her @entity10 opponent since 2004 and despite taking a 2 - 0 lead in the first set , then found @entity1 an irresistible force
serving for the match , @entity1 took the first of two championship points , clinching it with a thunderous ace , her 10th of a gripping final
" i was so nervous , i 'm just happy to be champion , " she told the capacity crowd on the @entity27 , speaking in @entity28
" i had a dream when i was 10 years old that i would win the title here and talk to the crowd in @entity28 , " she admitted after lifting the @entity31 trophy for the second time
" i played a great tournament but ran into a really tough champion today , " said the beaten @entity6 , whose victory over @entity38 of @entity39 in last year 's final completed her career grand slam
@entity1 , who has been in superlative form on the @entity4 clay , crushed @entity38 in just 46 minutes in the semifinals to serve notice of her intent ahead of the title match
but @entity6 , herself an impressive winner over @entity51 in the last four , made a fine start to break early and take the initiative
@entity1 , who has lost just three matches since her upset defeat to @entity57 in the first round of the @entity4 last year , immediately hit back and led 4 - 3 with a second break of @entity6 's service
@entity61 refused to bow and claimed @entity1 ' service to level at 4 - 4 before she was broken for a third time
@entity1 served it out to go a set to the good in 51 minutes and a single break of service in the second in the end proved decisive
it was her 31st straight win and with it @entity1 has moved to within two of @entity74 and @entity75 , who are tied fourth in the all - time list of grand slam singles titles winners
at 31 years and 247 days , she is oldest woman in the @entity79 to win the @entity4 title , the previous mark held by @entity74 since 1986
she has now won three of the last four grand slams , a run interrupted by a shock defeat to compatriot @entity86 in the quarterfinals of the @entity88 earlier this year
@entity89 bids for his eighth men 's title at the @entity4 when he plays fellow @entity93 @entity92 in sunday 's final and will start heavy favorite after his epic semifinal win over @entity96 .
