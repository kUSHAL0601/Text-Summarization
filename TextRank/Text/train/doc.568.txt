-- two men who the @entity3 government said worked as spies for @entity5 and the @entity6 were hanged sunday morning , according to @entity3 state news outlet @entity7
the men were identified as @entity10 and @entity11
@entity7 said @entity10 provided classified information to @entity13 , the @entity5 intelligence agency , and @entity11 had been convicted of providing the @entity15 with intelligence
there were no details on when the men were arrested or when they were tried
the hangings occurred at dawn , the report said
@entity5 officials did n't comment on the report
the @entity23 acknowledged seeing the reports but had no comment
the @entity15 did n't immediately respond to @entity0 's request for comment
the advocacy group @entity29 , based in @entity3 , estimated in 2012 that there were 488 hangings in the prior 12 months
about 12 % of those were public executions , the group said , according to a @entity23 report
one person hanged in 2012 was @entity37 , who was convicted of killing an @entity3 scientist
@entity3 said @entity5 paid him $ 120,000 to kill elementary - particle physicist @entity39
@entity3 also has blamed the @entity6 and the @entity40 for attacks against nuclear scientists
@entity3 's enrichment of uranium has been one of the most contentious issues in nuclear talks between @entity3 and the so - called p5 +1 countries -- the @entity6 , @entity49 , @entity40 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52
@entity3 has denied that it aims to build a nuclear bomb , claiming its nuclear program is for energy and medical use
@entity3 also holds a former @entity57 , @entity58 , who was detained in august 2011 while visiting his grandmother
@entity3 authorities accused him of spying for the @entity15 , a charge his family and the @entity65 administration deny
originally he was sentenced to death during a closed - door trial , but that conviction was overturned , and the @entity70 native awaits a new trial
@entity0 's @entity72 contributed to this report .
