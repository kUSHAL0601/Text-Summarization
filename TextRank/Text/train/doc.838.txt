@entity0 -- a court in eastern @entity3 on friday upheld the guilty verdict and life sentence against former high - flying politician @entity6 , effectively ending one of the messiest political scandals to hit the ruling @entity9 in decades
@entity10 in @entity11 affirmed the decision handed down by a lower court in the same city last month when @entity6 was found guilty of all three charges brought against him
he received the life sentence for bribe - taking , 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power following a trial that revealed tantalizing details of the lavish lifestyles of @entity3 's elite
the high court rejected @entity6 's appeal as it lacked any " factual or legal basis , " court vice president @entity24 told reporters in a press briefing , adding the court 's decision is final
@entity3 state broadcaster , @entity33 , released footage from the court session , which showed @entity6 standing handcuffed between two court policemen in what was likely his last public appearance
he appeared to be smiling while listening to the judge read the court 's decision and several of @entity6 's family members were seen seated in the audience
a family source told @entity1 the court session lasted for around 45 minutes with @entity6 repeatedly interrupted the judge to rebut the court 's findings , angering the judge
@entity6 met with his lawyer frequently after he filed the appeal and prepared diligently for the process , but his request to meet his wife was denied , the source added
@entity6 filed his appeal the day after his conviction in september
legal experts said @entity6 would begin to serve his sentence immediately , although he could still file a motion with the high court or the nation 's @entity61 to review his case based on new information or evidence
chances of a judge accepting such a motion and overturning the verdict are slim
' hotel - line ' prison awaits court documents said @entity6 would be incarcerated in @entity72 , a maximum - security prison in @entity0 where former senior officials usually serve their sentences
it 's often described as having " hotel - like " conditions
during his trial in august , @entity6 mounted a lively defense , denying the charges against him , according to transcripts published by the court
@entity6 's glittering career drew both admirers and detractors for his populist policies
it began to unravel last year amid a murder scandal in which his wife , @entity90 , was convicted of poisoning @entity92 businessman , @entity91
the son of a revolutionary veteran , @entity6 rose to power as a city mayor , provincial governor , minister of commerce and member of the @entity98 , the powerful policy - making body of the @entity9
he had been tipped to ascend farther up the party hierarchy before he was sacked as party chief in the sprawling metropolis of @entity105
@entity6 's wife , @entity106 , was found guilty by a court last year of murdering @entity91 and given a suspended death sentence
her video testimony formed a major part of the prosecution 's case against her husband
@entity3 's leaders are keen to put the case behind them ahead of an important @entity9 meeting in november -- the third plenum of the party 's @entity118 -- when president @entity120 is expected to push for economic reforms
" the idea is to allow a period to calm down public backlash over this issue before the party meeting , " said a @entity0 - based observer , who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to comment publicly
" they want nothing to distract from the important meeting
" however , not everyone thinks @entity6 's political career has been laid to rest
@entity134 , a political exile and former class mate of @entity6 , says the case has only raised his profile : " the @entity9 may have ended his career in the party , but it has given him a distinct political identity and charisma as a leftist
in a way , this has made him a hero
