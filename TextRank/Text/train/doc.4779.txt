-- the tea party - backed challenger who narrowly lost a @entity4 primary runoff in @entity5 to longtime sen. @entity6 says he plans to file a legal challenge contesting those results " any day now
" state sen. @entity9 said friday on @entity0 's " @entity10 " that " the integrity of the process matters
we believe on that night of june 24 there were thousands of irregularities and we 've already found thousands of irregularities in the process
" @entity9 also defended his campaign 's offer - announced thursday - of rewards of $ 1,000 each for individuals providing " evidence leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in voter fraud
" and @entity9 said " we condemn any racist comments what so ever , " when asked by @entity0 anchor @entity29 about a bizarre @entity6 campaign conference call on wednesday that included borderline racist comments by an unidentified caller who appeared to be a supporter of the challenger 's campaign
led primary , lost runoff @entity9 narrowly edged @entity6 in a june 3 primary , but with neither man cracking the 50 % threshold needed to win , the contest moved to the runoff three weeks later , which @entity6 won by fewer than 7,000 votes
his victory was aided by votes from @entity47 , who were actively courted during the runoff by @entity6 's campaign and allied groups
according to @entity5 law , voters are not required to register with a political party , and anyone who does n't vote in a primary election can cast a ballot in either party 's runoff
since the runoff , @entity9 has refused to concede and has repeatedly vowed to use every legal maneuver available to fight the results
@entity9 alleges that some democrats who voted in the runoff had previously cast a ballot in their party 's @entity68 primary
" right now , we have found we have found more than 5,000 irregularities
there are more than 19,000 absentee ballots we still have n't seen yet , " @entity9 told @entity0
disputed claims the @entity6 campaign disputes @entity9 's claims , and numbers
" the time has come now for the @entity9 campaign to put up or shut up
if they have hard evidence , bring it forward
but quit talking about exaggerated numbers that they know are not true , " @entity6 campaign spokesman and adviser @entity82 said wednesday
after last week 's runoff , @entity9 's campaign dispatched volunteers across @entity5 to investigate the results in the state 's 82 counties
@entity92 , one of the anti-establishment groups that 's been supporting @entity9 , dispatched activists to assist the campaign
separately , a conservative outside group filed a lawsuit in federal court asking for full access to the voting records in the primary and runoff elections
wo n't drag out @entity9 said on " @entity10 " that the process " wo n't drag out too much longer
we have our people in the field
they 'll be working all next week to find the additional irregularities that we believe are out there
" @entity9 added that " after that , we 'll have our evidence together and move forward
" and he defended his campaign 's use of reward money , " if fraud was committed
" he added , " if vote buying took place as alleged , we have an obligation to find it and root it out once and for all
there 's nothing wrong with that process
it needs to happen for the integrity of the election process
" @entity9 pushed back allegations that he 's contesting the runoff results to further his political career and pay off campaign debts
" we do n't have any primary debt , not one dime , " @entity9 told @entity29 , adding that what he 's now doing is " bigger than a campaign , it 's bigger than a candidate , it 's bigger than me
" ' join us in the process ' and he urged the @entity6 campaign to " join us in this process
why not go out there hand and hand and lets find the corruption if it exists
" but that offer did n't fly with the @entity6 camp
" it 's obvious that @entity9 does n't care about the integrity of the process or he would n't be offering thousand - dollar bounties in e-mail fundraising blasts and flat out stating that the election was stolen and the election was a sham without any proof , " @entity6 spokesman @entity144 told @entity0
" so i think he needs to spare me the ' why wo n't they join us in protecting the integrity of the process
' @entity9 does n't care anything about the integrity of the process
@entity9 cares about staying in the spotlight
" @entity9 condemns race comments on wednesday 's @entity6 campaign conference call , a person who appeared to be a @entity9 supporter asked " since black people harvested cotton , why is it ok to harvest their votes ? why is it ok to harvest the votes of black people ? " asked about those comments , @entity9 said " we condemn any racist comments what so ever
but bear in mind , we have no idea who that person is
" he added , " you understand there are people out there we have no control over
" if his legal challenge to the runoff results is turned down by the courts , @entity9 told @entity0 that " certainly we 'll respect the court 's decisions
as to endorsing or going forward with @entity6 or whoever else , i 'm going to have to make that call after all this is said and done
