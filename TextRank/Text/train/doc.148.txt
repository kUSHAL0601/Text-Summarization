-- if there were any doubts about the @entity5 's commitment to @entity6 , you can dispel them now after the @entity8 put forward a package of $ 15 billion , matching the sum initially offered by @entity11 before @entity12 was pushed out of power
the current tally is now $ 16 billion after a $ 1 billion commitment announced by @entity17 secretary of state @entity16 during his visit to @entity19 tuesday
@entity6 leaders have said they will be $ 30 billion in the hole by the end of 2015
about half of that debt comes due in 2014 and the country reportedly has about three months of cash reserves
without the support from the @entity8 , voters would have gone to the polls in " crisis mode " with the state nearly out of cash
the move by the @entity8 is also significant because it will also likely lead to funding from regional lenders : the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) and the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , both of which have deep pockets
@entity42 officials are on the ground in @entity6 assessing the economic situation
lending may prove to be more difficult in this period of transition
shareholders in the fund , 188 member states , usually hesitate to provide money when temporary leadership is in place
it is complicated by @entity56 president @entity55 holding the position that @entity12 was forced out of office
behind the scenes , commitments must also be coming from the @entity6 to start cleaning up corruption , something that was flagged as essential by @entity16 and during interviews i conducted this week
but @entity42 managing director @entity65 on tuesday expressed some willingness to proceed as her team was landing in @entity19 , saying in a statement " we are ready to respond , " and adding , " we are also discussing with all our international partners -- bilateral and multilateral -- how best to help @entity6 at this critical moment in its history
" this is very different from the tone taken with @entity75 after the ouster of @entity77 and the subsequent two years of turmoil
the $ 5 billion initially on the table from the @entity42 never materialized due to differences on how best to proceed with reforms
a crisis was avoided when @entity84 @entity83 filled the void with $ 15 billion instead
the stakes , some would say , are higher due to the @entity89 history surrounding @entity6
the next stage of the high stakes diplomacy surrounds whether @entity93 countries proceed with economic sanctions or not
while at a global financial forum here in @entity103 , former @entity100 president @entity99 told me , " economic sanctions would be appropriate of course if there is no deal " between the @entity17 and @entity56
former @entity17 secretary of state @entity105 took a similar position suggesting that the @entity93 countries , led by @entity108 , are marking their support for @entity6
" they 've sent the right signal so far which is saying ' hey wait a minute this is not acceptable ; we do n't like this and there is going to be some cost to it , " @entity105 said
