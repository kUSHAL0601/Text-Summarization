the deployment comes amid a political standoff over @entity9 's presidency , but the @entity4 would not say whether the events are linked
" it 's a group of ships that will operate in the vicinity for a while and as the ships in our @entity4 do , the presence is important , " adm. @entity15 , the chairman of the @entity16 , said thursday
" it is n't meant to send any stronger signal than that , " he said
" but it does signal that we 're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity , and that 's a very important part of the world
" the @entity6 was badly damaged by an @entity33 bombing during a port call in @entity35 in 2000 , killing 17 sailors
it returned to service in 2002
the destroyer and two support ships are close to @entity9 but out of visual range of the coast , @entity3 officials said
another six vessels , led by the amphibious assault ship @entity45 , are close to @entity46 and steaming toward the other three , the officials said
@entity15 would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming @entity9 parliamentary vote on a new president , which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week
but he said the vote was " important , " and @entity0 was waiting for it to take place
and a @entity56 administration official told @entity1 the decision to move ships to the region was a message to @entity61 that " the @entity62 is concerned about the situation in @entity9 , and we want to see the situation resolved
" " we are sending a clear message for the need for stability , " said the official , who was not authorized to speak for publication
the ships " should be there a while , " the official added
@entity9 's @entity76 majority in parliament and the @entity79 opposition have battled for power over the last three years
the country has been without a president since november , when @entity79 leader @entity84 's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement
despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief gen. @entity92 , disagreements over how to share power in a future @entity88 have kept the issue from coming up for a vote
@entity97 speaker @entity96 's office announced tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to march 11
@entity96 's office said the @entity100 needed more time to break the deadlock
@entity9 has been wracked by a sometimes - violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister @entity104 , whose supporters blamed @entity106 for his killing
the resulting outcry eventually drove @entity110 forces out of @entity9 , where they had been stationed since the 1970s
