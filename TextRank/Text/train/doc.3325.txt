-- some of the most controversial parts of @entity3 's immigration law could soon be off the table for good , according to a settlement deal filed in federal court tuesday
state officials agreed to block the enforcement of portions of the law , which was described as one of the nation 's toughest measures aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration when it passed in 2011
the proposed deal blocks several parts of the law , including a requirement for public schools to collect information on the immigration status of students ; a provision that criminalized the solicitation of work by undocumented immigrants ; and a section that prohibited giving a ride to undocumented immigrants
the agreement , which must be approved by the court , also says the law does not authorize police to detain someone for the sole purpose of checking immigration status
civil rights groups that sued the state over the law , known as @entity41 , described the settlement deal as a " significant victory
" " we warned the legislature when they were debating @entity41 56 that if they passed this draconian law , we would sue in court and win , " said @entity44 , an attorney for the @entity45
" that we have done
now it is time for our state lawmakers to repeal the remnants of @entity41 and for our congressional delegation to support meaningful immigration reform that will fix our broken system
" @entity3 attorney general @entity56 said in a written statement that his office had vigorously defended the law in federal and appellate courts
" the courts have upheld most of the @entity62 but have also made clear that some provisions are invalid
we have a duty to follow the law as set forth by the courts , " @entity56 said
" the filings made today inform the trial court of which claims must be dismissed and which provisions our of law can not be enforced because of the @entity71 's and @entity73 's rulings
it is up to @entity75 to fulfill its responsibility to enforce the country 's immigration laws
" as part of the deal , @entity3 agrees to pay $ 350,000 in legal fees and expenses for groups that sued to block the law
the agreement comes nearly six months after the @entity71 refused to review @entity3 's law and just days after @entity89 president @entity88 renewed a push to drum up support for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration laws .
