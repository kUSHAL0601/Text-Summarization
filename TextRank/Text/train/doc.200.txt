@entity0 -- a man who allegedly jumped a fence at @entity5 's home twice last weekend and was prowling around her @entity7 neighborhood monday pleaded not guilty wednesday to a felony stalking charge
@entity9 , 27 , was arrested at @entity11 's home late monday by off - duty police officers hired by the @entity14 - winning actress after two intrusions into her property on saturday and sunday , according to @entity0 police
@entity11 , in a court filing seeking a restraining order against @entity9 , said police told her he " has a criminal history of violence , theft and drug offenses
" he was " carrying a book with nonsensical ramblings and my name written in his handwriting " when he was arrested , she said
a neighbor alerted the officers to the presence of a " possible burglar " at 11:15 p.m. monday , according to the @entity35
the decision to charge @entity9 with a felony was announced wednesday morning by the prosecutor 's office
@entity9 , who was already on probation for misdemeanor battery , could face up to three years in prison if convicted on the stalking charge , the prosecutor said
@entity9 , a resident of @entity45 , @entity46 , made an initial appearance in court wednesday , where he entered his plea
the judged ordered him held in a @entity0 jail on $ 150,000 bond until his preliminary hearing on july 27
a temporary restraining order was also issued , banning @entity9 from coming within 500 yards of @entity11 or trying to contact her via telephone
investigators said @entity9 is the same man who intruded into @entity11 's yard two times last weekend
both times he claimed he was " there to see somebody , " but left after a @entity11 employee ordered him out , police spokeswoman @entity59 said
" @entity66 is a stranger to me and i have no desire to have any contact with him , " @entity11 said in her statement
" he has terrorized me and my family in three consecutive incidents over the last three days
" it 's not unusual for photographers to stake out positions around @entity11 's @entity0 home to get shots of the @entity14 - winning actress , but investigators did n't know what this intruder was trying to do , @entity59 said
@entity1 's @entity81 contributed to this report .
