@entity0 -- a crude bomb made from a water bottle was used in an explosion that damaged a @entity7 coffee shop on @entity0 's posh @entity8 , @entity0 police said
monday 's explosion shattered glass at the @entity12 @entity7 coffee shop
the @entity15 explosion damaged the shop , but no one was injured and no motive has been identified for the bombing
" we believe it to be ... a six - to 10 - ounce water bottle that was wrapped in black tape , " @entity0 police commissioner @entity22 told @entity1 on wednesday
he said the bomb 's powder may have come from fireworks components , including a fuse
the powder was placed inside the bottle in a way that made it " more powerful , " @entity22 said
he said a forensics unit is working on finding fingerprints
the homemade bomb , which went off around 3:30 a.m. , shattered glass , but no one was injured
the store was not open
police have said the device was planted under a wooden bench outside the coffee shop
" we have a witness who believes he saw two young people he describes as teenagers , both white males , " the commissioner said
one is described as blond , wearing a red shirt , and the other had brown hair and wore a gray shirt
@entity22 said the witness saw the two approach the @entity7 , then looked away
after the witness heard the blast , he said he saw the two young people run away from the building
@entity22 said that for now , it 's impossible to say whether the bombing was politically motivated
" we do n't know if they were a corporate target or somebody had a problem [ with ] what was going on on that corner , in general ... we 're not ruling anything out
" in 1999 , a @entity7 in @entity69 , @entity70 , was vandalized during a world trade conference
in february 2008 , a @entity72 @entity7 and another restaurant were damaged by an overnight explosion
@entity0 police say they 're aware of both incidents , but @entity22 says it is too early to draw any conclusions
" in the past , they [ @entity7 ] sort have been identified with the globalization movement
... we 're not saying that this is the case in this matter
