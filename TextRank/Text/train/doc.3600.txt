@entity0 -- a @entity3 mental health facility has dropped out of a plan to allow presidential assailant @entity5 to participate in social group sessions , according to a government court motion issued friday
government prosecutors are calling on the federal judge overseeing @entity5 's case to reject a proposal by @entity12 in @entity0 to allow the man who shot president @entity14 to have longer visits away from the government mental hospital
according to the court filing , @entity12 sent an august 8 letter stating that @entity20 , @entity22 facility in @entity23 , @entity3 , had withdrawn from the plan to participate in @entity5 's treatment
the letter has not been made public and prosecutors did not reveal why @entity27 had bowed out
prosecutors called the group sessions a " core feature " of the plan to allow @entity5 to spend more time living with his elderly mother in @entity23
" it now appears that the @entity36 will need to begin anew in developing a plan for the expansion of ( @entity5 's ) current conditional release privileges , " prosecutors wrote in their motion
the government wants the opportunity to have its mental health experts review any new plans @entity12 may develop for @entity5
@entity45 district court judge @entity44 did not immediately respond to the government 's motion
@entity5 currently spends 10 days a month visiting his widowed mother , who is in her late 80s
in july 2011 , @entity12 made a proposal to allow @entity5 two visits of 17 days duration followed by six stays lasting 24 days
after the proposed visits , @entity12 requested the authority to decide whether @entity5 , 57 , could be released on " convalescent leave , " which would make him a permanent outpatient
@entity44 presided over 13 days of testimony in late 2011 and early 2012 to consider the plan and has yet to issue a ruling
the government is opposed to the plan
government experts testified that @entity5 has failed to make friends in @entity23 and could become socially isolated
@entity5 's lawyers and @entity12 said his participation in sessions at @entity27 would help prevent that
one of the biggest controversies raised during the 13 days of hearings was that @entity5 did not always follow hospital - approved itineraries for how he would spend three hours of unaccompanied time allotted to him twice during each of his visits
\ witnesses testified that in july and september of 2011 @entity5 skipped movies he was permitted to attend and then lied about it
in addition , @entity79 agents who were watching @entity5 without his knowledge testified that in july and october last year , @entity5 went to bookstores and looked at shelves of history books , some of which dealt with presidential assassinations
dr. @entity88 , the former director of forensic psychiatry at @entity12 , testified for the government
he said he interviewed @entity91 and specifically asked him about lying about going to the movies
according to @entity88 , @entity5 said the doctor was " nitpicking
" @entity88 and a second government mental health expert said @entity5 should have kept to his itineraries to prove he could be trusted
@entity5 's defense lawyer @entity97 said the key question is whether @entity5 is dangerous
" not once during any one of these releases has mr. @entity5 done anything dangerous or violent
not once , " @entity97 said during his closing argument in february
@entity5 was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the march 1981 shooting of @entity14 , press secretary @entity105 , secret service agent @entity106 and police officer @entity107
@entity105 was shot in the head and permanently disabled .
