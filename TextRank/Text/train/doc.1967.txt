@entity0 -- the venomous attack on the pregnant @entity3 by author @entity4 calling her bland and " machine made " is a cheap publicity stunt
her remarks saying her impression of our future queen is that of a " jointed doll on which certain rags are hung , " with a " plastic smile " and " only purpose being to give birth , " is mean spirited in the extreme
where does the double man @entity20 winner get this impression ? has she ever seen @entity3 up close or seen her interact with people at home and abroad ? i doubt it very much
if she had she would not have been so rude and inaccurate
the darling of the literary establishment i fear is playing publicity seeking games ; raising her profile on the back of one of the most famous women on the planet right now
i respect @entity4 as a writer
i like her books too
but she clearly knows very little about modern princesses -- or duchesses even
perhaps all that time writing about @entity41 princesses has led her to lose her head -- like so many @entity41 heroines
@entity4 has never met the duchess
she has never seen her at work
i have , and i have been impressed by the speed and ease with which she has taken to the job of being a front line royal
people who meet @entity3 warm to her
she has a winning smile and easy charm
yes , she has a long way to go , and is not the new princess @entity55 as many in the media are hoping for
but i think she is slowly but surely carving out a role for herself
even @entity55 took years in the job before growing into the global icon who was so admired before she was taken from us so tragically
for somebody who is relatively new to royal engagements , @entity3 has performed with aplomb
on foreign assignments too , i have seen her at close quarters in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70
she is professional and warm , complimenting her husband prince @entity71 as they carry out their royal duties together
@entity3 and @entity71 are a great double act
there is her wifely strength , like the @entity77 , and as a @entity78 she does not try to steal the limelight from her husband
the @entity81 and @entity3 have kept a dignified silence over @entity4 's rant
it 's a wise stance
i know the team around @entity3 and far from her being a " machine - made doll " or " designed by a committee " she has a hands - on role in everything she does
she has chosen to be patron of charities in which she has a deep personal interest
@entity3 , in the coming months and years , will let her actions speak for her
today she was back doing royal duties for her charity @entity98 at @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity0
she looked fabulous as she stepped out of the royal car , happy to show her baby bump to the media gathered outside
she was well briefed and knew her stuff
she is a beautiful , educated and stylish young woman , who has embraced her role with ease and injected much - needed glamour to the @entity109 royal family
the @entity81 will step up the number of patronages in the coming months and claims that @entity3 is a plastic princess will soon fade
@entity3 has her detractors -- many internet trolls label her work shy -- but i am surprised someone of @entity118 's stature has joined in this pastime , attacking @entity3 for no apparent reason
in my view she has abused her position among the novel - writing elite to launch this astonishing attack on a woman half way through her pregnancy
@entity4 , whose latest books are set in the @entity41 court , is lucky she is not a character in one of her own books
if she had attacked the wife of a future king back then with such vitriol she may have soon lost her head in a more literal sense .
