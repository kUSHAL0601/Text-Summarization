-- president @entity1 is not shy about showing off his jump shot on the basketball court , but on tuesday night , it was his baseball skills that were put to the test
president @entity1 throws out the first pitch at the 2009 @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10
@entity1 , clad in a @entity12 jacket and blue jeans , threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the @entity15 in @entity9 , @entity10
his low pitch barely reached home plate and the mitt of @entity20 star @entity19
@entity1 became the fifth president to throw out the first pitch at an @entity15 , but the first in 33 years
he is following in the footsteps of @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28
asked about plans to practice before the game , @entity1 said tuesday , " i want to loosen up my arm a little bit
" " the last time i threw a pitch was at the @entity40 championship series , and i just wanted to keep it high , " the president said of his opening pitch at the 2005 @entity12 - @entity36 game
aiming high is a good strategy , says @entity20 scout @entity43 , but it takes more than on - point aim to make the perfect pitch
" throw it with some force , do n't lob it in there
try to get a good downhill plane
try to keep it in the strike zone , " said @entity43 , who will be at the game tuesday
@entity56 sports anchor @entity55 , who has thrown out a few first pitches , says @entity1 has to be careful to " not try to overpower it
" " there 's no speed gun on this
just make it a nice solid throw to the catcher , " @entity55 said
" the one thing he does n't want to do is bounce it home
mr. @entity1 is pretty athletic , so i think he 'll ace this
" overpowering it should n't be an issue for the president , who joked tuesday that he 'd be surprised if his 2005 pitch exceeded 30 miles per hour
the president also needs to make sure he uses his whole arm , @entity43 said
" you 'll see a lot of people throw kind of out front
their elbow will start out front and they 'll never get their arm back behind their body , and wo n't get a full arm swing
it will be real short , and not very rhythmic , " he said
former @entity15 pitcher @entity89 said @entity1 's at the top of his game , and he can " afford to take a few chances
" " he should toss it a little further to the left
the righties are down by 15 runs in the ninth , they 've got no team leadership
they 're fighting with each other in the opposing dugout , " he joked
all kidding aside , @entity1 should " just go with his instincts , like any good athlete , " @entity89 said
" you do n't want to throw the ball into the ground or behind you , that 's for sure
" @entity1 also does n't want to do what @entity110 mayor @entity109 did in his opening pitch for the @entity114 2007 season
he missed home plate by 30 feet
video of the @entity119 mayor 's embarrassing throw has been viewed nearly 2 million times on @entity121
but the opening pitch is n't always a light - hearted moment
president @entity124 described his opening pitch at @entity127 stadium during the @entity128 as " the most nervous moment " of his presidency so far
the game came less than two months after the september 11 terrorists attacks
@entity124 wore an @entity134 jacket to pay tribute to the @entity134
he stepped onto the pitchers mound , and before a cheering crowd of nearly 60,000 , he threw a strike
the crowded erupted in chants of " @entity140 , @entity140 " before the game tuesday night , @entity1 and all of the living former presidents will appear in a community service video
after the video is shown , @entity1 will take the field at @entity146 and greet the six @entity9 cardinal @entity149 players
he then will throw his pitch to @entity20 ' all - star first baseman @entity19
@entity15 said the president will wear a specially made glove for his appearance , with a script @entity1 44 and an @entity140 flag on it
the glove will then be sent to the @entity149 in @entity156 , @entity157
if @entity1 has butterflies about his pitch , @entity43 says the president should use the nervous energy to his advantage
" for @entity1 , i 'm sure he 's dealt with much more pressure than throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game , but i would -- instead of seeing it as pressure -- i would think of it as an exciting opportunity and turn the nervousness into positive adrenaline , " he said
