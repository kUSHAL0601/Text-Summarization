when it came to relegation from the @entity3 @entity2 could not quite " @entity0 " -- but things could have been very different if the @entity6 club had kept its lucky statue of @entity8
@entity2 's former owner @entity9 has blamed the club 's demise on the removal of the statue he erected in memory of the late @entity8 outside the club 's @entity16 stadium in 2011
after buying the club from @entity9 in july 2013 , @entity19 billionaire @entity18 had the two - and - a - half meter tribute dismantled
@entity8 's statue now has a new home at the @entity23 in @entity24 , but @entity9 says it is too late to save @entity2 's fate
" this statue was a charm and we removed the luck from the club and now we have to pay the price , " @entity9 told reporters as the statue was unveiled at the museum
" when ( @entity18 ) asked me to move it i said , ' you must be crazy '
this is such a fantastic statue which the fans are crying out for
" but now he has paid the price because the club has been relegated
he called me because he told me he wanted @entity8 to return
i told him , no way
" @entity9 was a friend of the @entity8 and the late singing superstar accepted an invitation to watch @entity2 take on @entity44 at @entity16 in @entity47 football 's third tier in 1999
following @entity8 's death in 2009 , the businessman split opinion among the club 's fans with his decision to install the statue , with @entity9 saying that fans who did not like his tribute could " go to hell
" @entity8 's statue now has a place in the @entity60 as part of the sport 's folklore
" this is a great place visited by thousands of people and i am very proud to present them with one of the greatest artists and singers in the world , " said the 85 - year - old @entity9
" @entity8 is a fantastic example for everyone
he came from nowhere and showed fantastic determination to be a superstar and i am very glad that he is now in this great institution for people to enjoy
" @entity9 ended 16 years at the helm of the @entity6 club last summer when he sold the club to @entity18 , owner of american football team the @entity81
after a period of stability under @entity9 , the club 's form plummeted and it dropped down to the @entity86 after 13 years in the top flight of @entity47 football .
