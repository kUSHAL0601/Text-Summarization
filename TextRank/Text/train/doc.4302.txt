editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of constitutional law at the @entity4 and the author of the recently published book , " the @entity7 and the @entity8 , 1789 - 2008
" he clerked for @entity7 @entity9
@entity10 says it 's not a surprise that justices voted 5 - 4 in favor of the @entity16 firefighters
@entity17 , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) -- monday , in the much anticipated @entity16 , @entity20 , firefighters ' case , the @entity7 reversed an opinion joined by judge @entity24 , president @entity25 's @entity7 nominee
the reversal was expected and is not the first time an appointee has been reversed by the court he was about to join
indeed , two of chief justice @entity33 's opinions for the @entity34 were reversed in 1969 , the year he joined the court
one was @entity35 v. @entity36 , in which the defendant had been convicted for threatening the life of the president
by a 5 - 4 vote , the @entity7 reversed , holding that @entity35 ' supposed threats were really nothing but hyperbole
the decision came down one month before president @entity45 nominated @entity33
more significantly , after @entity33 had been confirmed , the @entity7 reversed him again , this time in a major case -- @entity47
the @entity48 had refused to seat @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity52 rep. @entity51 after he won yet another election
the reasons for the @entity48 's action were misappropriation of public funds and abuse of process in state courts to avoid paying a judgment
@entity33 wrote that federal courts could not decide @entity51 's case because the issue was nonjusticiable -- that is , not appropriate for a judicial resolution because issues of membership in @entity68 were exclusively committed to @entity68
when the case reached the @entity7 , a lengthy opinion by chief justice @entity71 held that courts could rule in such a case and that a @entity74 could only exclude someone if that person did not meet the qualifications , age , citizenship and residence requirements set forth in the @entity81
there was but a single dissent
the reversal of @entity24 was expected because a majority of the current court are republicans who believe governmental decisions should be made on a color - blind basis
beginning with the presidency of @entity92 , republicans have taken aim at affirmative action , and the @entity90 justices have concurred
only once in the past 15 years has the @entity90 majority voted in favor of minorities in an affirmative action case
that came in 2003 , when the court upheld the affirmative action program at the @entity103
that case , however , was profoundly influenced by an amicus brief signed by 45 retired admirals and generals ( plus former defense secretary @entity108 ) stating that affirmative action was essential at the @entity110 in order to create a diverse officer corps in order to ensure necessary military cohesiveness
when asked about the military brief , solicitor general @entity115 stated that he had not thought about the consequences of ending affirmative action at the @entity110
that was enough for justice @entity120 , a @entity90 , who switched from her normal skepticism of affirmative action to sustain the law school program
nevertheless , four @entity90 justices -- @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 -- voted to invalidate the program
with @entity130 replacing @entity124 and @entity131 replacing @entity120 , the court acquired a majority that appears more concerned about discrimination against whites than about racial equality in @entity36 society
thus just two years ago in cases out of @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 , @entity143 , the @entity90 majority invalidated school assignment plans that the school districts themselves had decided were appropriate to prevent resegregation
with those cases as background , the majority 's sympathy for the plight of @entity150 , who studied so hard for the @entity16 promotion examination , was easily predictable
but so was the fact that the four dissenters in the @entity140 and @entity142 cases -- @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and the now - retired @entity161 -- would side with the city in its concern that the results of the test left no african - americans eligible for promotion
what the @entity16 case showed was that @entity90 have been winning presidential elections and therefore gaining @entity7 nominations more often than @entity52 for the past generation
so when a @entity52 president finally got a nomination , any person selected would dissent from the @entity90 ' disdain for affirmative action
it is merely a coincidence that the nominee , @entity24 , happened to participate in the case already
some @entity90 senators may try to use the @entity16 majority to paint @entity24 as out of the mainstream
but that conclusion requires painting the four dissenters as out of the mainstream , too
only the @entity90 base could believe that
@entity24 will be confirmed without a hiccup
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2
