a federal appeals court ruling that upholds a key portion of a @entity4 law will effectively close the doors on all but a handful of abortion clinics in the state , abortion rights groups say
the decision by a three - judge panel of the @entity11 , in @entity12 , on thursday gave @entity4 the green light to move forward on the mandate requiring all abortion clinics in the state be " ambulatory surgical centers , " regulated under the same standards as hospitals
lawmakers in the state 's @entity21 - majority @entity20 have said this would improve patient care and safety
abortion rights groups say the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in @entity4
the @entity30 @entity29 refused to intervene previously when other sections of the @entity4 law were challenged in court
the @entity33 sued @entity4 in april on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics
in august , a @entity37 judge ruled that the " ambulatory surgical centers " requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction
thursday 's appeals court ruling lifted that injunction and allows @entity43 2 to go into effect immediately
@entity45 , spokeswoman for the @entity4 attorney general 's office , said in a statement after the ruling , " this decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the @entity20 to craft a law to protect the health and safety of @entity4 women
" abortion rights groups say the mandate will leave women of reproductive age in the state with minimal health care options
" we are already seeing that @entity66 are suffering because of @entity43 , and with the closure of all but eight abortion clinics in a state as large and populous as @entity4 , the effects will be devastating , " said @entity62 , executive director of the @entity63
the decision , abortion rights activist say , would result in over 1 million @entity4 women having to travel a minimum of 300 miles round - trip to have an abortion
the ruling will leave the state with no abortion providers in the @entity78 or @entity4 along the @entity80 border
the state law also bans abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightens usage guidelines for " abortion - inducing drugs " such as @entity86
another part of the law -- requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where an abortion is performed -- also is under review by a federal appeals court
critics contend the law , in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state , will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous " back - alley " abortions
" it is gravely disappointing that the @entity11 has put ideology above the law , " said @entity62 , pro-choice @entity4 executive director in a statement
" when the need for abortion stays the same , but there are fewer reputable providers available , it creates the space for illegal providers and unsafe self - abortion care , " added @entity62
gov. @entity120 signed the bill into law last year .
