@entity0 , @entity1 -- conflict raged wednesday in volatile northwestern @entity1 , with nine militants killed in a gun battle , the @entity7 's abduction and release of about 30 police officers , and strikes on stranded @entity12 trucks

it 's the latest fighting between @entity1 security forces and the @entity7 militants in the northwestern region near @entity17
the country 's central government has little control in the area , and @entity27 intelligence officials say the area is a haven for militants
nine militants were killed when police and local residents foiled an attempted kidnapping of the mayor in a village on the outskirts of @entity39 , police told @entity2
@entity7 fighters attempted to abduct @entity41 , but police and residents resisted and a gun battle ensued
along with the slain militants , two police and two civilians were wounded and some of the militants fled
the village , @entity48 , is located between @entity39 and the @entity15 in the tribal areas
in the @entity51 , militants abducted around 30 police tuesday night but eventually released them on wednesday
@entity7 spokesman @entity53 confirmed to @entity2 that the personnel had been released after returning to the path of @entity56 and promising not to return to their jobs
police told @entity2 that the security personnel had been forced to agree to the @entity7 's terms and confirmed the release
there are conflicting details about the incident , in which @entity7 forces attacked the @entity67 check post in the @entity69 area of @entity51 on tuesday night and captured the people after a nightlong firefight
@entity53 said the personnel surrendered after @entity7 forces mined the area , preventing access
he said their ammunition was seized when supply vehicles coming to assist government forces were stopped by @entity7 mines
@entity1 police said the security personnel did n't surrender ; they were caught after they used up their ammunition
police and military sources said the personnel were police , but @entity53 said paramilitary officers as well as police were among the group
locals said government forces came under attack tuesday evening and ran out of ammunition before surrendering
this comes as the @entity1 military beefed up its operations this week in the @entity51
in the latest in a series of recent attacks meant to choke off supplies into @entity17 for the @entity27 and its allies , a rocket strike destroyed at least nine vehicles near the town @entity103 in the @entity15 -- one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the @entity17 border , a @entity15 official told @entity2
the trucks were returning from @entity17 but were stranded in the town because , a day earlier , suspected militants had destroyed a bridge connecting @entity103 to @entity111 , another part of the @entity15
the bridge 's destruction had forced authorities to halt traffic
because @entity17 is landlocked , many of the supplies for @entity12 - led troops fighting @entity56 militants there have to be trucked from @entity1
in recent months , militants aligned with the @entity7 and @entity124 have carried out several attacks to disrupt supplies , @entity1 officials said .
