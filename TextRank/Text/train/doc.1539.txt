less than a week after the arson of a mosque in northern @entity5 , dozens of @entity1 and @entity2 graves were vandalized in an @entity7 section of the @entity5 city of @entity9
more thahan 100 graves were vandalized in the @entity2 cemetery of @entity12 and at a nearby @entity1 cemetery in the @entity15 neighborhood of @entity9 , according to residents and a @entity18 producer who visited the locations
some of the graves were spray painted with graffiti while others were smashed
residents say the vandalism took place friday evening as the @entity28 holiday was beginning in @entity5 , but police suggested it might have taken place a day or two prior
among the words spray - painted in @entity32 on the gravestones were " price tag " and " death to all @entity7
" " price tag " is a term frequently used by radical @entity5 settlers to denote reprisal attacks against @entity39 in response to moves by the @entity5 government to evacuate illegal @entity44 outposts , or as retribution for attacks by @entity39
local residents told @entity18 that police who arrived at the scene on saturday morning tried to cover up the graffiti using white paint
the police also asked locals to clean up the graffiti
" this is bad , this very , very bad
this is all because of the settlers that moved into the neighborhood
when they did this , the writing was on the wall , " @entity9 resident @entity61 told @entity18
he was referring to the opening in 2009 , just blocks away in the predominantly @entity7 neighborhood , of a @entity68 , a religious school for young men which traditionally combines @entity71 studies with military service
" if they did what they did in @entity77 in @entity9 , there would be big , big problems , " he added , referring to the mosque that was severely damaged in an suspected arson attack in the @entity5 @entity76 village of @entity77 in northern @entity5 on monday
an 18 - year - old @entity83 @entity5 was arrested in connection with the arson
@entity5 police spokesman @entity86 said police were investigating the vandalism at the cemeteries
speaking to the @entity90 run @entity92 news agency , @entity93 , an @entity7 @entity5 lawmaker , condemned the vandalism
" the @entity5 government was not making any effort to stop these racist attacks against @entity39 , " @entity93 said
" rather , it provides extremists protection
" according to @entity5 police , reprisals have increased in the past year , prompting them to create a special investigative unit
in the past year , four @entity44 mosques have been set ablaze
the @entity105 has reported a measurable spike in violence against @entity90 property in 2011
on wednesday , a shrine holy to @entity83 was desecrated in the @entity44
@entity83 worshippers arrived at @entity111 in the city of @entity113 to find swastikas and graffiti sprayed on the walls
it is unclear when the graffiti was left there
the site is under @entity90 rule , and @entity83 visit every couple of months to pray .
