-- the air is crisp , the leaves are falling and animals are starting to prepare for the winter ahead
pull out your sweaters and hiking boots ; it 's time for a fall hike
if you have n't done much hiking in the past , have no fear
hiking aficionado @entity12 promises plenty of hikes for the novice wishing to spend a couple hours in nature
if you 're already a veteran hiker , @entity12 has several hiking recommendations for you
and if a hike looks to be too much for the beginner in your crowd , consider doing part of a longer hike , turning around and heading back to the starting point for a picnic or snack
raised on a mushroom farm in @entity28 , @entity12 would wander off into the woods for the day or take an overnight trip with his family and pitch a tent along the way
now executive director of the @entity36 's @entity35 , he hikes like most working people , often squeezing in a half - day or day hike on business trips
that 's why he started a blog dedicated to hiking experiences that do n't require endurance training
@entity12 wants to enjoy the experience and perhaps be in good condition for " a nice steak dinner and a glass of wine " he says
a hike that tortures his body ? not for him
" i 'm looking for a pleasant experience , not a 50 - mile death march , " he says
" i 'm not trying to prove a point
" here are some of his fall favorites
please suggest your own in the comments section below
@entity59 , @entity60 great views start at the trailhead at @entity64 parking lot
hike about three miles up to @entity65
the @entity66 also connects to several of the most scenic miles of the @entity68
if you 're bringing small children along , you can promise them ponies on this hike ( just not for riding ) as a herd of friendly , wild ponies lives on the mountain
they are visible during the first mile of this walk , so you do n't have to go far from your car
there is fencing to prevent them from entering the @entity68 section of the park
@entity85 , @entity86 and @entity28 @entity12 hikes the @entity85 at least a couple times a year
the preserve hugs the border of @entity28 and @entity86 and is part of the @entity91 watershed
designated by @entity92 as a @entity93 , @entity85 and the surrounding valley offers a nice level hike along the old railbeds ( part of a rails - to - trails conversion ) and through an old growth forest
energetic hikers could walk for nearly 10 miles on the gravel walk
while the local trail is actually unnamed at this point , it is a section of the larger @entity105 that will eventually roughly follow the @entity106
the creek side trail in this park follows the edge of the @entity85 for more than six miles from @entity28 to @entity86
@entity110 , @entity60 @entity110 is in the @entity111 in the @entity112 of @entity60 , a couple hours west of @entity113
the mountain 's eight - mile circuit includes scrambling up rocks and is considered a little more difficult , but a fit 10 - year - old could do it , @entity12 says
" the reward is top of the mountain , a craggy peak that overlooks the @entity123 , " he says
the mountain is close to @entity113 , so it can get crowded on the weekends during peak fall foliage season
it is a challenging trail , especially for a complete novice
that 's why there are warnings about being careful on the trail
but @entity12 has seen lots of kids hiking the trail and has no hesitation to recommend this to families
" just use common sense , " he says
@entity141 , @entity142 part of the @entity145 city park system , @entity141 is an old ranch five miles from @entity145 that 's been converted into parkland
the loop is a 7.8 - mile circuit hike starting at a peak , hiking down into the river valley and back up another peak
@entity154 , @entity155 a two - hour drive north of @entity157 , @entity154 offers hikers the chance to walk along the cliffs of the @entity161 and enjoy sweeping views of the coast
the hike can be done as a five - mile loop
the 1.2 - mile @entity166 runs along the ocean 's edge
it can be combined with the park 's north and south upland trails to create a flexible - length loop hike , most of which offers spectacular ocean views
" you can walk almost five miles through the meadows along these trails , " says @entity12
" it should be gorgeous right now with the dry wildflowers , " he says
@entity181 , @entity155 a short drive north of @entity157 , the @entity181 is a very popular park , and @entity184 is one of its popular hikes , says @entity12 , who once spotted a golden eagle on this trail
the 11 - mile hike is level and provides hikers with " instant gratification , " he says
" you have the bay on the right , the ocean on the left and a view to the rocky point section of the park ( at @entity199 )
there 's a managed herd of elk within view
" there 's also the remains of an old dairy ranch still standing , " so you can imagine what it would have been like to live on this remote place on the @entity161 , " he says
hiking in the big city think a hike needs to be in nature ? think again , says @entity215 , who loves to " hike " @entity216 in search of great restaurants and cheese shops
" i will park at one end , leave a cooler in my car and fill it with cheeses and meat , " he says
" with no summer heat , it 's a good time to be there
" he also loves to hike in @entity228
think it 's not a workout ? walk from @entity232 at @entity233 down to @entity234 in @entity235 and think again
or walk over the @entity236 and enjoy the incredible views of @entity236 , @entity235 and the @entity238
" i will literally go to @entity228 and walk from one end to the other , " he says
" i do n't think you have to get into a car to take a hike
a hike is an interesting walk where there are things to see along the way
i grew up in the country , in a rural area
to me , the city is exotic
" where do you love to hike ? it can be anywhere as long as you 're moving
