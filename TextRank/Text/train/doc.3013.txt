-- if @entity3 and @entity4 had a love child , his name would be @entity6
in the last century , the great critics of corrupt political language were @entity9 authors who wrote dystopian novels
in " 1984 , " @entity3 described a totalitarian society in which meaningless political language , dubbed @entity13 , veiled horrible truths
earlier , in " @entity16 , " @entity15 described toddlers conditioned in laboratories to be afraid of books
and in " @entity21 , " @entity20 imagined a world in which ultraviolent teens rampaged in a distinctive @entity26 - @entity25 patois that defined their alienation from society and authority
now in the 21st century , there is @entity6 's " truthiness " -- political half - truths , quarter - truths and what the website @entity35 describes as " @entity37 " prevarications
on his @entity40 show , " @entity39 , " he introduced " @entity42 , " a regular deconstruction of language contortion designed , in @entity3 's notion , to defend the indefensible
( one example : " a @entity50 , " as in , journalists should demand to investigate torture , but it 's not a perfect world
) it 's sharp political humor and a canny critique of @entity55 culture , language and iconography
and it 's helped the comic emerge as this nation 's court jester , licensed by the youthful cable tv audience to speak truth to power
such is @entity6 's power and influence that he has been invited to testify before @entity67 today on the issue of illegal immigration -- and to testify in character
it 's as if the @entity67 of the @entity72 years invited @entity73 to offer testimony by beeping his bicycle horn
@entity6 has long been on to something important about the nature of our political discourse at the beginning of a new postmodern millennium : that ideology has become the lens through which @entity55 found their particular truth , let the evidence be damned
as a caricature of @entity88 's @entity87 , he has turned deconstruction of the culture wars into an art form , adopting the slogans and symbols of @entity55 's ideologues , even as he reveals their emptiness
of course , during the last century , there were always comic voices -- from @entity99 to @entity100 to @entity101 to @entity102 -- who could be counted on to deflate the pretensions of the rich and powerful using their own words
but cable television has created a different breed of comic cat with vast media reach
and on @entity88 , @entity110 offers himself up as a " rodeo clown " ( his words ) , a character who embodies the disaffection and alienation of the right , but whose acolytes experience him as real enough to follow him in the thousands to the @entity118 for a rally
@entity120 insists that his " @entity126 " is comedy entertainment and not journalism , and yet it has become the main source of political news for millions
even as president @entity127 is seen by some to have lost his campaign mojo , @entity120 and @entity6 plan their own @entity130 rally , making them arguably the most potent antidote to the blustery right
is it possible we are reaching the point in political history when a fictional character can be elected to office ? viewers and fans should remember what 's real about all this and what 's not
i was reminded of this firsthand when i encountered the @entity6 comic persona during one of the 2004 presidential conventions in which he declared himself a worthy presidential candidate because of his humble origins
he was a descendant , he said , of " goat turd farmers from @entity154
" as producers explain to guests on " @entity39 , " it is not their job to be funny , but to act as foil for the self - important and clueless cable talk show host
the guest tries to disabuse @entity6 of his ridiculous view of politics and the world , an effort that never works , of course
what happens when @entity6 is questioned by members of @entity67 promises to be a comic hall of mirrors in which illusion and allusion , reflection and deflection , truthiness and reality collide and converge
members of @entity67 might treat the spectacle as entertainment , but they would be wise to look a level deeper , to see that the followers of @entity6 's circus may one day cast off their ironic pose and step up to cast their votes
when i was the age of @entity6 's legion of fans , i turned to the novels of @entity3 , @entity15 and @entity20 to sharpen my skepticism toward the language of those in power
such fiction is likely to wane in influence in an era when so many read less and care less
in its place is something quite different but , in its own way , quite good : comedy and satire shining a disinfecting light on the language of scoundrels
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .
