-- the @entity1 advised concerned consumers thursday to stop taking a popular cholesterol drug that may be contaminated with specks of glass if the pills came from one of 41 recalled lots
the recall of generic @entity10 was initiated nearly three weeks ago by @entity11 , but this is the first time the @entity1 -- or anyone else -- has told consumers to stop taking the drug
the @entity1 also announced thursday that @entity11 would stop making atorvastatin while it investigates how the glass might have gotten into the drug
even with these new guidelines , some pharmacies are still telling customers it 's safe to take the drug
" patients should continue to proceed as they normally would , " said @entity22 , vice president of corporate communications at @entity24 , on thursday
he added that the company would not give customers refunds for the generic @entity10 , or atorvastatin
cholesterol drug recalled over glass concerns @entity22 explained that this was a " pharmacy - level recall , " meaning pharmacies must stop dispensing contaminated lots of the drug , but consumers could keep taking what they already had at home -- even though the @entity1 has confirmed that some of the contaminated drug may have reached consumers
pharmacists at several cvs stores also told customers it was ok to keep taking @entity11 's atorvastatin but said they would replace the drug at a patient 's request
" this whole thing is confusing for consumers , " said @entity51 , editor of prescription drugs at @entity53
she also expressed concern that it took the @entity1 nearly three weeks to issue guidance to consumers
" it 's not clear why it took them so long , " she said
" @entity1 spokeswoman @entity61 declined to comment on the reasons behind the delay
recall leaves glass - specked drug in hands of patients in its statement thursday , the @entity1 said that the glass particles were " similar to the size of a grain of sand " and that " the possibility of adverse events related to the recalled product appear to be low
" making matters potentially even more confusing , the @entity1 directed concerned consumers to call their pharmacies to see whether their pills had been recalled , as not all lots of the drug are effected
however , pharmacists say they have no way of figuring out what lot number a bottle of pills came from
" the ability to tie a specific prescription to a lot number would be very difficult , " said @entity88 , vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the @entity91
@entity11 , @entity95 's largest pharmaceutical company and the 12th largest generics maker in the world , has had quality problems in the past
the @entity1 has accused the company of " a pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct , " including taking shortcuts in crucial quality tests
so widespread and grave was the misbehavior that in 2008 the @entity1 barred @entity11 from importing 30 drugs into the @entity107 .
