@entity0 -- divers have completed their search of a @entity6 cruise ship that sank last weekend with the loss of many lives , the @entity2 told @entity1 friday
the official death toll has reached 114 -- including 66 women , 28 children and 20 men , the ministry said
the bodies of 15 people are still missing
there were 208 people on the " @entity18 " at the time of the accident sunday , of whom 79 were rescued
divers have checked all the boat 's compartments , the ministry said , and are now looking for more bodies around the boat as well downstream on the @entity28 , where they could have been carried by the current
the area where search efforts continue has been enlarged to 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) from the scene , @entity6 transport minister @entity31 said at a briefing friday
preparations are under way for the cruise ship to be raised from the river bottom in the coming days
two large boat cranes , one from @entity0 and another one from @entity41 , which will be used for the lifting , are on the way to the accident site
" we have asked the @entity2 to keep 23 divers at the scene to continue the search for bodies even during the lifting operation , " @entity31 said
specialist military divers were brought in mid-week to aid in the search efforts
four people face criminal charges over the sinking of the ship , which @entity6 media have called the most devastating river accident in the country 's history
all agencies and organizations involved in tourism must be held accountable , @entity6 president @entity62 said at a special government meeting friday devoted to the accident
" this means that not only people who rubber - stamp documents , not only scapegoats , but also organizers of cruises must answer , " he said , in comments broadcast by @entity6 state tv
" the measure of punishment to be chosen must make it clear to each executive , irrespective of rank , that he or she will be held responsible for each cruise not only administratively , but also criminally
criminal liability must be sufficiently serious
" @entity62 said it would be too expensive and complicated for @entity6 immediately to replace the fleets of ageing ships in use on rivers and at sea
but , he said , that did not mean those carrying out inspections should not be thorough
" it is our task to find out the causes of the accident -- they are more or less clear now -- and also to prevent disasters , " he said
@entity102 , the company that sub-leased the " @entity18 " , had illegally organized five cruises on the ship in the summer of 2011 prior to the accident , the @entity6 prosecutor @entity100 said in a report published on its website friday
the vessel did not have a license to transport passengers , was overloaded , and was last repaired more than 30 years ago , the prosecutors said earlier this week
they had also established that the left engine of the ship was damaged , the prosecutors said on their website
the vessel was built in 1955 in @entity116 , according to @entity6 law enforcement officials
the double - deck cruise ship went down near the village of @entity120 in @entity121 , about 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) south of the city of @entity123
@entity123 is about 724 kilometers ( 450 miles ) east of @entity0 .
