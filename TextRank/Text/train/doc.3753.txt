@entity0 , @entity1 -- another round of toasts and exclamations of " hajiu " sounded out around me
i took a sip and set down my small glass of @entity10 as my new friends downed theirs and refilled
our seafood dinner , perched on the single cluttered table of a tiny antique shop , was punctuated regularly by such moments
a worker operates the giant fermentation units at the @entity10 plant in @entity0
i joined in happily , although somewhat bemused , at each increasingly beery celebration of our host , the worldly captain @entity21
my company , a gathering from four regions of @entity1 , was engaging me in @entity1 drinking etiquette , in the city of @entity0
a few drinks in the @entity1 led me to discover @entity29 delights and other unexpected finds in this modest city
you 'd be forgiven for not knowing where @entity0 ( pronounced @entity0 ) is
the @entity1 city in @entity36 province does n't roll off the tongue as easily as @entity38 , @entity39 , or even @entity40
the 2008 @entity41 gave it a place on the map as @entity1 's sailing hub ; no longer a secret that holiday - making officials could keep for themselves
but my @entity49 spell - check does n't recognize it ( which says more about my spell - check ) , and you can still find @entity54 manhole covers
so what is it about this city that seduces the unassuming traveler ? nestled on the coast of @entity36 province , almost exactly halfway between its big sisters , @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity0 features as a handy pit - stop on @entity59 itineraries
it boasts great infrastructure , a charming climate , alfresco eateries , good coffee , sandy beaches , @entity69 history , international hotels , a brand new airport and even a famous brewery
@entity0 could pass itself off as a miniature @entity74 if it were n't for the fact that pretty much no one outside of the five - star hotels speaks @entity79 , and that communism still articulates itself through the tourist beaches , stoically named @entity82 to @entity83
" in mainland @entity1 , @entity0 's history is uniquely international ; in fact , more of the city 's cultural identity is wrapped up in its @entity69 colonial past than even its prominent role in the emergence of @entity94 " said @entity84 , editor of the @entity85 @entity86
" the local culture bureau once joked to us that @entity0 is a ' cultural desert ' , because it does n't have the dynastic lineage of @entity99 or @entity40 , or opera for that matter , " @entity84 said
" but that 's not what makes a city livable , or even fun -- if your office is in downtown , you 're never more than five minutes from a protected beach ; there 's always excellent seafood close at hand ; you can buy @entity1 's best beer fresh , for 10 cents a pound , and walk around drinking it out of a plastic bag
" following this key advice , i visited @entity0 during the @entity118 in late august , an event aimed largely at a domestic @entity1 market
the annual @entity118 aims to change this
while the bright lights and myriad beers flowed , one thing was obvious : this was for the tourists
true @entity130 people are fiercely proud of @entity10 beer , produced just down the road on @entity133 , and little else is drunk here in homes or bars
@entity137 , beer in @entity139 , is hajiu in @entity130 , the regional dialect
when in doubt , this does as well for a toast as anything else
indeed , there is no better way of celebrating an occasion than by toasting the guest of honor with a bag of fresh beer
if i was the guest of honor at captain @entity21 's table , i certainly was n't living up to expectations
particularly not for my self - appointed etiquette guardian and " pure @entity0 boy , " @entity158
as i raised my glass for a sip and @entity158 jumped to toast the good weather for the nth time , it all became clear
in @entity0 , a beer glass is never raised without a toast
this serves three ( frankly ingenious ) purposes ; beer is drunk in unison ; beer is n't consumed too rapidly , since constant toasting would ruin conversation ; and everyone finds ways to honor each other for the purposes of toasting
captain @entity21 was particularly in favor of the latter as our eccentric host was made subject of most cheers , likewise teaching us the salutations he had learned from the many foreign guests he had cooked for
from the @entity190 " salut ! " to the @entity69 " prost ! " to the @entity188 " serefe ! " most popular of all was homegrown " hajiu ! " alcohol is enjoyed throughout @entity1
microbreweries are yet to catch on here like they have in @entity195 and @entity196
for now @entity10 holds the monopoly , and @entity0 's people are n't complaining
the @entity10 , founded in 1903 by @entity69 settlers , confiscated by the @entity195 in 1915 , turned over to state ownership in 1949 and finally privatized in the early 1990s , has witnessed a colorful history
the largest stakeholder , @entity203 , recently sold majority ownership to @entity195 @entity205
residents are the first to introduce you to their biggest export
outside every shop is a barrel or two of @entity10 , with a ream of clean plastic bags ready to be filled with cheap 3.5 percent beer
@entity10 beer tastes crisp and sweet ( most likely from rice mixed in to cut down on the cost of barley
it is bought by the pound and weighed to prevent gaseous volume manipulation
a pint , when sold in this method , costs around 1.5 renminbi , or 22 @entity49 cents
beer is a way of life here and has been ever since the @entity69 arrived and erected tree - lined avenues , red - roofed houses and a brewery
the @entity69 are gone but the beer stayed
and with it , three hajiu - loving generations tell you about their happy memories
" when i was little , buying beer was one special job i did for my dad every summer day , " explained @entity239 over a fresh bag of beer
" i was the little girl proudly and carefully carrying the plastic bag home
" it is easier to identify @entity0 by what it is not -- smoggy , crowded @entity38 , or nightlife hub @entity39 -- than what it is or hopes to be
this may be the very reason why @entity0 remains largely unvisited by the @entity121
and while there may not be much more than good weather , food and beer to keep you content , that may just be enough to hop on the three - hour flight from @entity264 , or the one hour 20 minute - journey from @entity38 or @entity39
following @entity41 - based investment , more than 3,000 factories have sprung up in the airport suburbs
you can source anything from shoes to jewels to @entity273 condoms among the largely @entity275 - owned industries
if these things are n't up your street , head elsewhere ; like functionally named @entity133 , @entity279 , or my personal favorite , @entity282
" we used to have to put on parties so that there would be material to justify an @entity79 - oriented lifestyle magazine , " editor @entity84 said
" now we have trouble keeping track ! " check out @entity79 - language newspaper @entity86 , for informative listings and an insight into the growing @entity79 - speaking population that has stumbled upon and stayed in @entity0 .
