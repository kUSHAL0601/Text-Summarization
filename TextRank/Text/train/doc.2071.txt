@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 president @entity3 and @entity1 interim prime minister @entity5 had strong words for @entity7 on wednesday as @entity8 again warned @entity9 there will be consequences if it does n't remove its troops from @entity13 and @entity14 said that it will " never surrender
" but @entity5 also said after his meeting with @entity3 at the @entity16 that @entity1 , a former @entity17 , wants to be good friends with @entity7
" we will continue to say to the @entity7 government that if it continues on the path that is on , then not only us but the international community ... will be forced to apply a cost to @entity7 's violations of international law , " @entity3 told reporters
" there is another path available , and we hope that ( @entity7 ) president ( @entity30 ) @entity30 is willing seize that path
" @entity5 -- who took over after the ouster of @entity32 , the @entity33 former president of ukraine -- said that @entity1 is fighting for its freedom
" we fight for our sovereignty , and we will never surrender , " he said
later he added that he wanted to be clear that @entity1 " is and will be a part of the western world " but still a " good friend and partner of @entity7
" at a meeting of an international affairs think tank called the @entity43 in @entity8 , @entity5 further explained
" we still want to have a free ( and ) equal partnership with @entity7
and you ca n't do it having a military incursion
we do not consider a military option as the best option on how to fix this crisis , " he said
even as the leaders met earlier pro-russian forces were tightening their grip in @entity13 ahead of a secession referendum denounced by the @entity56
well - armed men have effectively isolated the @entity13 peninsula , which has an ethnic @entity7 majority , from the rest of @entity1
tensions flared wednesday at a @entity1 military base in @entity63 , in western @entity13
a @entity2 team saw @entity1 forces load and cock their weapons as what appeared to be @entity7 soldiers moved in on the base and placed a heavy machine gun at the gates
the @entity7 troops pulled back
@entity5 first met @entity4 secretary of state @entity73 before heading to the @entity16 and later met with members of the @entity75
he will go to @entity76 on thursday to address the @entity78 @entity77
the @entity1 delegation will also meet with @entity80 , the @entity81 and the @entity82 while in @entity8 , in an indication of international support for @entity1 's fledgling government
@entity5 's visit comes as breakneck preparations are under way for a sunday referendum in @entity1 's @entity91 peninsula -- to be held largely in secret -- and tensions persist around @entity0 , @entity13 's capital
flights to @entity13 from @entity14 , @entity95 and several other cities have been suspended for the rest of the week , with only those originating from @entity9 landing
@entity100 will be able to choose between two alternatives when they vote : do you support reuniting @entity13 with @entity7 , as a subject of the @entity7 ? or , do you support the restoration of the @entity106 of the @entity107 and @entity13 's status as a part of @entity1 ? the @entity110 was delivering referendum ballots to regional administrative buildings , according to the body 's head , @entity113
the new @entity33 government on the peninsula in @entity1 's southeast said tuesday that if the voters opt to join @entity7 , the first step will be to declare @entity13 an independent and sovereign state
then it will apply to join the @entity7
@entity13 's representatives have already approached @entity9 with their idea
@entity7 leaders have greeted them with open arms
diplomatic pressure @entity7 - speaking troops wearing no identifying insignia have @entity13 firmly under their control
many believe that they belong at least in part to @entity7 's military , an assertion @entity9 has repeatedly denied
@entity7 says they are local " self - defense " forces
there has been an international outcry over @entity13 's push for separation and warnings that the referendum wo n't be recognized in @entity14 or elsewhere
efforts to exert diplomatic pressure on @entity9 continued wednesday despite little sign that @entity7 is listening
@entity73 said he would meet friday in @entity145 with @entity7 foreign minister @entity146 , to continue discussions on the situation in @entity1
meanwhile , @entity150 president @entity149 told @entity30 , in a phone call that the referendum planned in @entity13 " has no legal basis
" @entity149 urged @entity30 to " do everything to prevent the annexation of @entity13 to @entity7 , " saying that such a move would be unacceptable to the international community
in a different tone , a statement from the @entity159 said @entity30 and @entity149 had agreed to continue discussions , and @entity150 's foreign and defense ministers would travel to @entity9 next week
@entity4 military presence @entity2 has learned the @entity3 administration is expected to announce thursday a @entity166 plan to keep the aircraft carrier @entity168 in the @entity169 longer than planned to help reassure @entity171 allies in the wake of the @entity7 invasion of @entity13
one official said @entity4 military assets in the region are being reviewed for " what stays , what goes , what gets moved around
" although the @entity4 effort with @entity7 focuses on diplomatic initiatives , the military part of the equation was discussed in depth at a @entity16 meeting tuesday , the military official confirmed
asked about the decision to keep the aircraft carrier in the @entity169 , a senior administration official said not to expect much more muscle - flexing , or additional military steps , between now and sunday 's referendum in @entity13
@entity193 tells @entity7 to back off the @entity193 -- the world 's leading industrial powers without @entity7 -- and leaders of the @entity197 and @entity110 issued a strongly worded statement calling on @entity7 to " cease all efforts to change the status of @entity13 contrary to @entity1 law and in violation of international law
" the statement urged @entity7 to immediately halt actions supporting the referendum
" any such referendum would have no legal effect
given the lack of adequate preparation and the intimidating presence of @entity7 troops , it would also be a deeply flawed process which would have no moral force
for all these reasons , we would not recognize the outcome , " it said
it warned that the annexation of @entity13 could have " grave implications " for the legal order protecting the sovereignty of all states
" should the @entity7 take such a step , we will take further action , individually and collectively , " it said
the @entity193 nations -- the @entity4 , @entity227 , @entity150 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 -- had already suspended preparations for a planned @entity233 in the @entity7 city of @entity235 in june in response to @entity7 's actions in @entity1
world stage the peninsula in the @entity91 , with a population of just over 2 million people , has stepped into the spotlight of the world stage
the @entity56 has been preparing sanctions and at the same time telling @entity9 that there is a way out of an economic and diplomatic showdown : talk to @entity1 's new government and do n't intervene militarily
@entity9 has denounced the events that led to @entity32 's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new @entity1 authorities
@entity32 , currently in @entity7 , insists he is still the legitimate leader of @entity1 and has vowed to return to @entity14 " as soon as the circumstances allow
" he fled @entity14 on february 22 after three months of protests against his decision to scrap a trade deal with the @entity257 and embrace closer ties with @entity7
@entity30 has said his government has the right to protect ethnic @entity7 living there
unarmed military and civilian observers from the @entity265 are now on the ground in the city of @entity268 , in eastern @entity1 , the regional security bloc said via @entity269
the team was repeatedly turned back from entering @entity13 by armed men
a report by the @entity265 observer team said that although it was prevented from entering @entity13 , its " observations produced significant evidence of equipment consistent with the presence of @entity7 military personnel ( in the vicinity of ) the various roadblocks encountered
" the evidence included @entity7 pattern uniforms and equipment without identifying patches , as well as trucks bearing license plate numbers associated with @entity7 's @entity287 , the observers said
" this report adds to our deep concerns and clearly suggests direct involvement by the @entity7 and its agents in preventing impartial , unarmed observers from doing the work they are supposed to do , " @entity4 ambassador to the @entity265 @entity289 said
" @entity7 encouragement of and support for illegal checkpoints is unhelpful
" meanwhile , the @entity78 said assistant secretary - general for human rights , @entity298 , had canceled a visit to @entity13 -- primarily because of the logistical challenges at @entity302 and because he had been informed by authorities that he could not be received
aid package clears early hurdle eight @entity4 senators , led by @entity308 @entity307 sen. @entity307 , are scheduled to travel to @entity1 in coming days

the full @entity75 will vote on the package after the chamber returns from a recess
" it always takes time to make good things , " @entity5 said wednesday night , adding that his country praised the @entity4 for its support
@entity7 : ' absolutely legitimate ' @entity7 officials have compared @entity13 's potential departure from @entity1 to @entity332 's secession from @entity333 after many years of bloody civil war with its former neighbor
@entity56 governments recognized the separation over bitter opposition from @entity333 and its historical allies in @entity9
in a written statement , the @entity340 cited it as a precedent for the " absolutely legitimate " @entity13 vote
