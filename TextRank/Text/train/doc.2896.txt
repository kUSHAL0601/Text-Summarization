-- what a drag it is getting old
how many times has someone mocked @entity5 by using that lyric from the @entity7 hit " @entity8 " ? @entity5 and @entity9 wrote and recorded the song in late 1965 , when they were 22 , with @entity5 alternately lecturing , alternately pitying dejected housewives and their pills
sir @entity5 is going to be 70 years old on friday , and if it 's been a drag getting old for him , he certainly has n't shown it
the @entity7 are celebrating their 50th anniversary as a band with new music and an extensive tour
@entity5 can still move like , well , @entity5 , his sinewy dancing and endless energy showing little sign of flagging despite his grandfatherly age
( the man has two children in their 40s , for @entity29 's sake ! ) he 's made classic records , kept the gossip columns busy and always maintained an astute eye on the spotlight
@entity0 photo blog : never before seen @entity7 photos besides , @entity5 is only the latest of the 1960s musical heroes -- the backbeat of every classic rock station and baby - boomer record collection -- to cross the three - score - and - ten age threshold
@entity41 turned 70 last year
@entity43 hit 70 two years ago
@entity45 , @entity46 , @entity5 's bandmate @entity47 -- they 're all in their seventies
sure , it 's easy to make fun of that
pop music is a young person 's game , after all
" everybody that you mention looks like an old woman now , " says @entity55 , playing an employee of a record company specializing in heritage acts , in the movie " @entity60
" " you 're just mentioning a bunch of @entity67
" by the numbers : @entity5 we should all be so lucky , though
@entity70 lived until she was 85 , acting until almost the very end
better that than the alternative
if you 're doing something you love , you should keep doing it
@entity43 , who calls his travels the " @entity77 , " has n't stopped in years
why not ? most of the ' 60s - era rock stars , believing the music was just a fad , had no idea they 'd still be rockin ' and rollin ' as they entered their eighth decades
asked in 1964 why they were so popular , the @entity83 could only shrug
" if we knew , we 'd get together four boys with long hair and be managers , " said @entity84
so go ahead and sneer at them like the oldsters of their own youth did
@entity5 and his ageless friends are having the last laugh
what can a poor boy do , ' cept to sing for a rock ' n ' roll band , right ? happy birthday , @entity5 !
