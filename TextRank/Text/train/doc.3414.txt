@entity0 , @entity1 -- prime minister @entity3 of @entity1 said monday that he does not believe foul play was involved in a car wreck that killed his wife
the vehicle the couple were traveling in was left overturned off the highway
" when something like that happens there is speculation , but i want to assure you if it was foul play , it is one in a thousand , " he said monday
" it was an accident that took her life
" @entity3 's comments came amid widespread speculation that the wreck was caused by his political opponents aligned with president @entity26
@entity3 's political party , the @entity27 , has said the crash was an assassination attempt
it has called for an independent inquiry
@entity1 's new prime minister was hurt in the wreck and returned home monday from neighboring @entity35
" life has to go on and i 'm certain that if she was here she would liked life to go on , " he said
" it will be difficult to fill the gap left by her
" @entity3 has long been a leading opposition figure in @entity1 , but he joined a coalition government with @entity26 last month
that seemed to resolve an impasse created by a disputed presidential election between @entity26 and @entity3 last year
@entity3 received the most votes in the march 2008 election , but he fell short of the 50 percent required to avoid a runoff
he withdrew as a candidate in the runoff , citing political violence and intimidation targeting his supporters
negotiations between the two sides culminated in the power - sharing agreement that was implemented just weeks ago
questions about the wreck surfaced shortly after it happened friday on a busy two - lane highway between @entity3 's hometown of @entity62 and the capital city of @entity0
on saturday , members of @entity3 's political party , the @entity27 , told @entity2 that @entity3 believed that the driver of the truck that struck his car deliberately drove toward him in an effort to take his life
the party 's secretary - general , @entity71 , said police should have provided better security for @entity3
the wreck might not have happened , he said , if a police escort been on hand
a former @entity79 ambassador to @entity1 , @entity78 , said the wreck raised suspicion
" i 'm skeptical about any motor vehicle accident in @entity1 involving an opposition figure , " said @entity78 , who was ambassador to @entity1 from 1997 to 2001
" president @entity26 has a history of strange car accidents when someone , lo and behold , dies -- it 's sort of his @entity87 of how they get rid of people they do n't like
" @entity78 , however , was quick to add that traffic accidents are common in @entity1
the highway on which @entity3 was traveling is a two - lane road on which tractor - trailers are common , he said
vehicles in the country are often in bad shape and many drivers are inexperienced , he said
" it 's certainly plausible that this was just one of those tragic things , " he said
