@entity0 , @entity1 -- something interesting is happening in the @entity4 , and it 's not the unexpected rise of @entity6 and his 9 - 9 - 9 plan
the really significant development is the resilience @entity10 is showing as a top - tier candidate
ironically , @entity10 , the candidate who seems to generate the least excitement among @entity4 voters -- the candidate by default -- potentially could have the most far - reaching impact on the character of the @entity4
following almost half a century when the heart of the @entity4 moved toward the @entity20 of the country , a @entity18 @entity4 remains the likely frontrunner for the nomination
it is unlikely that @entity6 , who barely has a campaign organization to speak of , will last very long at the top of the polls
even as @entity29 gov. @entity28 is trying hard to steal his thunder , @entity10 has been able to stay ahead of most of his opponents
upon giving @entity10 his endorsement , @entity1 gov. @entity32 , another part of the new generation of republicans from the region , said : " the @entity35 are sticking together in this case
" if @entity10 wins the nomination , he would place the @entity41 wing of the party in a position where it has not been since the 1960s
there was a time when @entity48 , many of whom were relatively liberal , loomed large in the @entity4
politicians such as sens. @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , as well as @entity57 gov. @entity56 , championed a style of conservatism that stressed fiscal and regulatory issues over social and cultural questions
they tended to be more sensitive to issues such as urban revitalization and public transportation that were central to their constituencies
rather than fighting for all or nothing on government policies they disliked , their goal was to constrain and direct domestic programs
this was a breed of @entity4 that had to survive in heavily @entity76 states , so they understood the art of compromise and learned to work within divided political systems
standing before hostile @entity4 delegates who were trying to boo him off the stage at the 1964 convention ( when @entity4 shifted right by nominating @entity85 ) , @entity56 warned that he had " crisscrossed this nation " in order to fight to " keep the @entity4 the party of all the people ... and warning of the extremist threat , its danger to the party , and danger to the nation
" republicans gained strength in the @entity20 and @entity98
@entity76 took over the coastal states , succeeding in the @entity100 , where suburban voters were more liberal on social and cultural issues , and where unions still remained an important force
when @entity108 won the @entity76 nomination in 1976 and @entity110 in 1992 , a big part of their promise was to strengthen @entity76 in the @entity20 , a region that the party had been losing ever since president @entity112 finished his term in the late 1960s
@entity119 's " @entity118 strategy " was designed for @entity4 to capitalize on southern discontent with @entity76 following the passage of the @entity116
in the @entity124 , @entity18 republicans such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 began to seem like anomalies
if @entity10 wins the nomination , and possibly the presidency , he would likely bring a different sensibility to his party
@entity10 was born and bred in a region where surviving as a @entity4 required a different approach than in a place like @entity134
as governor he famously tackled issues such as health care , accepted the need for government to raise revenue , and took a middling course on issues like abortion
playing to the center is part of a family tradition
in 1968 , one of the front - runners for the @entity4 nomination was @entity10 's father , gov. @entity147 of @entity150 , former ceo of @entity151
@entity10 , like his son dashing in his appearance , brought many of the same political benefits to the table in an era when @entity4 still held a place for the center
as far as @entity76 were concerned , he was seen as a dangerous @entity4 because he could appeal to centrist and independent voters , and even to disaffected @entity76
he was able to win some union support and endorsed the cause of civil rights
@entity147 's campaign imploded because of a statement about his trip to @entity167 , where he said he had been brainwashed by the military
the statement created media fodder to question @entity10 's stability
right now , many @entity4 reluctantly see @entity10 as the best possible option for the party
but in certain respects , he might be the most interesting one as well
without losing the support of the kind of right - wing conservatives who wo n't go to the @entity76 , his candidacy offers the @entity4 the opportunity to tackle issues and policies that have been ignored ever since @entity56 's generation disappeared from the electoral map
whether @entity4 voters have the confidence to take a risk on a candidate who provides a different perspective than @entity118 and @entity189 @entity4 remains to be seen
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .
