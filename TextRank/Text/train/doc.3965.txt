-- here 's some good news , a year after @entity2 : states have been restoring funds for mental health coverage
states are the main providers of mental health services
in the recession of 2008 - 2009 , the states together cut $ 1.8 billion from mental health budgets , according to the @entity10 , an advocacy group
over the past year , 36 states have added money back
@entity13 just legislated the largest increase in mental health coverage in the state 's history , $ 259 million more over the next two years than over the previous two
private dollars may soon flow , too : the @entity19 requires insurers to expand their coverage of mental health problems
states have passed laws intended to prevent the mentally ill from doing harm
@entity26 adopted the most sweeping legislation
the @entity28 , as it 's known , requires all mental health professionals to report patients who , in the professional 's opinion , seem likely to present a risk of serious harm to themselves or others
state police can then check these reports and deny or revoke a gun license
@entity39 and @entity40 have also stiffened mental health reporting requirements
now the sobering news : mental health professionals ca n't report dangerous people if they do n't come into contact with them in the first place
professionals are in short supply
insurance coverage has historically been thin
those who most need mental health help are precisely those least likely to seek or accept it
even if the dangerous mentally ill can be identified , the facilities to protect society have been reduced to desperate inadequacy
in 1959 , state mental hospitals housed about 559,000 patients
a generation later , the mental hospital population had dwindled to 70,000 people
this trend is called " deinstitutionalization , " but that 's an inapt term
the mentally ill do often end up inside institutions : prisons
almost 1.3 million mentally ill people are held in prisons and jails
few of these people are adequately treated , and they often emerge more troubled and dangerous
even if authorities can identify a potentially dangerous mentally ill person and do revoke that person 's gun license , the sheer superabundance of guns in the @entity71 puts weapons in easy reach of anyone who wants them
the guns that @entity81 used at @entity2 were bought by his mother , who could have passed any background check
a society with a lot of guns is going to have a lot of shootings , no matter what else it does for the mentally ill -- especially since the most common form of gun violence is not homicide but suicide
the self - slaughter of a chronically depressed person is a mental health failure , too
a stronger mental health system is not an alternative to gun safety laws
it must operate in tandem with them
that lesson was written in blood at @entity2 , yet it remains unlearned to this day
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity107 .
