@entity2 says @entity11 should back up his words with action to reshape the @entity14
( @entity15 ) -- the back - and - forth between former secretary of state @entity11 , former vice president @entity16 , and radio entertainer @entity17 , has been , well , entertaining and fascinating
you have these enormous personalities and egos slamming into each other over what it means to be a @entity14 and the course the party should be on , as it is in desperate need of a vision
yet while folks like me in the media love the brouhaha , and tv and radio producers salivate at the chance to book any one of these three on their programs , the inevitable question has to be asked : what now ? and this is where former house speaker @entity39 is correct
@entity11 must go beyond commenting on the state of the party and what it needs , and work to help rebuild , reshape and revitalize the @entity14 in the form he thinks is appropriate for the 21st century
let 's be clear : @entity11 is under no obligation to hit the road campaigning for candidates , raising funds , participating in strategy sessions , and the dirty work necessary to make his vision a reality
but unless a leader such as @entity11 champions the cause of a moderate @entity14 , what he has been saying lately will be merely words
it has been my contention after the 2008 presidential election that the @entity14 is in desperate need of a separate entity that would have the same effect on the @entity14 as the @entity66 had on the @entity67
talk to liberal @entity67 and they will tell you the @entity66 aimed to counter the impact the rev. @entity70 had on the party after his presidential runs in 1984 and 1988 -- they feared the left dominating the party levers
so these largely white southerners , and moderate and conservative @entity67 created the @entity66 to broaden the @entity67 's reach , make it more palatable to big business , and fiscal conservatism
and who came out of this effort ? then - @entity83 gov. @entity82 , a co-founder of the @entity66 who went on to win two terms as president , and dominate the party for 16 years until president @entity87 came along
this , frankly , is what is needed in the @entity14
it would be a hell of a thing to witness @entity11 take his stature and considerable influence and band together with other liberal - to - moderate @entity14 to create an organization that represents their values and vision
like it or not , the opposition to them in the @entity14 is already organized with infrastructure and a fundraising mechanism
so to counter them , there has to be an entity that people can look to , or enlist in , to show the rest of the world that @entity11 is n't whistling in the wind , but has thousands -- or millions -- standing behind him and those who think like him
if such an organization was created , and all of a sudden you had chapters forming in states across the country , you would have the infrastructure to identify candidates to run in local and state races , and challenge the people @entity11 and others think are driving the party further into isolation as a largely southern and regional party
it 's clear the @entity14 has enormous problems in the @entity127 part of the country , and with @entity87 winning a sizeable portion of the @entity130 vote , and the party 's staunch opposition to illegal immigration , it is going to have a hell of a time in the @entity135 and @entity136
and with a fractured party , there is no better time to create an alternative that people can believe in and rally behind
on @entity15 last week , senior analyst @entity142 said there clearly is a civil war raging within the @entity14 , and @entity11 and @entity16 are on opposite sides
i chimed in that in any war , i 'd trust the guy who put on a military uniform -- @entity11 -- rather than the guy who ran from serving our country -- @entity16
@entity11 has clearly shown he is adept at leading our troops to victory on the battlefield by planning and shaping a perfect battle plan to defeat the enemy
now it 's time to see if he has the chops to do the same in the political arena , where the enemy is not as readily identifiable
there is no doubt he has the capacity to do it
it 's now a question of whether he wants to do it
as the old saying goes , you can talk the talk or walk the walk
mr. @entity11 , do you have your walking shoes on ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
