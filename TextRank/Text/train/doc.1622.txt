-- social payments are taking a giant leap forward
@entity3 has unveiled a @entity5 app that lets you send money to friends
the app , simply titled @entity10 , is just as straightforward as its name
you have the choice to send either an ecard with money or just money with no card
you select a card , choose a friend to send it to and then select how much money to send
" the @entity3 and @entity5 infrastructure have now merged , " @entity3 's @entity19 says
" this is another way to personalize the act of giving money
" while there are several ways to pay with @entity3 via @entity5 ( @entity27 comes to mind ) , this is the first app to enable peer - to - peer payments via @entity5 and @entity3
and because it 's a peer - to - peer transaction , there is no transaction fee , though @entity3 's regular limits and international fees still apply
" sending money , person to person , is free , " @entity36 product marketing manager @entity35 said
" if it 's funded by a @entity3 balance or linked to a bank account , it 's free
" and while the primary aspect of the @entity10 app is its enablement of transactions across the world 's largest social network , the ecard aspect is being emphasized as well
@entity3 was quick to point out that more than 500 million ecards are sent every year , and that 's why @entity3 is offering dozens of choices for everything from birthdays to congratulations
we can see the app really taking off
users who see on @entity5 that it 's a friend 's birthday can quickly fire up the app and send a card and some cash within a few minutes
the app is just as useful for things like lottery pools and reimbursing friends for lunch
it 's a big step toward making social payments a reality
if you want to learn more about the @entity74 , we 've created a simple walkthrough of the payment process
check it out in this gallery , and let us know what you think of the app in the comments
