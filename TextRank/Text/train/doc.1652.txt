@entity0 -- the defense attorney for one of two teenagers charged with fatally shooting a @entity6 baby in the face spoke wednesday about evidence in the case , saying speculation about the crime and evidence is complicating preparations for next month 's trial
public defender @entity15 , who represents @entity16 , said media reports have focused on " evidence selectively disclosed by the police
" the investigation and prosecution have been " heavy - handed , " he said , and " the state chooses to ignore obvious leads that are inconsistent with the state 's theory of the case
" @entity15 said he issued his four - page statement because of an overwhelming number of media inquiries , and he said it would be his last before the trial in three weeks
@entity16 and another teenager , @entity31 , have been charged with murder in the march 21 killing of 13 - month - old @entity34
they were 17 and 14 at the time , respectively
the case has drawn national attention for the horrific nature of the child 's death
the child 's mother , @entity41 , has said two teenagers approached her in the street in broad daylight
one pointed a gun at her and told her that if she did n't give him her money he would shoot her and shoot her baby
@entity50 said that the teen fired at her , hitting her in one leg and barely missing her head
the teen then shot her child in the face , she said
@entity58 's death marks 2nd time @entity6 mom loses a son to violence @entity15 said the case against his client is best described as circumstantial
" contrary to speculation by some , there is no evidence of gunshot residue on @entity69 or upon his clothing
there is no murder weapon
there is no confession , " he said in his statement
he said defense theories are evolving as the evidence develops , and he predicted further developments in the coming weeks
" much of what has been said about mr. @entity16 has been unkind , and much of that discussion has been based on false assumptions and misinformation , " he said
asked about @entity15 's statement on the gunshot residue , @entity84 , a spokesman for the @entity87 district attorney 's office , said , " we do n't have a comment on the record
" @entity94 ' mother , aunt and sister have also been arrested on various charges alleging that they have hindered the investigation
the sister , @entity99 , was named in a grand jury indictment accusing her of helping her mother get rid of the gun authorities say was used to kill the child
police found that gun in a pond more than two miles from where the shooting happened
@entity15 said more witnesses should not be afraid to come forward
@entity1 's @entity109 contributed to this report .
