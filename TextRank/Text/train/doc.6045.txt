-- @entity2 's top football clubs will resume their battles for a place in the quarterfinals of the continent 's biggest competition this month , with some still reeling after tie - changing moments of controversy
last month 's last - 16 opening legs provided bitter lessons for two @entity13 teams hoping to make their mark against benchmark opponents , and prompted calls for changes to the game 's rules
@entity21 supremacy continued , though the signs are that @entity23 will likely have at least one finalist for the third year in a row
@entity26 may provide an outside threat to the status quo , thanks in part to a mercurial talent who will sadly not be displaying his maverick talents at this year 's @entity34 in @entity35
here are the key talking points for the upcoming clashes : time for the sin - bin ? when the draw was made for the @entity41 last 16 , two ties stood out for neutrals and fans alike
@entity45 's imperious form was vanquishing all - comers , and the prospect of the @entity13 club being pitted against a stuttering @entity50 was electrifying
even the normally bullish @entity52 press were concerned
meanwhile , @entity54 's panache in @entity56 's @entity55 suggested questions could be posed for the reigning @entity59 champion @entity60
by the time the ties rolled around , @entity50 had found its feet again , while @entity54 had drifted somewhat off the boil
nevertheless , the early exchanges in both games promised fascinating double - headers
@entity50 's immense skill was gradually being tempered by @entity45 's physicality , while @entity54 hinted that it might threaten @entity60 's goal if it could just keep its composure
then two big moments turned the ties on their heads
in @entity75 , @entity45 defender @entity74 ' limitations were cruelly exposed by arguably the best player in the world , @entity76 ; in @entity79 , @entity54 goalkeeper @entity78 committed a clumsy but innocent - looking foul on @entity81
the incidents led to the reviled " triple punishment " of a penalty , a red card , and less crucially for the games themselves , an automatic ban for both players
as contests , both matches -- and very probably the ties -- were effectively ended
aside from the debate over whether @entity74 ' foul was committed inside the penalty area , the letter of the law was followed in both cases
but as many have since argued , the games were ruined as a result , and certainly in @entity54 's case the punishment brutally outweighed the crime
on march 1 , football 's lawmakers , the @entity106 , met to debate the idea of a " sin - bin " -- something already employed effectively in rugby and ice hockey -- and ultimately rejected it
but it did sanction the continued experiment of sin - bins in recreational youth football
while controversial , and arguably open to abuse by cynical defenders , a sin - bin would offer referees an extra layer of discretion , and paying spectators a better chance of seeing 22 players complete a game
in the high - stakes environment of @entity41 football it could be a welcome addition to the rule book
@entity56 's @entity55 fluffs its lines on the big stage with the exception of @entity133 , sent so forcefully back to the drawing board by @entity135 that embattled manager @entity137 ' head probably crashed through it , each of the @entity55 clubs could take a little solace from disappointing first - leg performances
@entity45 , having withstood an initial @entity50 barrage , seemed to be finding some rhythm before that red - card handicap came into play
@entity147 may need counseling to banish the trauma of his first - half penalty miss , but at least @entity54 had started to threaten the visiting @entity151
@entity152 also looked relatively comfortable before @entity154 's absent - mindedness in the six - yard box let @entity156 back into the tie
nevertheless , like the curate 's egg , these good - in - parts performances all left a sour tinge on the lips
@entity152 will rue not going for the jugular when the @entity165 home side was reeling , while @entity167 's striking options continue to -- rather publicly -- vex the @entity168
his team should still go through , though , but this performance did not impress
while refereeing decisions may have helped @entity60 and @entity50 coast to their respective 2 - 0 victories , their ability to retain the ball -- such an important skill at this level -- was at times startlingly superior
the idea of an unsophisticated @entity55 , lacking the tactical nous and basic skills to thrive at this level , may be less true than it once was , but @entity45 and @entity54 still have a way to go before they can match these hugely impressive opponents
do n't write off @entity50 and @entity185 , but @entity60 still favorite with the @entity52 giants beset by financial scandal and facing an unusually tough challenge on the home front , @entity50 's star looked to be on the wane in 2014
likewise , it is not often that @entity185 plays second fiddle to city rival @entity194 , but this year there is a genuine threat to its hegemony from the @entity198
both teams , however , look to be slipping back into their respective grooves
@entity50 warmed up for the first - leg clash with @entity45 by thrashing @entity202 6 - 0 , while back - to - back 3 - 0 wins over struggling @entity204 and @entity205 showed @entity185 's cool efficiency
against @entity45 , @entity50 reminded the world of its precocious talent
yes the red card ended the @entity13 side 's chances of rising to the challenge , but @entity50 's metronomic passing and accurate finishing showed just how tough an opponent this team can be
it will be interesting to see how @entity218 's team bounce back from saturday 's setback against @entity220
real , meanwhile , was irresistible in its 6 - 1 humiliation of @entity222 in @entity23 , and leads the @entity21 league after sunday 's win over @entity225
if @entity45 's prospects for the second leg show only the barest twitches of life , @entity222 's are not even worth a memorial service
but then we have @entity60
there is a sense that @entity234 has , after only the barest hint of teething trouble , got this team playing exactly the way he wishes
added to the muscular intensity of @entity60 's previous incarnation are a fluidity and impudence that characterized the best performances of @entity234 's @entity50 side
it is very hard to see how the @entity23 could be improved
embarrassingly unchallenged in the @entity248 , there is little to suggest that " @entity60 " will not be sewing yet another @entity41 star above the club badge in may
two - speed @entity41 makes things too predictable the @entity41 may be the pinnacle of club football , but survey the last - 16 second - leg ties and it is difficult to suppress a feeling of disappointment
with very few exceptions , the quarterfinals look pretty much set
just as the group stages generally went the way of the obvious , the tournament 's big seeds are rolling into the next round with only minor distractions en route
@entity2 's top club competition remains controversial for the way in which it perpetuates the status quo
without massive independent injections of cash from outside the game it is difficult to see this changing anytime soon
arguably only @entity277 has realistic hopes of breaking into the tight group of winners this year
it has to be a concern for @entity2 , and the tv rights holders that may struggle to entice neutrals to their screens again before the quarterfinals
whether anything can be done about it longer term , however , is another question
@entity291 is a genius in a world in which sporting stars can sometimes be anodyne and uninspiring , @entity293 striker @entity291 smashes the mold to smithereens
his swagger and apparent arrogance would be laughable if he did not so regularly back them up , but his continuing ability to underscore words with deeds is extraordinary
at @entity277 he is playing in a competition -- the @entity26 @entity304 -- that rarely stretches his talents and in a team that is built to serve him , so the best measure of his greatness is in the @entity41
once again , he did not disappoint
@entity291 's second goal against @entity311 went viral before the final whistle had even sounded , and with good reason
the fact that he will not be playing in the @entity315 is a huge loss to football .
