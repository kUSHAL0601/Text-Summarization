-- comedians @entity1 and @entity2 , the brains behind the hit @entity5 sketch show " @entity8 , " joked that president @entity6 is the idol black nerds have longed for and needed
" @entity6 was the best thing for black nerds everywhere
finally we had a role model , " @entity2 humorously told reporters recently
" before @entity6 , we basically had @entity14
" black nerds , aka " blerds , " is a way to describe @entity20 - @entity19 intellectuals in a time when it 's finally cool to be something other than an athlete or rapper
" there have long been @entity20 - @entity19 intellectuals , " said @entity27 professor @entity26 , whose new genealogical show , " finding your roots with @entity26 , " debuted last sunday on @entity31
" the difference with my generation and those after is that there are more of us in the spotlight , " @entity26 said
" with my @entity31 specials , i drew a record 25 million viewers
i would n't have been able to do that without the platform i have
" " it 's good to see black intellectuals do well , " he said
" we as a people are a whole range of things , and we 're finally starting to see that reflected in the media
" because there is a growing number of prominent and successful people considered blerds such as president @entity6 , @entity26 and astrophysicist and @entity31 star @entity56 , tv viewers are starting to see more and more blerd - type characters on their favorite comedies and even children 's programs
@entity62 , aka dj @entity62 from @entity64 's " @entity63 ! " is a total blerd
the list also includes comedic actor @entity67 from " @entity68 " on @entity69 ; @entity71 from @entity73 's " @entity72 " and " @entity74 " star @entity70 on @entity75
" i 'm a black nerd and that was illegal until 2003 , " joked @entity76 in one of his @entity5 standup specials
@entity76 has also started blending his nerdy habits in with that of his " @entity85 " character , @entity84
a comedian and a former writer for " @entity88 , " @entity76 has created a whole stand - up act trumpeting blerds like the president and rapper @entity91
" @entity94 , specific stuff -- that 's what makes a nerd a nerd , " @entity76 has explained during his bit
" @entity91 is a black nerd
if you go up to @entity91 and say ' hey , what are your favorite things ? ' he 'd be like ' robots and @entity105
' " " that 's a nerd
" similar observations have been made by comedian and actor @entity109 ( a guest star on @entity75 's " @entity110 " )
like @entity76 , @entity109 has created a new brand of dorky , self - deprecating humor that is completely different than that of their comedy predecessors , @entity116 and @entity117
" it 's fashionable to wear bowties and be educated , " said @entity118 , a tv content producer for @entity120 " it 's part of multiculturalism and with everything blending together , there 's a certain subset of ( black nerd life ) that 's becoming cool right now
" nerds are cool right now in general and that 's certainly an aspect
" @entity118 said the rise in characters such as @entity133 ( @entity70 ) on " @entity74 " is also the result of color - blind casting
" @entity70 ' character would n't necessarily be a black character the way it was written , " @entity118 said
" he 's fantastic and that helped him get cast but i also think once you get people from different cultures coming in , and taking roles that may not have been written for them , you see this type of advancement
" twenty years ago , it would 've been out of place to have this character there because it was n't happening culturally
" @entity67 , who also does standup , said his blerd character @entity159 " was @entity155 in the @entity157 book the show is based on
@entity157 also created the tv show and @entity161 is a medical student
" i like that they were open to different people coming in and going against type , " @entity67 said of the show 's producers
" i 've been @entity167 , but i 'd never been a member of a cast
" @entity169 , plays a blerd on the @entity172 comedy " @entity173
" he said his character cash is into " @entity178 " way more than he is in real life , in spite of the fact that he owns not one but two " @entity178 " @entity183 sets
" up until now , black nerds were n't being celebrated , " @entity169 said
" we 've seen the thug , the athlete , the rapper and the comedic best friend
" it 's cool to be uncool
