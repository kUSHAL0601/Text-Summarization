-- we each spend an average of three years of our lives sitting on them , @entity1 of @entity2 died while on his in 1760 and 2.5 billion people still do not have access to one
the humble lavatory is the unlikely subject of global celebration on monday , as one of the world 's most essential inventions but one that too many people still struggle without
although many of us tend to take ours for granted , campaigners hope that @entity20 will draw attention to what they 're calling the " global sanitation crisis , " with over a third of people worldwide living without a clean and private place to go
this means that one in three people still have to defecate in the open , using fields or bushes , rivers , railway lines or roadsides , or simply a plastic bag
others use unsanitary latrines or disease - ridden and foul - smelling buckets
the majority of those without access to a toilet live in @entity43 or @entity44 , with over half of people in @entity44 not having proper sanitation , according to the @entity49 - based charity , @entity48
@entity50 lives in a slum in the city of @entity53 in the @entity55 province of @entity56
she told @entity48 how people in her community have to defecate on a nearby hilltop
" there are no trees and privacy at the moment and so we have to wait until night to go there
it 's difficult for old people to go and it 's hard to go at night
it 's also hard for grown - up girls because of the risk of sexual attack , " @entity50 said
this @entity20 , international aid agencies are highlighting the particular risks to women of poor access to toilets
@entity48 says women are most vulnerable because they 're not only exposed to disease , but also have additional shame , harassment and risk of attack when they go out in the open
@entity84 in @entity85 described to @entity48 how she has to cross a very dangerous bridge every time she goes to the bush to defecate
" i think it takes 15 minutes to get to the bridge , " @entity89 says
" i come here once a day , between 4 and 5 pm
at night it is very dangerous
a woman and a boy were killed with knives
one woman i know of has been raped
" but it 's not just the shame and inconvenience of having no private place to go to the toilet , but a huge public health issue
when you consider that one gram of faeces can contain 10 million viruses , one million bacteria , one thousand parasite cysts and one hundred worm eggs ( according to @entity110 ) you can see why open defecation is so harmful to a community 's health
without a sewerage system to remove human waste and make it safe , cholera , typhoid and other infectious diseases spread quickly
the @entity120 says more than 2.7 million people die each year due to lack of sanitation
with diarrhoeal diseases killing more young children in developing countries than hiv / aids , malaria and measles put together , it 's the second biggest cause of death in under fives , according to the @entity132
tackling it , says the @entity135 's @entity134 , is extremely cost effective
it estimates that poor sanitation costs @entity139 countries around $ 5.5 billion a year and $ 53.8 billion in @entity56 is lost through associated economic impacts
the program 's study of 18 @entity139 countries found that even the time it takes people to find a discrete location to use the toilet accounted for almost $ 500 million in economic losses
that 's before you examine the cost of healthcare , premature deaths and lost workdays due to illness
in fact , according to the @entity20 organization , every dollar invested in sanitation yields a return of five dollars
its message is that the solution to the global sanitation crisis lies not in any miraculous technological breakthroughs but in stronger political leadership and a commitment to invest in sanitation infrastructure and education
@entity171 for one seemed to recognized the value of the toilet to humanity when he said " sanitation is more important than independence
" campaigners for @entity20 will be hoping that these words resonate with today 's leaders .
