@entity0 , @entity1 -- the wrecked @entity4 cruise ship has begun its final voyage
salvage crews refloated the ship last week so they can move it from its resting place off @entity0 to the @entity1 port of @entity11 to be dismantled
on wednesday morning , the rusting hulk set off into open waters under tow
attached to its sides are the huge steel hollow boxes , or sponsons , that were pumped full of compressed air to give the ship buoyancy
it 's been more than 2Â½ years since the ship ran aground off @entity0 with more than 4,200 passengers aboard , killing 32 people in a disaster that drew global attention
the vessel will be towed -- slowly and carefully -- approximately 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) to @entity11 , where it will be broken up
a convoy of 17 boats will travel along with it
the ship is expected to arrive in @entity11 on sunday
it 'll take about two years to dismantle the massive cruise liner
environmental concerns prompted the decision to undertake the expensive and difficult process of refloating the @entity4 rather than taking it apart on site
since the wreck two years ago , 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture , dishes , food , personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed
the @entity4 is the largest salvage ever attempted -- and the most expensive , at a cost of $ 1.5 billion so far
