@entity0 , @entity1 -- jurors began deliberations wednesday in the case of @entity6 , the second man to be tried in connection with a deadly @entity1 home invasion in 2007
a day before , the jurors heard lawyers ' final pleas in the case as prosecutors cast @entity14 , 31 , as the instigator of the attack , while the defense insisted " he did not want anyone to die
" the trial has gone on for a little over three weeks , during which time jurors heard emotional testimony detailing the deaths of @entity6 and her daughters -- 17 - year - old @entity6 and 11 - year - old @entity6
after closing arguments wrapped up tuesday , judge @entity27 started walking jurors through the 17 charges facing @entity14 , including three counts of murder , four counts of kidnapping , burglary , arson and assault
if convicted , he could receive the death penalty
the judge got through 45 of 48 pages detailing the charges late tuesday afternoon before sending the jury home
@entity6 , the first defendant to stand trial , was sentenced to death in december 2010 after a jury convicted him on 16 of 17 charges
as closing arguments began tuesday , prosecutor @entity45 told jurors , " once @entity14 and @entity6 completed their plan , where there was a family , there were three corpses
" prosecutors allege that @entity6 and @entity14 went into the @entity55 home , beat and tied up dr. @entity6 , raped and strangled his wife , molested one of their daughters , and set the house on fire before attempting to flee
the two daughters , who were both tied to their beds , died of smoke inhalation
before assaulting and killing @entity55 , @entity6 forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $ 15,000 from an account after finding evidence the account held between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 , authorities said
@entity45 recounted for jurors tuesday the ways in which @entity14 aided @entity6 during the crime , including driving him to the @entity73 home , helping him beat @entity6 and helping him restrain other family members
" make no mistake about it , this intrusion into the @entity55 home was mr. @entity14 's idea , " @entity45 said
defense lawyer @entity79 stressed to jurors that his client did n't enter the @entity81 home with a lethal weapon
@entity14 , in his view , did n't kill @entity6 when he had the chance , and he closed doors to the girls ' room to buy them time to survive the fire
@entity14 was contrasted with @entity6 , whom @entity79 claimed strangled @entity6 , then lit the fatal fire
" he did not intend that anyone should die , " @entity79 said of @entity14
on monday , a 90 - minute tape of @entity14 's police confession was played for jurors
he told authorities he followed @entity55 and her youngest daughter home after seeing them in a shopping center parking lot
he said he started thinking the @entity55 home was " very nice
" @entity14 said in the confession he was beating @entity6 with a baseball bat when " he let out this unearthly scream
i kept hitting him until he finally backed up into a corner of the couch
... he quieted down and was just staring at me with open eyes , just sheer confusion
" but he also denied killing anyone , saying that @entity6 " pulled me to the side " and said , " ' we got ta kill them and burn the house down
' i 'm like , ' i 'm not killing anyone , there 's no way
there 's not a problem
' " @entity6 addressed the media after tuesday 's courtroom session , admitting he was bothered by the defense 's strategy -- including its claim that his escape from the house may have precipitated the chain of events that led to the three deaths , or that things may not have unfolded as they did if @entity55 had acted differently
@entity2 's @entity132 contributed to this report .
