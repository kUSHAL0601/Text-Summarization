-- @entity1 has revoked or denied press credentials for @entity0 journalists in the country , following the president 's announcement he would expel @entity0 if it did not " rectify " its coverage of anti-government protests
" they want to show the world that there is a civil war in @entity1 , " president @entity9 said thursday in a televised speech
anti-government protests have become a daily occurrence in the country , and clashes with security forces or pro-government supporters have resulted in at least eight deaths , officials said
what @entity0 is not showing , @entity9 said , is " the people working , studying , building the homeland
" " enough war propaganda
i do not accept war propaganda against @entity1
if they do not rectify things , get out of @entity1 , @entity0 , get out , " @entity9 said , to applause from his pro-government audience
" fuera ! @entity32 ! " people in the crowd shouted -- " out ! out ! " hours later , government officials notified seven journalists for @entity37 and @entity38 that their press accreditation had been denied or revoked
@entity0 teams from outside @entity1 were told to book flights back to their home countries
@entity9 described @entity0 's journalists with some of the same adjectives he uses for his political opponents
" a group of fascists with their aggressions want to take us away from peace , " @entity9 said
" they are not going to do that
and we are going to show them
" when members of the @entity56 were told their credentials were denied , they were asked several times when they would be leaving the country
while the journalists were asked to leave , @entity37 and @entity0 en @entity61 continue to broadcast in @entity1
@entity0 has repeatedly asked for a meeting with officials , and a @entity0 reporter has been invited to a news conference where @entity9 will speak later friday afternoon
@entity0 en @entity61 's correspondent in @entity67 was also invited to the event
" @entity0 has reported both sides of the tense situation in @entity1 , even with very limited access to government officials , " @entity0 en @entity61 said in a statement , adding that at the time its credentials were revoked , @entity0 was seeking an interview with the president
" we hope the government will reconsider its decision
meanwhile , we will continue reporting on @entity1 in the fair , accurate and balanced manner we are known for
" a top legislative leader for the ruling party said the government will investigate the allegations against @entity0 , and will not " tremble in acting against those who make an attempt against the motherland
" the move to revoke @entity0 's press credentials comes after weeks of protests that mark the largest demonstrations @entity9 has faced in his 11 months in power following the death of president @entity94
government authorities and opposition leaders have blamed each other for deaths resulting from the violence
@entity100 , an opposition leader in @entity1 , faces arson and conspiracy charges in connection with the unrest
@entity100 , who has denied the charges , is being held in a military prison outside @entity67
@entity1 also expelled three @entity108 diplomats this week , accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government -- an accusation that the @entity111 has repeatedly denied .
