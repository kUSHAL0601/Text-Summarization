-- what level of privacy will we have online in the future ? will people share their personal data freely in exchange for more customized service ? or will they become fiercely protective of private information , using tools and browsers that protect their identity from advertisers and other third parties ? privacy experts from @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have been tackling these big questions this week at the @entity22 security conference in @entity23
public changes to privacy policies , like the ones that make news when @entity16 or @entity17 change their settings , are just a small part of the story
behind the scenes , these companies have full - time staffs of privacy experts , lawyers and engineers who are juggling an array of privacy demands
in addition to what the users expect , there are government regulations , industry standards and rules that vary across operating systems
companies that provide free services , such as search engines or social networks , have to strike the right balance between respecting their customers ' privacy concerns and serving advertisers
" it 's important and easy for everyone to acknowledge that much of the incredible growth of the @entity61 today has been fueled by advertising , " said @entity56 , @entity17 's senior privacy counsel
" i believe that will continue to be true
" for web titans , the money still flows in from advertisers , not consumers
@entity16 made $ 4.2 billion , or 84 % of its revenue , from online advertising in 2012
@entity17 saw $ 43.6 billion in advertising last year , accounting for almost 95 % of the company 's revenue
customers ' leverage they may not be paying for the services directly , but customers still have a lot of power -- and companies know that they need to listen
people can switch to another browser , ditch @entity16 and go back to writing e-mails , stop googling and start @entity84
and privacy is becoming more and more important to them
" @entity88 is increasingly becoming a feature , " said @entity87 , @entity19 's chief privacy officer
the customer demand for stronger data controls led to the introduction of the " do not track " feature
" do not track " is a setting that can be now found on all the major browsers : @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99
when turned on , it asks sites not to track that person 's online activities
a @entity19 survey found that 75 % of people were concerned about online tracking and thought the setting should be turned on by default
" do not track " seems like a clear , smart option to give consumers , but it has has been difficult to enforce
there are talks under way by the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) , an international organization that develops standards for the @entity117 , to make it official
however , advertisers and other third parties are pushing back
changes to consumers ' data , like " do not track , " can come at the expense of advertisers , creating friction
when @entity18 recently announced that it was testing a feature that disabled third - party cookies by default in its @entity96 browser , the general counsel for the @entity129 called it " a nuclear first strike " against the ad industry on @entity135
" we ca n't just sit back and allow the industry to just continue to ignore a core component of the user experience online , " said @entity136 , @entity18 's global privacy and public policy leader
the issues will become only more complex in the future , when small sensors and devices that can track things like location , fitness and environment become ubiquitous
the more devices that connect to the @entity61 , from smart cars to home thermostats , the more data there are about a person to collect
location data are already being tagged on to photos , tweets and other online actions when people use their mobile phones
for many people , they are considered private data , whether they show where someone is at that exact moment or where they 've been over time
" how can you take the data , make it less sensitive but still make it of value to the user ? " asked @entity87
balancing privacy and usefulness according to the panelists , personal data such as location have many potentially positive uses , for individuals as well as advertisers
consider the wealth of location - based tools already in use , such as food recommendations , social apps and dating services
there will probably be future options that strike a balance between sharing information and cutting off all data
not everyone will want the same level of privacy , so options and customization will have to be made available
people could share their location information on a case - by - case basis but still stay anonymous
they might choose to have a persistent anonymous id for location - based services , so that their location history and other data can be used without connecting them to a specific person
it 's also possible that over the next five to 10 years , people 's attitudes toward privacy and their data will change , and they 'll be willing to share more personal information , attached to their real - world identity , in exchange for more heavily customized computing experiences
" you do n't want to punish the user who cares about privacy by saying , ' give it up or do n't participate , ' " @entity136 said
for the people who do n't want to share at all , one option floated at the panel was to charge for the services and jettison the ads. this kind of either / or option is popping up in the mobile - app world and with services like @entity230
free versions come with ads , but for a price , people can upgrade to the ad - free experience
a paid subscription option is unlikely to come to the big services people are used to getting for free , such as @entity16
@entity239 , @entity16 's chief privacy officer , said that one of the chief requests from users is that the company never charge for the service
the lengthy privacy policies , thick with legalese , that most services use now will never go away , but better controls will probably emerge
whatever the tools are used to protect and collect personal data in the future , it will be important for companies like @entity16 and @entity17 to educate their consumers and to provide them with options for all levels of privacy .
