-- @entity2 veterans know when a bad one 's coming
it 's like those who feel the barometric pressure drop of approaching storm systems in their bones
i got the vibe midweek
so i asked my friends on the @entity13 , hardy survivors of @entity15 , what advice they would share with those in @entity19 's path
but i did n't want the usual flashlight , batteries , water , generator , gasoline tips
tell them something they do n't know , i asked , something that helped get you through
here 's what they said : outdoor solar lights can be brought in at night to light the indoors
when you make a video of your home for insurance purposes beforehand , open drawers and closets so the contents are visible
have a tire plug repair kit and pliers to pull out nails or screws , since debris in the roadway causes flats and leaks that are tough to repair when everything is closed
extend your cell phone battery 's life by texting instead of calling and turning off @entity54 / @entity53 connections
bank safes and safe deposit boxes are not waterproof
during flooding , items left in them may be damaged and not accessible for weeks
have thick tarps and roofing tacks in case you lose shingles from the wind
what i did n't expect was the advice of a different nature that many added after their practical tips : faith and the knowledge that no matter what , your life and the life of your family is more important than any material possession you may have
keep a positive attitude and help your neighbor ! remember to have patience with your family , friends and neighbors
... work together and share your resources
some of the best relationships were made in the aftermath of @entity15 , as neighbors discovered new friends next door and grew closer helping one another through a trying time
keep a hurricane preparation checklist these are heartfelt suggestions from those who know what it 's like to lose everything all at once
disaster has a way of focusing the mind and leveling the playing field
doctors and bankers stood next to mechanics and janitors in food lines in my @entity13 hometown of @entity111 , @entity13 , in the weeks after @entity15
such brutal shocks to the system are inevitable
no one can stop them , though human beings prefer to imagine we are omnipotent
we have access to virtually anything with the click of a mouse or a tap on our smartphones
we can skype with someone on the other side of the world
we can land a rover on @entity128 and find proof of ancient rivers
we can do anything -- except control @entity132
we do n't like that , because it forces us to accept that we are vulnerable
@entity136 , states , cities and individuals wisely invest time and money on prevention efforts , but we ca n't really predict when , where and how the effects of nature at its worst will be felt
what we can control is our reaction
and researchers report that contrary to popular myth , during disasters most people do n't adopt an " every man for himself " attitude
most react with responsibility and concern for their neighbors
i have seen it myself , over decades covering blizzards , floods , hurricanes and more
nearly five years after @entity15 , i was present at a remarkable discussion between the mayor of @entity111 and his wife
most of the town 's homes and businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed in 2005 when the monster storm 's 30 - foot surge , sustained 125 mph winds and hopscotching tornadoes roared through
but the town and its people recovered
it really was , " said @entity177 of the spirit of kindness , generosity and selflessness that prevailed in the months after the hurricane
" it would be nice to reclaim some of that patience and understanding
i wish we could go back to it
" " i feel bad saying it , but i really miss it , " agreed his wife jan. " we were all so close
" times of disaster reveal not just our human fragility , but our strengths
it is at times like this that we learn what we are made of
people come together , share what they have and accept help from others
suddenly differences that once seemed insurmountable turn out to be quite insignificant
the worst of times can bring out the best
@entity2 safety : when the lights go out the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .
