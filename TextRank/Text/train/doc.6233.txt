-- @entity1 paid the ultimate price for failing to deliver trophies at @entity4 last season , being sacked by the @entity8 club 's billionaire owner @entity6 just hours after a defeat on the final day
the @entity10 is determined to avoid a similar fate at @entity12 by guiding the big - spending @entity14 club back into the @entity15 -- a competition where success proves ever elusive for @entity6 -- for the first time since 2004
@entity1 replaced the sacked @entity19 at the @entity20 in december , with @entity12 sitting top of @entity14 's @entity22
his appointment has been just one of many changes aimed at boosting the club 's profile since the @entity28 became @entity12 's majority shareholder in may 2011
the 52 - year - old inherited an expensively - assembled squad including @entity33 playmaker @entity32 , who signed from @entity10 's @entity34 for a @entity14 record transfer fee
" the aim is to play the @entity15 next year , " @entity1 , who won @entity38 club football 's biggest prize as a player and coach with @entity41 , told @entity0
" i found the club at the top of the league and so i have to try to do the best to keep the club at the top of the league until the end of the season
but the aim is to play in the @entity15
" @entity1 fell out of favor at @entity53 after failing to follow up the glory of his first season in charge , when he oversaw @entity4 's first @entity58 and @entity59 double
after leading the @entity60 to second place in the league , he was axed in favor of one of football 's rising stars -- former @entity68 coach @entity67
the 34 - year - old is now himself in danger of losing his job , having overseen @entity4 's worst run of results since @entity6 took charge in 2004 , and is reportedly facing a player revolt over his team selections
the @entity60 are outside the qualification spots for next year 's @entity15 , and their hopes in this season 's competition hang by a thread after losing 3 - 1 in the first leg of the last - 16 tie away to @entity84 on tuesday
villas - @entity67 was heavily criticized for starting with experienced @entity86 duo of @entity87 and @entity88 and @entity90 's @entity89 on the subs ' bench in @entity93 -- players who were key figures during @entity1 's time at @entity4
" i think the problem at @entity4 was that they tried to change something , to have a team younger , to give less matches to the most important players @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity102 , " @entity1 said
" but i think that this change needed time because it is very difficult to substitute players like @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity102 because they are the players in @entity4
" @entity1 's coaching staff at @entity12 includes former @entity4 midfielder @entity106 , who won two @entity58 titles in @entity108 under coach @entity109 before moving to the @entity14 capital in 2008
" it makes me sad when i see @entity4 like this , " the 39 - year - old said
" in a team , you ca n't change five or six players
" now @entity4 lose a lot with a lot of experienced players on the bench
" fifth - placed @entity4 will seek to end a run of five games without a win in all competitions in the league match against @entity128 on saturday , while @entity22 leaders @entity12 travel to sixth - placed @entity131 with a one - point advantage over @entity133 .
