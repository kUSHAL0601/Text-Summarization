-- @entity1 is an all - action conservationist
the 60 - year - old @entity3 grew up in small towns in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 and developed an affinity with nature from an early age
" i grew up in the @entity3 bush and i formed an early relationship with the @entity3 bush which has stayed with me , " he told @entity0
" as i 've grown older i 've watched the deterioration [ of the natural world ] , and it really concerns me
" he took action to become a conservationist and created his own game reserve in @entity3 's @entity21 region , but he 's also taken his passion across borders
hiring a car from @entity25 he drove into @entity26 during the war there in 2003 to rescue animals from @entity30 zoo
he admits it was more naivete rather than bravery , but once he had managed to get the zoo under some sort of control ( which had only around 30 animals left ) , he ventured out to save even more animals
" @entity38 had lions that were rumored to be man - eaters , that he 'd fed them love rivals and things like that
the whole of @entity30 was talking about it back then
it was n't the lions ' fault ; they 're just lions
i refused to let anyone harm them , and thankfully they are still alive today , " he said
returning to @entity3 in 2004 he set up the @entity57 and expanded his international conservation efforts
he prepared a document that was presented to the @entity60 as a draft resolution to make all wildlife parks and conservation areas protected in times of war and their abuse classified as a war crime
in 2006 he reportedly met with the @entity69 rebel organization the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) in 2006 while they were involved in the bitter civil war in the @entity71
@entity1 reportedly persuaded them to protect endangered species such as the northern white rhinoceros
" they were very hospitable , " @entity1 said
" i found out that the rhino was the spiritual totem of the tribes that they came from and they thought there were hundreds and hundreds of rhinos , and there were n't
" creating relationships with people has been just as important as cultivating refuges for animals
after years of negotiation with the local chief of the land next to @entity1 's reserve , he was able to persuade the local community to convert their own land into conservation areas , so they too could benefit from eco-tourism
" i do n't think i have a mission in life , " he said
" i just want to hold together the values that are important to us as human beings
the name of the game is to survive and we ca n't survive without the plant and animal kingdoms
