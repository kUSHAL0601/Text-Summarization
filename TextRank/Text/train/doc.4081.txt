-- @entity1 has photographed 10 wars
he 's captured violence in @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7
but his recent week taking pictures of rebels in @entity10 was the most intense , frightening experience of his career
he compares it to @entity5 when he was embedded in 2010 with the @entity14
" if there 's a fight , the @entity16 soldiers are trained ; they 're going to protect you
they are skilled in combat and can fight back , " he said
" in @entity10 , anything goes
the rebels want you to tell the story , but what they do n't tell you is if something bad happens , they spread out
" for me , the stress level was high at all times
" @entity32 's photos of rebels and refugees fleeing @entity10 by dark @entity1 , a 33 - year - old @entity36 , worked with @entity38 photojournalist @entity37 , whose @entity10 contacts helped lead them across the @entity42 border into @entity10
they spent one week photographing rebels -- many just ordinary @entity10 who 've taken up arms -- as they battle military forces loyal to president @entity46
@entity10 has been locked for more than a year in a bloody conflict that began when protesters started demanding that @entity46 relinquish power
the movement grew out of the @entity51 , a larger phenomenon across the @entity52 and @entity53 in which @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity7 successfully protested for the removal of their leaders in 2011
in @entity10 , opposition forces report that as many as 10,000 people have died since march 2011
it 's been incredibly difficult to know for certain what is happening in @entity10 because @entity46 has banned journalists from entering the country to cover the conflict
several journalists who have gotten in to cover the violence have been wounded or killed
" i wanted to go , " he said
@entity1 , @entity69 and the @entity10 who helped them cross into the country had to move at night in pitch blackness , walking seven miles to a village where rebels and their families were hiding
they trudged over mountainous , rocky soil carrying their equipment , their heads hurting with worry that they could trip mines scattered along the border
" there 's a lot of fighting in the mountains
[ we heard ] machine - gun fire , " said @entity1
" the problem with that is you really do n't know what 's going on and who 's who
you have no idea if you 're going to be able to get out [ of @entity10 ] once you 're inside
" when they came to the rebels ' village , they saw houses made of stone and concrete
@entity1 relied on the contacts who helped them make it to the village to do the introductions
neither he nor @entity37 speaks @entity106
the villagers assumed from @entity1 's accent that he was @entity16
though he went to college in @entity111 and lives in @entity112 , the photographer never would have brought up his ties to the @entity114 , he said
" i never told anybody i have an @entity114 background
that 's a big no - no , " he said
if he had , the rebels ' families would still help him out of kindness but " they would n't like you as much
" " you have to remember these people are conservative muslims and @entity114 is still a problem for them , even though they wish @entity114 would help them , " he said
the @entity10 took to calling @entity1 " @entity126 , " the photographer said with a laugh
though the families were incredibly poor , they generously gave @entity1 and @entity69 a little rice , hummus and pita bread
@entity1 got most of his shots by using their homes as shelter
" you 're hiding a lot in houses and rooms , " he said
" you ca n't really [ for safety reasons ] get out and photograph as much as you 'd like to
" as the days went on , the photographer noticed that he rarely saw many rebels together at one time
they came by in small groups -- maybe a dozen at once
" that 's because they are retreating , " @entity1 said
" they are losing this war
they do n't have the equipment to stop the [ @entity153 ]
" he managed to photograph one rebel riding his horse as other fighters napped nearby on a woven rug , their guns propped against a concrete wall
@entity1 stood close to another rebel to get a shot of the young man , cigarette dangling from his mouth , pointing his gun toward an area where @entity10 snipers were positioned
shortly after photographing this exhausted fighter , the photojournalist started to get a bad feeling
his gut told him that he 'd pressed his luck enough
" we told our contact on the ground that we want to get out of here , " he said
" we said we 're done with our work
" @entity1 's instincts were dead on
just days later , the @entity10 military decimated the nearby town of @entity182 , once a rebel stronghold
@entity1 and @entity69 began their journey out of @entity10 by simply walking in the direction of the border , accompanied by the people who had helped get them inside the country
eventually they connected with their helpers ' families who were trying to flee into @entity42
again , they had to hike in complete darkness
occasionally , when the time seemed right , @entity1 asked one of the refugees to hold up a flashlight so he could take a photo
at one point , he captured a little boy in motion wearing a bright green sweater adorned with a heart and the word " happy
" one of the @entity10 fathers traveling with them had two babies and could n't both hold the infants and grasp trees as he navigated through the darkness
so the man handed @entity1 one of the babies and the photographer held the child as he struggled across the hilly terrain
the group reached a camp and were able to get in the back of a truck that drove them a final 500 yards to the @entity42 border
@entity1 remembers seeing the @entity42 towers come into view
" you 're relieved , " he said
" you do n't even care if the @entity42 army catches you
you know you 're safe by then
