-- @entity1 stretched his lead in the world championship standings with a peerless drive from pole position to win the @entity7 @entity6 at @entity8
the 30 - year - old @entity9 was claiming his third victory of the season for @entity12 after wins in @entity14 and the @entity15
he came home just under four seconds clear of the two - time defending champion @entity17 in his @entity18
but @entity17 was demoted to fifth for running off the track as he overtook @entity21 's @entity20 on the penultimate lap of 67
he was handed a 20 second penalty by race stewards to leave @entity25 's @entity20 in second place and @entity28 's @entity27 ( @entity29 ) in the final podium position
@entity31 of @entity32 was promoted to fourth , with @entity34 teammate @entity33 ( @entity35 ) in sixth
home hero and seven - time champion @entity36 was seventh for @entity38 ahead of @entity18 's @entity39 , who lost ground in the title race
@entity7 @entity42 , who was ninth for @entity43 , and his compatriot @entity44 , in the second @entity38 , completed the points scoring
2008 world champion @entity46 ( @entity21 ) saw his title chances further recede after being forced to retire after a puncture picked up from track debris
it followed an early collision between @entity12 number two @entity53 and @entity55 @entity54 of @entity29
for @entity1 , a third world title beckons after stretching his lead to 34 points over @entity59 's @entity39 , with @entity17 in third , but 10 points further adrift
" we 'll enjoy the win , " said @entity1
" starting on pole was the key factor because it was difficult to overtake and we were not the fastest but we kept the position
" @entity17 told the post-race press conference that he had not intended to hinder @entity20 as he overtook the @entity68
" the last thing you want to do is make contact
when we were side - by - side , i tried to give him enough room -- but it 's difficult to see
we were all struggling with tires , @entity77 in particular , which is why i was able to pass him
