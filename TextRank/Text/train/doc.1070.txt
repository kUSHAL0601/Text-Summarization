@entity1 , @entity0 -- sports researchers have found that body shape is a key ingredient to success for footballers
a study has found tall footballers like @entity10 are more likely to succeed
the study compared official @entity13 data from the the 1970s , 1980s , 1990s and between 2003 to 2004 to reach its conclusions
it was authored by professor @entity16 , a lecturer at the @entity17 , @entity18
@entity16 told @entity2 tall , lean players like @entity0 star @entity10 , @entity20 and @entity21 are the most successful -- and went as far to suggest that talent scouts should consider looking for this body type when searching for new recruits
more than 800 players were assessed for the research , and whether the player was in a top six team or not , at the end of each season was used as a measure for success , as they were more likely to be playing in @entity34 competitions , @entity16 said
do taller players make better footballers ? tell us what you think recent analysis also showed that players in more successful teams were taller , more linear , and younger than those from less successful teams , he said
this assertion from the research suggests that the top teams in the @entity50 and other major competitions would be more likely to win if they have taller , leaner and younger team members
" successful teams appear to have players nearly two years younger on average than other teams , " he said
@entity16 told @entity2 the findings linked in to how the game of football had changed in recent decades
" the less successful teams today are characterized as being a bit more muscular
however , in the 1980s , this was linked with more success
" i 'm quite convinced that the younger , lighter , more nimble and also taller players are more capable of making the finishing touches today , " he said
@entity16 said there were several reasons why the taller player had advantages
" apart from the fact that taller players will be more successful at heading the ball both defensively and in attack , they will be able to close down or limit opposition players ' ability to pass and distribute the ball
" furthermore , taller , thinner people are able to dissipate heat more rapidly than shorter , heavier people
" players had also increased in size over the study period , @entity16 said
" the results of the study show that professional footballers are getting taller and heavier per decade , with a small but significant rise in the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) over the four decades
" despite the findings , @entity16 said it was not the end for shorter players , as there would always be cases where shorter and bulkier players could still succeed
" obviously there will be lots of anecdotes where our findings are not going to be the case , " he said
the findings of the research have been published in the @entity104 .
