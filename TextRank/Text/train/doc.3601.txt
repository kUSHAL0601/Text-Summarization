-- supporters of @entity2 , @entity3 , police officer @entity4 say they have faced threats over their views , but vowed not to be silenced
@entity4 on august 9 shot and killed unarmed black teen @entity7 , an incident that stirred racial tensions and unrest
an unnamed spokeswoman for the @entity13 group , speaking at a rally saturday , accused the media of having a bias against supporters of the officer
" we believe this has only intensified the destruction of the community of @entity2 and the surrounding @entity24 areas , " said the spokeswoman
" we will not hide
we will no longer live in fear , " she said
" we ask this question : can justice ever be attained if one side 's supporters are living in fear of speaking out ? " the spokeswoman said that she and her group were not speaking on behalf of @entity4 or his representatives , but were making a statement for his supporters
she said she had received online threats against her and her family
the @entity40 rally , attended by about 100 supporters , was held outside @entity42 , a popular gathering spot for area police officers several miles south of @entity2
supporters , many of them armed , carried signs saying " innocent until proven guilty " and " we love cops
" an @entity51 - @entity50 woman at one point tried unsuccessfully to interrupt the rally , asking loudly why police had not broken up the gathering
a handful of counterprotesters later gathered peacefully across the street
there are competing versions from witnesses about what happened in @entity2
there is agreement that there was a scuffle between @entity7 and @entity4 , but some witnesses say the teen ran away , turned around and put his arms up as he was shot
the officer 's version , as told to a radio station by a friend , is that @entity7 charged the officer before the shooting
@entity4 's actions were warranted and justified , and he counts on the support of many , the spokeswoman said at the rally
" we believe that the evidence has and will continue to validate our position , " she said
the media is yet to earn the trust of those supporting the officer , she said
but @entity4 's supporters can take comfort that they have plenty of company from all around the country
the online fund - raising effort for @entity4 surpassed $ 300,000 on saturday , according to totals from two related pages on @entity94
in addition , supporters had raised about $ 10,000 in cash at the rally
a post on one of the pages notes that organizers " anticipate these funds will be used to cover potential legal fees , relocation and living expenses of both officer @entity4 and his immediate family
" " we truly appreciate your time , efforts , prayers , kind words and donations , " that message added
" it means more than you could possibly know
" more money raised for @entity2 officer than slain teen where is officer @entity4 ? @entity0 's @entity122 contributed to this report .
