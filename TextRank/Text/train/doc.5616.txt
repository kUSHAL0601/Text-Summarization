he was a beefy 5 - foot - 10 but won an @entity1 for playing the slight , 5 - foot - 3 @entity2
he had the booming voice of a deity but often played schlubs and conflicted characters
he could be heartfelt and giving , as with his male nurse in " @entity8 " or rock critic in " @entity10 , " or creepily machiavellian , such as the gamemaster in the latest " @entity13 " movie
@entity14 was an actor who could be anybody
" i do n't know how he does it , " director @entity15 told the @entity16 in 2008
@entity17 directed @entity14 on both stage ( " @entity20 , " " @entity21 " ) and screen ( " @entity22 " )
" again and again , he can truly become someone i 've not seen before but can still instantly recognize
... he may look like @entity14 , but there 's something different in his eyes
and that means he 's reconstituted himself from within , willfully rearranging his molecules to become another human being
" " @entity14 's precise , uncanny performance as @entity2 does n't imitate the author so much as channel him , as a man whose peculiarities mask great intelligence and deep wounds , " wrote @entity32 about 2005 's " @entity2
" @entity14 was found dead sunday
reports attribute his death to a drug overdose
for years , @entity14 was the kind of anonymous character actor who earned critical raves but was often unnoticed by the general public
he had an @entity45 face -- burly enough to be an athlete , soft enough to be an artist , with an eye twinkle that could be either vicious ( as in his " @entity51 " villain ) or humorous ( the frat - boyish @entity52 in " @entity54 " )
consider the roles that earned him @entity1 nominations : a conniving writer ( " @entity2 " ) , a cranky @entity59 desk jockey ( " @entity22 " ) , an upbeat , dissembling priest ( " @entity61 " ) and a charming , enigmatic cult leader ( " @entity63 " )
or consider the ones that did n't : baseball manager @entity65 ( " @entity66 " ) , suspicious @entity67 ( " @entity68 " ) , clever @entity69 ( " @entity70 " )
the @entity16 ' @entity71 , who saw him on stage , was unequivocal
" one of the finest actors of his generation , " he wrote in his review of the 2012 staging of " @entity21 " -- even while finding @entity14 miscast in that production
one of a kind everyman : he 's of a type harder to find in @entity82 these days , where movie - star looks and charisma often take precedence over the ability to disappear into a role
indeed , even when movie stars do try to disappear , we 're all too aware of the tricks , whether it 's weight gain , a putty nose or an unfamiliar accent
character actors -- and @entity14 , for all his intensity , was a character actor -- support movie stars
that seemed ok with him
you could more often find him in challenging roles or secondary parts than leads
he liked to take chances
he worked with director @entity106 ( " @entity107 , " " @entity8 , " " @entity63 " ) before either was a big name , and @entity106 provided him with a steady stream of interesting roles
he took small parts in such films as the dark comedy " @entity122 , " based on the unpleasant characters dreamed up by @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , and " @entity123 , " @entity119 ' comedy about religion and atheism
in some respects he followed the path of one of his heroes , @entity126 , who had looks and magnetism to burn but was n't shy about taking " character " parts , such as a broken - down lawyer in " @entity132 " or a ne'er - do - well in " @entity133
" the latter featured @entity126 acting opposite @entity14 , as did the @entity137 miniseries " @entity138
" he also kept his talent sharp with frequent stage work and the kind of " one for me , one for them " movie philosophy that made sure he was both busy and successful
the price of fame : in recent years , he 'd become a more recognizable face -- and persona
in a video that quickly made the rounds , his voice was dubbed into a trailer for the @entity154 movie " her , " taking the place of @entity158 's operating system , @entity159
where @entity158 is relaxed , @entity14 is intense ; where @entity158 is helpful , @entity14 is wily
it neatly summed up his capabilities
but with fame comes intrusion , and @entity14 seemed uncomfortable with the attention
he was a @entity167 - based actor , not a movie star
it was a job , not an excuse to turn him into an open book
" somebody wanted me to talk about my personal life , " he told the @entity173 newspaper @entity172 in 2012
" i 'd rather not because my family does n't have any choice
if i talk about them in the press , i 'm giving them no choice
so i choose not to
" his death has left his colleagues in shock
" we have lost a true artist , " said @entity185 in a statement
@entity185 worked with @entity14 in " @entity66 " and the forthcoming " @entity189
" " he was a giant talent , " said @entity190 , who co-starred with @entity14 in " @entity22
" but perhaps director @entity17 was most succinct -- and heartfelt -- in describing the void left by @entity14 's death
" no words for this , " he said in a statement
" he was too great and we 're too shattered
" " @entity201 " is an all - too - appropriate word , as @entity14 himself used it when expressing his goals
given his work and the circumstances of his death , a line from the 2008 @entity16 profile seems more haunting today
" for me , acting is torturous , and it 's torturous because you know it 's a beautiful thing , " he said
" i was young once , and i said , ' that 's beautiful and i want that
' wanting it is easy , but trying to be great -- well , that 's absolutely torturous
