there are many reasons why the @entity3 is perhaps the least - loved agency in @entity4 -- a tax code so complex that it seems like you need an advanced degree to understand it , the dreaded audit process and revelations that certain groups have been targeted based on their political beliefs
and now , a growing awareness of instances where the @entity3 seized the money or property of law - abiding citizens without due process is adding to the agency 's menacing reputation
according to the @entity23 , a public interest law firm that investigates civil forfeiture practices , these seizures carried out by the @entity3 had increased from 114 in 2005 to 639 in 2012
sounds unbelievable , but believe it
under a federal structuring statute , banks are required to report all cash deposits of more than $ 10,000 to the @entity29 of the @entity30
to prevent money laundering , deposits purposely " structured " to evade this reporting are illegal
in @entity34 , the @entity3 suspected a local grocer , @entity36 , of money laundering
without filing charges , it seized his $ 35,000 bank account
@entity36 had to prove in court that his daily bank deposits were for insurance reasons and to reduce robbery at his store -- not a criminal enterprise
fortunately , the @entity46 won their case , and the @entity3 returned their funds
@entity50 native @entity49 has made an honest living owning and operating a restaurant , mrs. lady 's , for 38 years
but in august 2013 , everything she saved -- roughly $ 33,000 -- was seized
the @entity3 targeted hinders because her restaurant only accepted cash or checks , which made regular bank deposits necessary
after 19 months and extensive national media exposure , hinders finally got her money back
in @entity63 , the @entity3 used suspicions of structuring to seize the operating accounts of locally owned @entity66 and forced owners @entity68 and @entity69 to prove their innocence
fortunately , the @entity71 settled their case by showing their deposits were legitimate but only after expending extensive time and energy
recent announcements by the @entity77 and @entity30 departments that they will end most forms of equitable sharing -- the practice of federal law enforcement coordinating with local and state law enforcement for the purpose of pursuing civil asset forfeiture cases -- are a start , but this only affects a fraction of overall seizures
in addition to the @entity3 , the @entity89 and @entity4 attorney 's offices across the country have civil asset forfeiture authority
in fact , the @entity4 attorney 's office for the @entity97 , run by attorney general nominee @entity98 , has been an active seizure office
a disturbing example under her watch is the @entity104 case , where her prosecutors confiscated $ 446,651 from a small business run by @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109
it took @entity98 two years finally to drop the charges
in light of this case and her office 's extensive practice of civil forfeiture -- more than 120 times during her tenure -- it was disappointing to hear her defend the current system during wednesday 's confirmation hearing before the @entity124
beyond these specific examples of abuse , @entity125 must take a hard look at the underlying federal civil asset forfeiture policies
ultimately , the @entity130 must be eliminated through legislative action as part of a larger package of reforms to the entire practice of civil asset forfeiture
for this reason , we have combined our previous efforts to introduce the @entity140 , or @entity141 , in both the @entity142 and @entity124
it would bolster protections for property and property owners by raising the level of proof necessary for the federal government to prove a civil asset forfeiture case -- requiring that the @entity3 and @entity89 prove guilt , rather than the individual prove innocence
moreover , the @entity141 eliminates incentives for civil forfeiture by rerouting funds seized by the @entity3 to the general treasury rather than the unaccountable @entity158 , which has little congressional oversight and has grown since its inception in 1986 to more than $ 2 billion in 2013
this fund is the depository for all forfeiture dollars seized by the @entity3 , @entity89 and equitable sharing partners -- such as local police forces -- at the state and local level
lastly , the @entity141 inserts protections by mandating the @entity3 prove individuals have knowingly violated the structuring statute instead of simply inferring guilt from the deposits themselves
making cash deposits does not automatically put you under suspicion of criminal activity
the @entity141 will ensure that federal government agencies , like the @entity3 and @entity89 , no longer profit from taking the property of @entity4 citizens without due process , while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds of crime
the @entity141 intends to tilt the playing field back in favor of due process and property rights
we call on our colleagues in @entity125 to address this issue and join our efforts .
