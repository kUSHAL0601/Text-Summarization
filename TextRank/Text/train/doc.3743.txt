have been engaged in a campaign of violence against the @entity6 state for more than two decades with the goal of establishing an autonomous @entity9 homeland
@entity2 leader @entity10 , pictured in 1992
@entity10 is currently serving a life sentence in a @entity6 prison
the @entity2 accuses @entity6 of oppressing @entity9 culture and suppressing @entity9 nationhood
more than half of the world 's @entity9 ( 10 to 12 million ) are estimated to live in @entity6 , making up a majority in the country 's south - eastern region
@entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 also have sizeable @entity9 minorities
but the group is considered a terrorist organization by the @entity26 and the @entity27 and is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of more than 30,000 @entity6 security force members and civilians , according to the @entity31
in 1984 the @entity2 launched a guerrilla struggle in response to the wave of repression that followed @entity6 's military coup in 1980 when the @entity9 language and @entity9 place names banned
by then the group 's founder , @entity10 , was living in exile in @entity22 where he organized @entity2 training camps
since the 1980s the group has claimed responsibility for regular ambushes on military targets in the southeast but also bomb attacks across the country , notably in @entity6 holiday resorts
during the 1990s the @entity6 military launched a concerted campaign to eliminate the @entity2 threat , adopting commando tactics and targeting the group 's mountain bases
the establishment of a " no - fly zone " over northern @entity20 following the first @entity59 in 1991 also allowed @entity6 troops to conduct frequent raids on @entity2 strongholds across the border
in 1998 , under intensive @entity6 pressure , @entity22 expelled @entity10 and shut down the @entity2 camps he had established there
@entity10 was snatched by @entity6 commandos a few months later while seeking asylum in @entity69
despite calling for a @entity2 cease - fire and peaceful negotiation following his capture , @entity10 was sentenced to death in 1999 following a trial condemned by the @entity75
however his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment when @entity6 abolished the death penalty in 2002
in the same year @entity10 's brother , @entity79 , who had inherited leadership of the @entity2 , vowed to form a new group to campaign peacefully for @entity9 rights
but the frequency of @entity2 terror attacks has steadily risen since 2004 and @entity6 claims the @entity26 - led invasion of @entity20 and the country 's subsequent instability following the overthrow of the @entity90 regime in 2003 has enabled the @entity2 to regroup
it accuses the @entity2 of launching attacks on @entity6 targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous @entity9 region of northern @entity20
earlier this year @entity6 sent large contingents of soldiers , tanks , guns and armored personnel carriers to reinforce its frontier
but following the deaths of 27 soldiers and 12 civilians in recent attacks , @entity6 military leaders have urged the government to give them the green light to strike at @entity2 bases inside @entity20
