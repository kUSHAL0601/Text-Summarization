@entity0 , @entity1 -- high winds whipped up a spreading wildfire in northern @entity1 on wednesday as firefighters battled several blazes across the tinder - dry state
a raging grass fire in @entity10 , meanwhile , claimed several structures , including a barn , affiliate @entity8 reported
homes in the area were evacuated
the @entity17 fire in @entity18 grew to about 7,500 acres on wednesday afternoon , and it was unclear how much had been contained , the @entity15 reported
the fire was centered around the south side of @entity22 outside @entity0 , about 50 miles west of the @entity24 metro area
observers on the opposite shore were forced to pull back when winds around 20 mph carried embers across the lake
the fire had destroyed at least 39 homes , according to the @entity15 , and another 125 households were evacuated
firefighters were getting support from aerial tankers and helicopters that were dropping water on the blaze
on wednesday morning , firefighters reported they had " hooked the heel " of the fire , which means they established an anchor from which they can begin extending lines along its edge
the cause of the blaze was not immediately clear
@entity1 is up against its worst fire season in state history , according to officials
a record 3.5 million acres have burned since the start of the season last november as hot and dry weather , coupled with a historic drought , have made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth
firefighters are now battling a total of nine wildfires , which have consumed about 16,000 acres , the @entity15 says
@entity61 and @entity62 were among the residents who were forced to flee as the @entity17 fire closed in on their homes
the fire " got away " from the firefighters , and " the only escape route we had at that time was the marina , " @entity66 said
he and his wife got on their boat , let others without boats onboard , and watched the thick , black smoke for a bit before going across the lake to the harbor
on wednesday , he inspected the house and saw that outside of some possible smoke damage , it appeared unharmed
yet the experience of evacuating -- the second time they had to do so since april -- was a frightening one
" the first time back in april ( was ) scary , but this was horrific , " @entity62 said
" this time i really felt we could lose everything
" " there 's still a lot of work going on and a lot of stuff that 's being threatened and they are doing the best they can to protect structures , " said @entity94 with the @entity15
boats such as the @entity104 ' were used to ferry some evacuees across @entity22 , he said
" i do n't think i have seen it this bad anywhere , " @entity106 said
" walking across somebody 's yard that just crackles under your feet because the grass is so dry
it 's just a tough , tough situation
" firefighters in @entity116 , in east @entity1 , battled a 100 - acre fire
two structures were lost and 10 homes were threatened
@entity1 and @entity10 are the worst - hit of several states in a band of severe drought that stretches from @entity124 to sections of the @entity126
more than 90 % of the state is suffering from " extreme " or " exceptional " drought conditions , according to the @entity129 at the @entity130
@entity2 's @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .
