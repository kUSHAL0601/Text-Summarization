@entity0 -- a 10 - year - old boy escaped out of the window of a sinking minivan after his mother drove the vehicle with her three other children into the @entity9 , some 60 miles north of @entity0 , authorities said
@entity10 swam to shore tuesday night and was picked up by a passer - by and brought to a nearby fire station in @entity12 , @entity0 , said fire chief @entity13
soaking wet and suffering from a mild case of hypothermia , @entity10 then told fire officials his mother had driven the vehicle into the river
police divers later discovered the bodies of @entity21 , 25 , an 11 - month - old girl , a 2 - year - old boy and a 5 - year - old boy some 25 yards off shore
a police investigation into the incident suggests that the mother intentionally drove the vehicle into the water , according to @entity12 police chief @entity31
responders , using dive teams and a circling helicopter , found the van after an hourlong search submerged in eight feet of murky water , according to @entity13
before the incident , a relative called police reporting a " domestic disturbance " that police say may have involved @entity10 's husband , @entity42
that belief is based on a phone call the relative received in which they said they heard " tussling in the background , " noting a history of domestic problems , police said in a statement wednesday
police declined to identify the relative
an autopsy on the four bodies is scheduled for wednesday
@entity12 mayor @entity57 said the incident is certain to have " a lasting effect on this city
" city resident and neighbor @entity61 said she " would never have imagined ( @entity63 ) to do this to her kids
" " to them little babies
i would have never have imagined
i 'm in shock , " she added
other neighbors described her surviving son , @entity72 , as responsible
" he was the type of kid that was responsible for his little ones , " said resident @entity73
but the traumatic effects of tuesday 's incident could have long - term effects on the boy , analysts say
" he has this major traumatic event and loss and that can be manifested in many ways , " said dr. @entity83 , director of @entity85 's @entity84
he warned of " aggressive behavior , through violence , through depression , through depressive symptoms and that can be quite severe and quite impairing in a child his age
" @entity1 's @entity98 and @entity99 contributed to this report
