-- high - stakes lawsuits , overlapping investigations and a bitter battle over blame are spreading across @entity5 in the wake of a scandal that has rocked the meat industry
horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100 % beef , sold in @entity12 , the @entity13 and @entity14
on sunday , a major company under scrutiny called one of its suppliers a " villain " responsible for the fraud
the supplier , in turn , insisted it was " fooled " by a subsupplier
while authorities say there is no immediate cause for health concerns , the discovery was a new shock to an industry already reeling from a bombshell last month when @entity33 investigators found horse and pig dna in numerous hamburger products
the blame chain @entity12 food producer @entity38 has been a focus of the uproar since it announced thursday that it had withdrawn its lasagna from stores as a precaution
the products were pulled monday after @entity48 supplier @entity46 raised concerns about the type of meat that was used , @entity44 said
@entity38 said a letter from @entity46 dated february 2 informed @entity38 that the contamination may date back to august 2012
@entity54 found in hamburgers in @entity13 and @entity33 @entity38 is only one of several companies that receive products from @entity46
others include @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , which have recalled some meat products in @entity12 , and @entity64 , which has pulled some products from shelves in @entity13
six big @entity48 retailers -- @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 -- said sunday that they were recalling lasagne and other products
@entity76 , which oversees @entity38 throughout the @entity78 region , said it has begun legal action against @entity46 and its subsuppliers
" we are only at the beginning of our legal process
@entity46 will end up in a lot of legal processes going forward , i imagine , " @entity76 ceo @entity84 said sunday in an interview with @entity0
" @entity46 is the villain
" @entity46 has not responded to @entity0 's requests for comment
the company did not answer its phones when @entity0 called repeatedly , and did not respond to an e-mail request for comment
but @entity84 told @entity48 news agency @entity94 on sunday that his company had been " fooled " by a @entity48 supplier
" we were victims , " he said , according to @entity94
@entity46 apparently took its website down , posting a sign that it is " under construction
" previously , the site described the company as offering a wide array of products through partners , including major @entity5 retailers
@entity109 - crossing investigations probes are under way in @entity14 , @entity12 , and @entity13
the supply chain being studied includes still more countries
@entity14 's consumer affairs minister , @entity114 , ordered an immediate investigation and said results will be available by midweek
in a statement , @entity114 said a provider in @entity120 and traders in @entity122 and the @entity123 are part of the chain being probed
the @entity126 announced sunday that it is reporting @entity38 to police , which is the standard course of action when products have been sold with the wrong labels
@entity13 police are investigating as well
@entity13 officials held an emergency meeting saturday in @entity135
participants agreed " meaningful results " must be achieved by friday , @entity137 spokesman @entity136 said
officials discussed what tests are possible , what laboratory capacity is needed , and what can be done to protect consumer confidence , he said
the evidence so far suggests " either criminal activity or gross negligence , " environment secretary @entity147 said , adding that " more bad news " could come
@entity13 food businesses have been ordered to test all processed beef products for authenticity and report back to the authorities by friday
" i am determined that we get to the bottom of this and that any wrongdoing discovered is punished , " @entity147 said in a statement
prime minister @entity160 weighed in friday on @entity161
" this is completely unacceptable -- this is n't about food safety but about proper food labeling and confidence in retailers , " he wrote
legal action under way @entity84 credits his company with uncovering " a serious case of fraud
" " what has happened with @entity46 is a crime , a scandal , " he said in an interview with @entity0
@entity177 finds horse meat at @entity5 supplier while @entity38 has begun legal action in @entity12 , @entity14 previously said it will file a legal complaint monday against a @entity183 business that is part of the supply chain
it did not name the business publicly
" there are two victims in this affair : @entity38 and the consumer , " @entity14 said in a statement
the @entity13 arm of @entity38 said it is considering legal action against suppliers as well
early results of an internal investigation " strongly suggest " the horse meat contamination of a beef lasagna product " was not accidental , " the company said
tests showed up to 100 % horse meat @entity64 said tests on random samples demonstrated that the withdrawn products contained between 30 % and 100 % horse meat
" this is completely unacceptable and like other affected companies , we feel angry and let down by our supplier
if the label says beef , our customers expect it to be beef
" samples of the affected @entity38 lasagna contained between 60 % and 100 % horse meat , according to @entity13 and @entity33 food safety inspectors
in january , the @entity214 of @entity33 found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse dna , while 23 of them -- or 85 % -- tested positive for pig dna
in nine out of the 10 burger samples , the horse dna was found at very low levels , the inspectors said
but in one sample from @entity226 , @entity13 's largest retailer , the horse meat accounted for about 29 % of the burger
@entity226 apologized and vowed to make sure it never happens again
@entity33 officials blamed ingredients from @entity230
concerns about a veterinary drug while horse meat is not itself a food safety hazard , food inspectors are concerned it may contain the veterinary drug phenylbutazone , or " bute , " commonly used to treat horses
meat from animals treated with phenylbutazone may pose a risk to human health and is not allowed to enter the food chain as it may pose a risk to human health
@entity38 has been ordered to test the lasagna withdrawn from shelves in the @entity13 for the drug 's presence
the revelations have revolted many meat eaters in the @entity13 , where horse meat is generally considered taboo , although it is commonly eaten in neighboring @entity14 , as well as countries including @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259
the discovery of pig dna in beef products is of particular concern to @entity264 , whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products
jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat
the @entity13 @entity271 confirmed last week that a number of meat pies and similar items supplied to prisons in @entity276 and @entity277 were labeled and served as halal -- prepared in compliance with @entity281 dietary law -- but contained traces of pork dna , the @entity137 said
horse meat is not commonly eaten in the @entity284 , but the country does export it to @entity286 and @entity287
@entity288 passed a bill in november 2011 that lifted a 5 - year - old ban on the slaughter of horses for meat in the @entity284
horse : coming soon to a meat case near you ? @entity0 's @entity297 contributed to this report .
