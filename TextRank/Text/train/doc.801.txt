-- @entity1 and the @entity3 channel have built a loyal following for the show " @entity7 , " now in its fourth season
the series ' titular , top - secret town is filled with uber - geniuses and one wily sheriff , which turns out to be a great mix for science fiction
@entity1 is in @entity14 , @entity15 , to promote " @entity7 " at @entity16 , and stopped by @entity0 studios to answer a few of our fan - centric questions
@entity0 : sheriff @entity21 ( your character on " @entity7 " ) is a very ingenious guy in a town populated by geniuses
what does @entity21 have that allows him to be able to figure out solutions that the others might not think of ? @entity1 : i think they do n't see the forest for the trees and he 's not compromised by not being able to see the forest , so he just sees trees
@entity0 : living in @entity7 ? @entity1 : yes , absolutely , well being in @entity0 right now , i 'm jonesing to live at the epicenter of something
@entity0 : do you think companies like @entity7 really exist ? @entity1 : yes -- a friend of mine wrote a book about one
@entity0 : why does sheriff @entity21 's car always get destroyed and why does n't he have a cool @entity43 like @entity44 and @entity45 ? @entity1 : tell me about it
they discovered first season that they like hurting me , so whether it 's a set of stairs i have to fall down or driving into a post , anything that has to do with me has to be destroyed
the @entity43 ad placement people are on set and we were doing this big stunt and they dropped the tree at the wrong time and the tree slammed the @entity43 , and the ad people said , " that was n't supposed to happen , was it ? " @entity0 : how do you feel about the rivalry between yourself and dr. @entity66 for the affections of @entity68 ? @entity1 : i was concerned that it was gon na be a really forced triangle , but they managed to make it an adult exchange where we could put it on the table and discuss it and i like it
@entity0 : you 've also done some directing and camera work
which do you prefer ? @entity1 : being the lead of the show is more difficult , it 's harder on my body , it 's more strenuous , it 's harder on my mind but it 's rewarding in a day to day manner , but what i love about being the director is you get to protect the story for longer , so you can take all these talents you know , all the people you work with and you get to make sure they get to do all they can do
directing is -- it 's easier to act in something that you have questions about than it is to direct something
directing is so much work for such a long period of time
@entity0 : we took a look at your @entity111 page
@entity113 has a " duck , duck , goose " competition and you 're the reigning champion ? @entity1 : that 's a lie that somebody put on the @entity111 website
@entity0 : you are a founding member of @entity119 , @entity122 's @entity121 improv comedy club
do you still get the chance to do improv or does the show and movies take up your time now ? @entity1 : i improvise on a regular basis on the show , so i get to do it in that format
as for stage stuff , i 'm rusty compared to what i used to be , so i do n't do it all that often , although @entity121 celebrated its 50th anniversary in december and i went back for that .
