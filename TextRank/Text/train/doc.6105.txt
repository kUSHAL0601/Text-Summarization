@entity0 -- bamboozled by eurozone debt crisis jargon ? @entity1 is here to help you tell your bond yields from your banking interventions , your defaults from your haircuts
and if you need anything more explained , please submit your questions to @entity10 at the bottom of the story
@entity13 the euro is the common currency used by a bloc of nations within the @entity18
the 17 states that use the euro -- including @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 -- form the eurozone
a further 10 @entity18 nations -- including the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 -- continue to use their own currencies
recession a recession is technically defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking output -- or a country going backwards financially
the eurozone is currently teetering on the edge of recession , triggered in part by the crisis which has rolled on since may 2010
a double dip recession is when a country which has been in recession enters a downturn again after a brief and weak recovery
contagion the " contagion effect " referred to in the eurozone crisis is the fear that one country 's financial problems will spill over to another country
this happens because the capital markets -- where sovereign bonds are bought and sold -- can be influenced by sentiment as well as the fundamentals of each country
contagion can also occur because the more countries within the bloc struggle , the higher the cost to others of giving aid
default countries , or companies , default when they can no longer pay their bills on time
defaults can come in different forms : " orderly " -- when investors holding the bonds can agree to take haircuts ( see below ) -- or " disorderly , " where losses are unexpected and sudden
bond yield countries raise money by issuing sovereign bonds which are then purchased by investors
the ' " yield " of the bonds - which can be thought of as @entity87 -- is how much the investor wants to be paid to hold that bond
so , a higher yield indicates a higher risk bond
for sovereign bonds a yield of more than 7 % is considered unsustainable for any extended period of time , because a country 's earnings are unlikely to be able to cover repayments
liquidity liquidity is the oil which greases the world of finance
it refers to the ease at which funds -- cash , for example -- can flow through the system
a market with lots of buyers and sellers is liquid , while one without is illiquid
haircut a haircut refers to a cut in the value of investments lenders are asked to take
for example , a 50 % haircut on an investment means you 'll get back only half of what you paid
investors in @entity125 bonds have been asked to take a haircut on their debt
it would be in their interest to do so if they thought the value of the debt could drop further in the future
investors can also be asked to swap bonds maturing soon for longer dated ones which would pay out at a much later date
junk the ratings agencies -- @entity138 's and @entity139 being the big three -- award scores based on a company or country 's credit worthiness
" junk " refers to when that rating drops below investment grade
once a credit rating drops below the @entity151 level , it is " sub-investment " grade and is commonly referred to as junk
eurobond eurobonds are being suggested as a way to tie the finances of the eurozone 's 17 countries more closely
a eurobond would be a bond -- or debt which investors buy in return for yield -- backed by all the countries of the bloc
the idea remains under discussion , although it has rejected by the eurozone 's two most powerful leaders , @entity21 chancellor @entity173 and @entity22 president @entity174
fiscal union fiscal unity is centered on integrated taxation and spending
the eurozone is a monetary but not fiscal union , meaning its 17 members maintain their own taxation policies and also raise money to fund themselves
however , the bloc does have a central bank -- the @entity185 ( see below ) -- which maintains monetary policy
the bloc appears to be moving toward closer fiscal integration as it seeks to stem the crisis
@entity185 the @entity185 , based in @entity189 , @entity21 , was set up in 1998 to maintain monetary policy for the eurozone under its common currency , the euro
the @entity185 's mandate is to keep inflation at around 2 % or below , and ensure some level of stability for the countries that use the euro
like other central banks , the @entity185 's main tool for keeping to these targets is by raising or lowering interest rates -- a key tool for influencing financial markets
the @entity185 has also been actively buying the sovereign bonds of troubled eurozone economies , in the hope that it will lower those countries ' funding costs
@entity210 the @entity210 ( @entity210 ) is @entity212 's temporary bailout fund
it was hurriedly set up after @entity125 needed its first bailout in may 2010 , and has since become a key tool to combat the debt crisis
@entity212 leaders have increased its lending capacity from around â ‚ ¬ 250 billion to â ‚ ¬ 440 billion , and are investigating ways to boost its clout
a permanent bailout fund , the @entity221 , or @entity221 , should be available as early as next year
@entity223 the @entity223 , which is based in @entity224 , is an organization of 187 countries
it is designed to assist countries in financial trouble
member countries contribute to the fund , relative to their economies , when assistance is needed
it has been a key player in the @entity212 bailouts .
