nervous anticipation extends far beyond the racially charged powder keg of @entity2 , @entity3 , over a grand jury decision on whether to indict a white police officer for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager
the @entity8 suburb has simmered with anger since the day in august when 18 - year - old @entity10 was shot multiple times by officer @entity12
with the grand jury expected to deliver its decision any day , people worry that tensions could boil over -- not only in @entity2 , but at demonstrations in more than 30 cities from @entity19 to @entity20 organized by a group called the @entity22 , mostly for the day after the decision is announced
while most protests in @entity2 have been peaceful , some devolved into violence , especially in the nights immediately after the shooting
the imminent decision has renewed concerns over clashes between protesters and heavily armed law enforcement officers , especially if @entity12 is not indicted
" i , like so many other people , am on pins and needles , " said the rev. @entity34 , a @entity35 - based deputy director of the community organizing group @entity36
" this case has resonated with a lot of people who are beginning to understand that the issue of police violence and lawlessness is an issue that , although for the moment is focused on @entity2 ... it is an issue that challenges the nation
" though @entity34 expects to be in @entity2 after the announcement , he said members of the network 's 3,000 multidenominational congregations around the country plan to participate in vigils and protests
the @entity22 lists planned community responses to the grand jury decision in big cities such as @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63
it 's also planned public gatherings -- to be held the day of the announcement or the day after -- in smaller cities that include @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity69 , @entity70 ; @entity71 , @entity72 ; @entity73 , @entity74 ; @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity78
" the faith community has been quite busy on issue of @entity2 , " @entity34 said
" it has been a challenging experience because many clergy have been looking for how they make the connection between the faith they celebrate on sunday and the everyday cares , challenges and struggles that their people face the other six days of the week
" police departments prepare throughout the country , law enforcement agencies have been busy with @entity2
" many of my colleagues i 've had an opportunity over the last few days to talk to around the country ... are preparing for whatever the outcome may happen to be , " said @entity93 , president of the @entity94 and public safety director for @entity96 , @entity97
@entity93 said law enforcement agencies in the @entity107 area , for instance , have " working relationships with our community members and leaders " and are preparing to mobilize should tensions erupt
" there are many communities in which we really have to engage our communities and set some real parameters about how we 're going to work together , " @entity93 said
@entity107 police spokeswoman @entity115 said the department will respect the rights of demonstrators to peaceably assemble but will not " tolerate those who violate our laws , destroy property or endanger lives
" " we have met with , and are in discussion with , numerous law enforcement agencies throughout the metro @entity107 area to ensure our efforts are coordinated , and that we are maintaining the same level of readiness and vigilance , " she said
in @entity133 , a @entity132 police spokesman , lt. @entity130 , said the city did not anticipate violent demonstrations following the grand jury decision
" however , we have adequate resources in place to address any situation that may arise , " he said
" in addition to the resources , we work hard to develop and maintain strong relationships within our communities
we feel confident that together we can address such a situation if it arises
" police officials would not reveal specific preparations
but @entity146 law enforcement analyst @entity145 , a former @entity147 assistant director and police officer , said federal agencies will likely be working with local police departments , particularly sharing information on agitators from the @entity153 and abroad who typically move from state to state to stir problems at public demonstrations
and law enforcement agencies in cities such as @entity159 and @entity35 have extensive experience dealing with protests
" the @entity163 police have demonstrations in downtown @entity35 all the time , " he said
" it 's not like they 're not prepared or equipped
people will be on heightened alert
when the word goes out that the decision has been made , departments are going to be trying to at least be ready , to have their officers on standby to go to extended shifts and whatever might be necessary to prevent things from getting out of hand
" unresolved tensions when members of the @entity180 met with police chiefs from around the country in @entity183 , @entity184 , last month , the situation in @entity2 was at the top of the agenda
conference spokeswoman @entity187 said the group has had internal discussions on how to react to the grand jury decision but will not make a statement on the case until the announcement
" we do n't know what 's going to happen , " she said
" we 're waiting like everybody else
" outgoing @entity153 attorney general @entity197 told the gathering of mayors and police chiefs that law enforcement had a responsibility to address tensions within communities
" the events in @entity2 reminded us that we can not and we must not allow tensions , which are present in so many neighborhoods across @entity153 , to go unresolved , " @entity197 said
the @entity2 case , @entity197 said , underscored divisions between police and residents in many @entity153 cities
" when i traveled to @entity2 in the days after that incident , my pledge to the people of that community was that our nation 's @entity216 would remain focused on the challenges they faced , and the deep - seated issues and difficult conversations that the shooting brought to the surface , long after national headlines had faded , " he said
federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations , one into @entity10 's killing and the other into the local police department 's overall track record with minorities
free speech , worries about violence police will be on hand at protests to ensure freedom of expression -- without any criminal activity
@entity36 , on its website , says it opposes " any militarized response against @entity153 citizens exercising our right to freely and peaceably assemble
" @entity3 gov. @entity247 has called for protests to remain peaceful once the grand jury rules in @entity12 's case but vowed to crack down on any " ugliness
" @entity247 made clear last week he 's not anticipating violence , but wants to be ready for anything
people have a right to express their views and grievances , but they do not have the right to put their fellow citizens or their property at risk , " he said
many protesters , furious because they felt @entity10 's killing was an example of excessive force , clashed with heavily armed law enforcement in the streets for days after the shooting
@entity270 , who responded in armored vehicles and military gear , were criticized for escalating the violence rather than tempering it
@entity10 's family has implored would - be protesters to refrain from the looting and violence that marred the early protests
but through its attorney , the family asked authorities to use " reasonable restraints " in dealing with protesters
the attorney blamed assault rifles , manhandling , tear gas , rubber bullets and false arrests for agitating the protesters who took to the streets
@entity145 said people on both sides of the issue have all but telegraphed what 's to come after the grand jury decision is announced
what happens in @entity2 , he said , can influence what happens in the rest of the country
" when you have demonstrations , emotions are high , " @entity145 said
" when you have high emotions , a mob can get out of control
... when emotions are high , all it takes is one or two people to incite the crowd into doing something else
and one bad cop can incite things if shots are fired or if the police do something too aggressive
it can work both ways
