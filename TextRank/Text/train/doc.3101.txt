-- @entity2 around the skies above the ferry boats and cargo ships , seagulls are as a familiar sight above the @entity7 as the commuters and containers on it
their enduring presence on @entity14 's busy waterway will soon be further cemented with the construction of a new transport hub designed to look like the seabird in flight
perched on the western shores of the @entity7 , the @entity19 will enable new and improved connections for ferries , trains , buses and some small ships , says @entity26 , director of major projects for @entity28
infographic : historic hub where east meets west " today this area carries around 60,000 passengers per day ... when [ the hub is completed it will carry ] around 90,000 persons per day by our estimates , " @entity26 said
the seagull was a natural choice for the design , says @entity26 , because the bird is the symbol of the @entity7
the @entity14 - based architects will be assisted by @entity43 engineering company , @entity42 who will be providing geotechnical , environmental and maritime expertise
in addition to its iconic design , the project will incorporate green features such as rainwater collection and a renewable energy facility
work on the building is due to start next year , @entity26 says , and should be completed by 2015/16 .
