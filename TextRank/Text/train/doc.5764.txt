-- tens of thousands of @entity3 marched sunday in memory of anti-government protesters killed on friday , calling them " martyrs " and chanting for freedom , demonstrators told @entity0
" the area was so packed with thousands of people it was difficult to move , " said human rights activist @entity8 , calling it " the biggest crowd i have ever seen since the unrest started
" after eight victims were buried , protesters shouted slogans including , " the people demand the fall of the regime , " @entity8 said
other demonstrators chanted , " with our blood , with our souls , we will sacrifice for you martyrs , " at the @entity23 in the @entity25 suburb of @entity26 , the site of friday 's protest , another eyewitness said
national security forces left the marchers alone because the dead had been declared martyrs , the source said , requesting not to be named for safety reasons
the government did not immediately confirm there had been a march or that security forces had steered clear
the @entity41 said sunday that 123 people have died since the start of the unrest in @entity3 last month
opposition leaders circulated a list of demands , saying that if the regime were to respond positively , they would not call for the government 's collapse
the demands include the immediate release of political prisoners , lifting of emergency and martial law , and withdrawal of intelligence forces from @entity3 cities
@entity3 president @entity59 appointed a new prime minister earlier on sunday
@entity62 , a former academic with a doctorate in biotechnology , was agriculture minister for eight years before being appointed to lead the government , the state news agency said
the government resigned last week in the face of protests that have left at least dozens dead
@entity69 accepted their resignations on tuesday , but made no further concessions in a widely anticipated speech to the nation on wednesday
at least 15 people were killed in @entity26 on friday , @entity8 said sunday
he based his tally on calls to hospitals and relatives of the victims , he said
eight people were buried sunday , he added
another person was killed in @entity83 near @entity84 , activists said earlier
the anti-regime demonstrations pulsating across @entity3 resulted in a security hunt for armed snipers and a wave of arrests saturday
@entity3 security forces were searching for members of an " armed group " that killed " a number of citizens and security forces " in @entity26 on friday , the @entity90 reported on saturday
@entity90 reported that a girl was killed when the armed group opened fire on civilians in the city of @entity102
the agency cited an official source as saying that snipers from the group fired at citizens and security forces from rooftops
" security forces are pursuing the members of the armed group that terrorized the citizens through firing randomly , " @entity90 reported , citing the source without identifying the official or the alleged armed group
activists and witnesses dispute the government account , telling @entity0 that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators
the @entity120 said security forces in the volatile southern city of @entity84 and in @entity102 arrested about 20 people on saturday after demonstrations the day before
along with the protests in @entity26 , @entity84 , @entity102 and @entity127 , people also took to the streets in @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 on friday , activists told @entity0
before friday 's fighting , dozens of people were killed in the last two weeks across @entity3 , with many deaths reported in the southern city of @entity84 , where popular demonstrations started , and the coastal city of @entity129 , activists say
the list of opposition demands circulated sunday called for a decree guaranteeing the right to peaceful demonstrations and the " termination of all threatening and intimidating acts against our sons and daughters in our schools whether by school staff or secret service agents in and around the schools and to refrain from obliging them to participate in demonstrations supporting the regime
" it called for an amended constitution accommodating " a multi-party democracy " and guaranteeing " basic human rights , " the establishment " of a truly independent judiciary system , " freedom of information and expression and an end to " the existing corruption in @entity3
" @entity0 's @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report
