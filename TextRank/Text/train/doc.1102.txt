-- @entity1 is a former private school teacher who has made the shelters of @entity3 her classroom
her goal : to transform the lives of homeless children through academic and social opportunities
through her nonprofit , the @entity10 , @entity9 believes she can spread hope to a community often overlooked
" i believe everyone is fundamentally good , " she explained
" i do n't like to give up on people
" for @entity9 , the reality of growing up poor is personal
when she was 13 , @entity9 and her siblings immigrated to @entity20 , @entity21 , from @entity22 , @entity23
her father , an artist and chef , had moved three years earlier to establish a life for his children
" we moved into a $ 30 - a - month walkup apartment , " she said
" none of us spoke @entity31
" so to help her parents make ends meet , @entity9 and her siblings went to work
her first job was in a bakery after school , which foreshadowed her love of service
" each saturday night , ( my boss ) would give me all the baked goods and cakes that were left over , " she said
" so , i would bring them to the entire neighborhood
... i was so thrilled
" despite growing up in poverty , @entity9 never saw herself as poor
" being poor is a real state of mind , " she explained
" we never felt poor ; we just lived in a poor environment
" @entity9 went on to college and became a high school @entity51 and @entity23 teacher
she also served as a tour guide for @entity21 's @entity55
but it was on a trip to a homeless shelter that @entity9 was " accidentally " introduced to a future life of nonprofit work
after moving to @entity3 in 1990 , @entity9 worked as a volunteer in a shelter and met an 8 - year - old boy who could n't read
she learned that the boy never attended school because his mother never took him for the required physical exam
without hesitation , she got the mother 's permission and took him for the exam
soon , @entity9 was taking other kids to the doctor and eventually on field trips
" i then started bringing the kids on outings to the beach and to the mountains , " she said
and in 1993 , @entity9 founded the @entity10
with her son and daughter working closely by her side , the former teacher 's nonprofit works to connect youth in @entity3 shelters , who are often exposed to drug use and violence , with resources that support the " whole family
" @entity9 believes that children succeed when their family 's social , emotional and academic needs are addressed
" we need to focus on all these aspects to be a whole person , " she said
her main goal is to provide them with the same sense of hope she had as a child
@entity104 is funded through a combination of grants and private donations
with a staff of more than 250 volunteers , the foundation provides services that fall under three key initiatives : living , learning and enriching
designed to meet the domestic needs of at - risk families , the living platform transitions children and parents from shelters into stable housing in safe communities
upon qualifying for this program , families are given a fully furnished apartment , complete with a year 's worth of food , clothing and appliances
" we also help to supplement their income for that first year , " @entity9 added
she says the program is available only for families who are ready to change their lives
parents must be drug - and alcohol - free and have a job , among other qualifications , when they move into their new homes
to assist families in maintaining their homes , the foundation also provides access to financial and credit coaching , interview training and mentorship opportunities
through this platform , the group has moved more than 60 families into homes
" it plants hope in the hearts of these children and families , " @entity9 explained
the nonprofit 's learning platform is dedicated to academic growth
through this initiative , the children have access to computer labs and one - on - one tutoring sessions from @entity10 volunteers
under the nonprofit 's @entity166 , it is @entity9 's goal to make sure that each child is prepared for college
" to have that basic education is so important
... it is going to prepare them for life
" upon completion of this program and graduation from high school , students receive four - year college scholarships
" they actually care about your life , not only in school but outside of school , " said 19 - year - old scholarship recipient @entity181
" thanks to them , i am able to attend college
" @entity181 , who lives with his mother and two siblings , is studying film production at a @entity193 community college
@entity104 helped spur his interest in photography with classes through a local nonprofit , and he attended a summer cinematography session at the @entity199 with help from the foundation and @entity9 's daughter , @entity202
the foundation 's enrichment platform is what @entity9 describes as social aspect of her organization
through this program , the nonprofit provides @entity212 's inner - city youth -- some homeless , some not -- with recreational activities
this can include summer camps , birthday celebrations , family movie nights and pizza parties
@entity9 believes that through these events , @entity10 families are able to see a world unrestrained by poverty
" it shows the kids that they so deserve it , " she said
over the nonprofit 's 20 - year history , its three platforms have helped more than 75,000 families
" if your heart is open , you are kind , " @entity9 said
" and if you are kind to another person , you open their heart
