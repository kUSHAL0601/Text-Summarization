what would you do if you only had one day to live ? probably not spend time downloading and fiddling with a mobile app , we 're guessing
but a new app , @entity6 , wants you to embrace life in just that way
it lets you create a social network geared toward meeting new people around you , sharing photos and videos of what you 're up to and supporting other users who are also living it up
using gps , @entity6 identifies other users close to you and shows them your posts
they may then " cheer " or comment on those posts and , if both parties agree , they can become " 24 - hour friends
" there 's an option for users who hit it off to make each other permanent parts of their network
the kicker is that , anything you do using the app is totally erased after 24 hours
texts you send to other users disappear after a few seconds and photos or videos you share can go away nearly as quickly
the app 's co-founder , @entity41 , says that in an era when your third - grade teacher can find you on @entity46 and anyone you 've ever met at work wants to network on @entity49 , people are craving an app like @entity6
it lets them share without worrying their actions will go down on their permanent record
" it promotes sharing only the most refreshing contents and leading a casual relationship with no strings attached , " said @entity41 , an alum of @entity56 , @entity49 and @entity57
so , you can call sobrr the @entity63
but if you want to call it @entity65 meets @entity66 meets @entity67 , you would n't be that far - off either
the app 's name reflects the moment the idea first dawned on @entity41 -- the morning after a @entity73 bachelor party
he says he noticed all of his fellow partyers rushing onto their social media accounts to make sure they had n't shared any incriminating info about the previous night
no , @entity41 says , his app is n't just another tool for the hookup culture or a way to send naughty photos without having to answer for them later
but if somebody wants to use it that way ? he 's not here to stop them
" from the party animals that i 've surveyed , more than half admitted that they want to meet new people in the party , and crave for a one - night stand , " he said
@entity6 lets users post content " that they might otherwise feel too embarrassed to post on other platforms , " he said
@entity41 also said it 's important for users " to have their own space and little secrets
" but he maintains that " naughty stuff " is only a small part of what users have been sharing in the month since the app 's release
" we understand that ' hooking up ' is the need of many users on the platform , but we really value more of the casual interaction and conversation on the platform -- the foreplay of hooking up , " he said
" people are more attracted by each other based on their life moments or a common interest
" it 's possible the @entity125 startup is onto something
in the past year or so , ephemeral messaging apps such as @entity66 , @entity128 and @entity129 have flourished
so far , the app 's user base remains relatively small , boasting 10,000 users in the weeks it 's been available exclusively for @entity135 's mobile devices
whether more folks will flock to it to live a more carefree social media life , or merely hide the evidence from their wild nights out , remains to be seen .
