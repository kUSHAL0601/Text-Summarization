@entity0 , @entity1 -- a suspected @entity5 drone strike in @entity1 's tribal region killed four suspected militants monday , @entity1 intelligence officials told @entity2
two intelligence officials said the suspected drone fired two missiles at a vehicle carrying militants in the @entity14 area of @entity15 , one of the seven districts of @entity1 's volatile tribal region bordering @entity19
the intelligence officials asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media
based on a count by the @entity0 bureau , monday 's suspected drone strike was the 27th this year compared with 111 in all of 2010
it was the latest in a spate of suspected drone attacks that the @entity5 has carried out in @entity1 since @entity5 forces killed @entity30 leader @entity29 in the early morning hours of may 2
the recent increase , however , probably is not due to intelligence gained from @entity29 's compound , @entity34 , a military affairs analyst and editor of the @entity36 , has said
" what has happened since the @entity29 raid is that the @entity5 has not felt pressured to dial back the attacks due to @entity1 sensibilities , " he said
on sunday protesters in @entity1 held a sit - in near the country 's main port in @entity46 , demanding an end to @entity5 drone strikes
the @entity5 does not officially acknowledge drone attacks in @entity1 , but it is the only country operating in the region with the capacity to carry out such strikes
it was once widely believed that the program had the tacit approval and cooperation of @entity1 's intelligence agency
@entity2 's @entity58 contributed to this report .
