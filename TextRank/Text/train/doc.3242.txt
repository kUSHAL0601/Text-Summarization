-- @entity2 's list of celebrity clients featured the @entity4 of the entertainment industry , including @entity6 and @entity7
in a @entity9 market where looks are everything , the self - proclaimed skin - care guru to the stars relished her title and guarded it zealously
so much so that when aesthetician @entity18 set up shop in the same building as hers , tension ensued , authorities said
tension that led , police say , to a bizarre plot
@entity2 owned @entity25 in @entity26 , which provided skin care products and treatments
she was arrested in march after she allegedly wanted to have @entity18 , whom she considered a competitor , killed
" i came in and i said ' can i help you ? ' because she was in my office
and she said , ' oh good , a @entity34 that speaks @entity35
' and that hurt , " @entity18 said
" she wanted me out of the building
" the rivalry created by his new beauty salon called @entity41 morphed into a crime thriller filled with one twist after another
it had all the bizarre elements of a @entity26 shocker : sex solicitations , an alleged plot to kill and betrayal
convinced that @entity18 was not only ruining her popularity -- but that he was also allegedly posting raunchy @entity54 ads claiming she was seeking a man to fulfill her sexual fantasies -- @entity2 tried to hire a hit man to kill him , detectives said
" the phrase was , at that point , in essence , to find somebody to take out a double - minority @entity34 gay , " said @entity60 of the @entity61
but @entity18 said he had nothing to do with the cyber postings
in a wild case of betrayal , it later came to light that it was n't @entity18 posting the @entity74 said it was @entity2 's good friend , @entity75 , who now faces charges in a separate prosecution
her friend was creating drama so he could be the one who stepped in and saved her , @entity78 of @entity80 told @entity81 earlier this year
the online entertainment magazine broke most of the developments in the story
police said @entity75 , who was their informant , is also linked to the case in other ways
he is also the man @entity2 texted to tell that she hired a hit man to take out her business rival
her text to @entity75 read : " i found someone who is going to take @entity18 out
his name is @entity94 , and he 's an @entity95 quarterback , " prosecutors said
but @entity2 's lawyer said that it was not a plot to kill
" you will see that she was venting to family , she was venting to friends , " said @entity99 , her attorney
" this was not a case she was trying to solicit someone to murder
" @entity94 said the accusation stunned him because he hardly knew @entity2 and had only met her briefly at a pub in @entity109 , @entity110
" i want to clear my name because the mental anguish i 've suffered is far more than any football injury i 've ever had , " @entity94 said
@entity2 has pleaded not guilty and says she wants to clear her name as well
" she 's the victim of a stalker who posted fake @entity54 ads claiming she had a rape fantasy , " @entity99 said
@entity2 will be arraigned monday on solicitation of murder charges
her attorney says she plans to plead not guilty again .
