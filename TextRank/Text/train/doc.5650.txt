-- getting a song to hit in the summer can change a career -- just ask @entity3 or @entity4
before the reign of " @entity12 " in the summer of 2008 , @entity5 had been tirelessly striving to create a name for herself in the music industry and was starting to find some long - sought success with her debut single , " @entity10
" but right around @entity14 2008 -- which reminds us to make the most of what 's left of the season -- @entity5 's loud and bold " @entity12 " pushed through to the no. 1 spot on @entity21 's @entity20 and refused to let go for seven weeks
that single gave @entity5 an entree as pop 's newest princess
as for @entity4 ? he 'll tell you himself that his 2013 single with @entity27 and @entity28 , the controversial " @entity30 , " ushered in a new era , creating the kind of success of which most artists can only dream
@entity4 had been working as a singer and songwriter for years when " @entity30 " arrived in the spring of 2013
but after that song was played at every pool party , barbecue , nightclub and wedding reception -- topping the @entity21 100 in late june and staying there until september -- @entity4 became a global pop star
having the song of the summer does n't always translate into album sales later
@entity4 's latest release , the lovelorn " @entity47 , " has performed dismally
but it is a fast and easy way to gain notoriety , even if it only lasts for the season
so who 's going to claim the title for 2014 ? the obvious answer is @entity54 , the @entity55 rapper who 's swiftly gaining fame as the rapper on the @entity59 - assisted " fancy " and @entity61 's " problem
" but @entity62 , as she 's known to her fans , has some competition
including " fancy , " here are the 10 tracks poised to be the staple song of summer : " fancy , " @entity54 ft. @entity59 the combination of @entity54 's flow with @entity59 's cocky singing on the hook has made " fancy " as irresistible as running through sprinklers on a hot day
you think you might be too old for it , but why not ? it 's fun ! cute lyrics , easy to sing along to and upbeat enough to spin at a party , it 's little wonder that this release from @entity86 's " @entity87 " album has been no. 1 on the @entity21 100 since june 7
" @entity88 , " @entity89 the @entity91 dj / producer / singer / songwriter has captured exactly what a summer song needs to be with this seasonally appropriate single
with wistful lyrics about a warm weather romance and a pulsing beat , @entity89 ' single is an easy favorite
" rude , " @entity100 ! @entity101 reggae fusion band @entity100 ! has crooned its way almost to no. 1 with its single " @entity103
" the song arrived last fall , but it was n't until beach season that " @entity103 " really took off in the @entity107
ridiculously catchy , it comes complete with a heartfelt backstory that makes it applicable to this season of makeups and breakups
" @entity116 , " @entity115 ft. @entity114 is @entity115 's ode to the rear end a little silly ? sure
but that 's also what makes it perfect for summer
with a hypnotic beat and an artist - supplied dance move , " wiggle " is made for carefree nights
not even @entity127 could resist " @entity129 " while on vacation
" @entity130 , " @entity131 this rock group 's fourth album has been a wellspring of hits , with 2013 's popular " @entity139 " being followed by the light - hearted " @entity130 , " a bouncy track that lives up to its title
@entity131 's @entity140 says the making of the single was as breezy as the song itself
" problem , " @entity61 ft. @entity54 @entity61 has n't had any problems climbing the charts with this horn - heavy dismissal of an unnecessary love
funky and featuring the rapper du jour , @entity54 , " problem " is nipping at the heels of " fancy " to be the top choice of summer 2014
" @entity156 , " @entity155 in case you missed our very detailed memo , this is @entity155 's year
the @entity163 soul singer has released his debut solo album and has gifted us all with the kind of song that 'll be sung at karaoke for months to come
it is n't as danceable as @entity155 's work with @entity170 , the still - hot " latch , " but it is memorable and affecting
" @entity174 , " @entity172 and @entity173 since its release last year , @entity172 and @entity173 's " @entity174 " has become the go - to party anthem for anyone wanting to turn up their night
it worked just fine when it was cold and darkness fell early , but " @entity174 " demands listening when it 's 8 p.m. , the sun is still bright , and your day 's just getting started
" sing , " @entity186 @entity186 used to be known as the guy who sang sad love songs
that 's still true , but with his new album , " x , " @entity186 's branched out into more upbeat territory
his spring release , " sing , " has a groove produced by @entity27 and a chorus easy enough for the inebriated to howl along to -- usually , that 's more than enough to crown a single the song of the summer
" @entity198 , " @entity197 like with " @entity103 , " @entity201 duo @entity197 invoke a beach vibe with their hit " am i wrong
" it has a tempo quick enough for dancing but slow enough to encourage pairing off , with just the right amount of sultry for a summer night
tell us : what 's your favorite song this summer ?
