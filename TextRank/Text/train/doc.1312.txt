@entity0 -- in the aftermath of one of the worst weather systems to hit the @entity5 , finding adequate shelter is the big concern
what to do with displaced residents , whose homes were rendered dark , cold and powerless by @entity11 , is now the question plaguing emergency management officials across the tri-state area
@entity16 's answer for @entity0 : fix up the homes as best they can and put people back in them
faced with a lack of physical space for @entity16 trailers and limited access to available rental apartments and hotels , @entity16 officials in @entity0 said they are bent on making flood - soaked homes inhabitable as winter weather moves in
@entity29 takes 1 - 2 punch " @entity0 is a unique housing environment , " said @entity31 , federal coordinating officer for @entity16 , on wednesday
" we had to come up with something
" the agency 's typical approach to disaster relief , such as the widespread use of emergency trailers for displaced residents and long - term rental assistance , does n't work as well in the @entity42
rental housing vacancies across @entity0 are less than 5 % , while holiday season hotel rooms are packed with tourists and travelers , leaving few options for those in need of shelter , authorities said
adding to the dilemma , crowding persists in the city 's public housing units , where more than 160,000 families were on the waiting list before the storm
can @entity59 capitalize politically on @entity11 ? officials are expected to focus on getting power restored in places where the sheer extent of the electrical damage has made utility companies cautious about reconnecting homes to the power grid
they will also implement structural repairs to make the homes adequate shelters for incoming winter weather
repairs could include tarps , plastic and plywood
map : see images of destruction , recovery across the @entity80 @entity16 is putting forth " an essential package of necessary fixes so that people can get back into their homes , " said @entity31
" this is not a complete repair
" more than 17,000 households remain without power across @entity0
that does not include more than 30,000 customers who " are unable to safely receive power without customer repairs , " according to the @entity91
@entity93 residents sue utility in hard - hit places like the @entity97 and @entity98 , where residents have often clung to their damp homes instead of evacuating , officials said the new program will better cater to the stark realities of the crisis
" our home is not that destroyed
we do n't have no heat ( and ) it 's very cold in the apartment , " said @entity105 , a 41 - year - old resident of @entity106 , @entity107
" we just need heat , water and electricity
" residents like @entity114 , whose homes are damaged but not destroyed , are likely @entity16 's target customers
but reservations about safety persist
opinion : do n't rebuild " my house shifted about 5 inches , " said @entity119 , 55 , a @entity120 resident of @entity98
" we do n't know if the quick repair ... is going to be safe enough
" a thicket of downed houses and washed - out roads lines several blocks in the @entity120 area after a torrent of wind and water swept across the coastal neighborhood on october 29
" i do n't know how minor repairs get you back in your home , " she said
@entity11 amplifies struggles for low - income families others seemed somewhat encouraged by the federal plan
" there are a lot of people that do n't have their own contractors , so it 's a good program for those people , " said @entity141 , a 41 - year - old resident of @entity98 , whose rental property was destroyed in the storm
but the program is not meant to address the needs of those made homeless
that displaced population has mostly inhabited hundreds of city shelters , holed up with friends and family members or taken to living in more perilous places , like their cars
costs of @entity11 in the billions meanwhile , signs of normalcy continued to surface across the tri-state area
but those still in the dark require inspectors to go door - to - door to check individual electrical panels to avoid further damage and potential electrical fires , raising the possibility of a long and cold winter for those still without proper shelter
