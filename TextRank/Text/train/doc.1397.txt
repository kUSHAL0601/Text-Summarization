@entity0 , the space tourism company founded by @entity2 billionaire @entity1 , has barred @entity4 nationals from applying for spots on its first commercial flights
cashed - up @entity4 passport holders have reportedly been willing to pay the $ 260,000 fare for a spot on the inaugural @entity0 space flight scheduled for later this year , but have been turned down in order to comply with @entity14 anti-espionage laws , the @entity7 reports
rocket engines on the @entity0 craft -- named @entity17 and @entity18 -- are reportedly considered military grade technology under @entity21 @entity14 arms trafficking laws
the legislation was designed to prevent foreign powers , such as @entity4 , from getting hold of @entity14 military tech secrets
" both @entity17 and @entity18 are @entity14 technology and are therefore subject to @entity14 regulations , " said @entity26 , a spokesperson for a @entity0 accredited partner in @entity28
@entity4 nationals with multiple passports or @entity14 residency might be considered for a place on the space trips , @entity0 said
short -- but sweet ? @entity0 has already accrued almost $ 70 million in deposits for spots on its space flights , according to the @entity7 , the first of which is due to take place later this year
a ticket gets you a 110 - kilometer trip into the atmosphere and six minutes of weightlessness before returning to @entity46
the cost of the tickets has been criticized as excessive for such relatively brief excursions
@entity0 will be headquartered and launching its flights from @entity51 , a planned epicenter of space tourism near the @entity55 town of @entity56
" come visit us ! " says the @entity51 website
@entity61 first learned of the story on @entity63
