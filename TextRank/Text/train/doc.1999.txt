the gorilla sector of the park " has been swallowed up in this conflict , " said @entity12 , communications director for the refuge
she fears for the animals ' safety , not least because mountain gorillas do not always flee the sound of gunfire and mortars , she said
" there are documented cases of the gorillas getting caught in the crossfire and getting killed , " she said
" it 's the chaos of war and they are right in the middle of it
" that leaves the situation " extremely precarious " for the critically endangered species , she said
about 200 of the world 's 700 known mountain gorillas lived in the park when rebel leader @entity39 's men took control of the gorilla section last year , @entity12 said
at least nine gorillas are known to have been killed in @entity2 last year
there are no mountain gorillas in captivity , she added
" the mountain gorillas live in the wild
they do n't reproduce in captivity
" @entity39 's fighters seized the headquarters of the park on october 26 , park officials announced last month , a move park director @entity54 called " unprecedented
" the seizure forced hundreds of rangers who normally monitor the gorillas to flee
the rangers " track and monitor the mountain gorillas , " freeing them from snares and intervening medically in life - threatening situations , @entity12 said
" it 's really important to keep track on a daily basis
" that has been impossible for weeks , she said
" there has been a complete lack of knowledge about the gorillas for some time
@entity39 's forces control about 50 percent of the park , including the gorilla sector
" the gorilla section of the park lies in a strategically important area near the borders of @entity79 and @entity80 , she explained
fighting between @entity11 government soldiers and rebels led by @entity39 has displaced more than 250,000 people
that 's in addition to roughly 800,000 who already had been driven from their homes , according to the @entity88
on sunday , even as there was fighting in @entity91 province , @entity39 met with @entity92 , the @entity88 special envoy for the area
" @entity39 engaged on two things in my presence : the respect of the ceasefire on the one hand and on the other , the maintenance of humanitarian corridors in order to give unconditional access to assist vulnerable populations , " @entity92 said following the meeting
but @entity92 said nobody could say for certain what @entity39 wanted to gain from his offensive
@entity2 is a @entity108 and @entity110 's oldest national park
it was formerly known as @entity2
