-- a new global racing series is launching with hopes of rivaling @entity3 , but there is one major difference -- the cars will all have electric engines
the @entity9 series has been backed by @entity10 , president of motorsport 's world governing body the @entity13 ( @entity11 )
the former @entity15 chief has signed an agreement with a group of investors to stage a series of races on city - center tracks
the investors , who already have @entity23 signed up as a host city , plan to have 10 teams and 20 drivers ready to race in 2014 , following a year of testing
" this new competition at the heart of major cities is certain to attract a new audience , " @entity10 told the @entity11 website
" this spectacular series will offer both entertainment and a new opportunity to share the @entity11 values and objectives of clean energy , mobility and sustainability with a wider and younger audience as well
" @entity9 's cars will be based around a prototype designed by @entity45 company @entity44
the 780 kg vehicles will have a maximum speed of 220 kmh ( 137 mph ) and run on a lithium - iron battery that can provide 25 minutes ' racing
the chairman of the new series will be @entity52 , who already supports teams in the @entity11 's gp2 and @entity51
" we see this as a great opportunity to create a new and exciting spectacle mixing racing , clean energy and sustainability , looking to the future , " @entity52 said
" we expect this championship to become the framework for research and development around the electric car , a key element for the future of our cities
" the @entity11 has been eager to encourage motorsport to lead the motor industry in harnessing the potential of electric engines , with innovations such as the kers system -- which harnesses braking energy to provide an engine boost every lap -- already being adapted to mass production cars
from 2014 , @entity3 pit lanes will have to be electric only .
