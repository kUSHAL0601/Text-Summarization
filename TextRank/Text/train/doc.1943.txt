@entity0 , @entity1 -- a 53 - day journey by train might sound like murder on the @entity6 , but one enterprising @entity8 travel company is offering rail tickets that take nearly eight weeks to circumnavigate the globe
as you 'd expect for the $ 36,500 price tag , you wo n't be spending six weeks cooped in the cheap seats listening to other people yammering into their cell phones
the ticket offered by @entity17 is first class most of the way , crossing three continents in the kind of style you 'd associate with a golden age of rail travel -- albeit without the top hats and tailcoats
en route , passengers get to experience some of the world 's most luxurious trains , including the @entity32 's @entity31 from @entity33 , the @entity34 and the @entity8 @entity35
the itinerary begins in @entity0 on may 18 , 2015
" we 've got some pretty long journeys in our portfolio , but we 've never done the full circumnavigation , " @entity37 of @entity17 said
passengers will fly to @entity43 and then spend 20 days crossing @entity44 by train
they call in at @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 and then sample a few classic rail rides such as @entity52 's scenic @entity51 route and the steam - powered @entity54 & @entity55 line
ten epic train journeys there 's a side trip to the @entity59 , a sojourn in @entity61 and a boat ride to @entity63 , where passengers take to the air once again to reach @entity66
the trip sticks firmly to the rails from then on , taking passengers from @entity70 , home of terra cotta warriors , to @entity72 and then on to @entity73 via @entity33
the journey links up with the epic @entity76 line to reach @entity77 before pressing on into @entity78
after calling at @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , it heads back to @entity0
@entity85 says the company had sold its first tickets but is planning to limit numbers to about 25 to " keep it fairly exclusive
" " there is a huge number of people who are interested in rail as a method of travel , " he said
" this is quite clearly the longest and most expensive trip we 've ever done so it 's going to appeal to the wealthy and , at 53 days , people with time on their hands
" if 53 days sounds a little on the slow side , another company offers a similar journey in reverse , via @entity105 , that takes a mere 40 days
@entity106 , based in @entity107 , charges $ 32,765 for its escorted tour starting may 3
or you could just catch a plane
