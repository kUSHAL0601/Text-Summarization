-- an indictment unsealed in @entity2 tuesday provides further evidence of links between @entity6 affiliates in @entity7 and @entity8 , a growing concern to counter-terrorism officials
and the indictment also sheds light on the @entity14 administration 's policy on how to handle terror suspects detained overseas
the indictment charges @entity16 with providing material support to the extremist group @entity18 in @entity7 , and to @entity19 ( @entity19 ) in @entity8
he is also charged with conspiring to teach and demonstrate the making of explosives
if convicted , he faces a mandatory life sentence
@entity16 , a @entity7 national , was captured by @entity24 forces on april 19 in what the @entity24 attorney 's office in @entity2 describes only as " the @entity28
" he was interrogated overseas for " intelligence purposes " for two months before finally being transferred to @entity31 custody and brought to the @entity24 tuesday , when he made an appearance in federal court
during that appearance , he pleaded not guilty , according to @entity34 , spokeswoman for the @entity24 attorney 's office
@entity37 was held on a @entity39 ship in the @entity28 after his capture until being brought to @entity2 for tuesday 's court appearance , according to the attorney 's office
neither the indictment nor the accompanying press release disclosed where the interrogation took place , but there is a substantial @entity24 naval presence in the @entity49
according to the indictment , @entity16 , said to be in his mid- 20s , provided material support for @entity18 , which controls large areas of central and southern @entity7
he also provided the group with explosives , weapons and communications equipment
he also spent time in @entity8 in 2010 and earlier this year , allegedly receiving explosives and other training from @entity19 , which in the past two years has emerged as one of the most active parts of the organization
unconfirmed local reports in @entity7 have spoken of @entity18 boats leaving @entity64 for southern @entity8 as @entity66 groups there -- including @entity6 - have taken advantage of a growing political vacuum
@entity37 is also alleged to have tried to broker a weapons deal with @entity19 on behalf of @entity18
both groups are designated as terrorist organizations by the @entity24
@entity24 officials have recently spoken of growing links between @entity18 and @entity19 , and their ambitions to hit targets overseas
a joint @entity78 - @entity77 task force has recently stepped up pressure on @entity18 , visiting @entity7 to gather intelligence against the group
late last month a @entity24 drone strike against an @entity18 camp near the southern port of @entity64 is said to have killed several militants
@entity0 's @entity86 contributed to this report .
