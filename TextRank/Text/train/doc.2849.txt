-- weeks after @entity4 's startling admission that he used performance - enhancing drugs throughout his cycling career , the world of sport has been rocked by explosive new allegations about cheating in sports - mad @entity8
on thursday , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) published the findings of a year - long investigation that claimed the use of banned substances such as growth stimulants was " widespread " among professional athletes across a range of sports there
in many instances , the report said , the substances are not yet approved for human use
in its conclusion , the @entity10 said there are clear parallels between what has been discovered in @entity8 and the @entity29 investigation into @entity4 -- who was recently stripped of his seven @entity32 titles -- underlining the transnational threat posed by doping to professional sport
the report stressed that it is not just athletes that are involved , but their support staff , doctors and organized criminal elements
what is doping ? it involves an athlete taking drugs or blood products to artificially boost their performance during training and competition
what substances are we talking about here ? the @entity10 report identified an evolving market in a new generation of @entity56 ( @entity57 ) -- known as peptides and hormones
according to the @entity10 , some of these substances are perceived by athletes to be undetectable , making them attractive to those seeking to gain an unfair advantage
-- growth hormone releasing peptides " peptides " stimulate the release of an increased level of human growth hormone ( @entity70 ) , making them popular among athletes and body builders to promote muscle growth
they are also used in combination with anabolic steroids -- which also promote size and strength -- to maintain muscle gain
they are sold as a cream or in a solution for injection
while some peptide supplements are perfectly legal as a recovery aid after exercise , growth - stimulating peptides are classified as a prohibited substance on the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) prohibited list and therefore are banned for use by professional athletes in and out of competition
-- growth hormone @entity96 the report also identified the use of @entity100 , a variant of growth hormone with fat - burning properties often taken by athletes to increase their power
clinical trials suggest it may even help to repair and enhance muscle formation , according to the @entity10 report and @entity91
@entity110 - 9604 is not prohibited by @entity91
-- @entity111 ( @entity111 ) like anabolic steroids , @entity111 build strength , bone density and muscle mass by stimulating the body 's androgen receptor , which itself boosts the uptake of testosterone -- the main male hormone -- into cells
sarms have a lower risk of side effects normally associated with the prolonged use of anabolic steroids , such as high blood pressure , liver damage , depression , baldness , the development of male characteristics in females and the development of breast tissue in males
according to @entity10 report , @entity111 are often used in combination with other @entity139 , including @entity70
sarms are a prohibited substance for elite athletes both in and out of competition under @entity91 rules
-- @entity146 growth factors ( @entity147 - 1 ) @entity147 is one of the primary hormones necessary for cell growth in the body
many athletes use @entity147 for its anabolic effect in muscle and to facilitate the development of cartilage and bone
in many cases , athletes will use @entity70 and @entity147 in small doses to reduce the chances of returning a positive anti-doping sample , the @entity10 report says
@entity147 is also banned by @entity91
-- mechano growth factor ( mgf ) a variant of @entity147 , @entity164 leads to an increase in the muscle cells necessary for adult muscles to continue growth beyond their genetic limit
it is often used by bodybuilders due to its role in muscle repair following exercise
banned under @entity91 rules , @entity164 is also illegal to possess in many countries without a prescription
-- other substances the @entity10 report also identified a number of other performance - enhancing substances -- some being prescription only medicines : @entity186 and @entity187 -- both peptides with anabolic effects , which are both prohibited by @entity91
@entity190 -- promotes muscle growth
banned by @entity91 , with its possession without legal authority is illegal
@entity194 -- used to speed up recovery from injury , it is an unregulated substance banned by @entity91 .
