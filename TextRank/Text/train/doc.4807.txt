i 'm really not sure how i feel about the color purple
it 's elegant and regal , but part of me also wants it to die in a ditch
no offense to our mountain majesties or eggplants
but , really , purple is kind of a confused , soulless color that , deep down , wishes it was blue , yet ca n't shake the fact that somewhere down on the family tree one of its relatives had hot , unprotected color sex with red
" i shall not deny my feelings for you
" " that 's great , @entity22
but what 's with the leather chaps ? " love it or hate it , get used to it
@entity28 is going to be big in 2014 , at least according to our color overlords at the @entity32 corporation who recently announced the upcoming color of the year : @entity35
with its " enchanting harmony of fuchsia , purple and pink undertones , " @entity35 actually seems rather zen and peaceful
but it also sounds exotic and , dare i say , mildly hallucinagenic
trust me , someone at @entity42 will find a way to smoke this color
now , if it all seems a little weird to you -- the fact that there even exists a color of the year -- understand that @entity32 , headquartered in @entity49 , @entity50 , heralds itself as " the global color authority and provider of professional color standards for the design industry
" basically , the company name has become synonymous worldwide with color language and communication
that means a designer in @entity60 can say to a manufacturer in @entity62 , " we want all of our widgets to be @entity64 " and they 'll both know exactly what that looks like
that 's assuming @entity69 is actually a shade of green in @entity32 's official palette
if it 's not , it should be
i have several samples under my desk
regardless , @entity32 18 - 3224 , @entity35 , is apparently the big color for next year
and why ? because they said so
granted , there 's a lot of research that goes into this big decision , for choosing a color of the year is slightly more involved than just asking your buddy , @entity85 , to decide
" " can you be more specific , @entity85 ? " " you know , like an orange
" it has to be bigger than that
after all , this is the one color that will supposedly express " what is taking place in the global zeitgeist " thus , to finally crown @entity98 , @entity32 searched the world over for design and color influences , pulling ideas from entertainment to technology
and , in the end , viewing the planet as one big global community , they decided , " @entity110 , this is sorta where we 're at
of course , @entity35 marks is a drastic departure from 2013 's wild and daring color of the year , @entity32 17 - 5641 @entity115
which , i submit , looks astonishingly close to @entity69
perhaps as a return to civility , @entity35 appears somewhat closer to 2012 's color of the year , @entity32 17 - 1463 @entity121
" can you be more specific , @entity85 ? " " you know , like a tangerine tango
" really , i have no idea what the hell any of this means
but , especially to those in the design community , it matters
and , somehow , as a brand , @entity32 has actually become culturally iconic
at least in certain circles
in fact , now you can literally buy accessories like mugs and @entity139 cases that are intentionally designed to look like a @entity32 color swatch
it 's sort of like getting your favorite element from the periodic table printed on something because , damn it , you love @entity146
but , @entity32 merchandise , in a way , actually makes sense
i mean , why not express and represent yourself with a color
perhaps asking one 's @entity32 will even become a part of our lexicon
" hey man , what 's your @entity32 ? " " oh , i 'm not wearing pants today
" so , in 2014 keep an eye out for purple
from fashion runways to websites to living rooms , @entity35 is going to be everywhere
well , maybe not everywhere
but definitely under my desk
follow @ @entity166 on @entity167 .
