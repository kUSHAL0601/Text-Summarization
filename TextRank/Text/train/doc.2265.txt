@entity0 lived inside a heavily secured compound
but the public diplomacy officer for the @entity3 in @entity4 was always pushing to get out
" we thought she was relatively safe in the embassy compound , but as it turned out , @entity0 really wanted to do a lot more , " her father , @entity5 , told @entity6
" she was always finding projects and assignments that took her outside to the various provinces within and around @entity15 , and that was what she wanted to do , " he said
" that was what really drove her
" this past weekend , the 25 - year - old was trying to do just that -- delivering books to a school in southern @entity15 -- when a suicide bomber smashed into her convoy saturday , killing @entity0 and four others
she is believed to be the first @entity29 diplomat killed since the september attack in @entity31 , @entity32
her death was a grim reminder of the risks and importance of pushing for change in " one of the toughest places on earth , " @entity29 secretary of state @entity33 said sunday
it was an " extraordinary , harsh contradiction , " @entity33 said , to see an attacker kill " a young , 25 - year - old woman with all of the future ahead of her , believing in the possibilities of diplomacy , of changing people 's lives , of making a difference , having an impact , who was taking knowledge in books to deliver them to a school
" officials did not say who they believe was behind the blast
but @entity33 offered a sharp condemnation of the violence as he spoke to @entity29 diplomats stationed in @entity63
" the folks who want to kill people , and that 's all they want to do , are scared of knowledge
and they want to shut the doors and they do n't want people to make their choices about the future
for them , it 's ' you do things my way and if you do n't , we 'll throw acid in your face
we 'll put a bullet in your face , ' to a young girl trying to learn , " @entity33 said
" so this is a huge challenge for us
it is a confrontation with modernity , with possibilities , and everything that our country stands for , everything we stand for , is embodied in what @entity0 stood for
" friend : ' she pushed you to be better ' @entity0 graduated from @entity92 in 2009 with a degree in international relations and joined the @entity95 soon afterward
" i remember how excited she was when she got in and started her training
she would always talk about it , because she was one of those natural leaders , " said @entity98 , 26 , a close friend who first met @entity0 in college
" when she was passionate about something , she would let everyone know
... you could just tell when she got in the @entity95 , she saw that this was her opportunity to make a big impact on the world
" and her enthusiasm was infectious , said @entity98 , a medical filmmaker in @entity109 who recently vacationed with @entity0 in @entity110
" she always got people interested in what she was involved in
... whenever i knew i was going to see her , i 'd always make sure i was brushed up on foreign affairs
she was one of those people , you did n't want to let her down , " he said
" she pushed you to be better
" @entity33 laments death of @entity29 civilian in @entity15 it was clear that " there was no better place for her " than the @entity95 , her parents said in a written statement
after a tour of duty in @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity0 volunteered for an assignment at the @entity3 in @entity4 and had been working there since july , her parents said
" we are consoled knowing that she was doing what she loved , and that she was serving her country by helping to make a positive difference in the world , " they said
before she joined the @entity136 , @entity0 served on the board of directors for the @entity138 ' @entity140 program , spending a summer cycling across the @entity29 to raise money and awareness
" @entity0 was an incredibly optimistic , fearless , and giving person , " said @entity144 , the program 's founder
" we mourn a life cut short , " he said sunday , " but are blessed to have shared in it
" mother : ' she was just so exuberant about everything ' @entity152 's @entity151 profile gives a glimpse of her life in @entity15
one photo shows a group skiing in the @entity15 mountains
another shows her standing behind a lectern at the embassy , surrounded by @entity29 flags
another , titled " @entity164 around @entity165 , " shows a smiling @entity0 sitting beside men in camouflage , wearing a helmet and a flak jacket
the prospect of her working in @entity15 worried her parents at first , but her passion for the job and the good work she hoped to do won them over
" she really thought there was a lot to be done there , and she could be part of it
... as parents you always want to make sure no harm comes to your children , but i knew that she wanted to embrace this opportunity , " her mother , @entity180 , said monday , " so she had our full - hearted support and blessing to apply for that position
" public outreach projects like delivering textbooks to schools , organizing educational efforts and working with women 's groups to promote equality were parts of her job she particularly loved , her parents said
they spoke to @entity6 monday morning from @entity200 in @entity201 , where they were awaiting the arrival of their daughter 's remains just over a week after their last conversation with her
in that @entity207 chat , she excitedly told her parents about @entity33 's recent visit to @entity15
she sent them photos and a congratulatory e-mail she received from the ambassador for her work during the trip
" she was just so exuberant about everything that had transpired during that trip and what she had done , " @entity180 said
" obviously , we were very proud of her
" @entity33 was emotional sunday as he spoke of @entity0 's death and described his experience meeting her during the recent @entity15 trip
" i remember her -- vivacious , smart , capable , chosen often by the ambassador there to be the lead person because of her capabilities , " he said
this weekend , @entity0 " was just trying to deliver books , bring knowledge to people -- books in their own language -- in order to help them know about the possibilities of life , " @entity33 said on monday
" and some wanton terrorist , out of the blue , nameless and faceless and now lifeless , attacked this group of people and took five lives
" neighbor : ' she had candle power ' residents in the @entity242 , @entity243 , neighborhood where the @entity0 family lives said they were devastated by the news
" @entity0 was one of those rare people who , you were lucky if you were near her
she had candle power , " one neighbor told @entity6 affiliate @entity249
" she brightened everyone 's life
" @entity253 , whose sister was @entity0 's best friend , told the @entity6 affiliate that the " beautiful and brave " diplomat was doing her dream job
" the world has really lost somebody who was going to do a lot of good things
... every dangerous place she wanted to go there , because that 's where the hard work was , " @entity253 said
in @entity0 's memory , @entity6 affiliate @entity267 reported , @entity29 flags lined the road near her family 's home on sunday
a large photograph she posted on her @entity151 profile less than three weeks ago shows another road on the other side of the world , lined with @entity15 flags .
