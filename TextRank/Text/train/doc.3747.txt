@entity0 , @entity1 -- ahead of a landmark vote in @entity1 , an international monitor warned that @entity6 's successors risk repeating the ousted dictator 's mistakes unless electoral winners make rule of law a top priority
many months after the february 17 uprising that rid @entity1 of @entity6 and his autocratic rule , @entity1 will choose a new government saturday
much is at stake in that vote , said @entity17 , which issued a scathing report thursday on widespread @entity1 lawlessness , focusing on armed militias operating above the law
in @entity23 , @entity1 vow that the vote will go on the report documented arbitrary arrests , detention , torture and impunity for unlawful killings
it said @entity17 staffers visited @entity1 in may and june and found many militias refusing to disarm and that the government has only been able to dismantle a handful of the armed groups
" it is deeply depressing that after so many months , the authorities have failed so comprehensively to break the stranglehold of the militias on @entity1 security , with dramatic consequences for the people that bear the brunt of their actions , " said @entity36 , @entity17 's @entity37 and @entity39 deputy director
" calls for an end to repression and injustice were what led to the ' 17 february revolution ' in the first place , " she said
" without immediate action to stop abuses and lawlessness , there is a very real danger @entity1 could end up reproducing and entrenching the same patterns of violations we have seen over the past four decades "
@entity17 said it spoke with two sisters -- 27 and 32 -- who were stopped by militiamen at a checkpoint in february and forced at gunpoint to a nearby farm
" one was suspended from a door for hours , had boiling water poured over her head , and was beaten and stabbed while being accused of supporting the former government of colonel @entity6 , " the report said
" the other was also suspended and beaten
the husband of one of them , who was detained at the same time , has disappeared
" @entity17 also found instances of revenge beatings and vigilante - style justice carried out against detainees held by people who suffered under @entity6
the report said that sometimes detainees were held in cities where @entity6 's regime allegedly committed human rights violations
it gave the example of neurosurgeon @entity92
he was abducted in @entity0 in april by a militia from @entity94 that blamed him for the death of a relative due to alleged medical neglect
the doctor was beaten with sticks and whips
in court , @entity92 testified that he was n't the treating physician in the case and that other doctors had operated twice to save the man who died
@entity92 was charged with murder and will stand trial in @entity108 , where there is strong sentiment against him , @entity17 said
@entity1 from all walks of life took to the streets to stand up to injustice , @entity17 said , but now their leaders are undermining their aspirations
and public criticism of the revolutionary militias is uncommon after they were hailed as heroes who ousted @entity6
critics of the militias , @entity17 said , are often labeled as @entity6 loyalists
@entity17 urged @entity1 authorities to do more
@entity2 was not successful in obtaining immediate comment from @entity1 government officials
it said @entity1 should build a judicial system that will " hold perpetrators to account in trials that meet international standards and provide redress to the thousands of victims of human rights violations
" that position was supported by policymakers and @entity1 observers
@entity137 , the top @entity138 envoy in @entity1 , agreed that @entity1 's @entity139 has not done enough ; he said his office has been pushing to accelerate the handover of detainees in custody of revolutionary brigades to proper state authorities
" we have also repeatedly pressed the government to take responsibility for protecting the physical integrity of those in detention , even if they go on being held outside state authority for a limited period of time , " @entity137 told @entity2
@entity137 said the @entity138 was trying to assist the @entity1 in developing a strong judicial system
" certainly we are not satisfied with the rate of progress in that respect and very concerned by continuing torture and abuse of detainees in custody and continuing arrests outside legal process , " @entity137 said
@entity17 said 4,000 detainees remain in centers outside government reach
some have been detained for a year
analyst @entity169 said the interim government appears unable and unwilling to try to assert its control over a complicated network of armed militias
in a commentary for @entity2 , @entity169 , a senior analyst at the @entity179 , described chaos over the past week in the seizure of @entity0 's airport , attacks on a @entity176 diplomatic office in @entity23 followed by one on a @entity184 convoy , and violent tribal clashes in the south
" the current security environment , dominated by militias , does not constitute a proper security framework : it lacks coordination and creates gaps that allow for conflict between rival groups , as well as criminal activities like smuggling -- and terrorism , which appears to be a new factor in the east , " @entity169 wrote
@entity17 said @entity1 who emerge as the nation 's new leadership after saturday 's election will face a tough task of piecing together a land damaged and divided by years of mistrust and repressive rule
@entity6 , @entity17 said , cracked down on his opponents in protecting his 1969 revolution
saturday 's victors , the group said , must prevent a similar outcome
international court staff freed after detention in @entity1 @entity214 hands former @entity215 over to @entity1 extremist triangle a growing threat to @entity39 and @entity176 @entity2 's @entity218 reported from @entity219 and @entity220 , from @entity0 , @entity1 .
