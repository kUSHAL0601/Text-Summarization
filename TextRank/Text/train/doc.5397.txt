@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's home is a shambles , and a large bandage is draped across his head -- not from four previous brain surgeries he had endured but from the plywood that smacked him , while he was outside trying to warn a family across the street about a coming tornado
and yet sunday , the @entity0 , @entity1 , resident was all about giving thanks
thankful for the neighbors who , after the twister slammed through his and other homes , had rushed over and picked up the washer and driver sitting atop his grandson
another grandson had been blown away from the house , only to be found with two big cuts on his arm
@entity4 also expressed appreciation for staff at @entity29 who , he said , had treated him and his family with a minimum of paperwork and maximum of caring and expertise
tornado threats from @entity38 to @entity39 and lastly , he gestured to those working feverishly behind him -- some of them neighbors , some strangers -- to clear the rubble
" we are truly blessed
@entity45 saved us , and that 's what it 's about , " @entity4 said
following an earlier bout of severe weather , the tornado barreled through @entity0 just after midnight sunday
compounding the fact it struck at such a late hour , the high winds " took out " the transmitter for the public siren and tornado notification system , and " we lost our manual override " when the electricity was knocked out , city manager @entity52 said -- meaning there was no warning system
" it caught us asleep , mostly , " mayor @entity63 told @entity2
afterward , it was learned that five people in @entity0 -- a community of about 12,000 people about 85 miles west of @entity68 and not far from the @entity69 -- had died as a result
while the powerful system hit a hospital , blew truckers off highways and shredded buildings in several states , @entity0 was the only place where fatalities were reported over the weekend
they include @entity80 , who died along with two girls -- presumed to be his 5 - and 7 - year - old daughters -- according to state medical examiner 's spokesman @entity83
@entity63 earlier said that a father and his two children were inside a trailer at the @entity88 when the tornado rolled through and killed them
@entity91 identified one of the other dead as @entity94
a 10 - year - old girl who was found with him is thought to be @entity94 's daughter
@entity63 had said that two people died when the car they were in rolled over several times
still , given the power and timing of the storm , @entity1 gov. @entity101 said late sunday afternoon that she believes it is " remarkable that we did n't have more loss of life in @entity0
" @entity101 detailed some survival stories from the small city
one man was lying asleep on his sofa , with his dog beside him , when the tornado came through , @entity101 said
the intense winds picked up him and his sofa and dumped him behind his house
but except for some scrapes , he escaped unscathed
the governor also recalled how a woman described hunkering down with her family , wrapping her arms around her pregnant daughter , as the twister approached
afterward , the daughter was rushed to a nearby hospital where her baby was delivered , safely by cesarean section , according to @entity101
@entity4 was a survivor long before this weekend 's storms , having undergone two heart procedures in addition to his four brain surgeries
his latest wound , a big gash to his head , was stitched back up early sunday
he said he did not initially notice it , as he rushed to get his grandson to the hospital even before he 'd located his wife of 43 years
hours later , @entity4 was back where his home once stood
people young and old were working hard nearby , tossing debris , cutting through wood with chainsaws and otherwise trying to bring order to the chaos caused by the tornado
" this is @entity0 , @entity1 , " said @entity4
" we 're here to take care of each other ... we 're truly blessed in so many ways , and one of them is to live here
" as to what what treasured mementos he hopes to find among the wreckage , @entity4 said he already had everything he needed
my son , my daughter , my son - in - law , my grandbabies , my wife , " he said
" everything else is brick and stick , and they 're all easily replaced
" @entity2 's @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report .
