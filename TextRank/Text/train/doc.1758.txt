-- winning a pageant title is life - changing , especially during the year of your reign
if it 's a big crown , like a state title , it can be like a full - time gig as you prepare for the national event and make appearances
@entity10 set right to work after getting her tiara on june 21 , when she was named miss @entity13
she reportedly had even dropped out of the @entity15 so she could prepare for the @entity17 contest in september
but now , she wo n't be going to the premier beauty contest
pageant officials announced friday there had been a mistake in tabulating what must have been very close final scores
and days after getting her crown , @entity24 was giving it back , so the @entity29 @entity13 organization could give it to @entity30 , originally announced as first runner - up
the executive director of the pageant said on @entity34 that the organization had to make things right
" integrity means doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances
it takes having the courage to do the right thing , no matter what the consequences will be , " @entity40 wrote
@entity10 's mother , @entity45 , told the @entity46 she was told that one judge changed his mind in the last 15 seconds and tried to indicate it on his ballot
" it was a human error , " @entity40 told the paper
" we have two auditors ... but they unfortunately missed one of the markings on the ballot
" @entity30 , a student at @entity58 , said on her @entity34 page that she had bonded with @entity24 during their week at the competition
" i know our friendship will remain strong , " she wrote , before going on to thank pageant officials for their honesty and integrity
in a blog linked off her @entity68 page , @entity10 said : " there is one big idea that i would like to emphasize : i was miss @entity13 for a glimpse , but more importantly , i have been @entity10 since day one
a title does not define me
it opens doors , but it does not dictate who i am and where i am going
i would like to think of opportunities like this as stepping stones to my future
i can not deny that this was one of the biggest " steps " i have come across , and i had become very comfortable and excited about the growth it would bring
" the @entity13 mix - up is similar to one in 2013 where the announced winner of @entity87 , @entity88 , gave up her crown after 24 hours when officials discovered a typographical error
and it comes just after @entity93 had her @entity17 dreams squashed when officials ruled her out because she is too old under pageant rules .
