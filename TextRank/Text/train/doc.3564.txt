-- the @entity1 is expected to issue a number of historic decisions in the coming weeks about how the government deals with race issues
with the @entity7 and affirmative action on the agenda , the nation is watching closely to see what the highest court will say
the court is tackling affirmative action through a case involving the @entity14 and a student who was denied admission
with the @entity7 , the court is looking again at the law , including @entity18 , which stipulates that some jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination are required to submit changes in districting and voting laws for clearance
both issues came out of the 1960s , one under president @entity28 in 1965 and another under president @entity29 in 1969 , with the intention of helping to correct more than a century of racial inequality
in 1965 , in the wake of massive grassroots protests , @entity32 passed the historic legislation that ensured the federal government would protect the right of @entity38 to freely participate in the vote
@entity28 responded to immense pressure that came from the rev. @entity41 and civil rights protesters , who put themselves on the line and suffered violence to obtain this right
selected quotes from @entity1 affirmative action in 1969 , the @entity48 launched the @entity49 , requiring unions involved in projects receiving federal funds to hire a percentage of @entity38 in proportion to the composition of the local population
@entity29 supported this plan as much for politics as policy
his goal was to divide the @entity62 coalition by pitting @entity38 against organized labor
the goal of both programs , though born for very different political reasons , was for the government to proactively tackle problems that aggravated racial equality
@entity28 's speech in 1965 laid out the rationale
in a powerful address at @entity73 , he said : " you do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying : now you are free to go where you want , and do as you desire , and choose the leaders you please
you do not take a person who , for years , has been hobbled by chains and liberate him , bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say , ' you are free to compete with all the others , " and still justly believe that you have been completely fair
" these programs have been controversial from the start
a summary of major upcoming @entity1 decisions as the late historian @entity90 argued with regards to affirmative action , they moved away from the idea that the government would guarantee individual rights after they had been violated toward establishing policies whereby the government would take steps to ensure that racist practices would not even be allowed to occur
the goal , though more controversial , was to take stronger steps to design institutions that would not perpetuate racism
during the late 1960s , some members of the @entity29 administration tried to push for changes to the @entity7 that would have severely weakened the legislation , including dismantling the clearance provision that required governments holding elections to gain approval from the @entity112 to any changes in their voting process
but the supporters pushed back , and the laws remained intact
there have been repeated challenges to the @entity7 and affirmative action , especially as it was extended into areas other than employment , such as education , but they have failed
this time the threat seems greater than before
the efforts of conservatives to transform the composition of the federal courts in a rightward direction are finally starting to pay off
for the first time , many experts feel the conservatives have the numbers they need to make substantial changes in both of these laws
the decisions will have huge ramifications
if the court begins to knock down these two pillars of civil rights policies , they would set back the government 's power to deal with racial problems
these programs have been a stunning success , slowly starting to repair the immense damage caused by the nation 's history of racism
the @entity7 produced big increases in the number of @entity38 voting and produced several generations of @entity38 elected officials
three questions for @entity155 affirmative action has helped bolster the @entity38 middle class and opened access to institutions from education to employment
to be sure , there are legitimate questions that have been raised about both of these programs , areas where they certainly could be strengthened
experts have debated how affirmative action programs could do a better job , particularly by putting emphasis on giving those who suffer from class - based discrimination more access to higher education rather than relying solely on race as a standard
but improving and strengthening programs is different than knocking them down
if the court makes the decision to turn back the clock on these two policies , it would be a huge setback for the civil rights movement that changed the nation 50 years ago
even with all the progress we 've seen , the court must be cautious before weakening programs that respond to the many racial challenges that still need to be fixed , as well as to new ones that have emerged
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .
