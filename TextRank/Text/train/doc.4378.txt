@entity0 -- @entity3 's decision to close a key @entity5 military base is " regrettable , " secretary of state @entity6 said , but it wo n't affect the @entity5 military effort in nearby @entity8
@entity9 in @entity3 serves as a @entity5 supply route for troops and supplies into @entity8
on friday , @entity14 announced it would assist the @entity5 in transporting nonmilitary cargo to @entity8 , foreign minister @entity13 said
the @entity5 uses @entity9 in @entity3 as a route for troops and supplies into @entity8
@entity3 president @entity17 announced tuesday that " all due procedures " were being initiated to close the base
" it 's regrettable that this is under consideration by the government of @entity3 , and we hope to have further discussions with them , " @entity20 told reporters thursday after a meeting with @entity24 foreign minister @entity23
" but we will proceed in a very effective manner no matter what the outcome of the @entity3 government 's deliberations might be
" @entity17 made his announcement at a news conference in @entity39 , @entity14 , following news reports of a multimillion - dollar aid package from @entity14 to @entity3
@entity13 said on @entity14 television that his country intends to help get vital cargo -- but no weapons or troops -- to @entity48 troops in @entity8
the @entity5 asked to transport the cargo through @entity14 territory to @entity8 , @entity13 said
the @entity5 military is planning to send an additional 30,000 troops to @entity8 to halt a resurgence of the @entity54
gen. @entity55 , who oversees @entity5 operations in the @entity57 and @entity58 , described @entity9 as having " an important role in the deployment of these forces " and in refueling aircraft
senior @entity64 officials said the @entity66 departments are working with @entity3 to keep the lease to the base
the officials said the @entity3 government has not yet responded to an offer to renew the lease
discussions are being conducted through the @entity75 in @entity3 and relevant @entity64 and @entity77 bureaus , the officials said
one official said the @entity5 has almost 18 months to renegotiate the lease before it expires and hopes @entity3 will reconsider their position
@entity77 spokesman @entity82 called @entity9 " a hugely important air base
" " it provides us with launching point to provide supplies in @entity8
we very much appreciate [ @entity3 ] support in using that base , and we hope to continue , " he said at a daily news briefing earlier this week
@entity20 said the @entity77 " is conducting an examination as to how else we would proceed that will not affect whatever decisions we make
" @entity55 was in @entity3 last month , partly to lobby the government to allow the @entity5 to keep using the base
he said he and @entity3 leaders did not discuss at all the possible closure of the base and said local officials told him there was " no foundation " for news reports about the issue
the mountainous former @entity104 republic is @entity58 's second poorest country
the @entity5 pays about $ 63 million a year for use of the base and employs more than 320 @entity3 citizens there , @entity55 said
the base has been in operation since december 2001 under @entity110 mandate
the @entity14 newspaper @entity111 reported tuesday that @entity14 would offer @entity3 a $ 300 million , 40 - year loan at an annual interest rate of 0.75 percent , and write off $ 180 million in @entity3 debt
@entity3 also is home to a @entity14 military base , at @entity116 , that officially opened in 2003
@entity3 prime minister @entity117 told @entity14 news agency @entity118 it was coincidence that talk of the base closure comes at the same time as the loan
" the @entity14 decision to grant a major loan has nothing to do with the pullout of the @entity5 air base from the @entity3 territory , " @entity117 said
the relationship between the @entity5 and @entity3 was damaged when a @entity5 airman killed a @entity3 citizen in december 2006
the airman was transferred out of @entity3 , and the dead man 's family was offered compensation
@entity55 said in january an investigation into the death was being reopened
in announcing the base closure , @entity17 said he was not satisfied with the inquiry and that his government 's " inability to provide security to its citizens " was proving a serious concern
@entity1 's @entity145 contributed to this report .
