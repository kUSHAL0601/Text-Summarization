-- world - famous physicist @entity1 recently said the world as we know it could be obliterated instantaneously
basically , we would be here one minute and gone the next
do n't you love physics ? when we speculate about catastrophes , we do n't mess around
the physics underlying this speculation is related to the @entity12 particle , whose discovery was announced july 4 , 2012 , at the @entity14 , the world 's largest particle accelerator , in @entity17 , @entity18
a leading physicist dubbed it the " @entity21 particle " -- a name i wish would disappear , as the particle and the laws of physics tell us nothing whatsoever about @entity21 , and @entity21 , if she exists , has not opined about the @entity12 particle
so , the simplified argument goes like something like this -- the @entity12 particle pervades space roughly uniformly , with a relatively high mass -- about 126 times that of the proton ( a basic building block of atoms )
theoretical physicists noted even before the @entity12 discovery that its relatively high mass would mean lower energy states exist
just as gravity makes a ball roll downhill , to the lowest point , so the universe ( or any system ) tends toward its lowest energy state
if the present universe could one day transition to that lower energy state , then it is unstable now and the transition to a new state would destroy all the particles that exist today
this would happen spontaneously at one point in space and time and then expand throughout the universe at the speed of light
there would be no warning , because the fastest a warning signal could travel is also at the speed of light , so the disaster and the warning would arrive at the same time
we know spontaneous events do happen
the universe began in a rapid expansion called inflation that lasted only a tiny fraction of a second
we owe our existence to that sudden event
spontaneous change is something you might have seen in chemistry class
super-cooled water will rapidly crystallize to ice if you drop a snowflake into it , just as a salt crystal will grow when added to a supersaturated salt solution
whether the existence of @entity12 means we 're doomed depends on the mass of another fundamental particle , the top quark
it 's the combination of the @entity12 and top quark masses that determine whether our universe is stable
experiments like those at the @entity14 allow us to measure these masses
but you do n't need to hold your breath waiting for the answer
the good news is that such an event is very unlikely and should not occur until the universe is many times its present age
many bad things are possible a large asteroid destroying the @entity112
getting hit by a bus
having space time gobbled up by instability in the @entity12 field
( for an engaging discussion of the many ways humans can be done in by the cosmos , see the marvelous " @entity121 ! " by bad astronomer @entity120
) are they likely ? humans have to prioritize by considering both outcome ( death or destruction ) and probability
rare events like the collision of a massive asteroid with the @entity112 could destroy life as we know it and perhaps the planet itself
however , the chances of a sufficiently massive asteroid intersecting the @entity112 in the vast emptiness of space is pretty low
collisions with much less massive asteroids are much more likely but much less destructive
so do n't lose any sleep over possible danger from the @entity12 , even if the most famous physicist in the world likes to speculate about it
you 're far more likely to be hit by lightning than taken out by the @entity12 .
