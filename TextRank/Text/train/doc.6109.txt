@entity0 , @entity1 -- despite deep public spending cuts that triggered waves of protests last year , @entity4 will not default on its debt payment obligations , prime minister @entity3 told @entity2
" this is not on the books ... it 's not on our road map
and this is why we are talking about these other measures , which we think are enough to be able to make things sustainable , " @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity14 on the sidelines of the @entity16 in @entity0 thursday
" obviously ( it will be ) difficult , but we have been doing our work , and we will be successful , " he said
the economic troubles in @entity4 last year sparked a wave of sovereign debt woes across @entity24 , especially hitting @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27
the value of the euro cratered during the debt crisis and raised lingering questions about the viability of the 17 - nation monetary union
a @entity34 released this week at @entity0 show 59 % of respondents believe that at least one or more euro nation would break from the monetary union by 2016 , and nearly three - quarters polled thought @entity4 would default on its loans
" well , maybe people will believe things , but that 's why we politicians are here , to put things on the right course , " @entity3 said when asked about the poll
" and there is the political will of our peoples and the leaders of the @entity52 ... to make sure that in 2016 and 2020 and on , the euro will exist
" his comments echoed the sentiment @entity57 president @entity56 who in his @entity0 address thursday said : " we will never abandon the euro
never ! @entity61 spells @entity24 , the euro is @entity24
@entity24 has meant 60 years of peace on our continent
we will never abandon that
" @entity56 's spirited defense of the euro underlined how high the stakes have become for the economic evolution of the continent
" to imagine that we might pull out of that is to ignore the fact that as people who have been at each other 's throats for centuries , we now have one wish , and that is lasting peace , " @entity56 said
but @entity80 has been challenged as the bailout of @entity4 thrust the spotlight on the uneven economics among member nations
besides debt woes in @entity4 , countries like @entity25 and @entity26 were deeply exposed to the crash of the housing bubble
meanwhile , the @entity90 economy -- the largest in @entity24 -- enjoyed its fastest expansion in two decades last year and its largest growth in gdp since @entity90 reunified in 1990
concern has grown of an unfair burden placed on larger economies by the problems of smaller economies like @entity4
but @entity3 said @entity4 is well on its way toward reducing its debt
" we have made very good progress , because we 're on track , and i would say , even , beyond
we have cut the deficit by over 6.5 percent , which is a huge cut , " @entity3 said
" we 've changed our pension system , it 's now a viable pension system , one of the most viable in @entity24
we 've changed our tax system , it 's transparent , more effective , hitting tax evasion , " he said
" but the structural things we 're changing are actually going to bring growth
" @entity115 , the president of the @entity116 , told @entity2 " this is no time for complacency -- that is absolutely clear
but let me tell you , nevertheless , that the real economy is giving signs that are encouraging
" the main risk is to practice benign neglect ... as soon as things are going better , to forget that we had to cope with a very , very demanding crisis , " @entity115 said
" so , we have to draw all the lessons
" @entity2 's @entity14 , @entity128 and @entity129 contributed to this report .
