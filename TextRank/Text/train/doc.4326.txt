last december 5 , just after 7 p.m. @entity2 time , i got a text message from one member of @entity6 's family
" and so that 's how i knew a great man was taking his final breaths
" it 's done , " said the next message from those who were with him at the end
it was 9 p.m. and @entity6 was gone
by that stage , we were all in the @entity19 bureau and ready to go live , to tell the world @entity6 was gone
however , i had made a promise to my sources that i would not go to air with any information they gave me about his condition until there were an official announcement by president @entity30
the televised address to the nation came just before midnight
it was a long wait , but i was so grateful to his family for trusting me with the information -- those three hours of preparation allowed me the time and space to clear my head
i am a @entity2 , a white @entity2 whose country was changed for the better by his visionary leadership
i had my own personal thanks to give for @entity6 's life
then i had the responsibility of delivering this news to @entity19 's global audience
that task continued for the next 11 days until he was buried in the rural hills around his boyhood home in @entity53 , @entity54
the immediate days after @entity6 's passing created a wonderful celebratory mood in the country -- strange as it might have seemed to others
for @entity2 , it was the most natural reaction
sadness and mourning had been done already in the months before , when he was critically ill. now , @entity2 gave thanks , paused in gratefulness and came together in ways that reflected the debt they owed to this one man
white , black , old , young gathered outside his house in @entity72 , laying flowers and saying a personal prayer of thanks
it was astounding to watch
the manicured pavement lawns of suburban @entity76 became like an altar of reflection for a time of hope and reconciliation that seemed like an age away
it was called " @entity89 " -- and now that he was gone it felt like the ' magic ' that had sustained a battered , racist nation would go with him
it was always an ephemeral , false even , suggestion that @entity6 saved @entity2
@entity2 did it together , he just led them on the right path
still , older @entity2 brought their children , some just babies wrapped in blankets , to his home in the days after he died
often , they dressed the kids up in their best clothes , like they were going to church , and solemnly walked to the piles of flowers on the sidewalk or loitered by the exterior walls
it was as if a whole generation of @entity2 wanted their kids to feel and breathe in that last little bit of " @entity89
' there was an important sense of occasion , a primal need to ' be there
' at times , i watched families appear quietly outside @entity6 's home and silently soak up the atmosphere
other times , i felt like i was watching worshipers presenting gifts to a deity , pushing forward toddlers and young kids to the front of crowds just so their children could be closer to the place where he died
in years to come , a new generation of children will be able to say , " i was there
" @entity6 's funeral was a measure of the man
i watched from inside the funeral tent and thought how apt it was that his goodbye was both about pageantry and plain - speaking
i stood by his casket as it made the final journey and softly said goodbye and thank you as that great man was laid to rest on a simple grass mat , as he had wished .
