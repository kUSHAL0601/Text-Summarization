@entity32 district attorney @entity31 said monday that he will seek three months of incarceration against @entity3 and widen the investigation
@entity32 assistant district attorney @entity35 , who is handling the case , said of @entity3 , " so far he 's the one
there 's no doubt about the incident

and 45 minutes later , when he was eating at a some restaurant or discotheque , somebody tells him , ' hey , you 're the one who killed so - and - so
' " @entity55 said , " we 're concerned about his career or whether he 's going to have to go to jail
we do n't know if it was him
he wants to clear up what happened , but no one really knows if it was him for sure
