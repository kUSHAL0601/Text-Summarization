@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 's dramatic deadline day transfer to @entity7 has finally been rubber stamped by the @entity8
the @entity10 international joins from @entity11 after a technical hitch meant @entity7 struggled to submit the relevant paperwork shortly before tuesday 's @entity1 transfer deadline , but the @entity8 have now ratified the move
@entity6 , who was part of the @entity10 side that lost in the @entity19 final to @entity20 , joins the @entity0 club for a fee believed to be in the region of $ 12 million
" the interest from @entity7 came very quick and i did not have much time to think , " @entity6 was quoted as saying on the @entity8 's official website
" but i want to play football again and if possible every week , with a beautiful club
i am excited about playing in @entity1
" whether it suits my style remains to be seen , but i think a good footballer can adapt and i am very proud of this transfer
" both clubs confirmed the deal , with @entity11 refuting a claim from @entity7 's manager @entity36 that @entity6 had been the subject of a $ 26 million bid from @entity40 champions @entity39
@entity11 's sports director @entity41 told the club 's official website : " it is absolutely false that @entity11 received a 21 million euro offer from @entity39 for @entity6
" in fact , the @entity40 team never showed an interest to sign the player , so the allegations made in @entity1 have greatly surprised us
" a statement on @entity7 's official website read : " we are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with @entity11 for the transfer of @entity6
" the @entity57 international came through the ranks at @entity59 and won two league titles during 141 appearances with the @entity63 side , scoring 60 goals before leaving for @entity65 in the summer of 2005
" the attacking midfielder , 27 , was the @entity68 side 's leading scorer in his first season in @entity40 and went on to captain the side before joining @entity11 ahead of the 2007/08 campaign
" @entity6 has been capped by @entity57 a total of 83 times , scoring 16 goals , since making his international debut against @entity77 in 2001 at the age of 18
" he has since represented the @entity10 at two @entity79 and two @entity80 , including this summer 's tournament in @entity82 where he featured five times in the side 's run to the final
