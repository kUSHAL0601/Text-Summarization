@entity0 , @entity1 -- i knew every last @entity4 had been touched by the @entity5 when my father - in - law told me how much he enjoyed " the first few innings " of the @entity10 - @entity9 match
needless to say , he 's just discovering soccer
he still thinks a red card is what communists keep in their wallets
and yet , like so many of his countrymen , he 's suddenly been laid low by @entity5 fever , whose symptoms include a dull headache and a stiff neck , the result -- in my case -- of practicing headers in the driveway
( " practicing them for what ? " my wife inquired
but you never know when that call - up will come for the @entity31 national team
) at long last , soccer ignorami in this country are becoming part of the international community
for most of this past week , i ( an @entity4 citizen ) felt schadenfreude ( a @entity38 word for " joy in the misery of others " ) at the spectacular implosion of @entity43 ( the @entity45 national team , which mutinied against its own coach while crapping out of the tournament )
that 's three countries in a single emotion , the kind of geopolitical awakening most of us only get in @entity4 when walking into an @entity54
and so i ca n't stop singing that song from @entity58 's ubiquitous @entity5 commercial , in which @entity60 lounge singer @entity59 serenades @entity62 captain @entity61 with a chorus -- " @entity66 , @entity67 " -- that is as insidiously unshakeable as the @entity5 itself
i interviewed @entity61 in @entity68 a dozen years ago and have followed and occasionally covered international soccer for two decades
in @entity4 , i sometimes act like one of those bores who saw the @entity73 in @entity74 before they made it big : that guy who feels smugly superior to the mass of fans who later fill the bandwagon
this kind of smugness has its advantages
a fellow school parent asked me yesterday : " what 's the name of that guy who coaches @entity86 ? " when i said , " @entity87 , " she replied : " how do you know all this stuff ? " @entity87 is only the greatest soccer player of all time and one of @entity93 's most famous inhabitants , but i kept those secrets to myself , letting her think i 'm a soccer sophisticate and repository of the game 's most obscure trivia
i 'm just happy that more people care , that the next time my father - in - law hears the name @entity104 , he 'll think of the @entity4 whose 91st - minute goal sent the @entity4 to the knockout stages of the @entity107 , not the @entity108 whose song " @entity109 " went to no. 2 in the charts in 1966
someday , when my father - in - law thinks of 1966 as the year that @entity112 last won the @entity5 , the tournament will have finally realized its manifest destiny
it will truly have conquered the world
it 's almost there now
more and more @entity4 are succumbing
you may have noticed your fellow cubicle jockeys sounding like one of those @entity108 soccer announcers currently on loan to @entity123 : decrying " cynical " tackles , praising " beautifully weighted " passes and pronouncing themselves , at the water cooler , too " knackered " to work
@entity127 : do you have @entity5 mania ? last sunday , i saw a brand - new @entity131 license plate frame on a car in our church parking lot
the next day , an 8 - year - old saw my toddler in an @entity108 soccer jersey at the park and yelled , correctly : " he 's got an @entity141 shirt on ! " these are hopeful signs
in much of @entity4 , in the month it is named for , the june bug abruptly appears , reaches maturity in july and then quickly dies off
typically , the @entity5 does the same
but this time , i think soccer , as grass - dwelling pests go , will be harder to eradicate
i know the game will be eating my lawn for years to come
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .
