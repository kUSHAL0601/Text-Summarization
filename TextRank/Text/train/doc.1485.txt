by any standard , the killings are grisly
with the discovery of the body of an 87 - year - old @entity8 woman whose disappearance came to light after her husband 's decapitated body was found in their waterfront home , authorities not only want to know who did it , but also why
@entity16 's body was found in @entity17 , south of @entity18 , @entity20 sheriff @entity19 told reporters friday
" we now , unfortunately , know that @entity16 was murdered , " @entity19 said
@entity19 declined to discuss the condition of the body other than to say , " the head was not removed or anything like that
" authorities were alerted friday by two fishermen who spotted what they believed to be a body in the lake , some five or six miles from the couple 's home
the discovery adds an element to the investigation -- the possibility that a boat was a mode of transportation in the killing , @entity19 said
" this jumps us about two jumps up on the checkerboard , shall we say , " he said
@entity16 's family is in shock with the news of the discovery of her body , said the rev. @entity52 of @entity53
" we have n't even had a funeral for @entity55 because their kids wanted to wait
now that we know about @entity16 , we will start planning the funeral services for both
" from the beginning , investigators treated @entity16 's disappearance as an abduction
her purse , cell phone and car were all at the couple 's million - dollar waterfront home on @entity17 where her husband 's headless body was found
investigators believe she was taken from her home after her husband , 88 - year - old @entity73 , was decapitated sometime between may 2 and may 4
investigators continue to search for his head , and they plan to look in the same area of the lake where @entity16 's body was found , @entity74 said
" obviously , the head of mr. @entity73 will be quite difficult to locate
" @entity73 's body was discovered in the couple 's garage after friends , who had n't heard from the couple in days , went to their home
the @entity87 put up more than 100 billboards in its search for the missing woman , and it offered a reward of up to $ 20,000 for information to her location or the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance
" the mindset of the individual that did this was a homicidal individual that does n't deserve to breathe the air on this @entity102 , " @entity19 said
in the days after @entity16 's disappearance , authorities searched @entity17 in the vicinity of the couple 's home -- turning up only a lawn chair and a christmas tree -- and sent cadaver dogs into the nearby woods , to no avail
authorities have also spoken to neighbors , family and friends
so far , the investigation has turned up little to shed light on the crimes
investigators are n't aware of any enemies the couple had made , or any reason someone would target them , @entity19 said .
