@entity1 ( 22 - 0 , 19 @entity9 ) picked up the @entity3 belt that became vacant when @entity8 retired

@entity16 @entity15 knocked out @entity17 in the 12th round in @entity19 , to become @entity21 supermiddle champion
@entity15 ( 40 - 1 ) dominated throughout in front of an enthusiastic home crowd at the @entity24
@entity17 , who was born in @entity25 but grew up in @entity26 , suffered his first loss after a 22 - 0 start in his pro career
@entity15 won the @entity21 title in november 2004 by stopping @entity31 of @entity32
he also lifted the the @entity3 super middleweight crown two years later when he knocked out @entity34 of @entity26 in the third round

@entity42 's @entity41 was floored before successfully defending his @entity44 lightweight title with a fifth round stoppage of @entity46 in @entity47
@entity41 , who has won all 18 of his fights since turning professional after winning a silver medal at the @entity50 , knocked @entity46 down in the first round but found himself on the canvas in the second in a brief but rugged contest
@entity41 said : " this was one of my toughest fights but i learned from my mistakes
i will watch the video and work on them and continue my journey to the world title
" @entity41 was on target with a powerful right uppercut in the first round and a combination of punches floored @entity46 , who retaliated in the second round
a left hook over the top of a jab put @entity41 down and he had to take a standing count and looked unsteady on his legs for several seconds afterwards
@entity46 landed a damaging hook to the ribs in the fourth but early in the fifth @entity41 put his opponent down again with a powerful body shot
@entity46 began to take a lot of punishment and referee @entity79 stopped the contest
@entity46 looked disappointed but appeared to be all but out on his feet .
