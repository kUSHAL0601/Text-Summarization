-- @entity1 scored after just 33 seconds as @entity2 maintained their slim advantage at the top of the @entity5 wednesday with a 1 - 0 win over @entity7
the @entity9 faithful had barely settled in their seats when the @entity13 striker picked up a pass from @entity15 and saw his shot deflect off @entity17 to loop over visiting goalkeeper @entity18
it was the quickest goal of the @entity5 season and left @entity2 a point clear of neighbors and defending champions @entity23 , who won 2 - 0 at @entity25
@entity2 have fallen behind in many games this season before recovering and manager @entity27 was delighted by their defensive display
" if we can keep clean sheets more often than not it will a good foundation to challenge for the title , " he told @entity30
recalled @entity35 gave @entity23 a second half lead at @entity25 before @entity37 sealed the three points with a thumping strike from outside the penalty area
@entity35 's performance earned scant praise from his manager @entity43
" i think @entity35 can do better
he scored one important goal but can continue to improve
for me , he did not play very well , " he told @entity30
@entity48 is still searching for his first win and first goal since taking charge of @entity52 as interim manager following the sacking of @entity55
his side were held 0 - 0 at home by @entity59 rivals @entity58 , off the back of the same result against @entity23 sunday
it left @entity52 seven points adrift of leaders @entity2 in third place in the standings and @entity48 was again subjected to barracking by home supporters unhappy at his appointment
@entity70 slipped back to fourth with a first defeat in five games , beaten 3 - 1 at @entity74 side @entity73
@entity76 midfielder @entity75 scored his eighth @entity5 goal of the season to put @entity73 ahead and they were two up inside 10 minutes when @entity79 netted
@entity79 added his second and the home side 's third just before the interval , but there was still time for @entity70 to pull one back when on - loan @entity84 scored in injury time at the end of the half
@entity89 took closer order in fifth with a 2 - 1 home win over @entity92 at @entity93
@entity94 was set up by @entity95 for an early opener for @entity89
@entity95 then put the home side two clear after just 16 minutes when he crashed home a deflected free kick
in the second half , the pair were involved in a bizarre incident as @entity94 smashed a clearance into @entity95 's face and it found its way into the @entity89 goal , but @entity92 could not force an equalizer
@entity108 and @entity109 are just behind them in sixth and seventh after they shared a 1 - 1 draw at @entity112
@entity113 put the @entity114 ahead in the first minute , but @entity116 international @entity115 curled home a leveler midway through the first half
@entity121 's miserable recent run continued with a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity123 while @entity124 remained in the drop zone after a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity128
it was referee @entity131 's first match in charge since being cleared of racially abusing @entity52 's @entity133 .
