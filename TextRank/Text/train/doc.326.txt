read his column here @entity0 says @entity6 's critics challenged her because of prejudices about small - town values
@entity9 , @entity10 ( @entity11 ) -- during the presidential election , some @entity12 demanded to know how i could defend @entity15 gov. @entity6
simply put , @entity6 is my people
she 's small - town folk who wound up in the big leagues
because i grew up in a small town with a population of less than 15,000 people , i was disgusted by the insults and condescension coming from those who think of themselves as the enlightened elite
meanwhile , in small towns , i detected great affection for @entity6
people talked about how she was " a real person " who " reflected their values
" the most significant divide in @entity37 is n't @entity38 vs. @entity38 , it 's rural vs. urban
the country mouse and the city mouse are still slugging it out
in 1982 , @entity43 mayor @entity42 ran unsuccessfully for governor of @entity43
some say the deciding factor was when @entity42 described life in @entity48 as " sterile " and said he dreaded living in the " small town " of @entity50 , if elected
that did n't play well in rural areas
during a recent appearance on @entity11 's " @entity55 , " @entity53 attempted an autopsy on the @entity58 's failed presidential bid
he went after @entity6 , accusing her of pushing the party so far to the right that it went over a cliff
" i think [ @entity6 ] had something of a polarizing effect when she talked about how small - town values are good , " @entity53 said
" well , most of us do n't live in small towns
and i was raised in the @entity69 , and there 's nothing wrong with my value system from the @entity69
" you 'd think the presidential campaign was about conservatives picking on urbanites
sure , some @entity58 probably made a mistake by using phrases such as " real @entity37 " or " real @entity37 " as a rallying cry for the base
@entity37 who live in cities might have thought they were being slighted
but those phrases referred as much to people 's politics and values as it did their zip code
i live in a city with a population of more than a million people and i never thought the @entity58 singled me out as not being a " real @entity37
" if anything , it appeared that big - city liberals were tapping into prejudices about small - town @entity37 to belittle the governor of @entity15 after @entity53 attacked @entity6 , one of the governor 's most vocal defenders , conservative talk show host @entity101 , returned the favor by attacking @entity53
" what is this hatred for conservatives and small - town people and @entity6 ? " @entity101 asked on his radio show
" i know a lot of people that are from the @entity69 , gen. @entity53 , and if you think the values there in the @entity69 today reflect the ones you grew up with , take a trip back and see if the street corners and the activities there are the same as when you were growing up
when people use phrases such as " small - town values , " it 's as much about time as it is place
the idea is n't that people who live in small towns have better values than people who live in cities
it 's simply an attempt to recall , with nostalgia , what life was like when more @entity37 lived in small towns
it used to be that more families ate dinner together and high school students worked summers and after school
it used to be that our schools did n't make excuses for why some kids do n't learn because they were too busy trying to teach them
it used to be that parents were n't interested in being their kids ' best friends , only good parents
and it used to be that people pulled their own weight and would never dare ask for a handout
during a recent interview with the conservative newspaper , @entity158 , @entity6 was asked if she thought her humble background accounted for some of the flak she got from the media
@entity6 acknowledged that she did n't come from elite stock , but said that she was grateful for that
" i got my education from the @entity166 because that 's what i could afford , " she said
" no , i do n't come from the self - proclaimed ' movers and shakers ' group and that 's fine with me
it 's caused me , or rather , allowed me , to work harder and pull myself up by my bootstraps without anyone else helping me
i think it allows me to be in touch with the vast majority of @entity37 who are in the same position that i am
" @entity6 understands a lot about @entity37
too bad many @entity37 do n't understand @entity6
they may get another chance to acquaint themselves with her -- in say , four years
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186
