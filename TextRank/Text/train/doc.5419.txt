-- every year , come @entity1 , i cringe at the thought of walking down the street with red roses , balloons and chocolates
it 's not that i do n't like all of the above , i simply dislike the commercialization of love
but whether you 're shy or not about proclaiming your love , the reality is that this day is big business
@entity16 is one of the many carriers that help to deliver romance
every year it transports 20,000 tons of flowers and plants
in the days leading up to @entity1 , it will fly one thousand tons of roses
ensuring they reach their final destination in full bloom is a complex logistical chain that begins with the growers
the roses come directly from @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33
they are picked up locally by the freighter and while they vary in shape and quality , they all have to meet tough quality standards and strict @entity42 regulations
this begins the moment they board the plane
here , the captain has to shower them with love , attention and a temperature in the range of four and eight degrees
@entity16 's cargo pilot , @entity55 , tells me this is important " because roses are easily perishable goods , it 's very important not to disrupt the code chain
" after a 10 hour flight , they land at @entity61 and here , it 's all about speed and punctuality
with cargo doors open and temperatures below zero , the roses need to be moved quickly
in less than an hour , all 65 tons of roses are moved from the freighter to the perishable center where their temperature is taken once again
@entity73 is responsible for the next step
as a representative of the @entity78 government , it 's his responsibility to check all food and plant shipments that come through @entity61
but his task is bigger than this : he 's a border inspector for the whole of the @entity42 and he must make sure that everything that leaves @entity61 is clean of any diseases
picking up a pink bunch of roses , @entity73 shows me he 'll be looking at leaves and stems for plant rust , mildew , whitefly and many more bugs
he 'll examine one batch from each supplier and if clear , he 'll sign off and they 're good for delivery
so next time you buy or receive a bunch of roses , remember the precision of this logistical chain
it may have taken you five minutes to buy them , but it takes six hours to approve them
now that 's commercial love .
