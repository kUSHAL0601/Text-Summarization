-- an @entity2 man said he does n't hate african - americans and counts some of them among his best friends
murder and hate crime charges were filed on friday accusing him and another man of killing three strangers because they were black
@entity9 , lawyer for 19 - year - old @entity10 , told reporters friday he would not comment specifically about the april 6 shootings that left three dead and two others wounded in @entity14 , @entity2
he did show a video of an interview his team conducted and recorded with @entity18 from jail , in which the suspect described the trauma of watching first his father and then , nearly two years later , his girlfriend being shot dead a few feet away from him
@entity18 also talked of growing up and living in @entity14 , which has a large @entity25 - @entity25 community , and saying he had friends of all races
" i always got along with everybody , " he said in the tape , recorded friday morning
" it did n't matter what color he was
" that view is starkly different from the portrayal of @entity18 offered by prosecutors , as well as in the probable cause affidavit that led to the arrest of him and 33 - year - old @entity39
in addition to commenting on his girlfriend 's suicide in january , @entity18 lamented his father 's death exactly two years earlier " at the hands of a f -- king n --- - r " in an april 5 message on his @entity48 page
@entity18 said in the jailhouse interview that he used those words " just to express how i was upset at the guy who shot my @entity55 " and they do not mean he was a racist
authorities say he and @entity39 went into a largely @entity25 section of @entity14 shortly after midnight and gunned down apparent strangers at four locations
two men and one woman died after being shot in the chest -- with one of them found " lying face down " outside a funeral home -- while two others were shot and survived
all the shooting victims are black
police have identified @entity39 and @entity18 as white , though the probable cause affidavit released friday noted @entity18 was a co-owner of a truck that had @entity73 license plates
three @entity75 tips helped lead authorities to the men , according to the affidavit
in the first , made last saturday , a caller described @entity18 as " a racist ( who ) hates black males " and said he had " bragged about other shootings
" another person phoned to say that @entity18 had gone off to burn his truck , which was similar to the vehicle seen by several people -- including one of the survivors -- in and around the area where the shootings took place
sheriff deputies soon after found a 1989 @entity95 truck with the @entity73 tag on fire in @entity14
the third caller to contact @entity75 on april 7 said @entity18 had " made several comments about killing black people " and wanted " justice " for his father 's killing
this person added that @entity18 " uses drugs and will not go down without a fight
" neither @entity18 nor @entity39 offered resistance when they were taken into custody early sunday , @entity108 capt. @entity107 said
@entity18 confessed to shooting three people , while fellow suspect @entity39 admitted to police that he shot the other two , both of which were fatal , according to police documents
@entity116 district attorney @entity115 on friday filed charges against both men on three counts of first - degree murder tied to the deaths of 54 - year - old @entity122 , 49 - year - old @entity123 and 31 - year - old @entity124
they also face two counts of shooting with intent to kill related to the two people who were wounded , according to the press release from the district attorney 's office
in addition , the men face five counts of malicious harassment
the district attorney notes that , according to @entity2 law , the charge infers that a person has acted " maliciously and with the specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person 's race , color , religion , ancestry , national origin or disability
" the charge is equivalent to a hate crime under @entity2 law , according to partners @entity150 , a joint project of the @entity153 , the @entity154 and the @entity155 for preventing hate nonprofit groups
the rev. @entity157 , speaking friday outside the @entity158 in @entity14 , challenged why this " hate crime " charge is considered a misdemeanor , and not a felony , in @entity2
the maximum penalty for a conviction is a year in prison and a $ 1,000 fine
still , the civil rights leader lauded authorities for filing charges in the case that effectively asserted the victims were targeted due to their race
the rev. @entity172 voiced a similar sentiment , canceling a planned trip to @entity14 and saying in a statement he was " glad that ( prosecutors ) filed first - degree murder and hate crime charges
" " we 're glad that they 've made that decision in the right direction today , " @entity157 said
@entity9 said he decided to represent @entity18 after getting a letter monday from the suspect 's mother , who has been incarcerated for the past 11 years
the lawyer described his client as a hard - working young man who had served as a father figure to his teenage sister and is himself the father of a baby son born to his late girlfriend
he also said @entity18 harbors no ill will toward african - americans
" many ( of his friends ) are black
he has family members that are black
and there 's no hatred of blacks in him at all , " said @entity9
the @entity202 is investigating the @entity14 shootings to determine if federal civil rights were violated , said spokeswoman @entity205
she called it an " open investigation , " but not a hate crimes investigation per se
@entity39 and @entity18 will appear in court monday , when a judge will set a date for a preliminary hearing
prosecutors filed a motion friday asking that both defendants be held without bond and not be released if they come up with the $ 9.16 million bond set monday , when authorities outlined murder but not the malicious harassment charges
" both defendants are a danger to public safety in this community , and they have strong incentive to flee the jurisdiction if they were able to make bond , " the prosecution argued
the maximum sentence for each charge of shooting with intent to kill is life in prison
@entity18 and @entity39 could face anywhere from life with the possibility of parole or a death sentence for the murder charges
first district attorney @entity239 said in a press release that the prosecution likely will decide whether to seek the death penalty after the preliminary hearing is complete
calling the shootings " tragic and senseless , " @entity239 characterized the filing of charges as a " first step to obtain justice
" @entity157 similarly cautioned against celebrating too early that the suspects were detained and charged , noting the legal process ahead could be long and complicated
" this is a first down , not a touchdown , " he said
" this is a charge , not a conviction
" @entity0 's @entity255 contributed to this report .
