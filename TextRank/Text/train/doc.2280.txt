-- @entity1 beat fellow @entity3 finalists @entity4 2 - 0 in a friendly international at @entity6 in @entity7 on wednesday
@entity9 's early strike put the @entity10 on their way to victory which was sealed by @entity14 's late header
both teams had several @entity17 stars in their ranks , with @entity1 captained by @entity20 's @entity19 - sung while the @entity21 had @entity23 's @entity22 and @entity25 's @entity24 in attack and @entity28 's @entity27 in defense
@entity22 came close several times for the elephants , who crashed out in the quarterfinals of the @entity34 to @entity35 , and are without a coach after the subsequent sacking of @entity38
the @entity4 have been linked with former @entity23 and @entity40 boss @entity39 and need to show an improvement with @entity42 and @entity43 in a tough group in @entity45
it was the @entity10 who gave their rowdy supporters at the home of second flight @entity51 side @entity50 the most to cheer and they were ahead in the fourth minute
a free - kick from @entity54 was only partially cleared and @entity9 showed superb technique by volleying it past @entity57
@entity19 nearly gave the @entity10 a two - goal cushion but he was denied by an excellent block by @entity60
@entity61 also saw a shot drift just wide after the break , but in the dying moments they grabbed a deserved second as @entity14 headed in @entity68 's free - kick
it proved a generally round of friendlies for @entity45 's @entity3 qualifiers with @entity35 , who are in @entity51 's group , thrashed 3 - 0 at home by @entity76 , who are also in the finals
@entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 scored as @entity83 's team were easily beaten meanwhile , @entity3 hosts @entity45 were held 1 - 1 at home my minnows @entity86 who saw @entity88 give them a shock 42nd minute lead
@entity91 were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity92 despite going ahead through @entity93 after 22 minutes but the @entity94 of @entity94 beat the @entity95 5 - 2 as they build up to the finals
@entity97 also received a boost as they held world champions @entity101 goalless in a later match held in @entity103
@entity104 fielded an experimental @entity106 side but they had the better chances although it needed a last - ditch tackle from substitute @entity111 to deny @entity112 a late winner for @entity97 .
