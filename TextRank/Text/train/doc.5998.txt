-- men in glitzy shirts and outrageous hairstyles walk down the red carpet alongside a cheerleader while 2,500 people sing " stand up if you love the darts
" these are not your groomed and glamorous stars like @entity10 -- these are men of the people
welcome to the world of darts
a world where men like @entity16 , who sports a multi-colored mohawk with a snake painted on the side of his head -- and parades around in shirts which would be more at home at a 1970s psychedelic disco -- is hero worshiped
where men with paunches , who appear to have spent more time lifting pints than weights , thrill millions -- including @entity33
once played by as many as 10 million @entity35 in pubs each year , darts has long since escaped the stereotype of a working class leisure pursuit
it 's been rebranded , revamped and then some
and what a success the marketing men have had
the @entity42 , which concluded in style on @entity44 at @entity46 's @entity45 , was broadcast live across the globe as far as @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity51
real skill as well as its larger than life sporting characters , what television loves most about darts is the atmosphere a couple of thousand men and women -- many in fancy dress and imbibing liberal amounts of alcohol -- generate at the " @entity65
" " it 's quickfire and entertaining -- you get a result on the night and you do n't have to wait around for five days or so , " @entity66 , chief executive of the @entity67 , told @entity0
" then there 's the crowd aspect
it 's non-partisan , it 's not like football where people have teams
they have their favorite players but it 's different atmosphere
" the social element is hugely important , " added @entity66
" people can go out in fancy dress , they can be on television and that all serves to make it an enjoyable night out
they 're not just going to a sporting event
the argument over whether darts is really a sport has seemingly become redundant , with @entity92 , a leading sports scientist and coach , who has worked as @entity94 of @entity95 and the @entity97 rugby team , arguing it should be in the @entity99
with 72 players from 20 different countries taking part , the reach of the sport has grown immeasurably since the inception of the @entity67 in 1992 , which is today known as the @entity67
the move , which came after a number of top players voiced their concern at the lack of progress being made by the game under the auspices of the @entity114
the split brought about a new era with the creation of the @entity67 , now led by sports promoter @entity118 , who helped to revolutionize the game by giving it a complete facelift
@entity97 's answer to @entity124 promoter @entity123 , @entity118 , who also owns a lower division @entity97 football club , has also helped revamp snooker as well working as a boxing supremo
' arrows ' @entity130 is now a lucrative business with players competing in front of packed arenas with a total prize fund of $ 8 million on offer throughout the year
the game 's origins remain a mystery
" @entity140 , crossbow bolts and archery have all been considered , " according to darts historian @entity143 , known as ' dr darts ' , the author of eight books on the sport
historically @entity97 has always excelled at archery , notably at the battle of @entity152 in 1415 when despite being outnumbered by @entity154 soldiers , @entity150 and @entity97 archers overwhelmed the enemy with a storm of arrows
" of these the most likely scenario is that the game has its roots in archery , " added @entity143
" glance back to the earliest type of dartboards and you will see that these were concentric targets -- miniature forms of the archery target
" moreover , darts is most commonly known as ' arrows
' some would say that these two points alone are sufficient to confirm our sports ' heritage
" while darts was always a pastime enjoyed in pubs across @entity35 in the 1930s , it was not until the @entity114 was established in 1973 that it became a professional sport
by january 1979 over eight million people tuned in to watch @entity179 win the @entity180 on the @entity181
while tv coverage was scaled back in the 1980s , the advent of satellite television brought about new opportunities for the game with both parties enjoying huge success
@entity66 is now targeting the @entity189 and @entity50
" all the hard work of the past 10 years or so has come to fruition and we 're now trying to continue our global expansion
" we started a world series last year with @entity195 and @entity48 and we 're now trying to expand in @entity124 and @entity50 , " said the @entity67 chief executive
" @entity196 is a tough nut to crack because it 's such a vast market but we 've got tv coverage over there
" we do n't have an elite @entity189 player and they like to watch their own
" @entity66 is equally keen to draw in new fans
" to any new fans who want to come , i 'll give them my personal guarantee that i 'll refund their money if they do n't enjoy it
" i do n't know anyone who has n't enjoyed an evening at the darts
