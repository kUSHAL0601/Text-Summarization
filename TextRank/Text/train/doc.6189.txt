-- an e-mail exchange released by @entity4 gov. @entity3 's office on tuesday has revealed a series of potential @entity7 concessions to a three - week standoff over a budget bill that would restrict the collective bargaining rights of most public workers
the e-mails show a discussion between @entity3 's deputy chief of staff , @entity15 , and @entity17 state sens. @entity16 and @entity18 in a correspondence that reveals offers and counter-offers between two sides who have remained at an impasse since mid-february
@entity3 's initial proposal -- which passed the state 's assembly on friday and would exclude police and firefighters -- requires public workers to contribute more to their pension and health care plans , while prohibiting collection of union dues
it would also restrict the collective bargaining power of public - sector unions to be limited to wages , and would be capped to the rate of inflation
pay raises beyond the inflation index would require a voter referendum
the original bill would also restrict contracts and would mandate annual votes for unions to keep their certification
but in this latest e-mail exchange , dated sunday , march 6 , @entity3 appears willing to take steps that would curtail the proposal
according to the e-mail , the changes would : -- allow unions to bargain for wages beyond inflation rates , without a mandatory voter referendum
-- permit collective bargaining on certain economic issues , including mandatory overtime , performance bonuses , hazardous duty pay , calendar and classroom size , as well as certification or license payment
unions and public employers would be required to define the parameters of the negotiations in each case
-- allow public workers at the @entity73 to keep their collective bargaining rights
-- permit public workers to collectively bargain workplace safety issues , while restricting workers from negotiating hours , overtime , sick or family leave , work breaks and vacation
-- limit collective bargaining agreements to one or two years
-- require unions to register less than one year after the bill is signed into law , and compel their registration every three years to stay active
the original measure would mandate annual certification
the modifications do not address @entity3 prohibiting unions from collecting dues , often considered a sticking point in negotiations
later tuesday evening , @entity17 lawmakers offered an " alternative adjustment bill " in an open letter to @entity3 and @entity95 majority leader @entity94 , identifying three areas where the @entity4 state budget is facing shortfalls : medical assistance , public defender , private bar and the @entity102
" recent reports made it clear that @entity4 is not ' broke , ' as you claim , " the statement said , referencing @entity3 's earlier speeches
the @entity17 proposal requires " the same level of contributions for pension and health care that gov. @entity3 proposed " and would " maintain provisions to restructure @entity4 's debt , freeing $ 165 million to be used to cover shortfalls in the current biennium , " according to the statement
the statement did not offer specifics in covering the shortfalls
on monday , @entity3 dismissed as " ridiculous " a letter from a @entity17 state @entity95 leader , who suggested meeting near the @entity4 - @entity126 border to discuss the budget impasse
fourteen @entity17 senators left @entity4 for @entity126 on february 17 to prevent a vote on a budget bill that ignited fierce opposition from labor leaders and their supporters
last week , the @entity95 's @entity7 majority approved a resolution charging their @entity17 colleagues $ 100 fines daily until they return
on friday , @entity3 's office issued notices to unions , warning them of possible layoffs in early april if the budget battle continues
@entity4 is confronted with a looming $ 137 million shortfall at the end of the fiscal year , june 30 , and faces a $ 3.6 billion budget gap by 2013
@entity0 's @entity147 contributed to this report
