-- there 's a new group of travelers in town -- and it hardly matters which town you 're talking about
@entity8 travelers are increasingly booking trips abroad , and hotels and touring companies are working overtime to win their patronage
in 2012 , @entity8 tourists spent $ 43 billion abroad -- making them the fifth highest - spending segment of the travel industry
last year , nearly 40 million @entity8 traveled overseas ( only 8 million journeyed in 2006 )
that number is likely to expand , and quickly ; @entity8 are the world 's second - fastest growing group of tourists
the supercharged growth can be attributed to a steadily growing middle class ( projected to rise 16 % between now and 2020 ) , and the fact that access to the world beyond the former @entity27 borders is still fairly novel

" now is the time ( for them to do so ) , because unless you can cater to the needs of @entity8 customers , they 'll go and stay somewhere else , " he adds

now , we have some every single weekend and weekday , " notes @entity83 , general manager of @entity63 's @entity84
" this being a new market , you have to start adapting to them : what are their needs ? how should we handle them ? what types of room do they like ? how do they like to be addressed ? " for the companies that do succeed in winning over this newest segment , the rewards can be sizable

" on the plus side , @entity8 are seen as high - spending
they bring a lot of cash with them , " says @entity32 , who adds that @entity8 tend to enjoy a drink or two
" the bar bill benefits quite significantly when @entity8 are traveling
