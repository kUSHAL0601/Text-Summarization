-- @entity1 in @entity2 sarcastically call it " the whale
" a new report says a half - built prison in @entity7 , @entity1 , will probably never be used
the " skeletal , half - built " shell of a maximum - security prison in @entity7 " will probably never house an inmate " even though the @entity11 spent $ 40 million on the now - halted $ 73 million project
marred by " poor security and weak subcontractor performance , " the project is among several examples of @entity1 rebuilding problems cited in a just - published history by the @entity18
titled " hard lessons : the @entity26 , " the report says the massive reconstruction initiative was marked by waste and failures caused by " blinkered and disjointed " pre-war planning -- and was pursued amid deteriorating security
" why was an extensive rebuilding plan carried out in a gravely unstable security environment ? asked @entity29 , the special inspector general for @entity1 reconstruction , whose oversight jurisdiction covers $ 50 billion in @entity11 funds appropriated by @entity33 for @entity1
" this question underscores an overarching hard lesson from @entity1 : beware of pursuing large - scale reconstruction programs while significant conflict continues
" the report , released monday , comes at a much less violent stage of the @entity1 conflict
the peaceful provincial elections across the nation saturday reflected strides in political reconciliation and improvements in the performance of @entity1 security forces
but @entity11 commanders continually warn that the security gains are fragile and could be undermined by insurgents
the report says the @entity11 government " had neither the established structure nor the necessary resources to carry out the reconstruction mission it took on in mid- 2003
" it weaves interviews , facts and vignettes detailing the use of a " sea of taxpayer dollars " from mid- 2002 through autumn 2008
" @entity65 " also looks to the future
it stresses the importance of developing " an agreed - upon doctrine and structure " for reconstruction " so that the @entity11 is ready when it next must intervene in a failed or failing state
" the first of several principles mentioned for such operations : " security is necessary for large - scale reconstruction to succeed
" after @entity11 forces toppled the @entity80 regime in 2003 , it was " unprepared and ill - equipped to deal with what came next : a ' post-conflict ' environment torn by violence , looters , criminals , a nascent insurgency ; a governmental system in a state of complete collapse ; and an economy that had slipped into idle and then switched off
" the raging @entity1 insurgency , crime and sectarian fighting " informed and complicated every decision " in funding such tasks as infrastructure building , security force development , job creation , economic reform and governance
" the @entity11 reconstruction management structure was overwhelmed by the challenges of building in a war zone , " the report said
the program was marked by frequent changes in reconstruction strategy , " turbulence " caused by personnel turnover and " poor integration " of work by various @entity11 government agencies
this was the result of " weak unity of command and inconsistent unity of effort
" a lack of " interagency debate " took its toll when the @entity11 - led @entity122 administered @entity1 from may 2003 to june 2004
the report cites the agency 's " momentous orders " of disbanding @entity1 's military and removing members of @entity80 's ruling @entity130 party from top government positions , a process called de-baathification
" had these issues been fully discussed by the war @entity135 and within the @entity122 , the @entity11 might have acted differently
instead , the @entity11 rebuilding program was left to deal with the instant loss of many of the @entity1 technocrats it would later need
" it also had to build entirely new @entity1 security forces , a task that would ultimately consume more than half of all @entity11 - appropriated reconstruction dollars , " the report said
through " trial and error , " the reconstruction program matured under successive @entity11 ambassadors to @entity1 @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 , and the @entity11 - led " surge " and its " complementary civilian effort " led to a " new era " -- security strides and " a more secure reconstruction environment
" and reconstruction became " more @entity1 - driven and @entity1 - funded " than it had been in 2003
although there has been progress , " the @entity11 still struggled in late 2008 to make @entity1 's reconstruction a success
" the program generally met its goals in developing the @entity1 security forces , but did not do so " on the infrastructure front , " the report concluded
electricity and oil output are lower than the goals set five years ago by the @entity122
" successful project completions in the key water and health sectors fell far short of hopes , " the report said
there were " egregious examples of fraud , " but the amounts represented a small percentage of the overall reconstruction efforts , and the number of those " involved was relatively low
" however , the waste " grossly overburdened " the program
" the overuse of cost - plus contracts , high contractor overhead expenses , excessive contractor award fees , and unacceptable program and project delays all contributed to a significant waste of taxpayers ' dollars , " the report said
the report gives examples of waste , including the @entity7 prison project , which it describes as " perhaps the single greatest project failure in the @entity11 reconstruction program
" @entity29 , who has been special inspector general for @entity1 reconstruction since october 2004 , previously served as the @entity122 's inspector general
he has had a longtime association with former president @entity202 , serving in several capacities under his presidency , the @entity206 transition team and @entity208 governorship .
