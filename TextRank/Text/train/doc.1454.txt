-- it 's a loaded question , one with no clear answer
but in the year since @entity5 's co-founder and visionary ceo died , it 's been asked in tech circles over and over : who is the next @entity9 ? there 's one easy response
it 's safe to say that no figure in the tech industry will perfectly duplicate the unique blend of vision , salesmanship , mystique and eye for detail possessed by @entity9 , who died one year ago friday
and it 's complicated further , some say , by the fact that for much of his own life , many would n't have predicted @entity9 himself would earn tech - icon status
" @entity9 had a strange career
he really was n't celebrated as a genius until really late , " said @entity28 , editor of the cult of @entity31 blog and author of books on @entity5 , including " @entity34
" not until @entity9 returned to @entity5 and introduced the @entity37 and @entity38 did people begin to praise him as a modern - day @entity39 , @entity28 said
" he was dismissed before then as a marketing guy , a fast talker who did n't know much about technology
he only really was lionized in the last four or five years
" # @entity45 : share your thoughts on his life and career but industry observers abhor a vacuum
futile though it might be , it 's perhaps human nature to speculate about who could emerge to fill the void left by the passing of tech 's biggest personality and most recognizable face
one can make cases for or against a handful of nominees
and no list is long enough to include an as - yet unknown creator who may be birthing the industry 's next game - changer in a garage or dorm room somewhere
did @entity5 's fanboy fever peak with @entity9 ? but here are some names worth considering , with thoughts both for and against their candidacies : @entity74 , ceo , @entity75 pros : @entity74 actually has a host of traits that mirror @entity9
like @entity9 was with @entity5 , he 's the founder of @entity75 as well as its ceo
being a part of a company 's life story helps
as much as anyone , @entity74 also captures a bit of @entity9 ' panache at live events
at last year 's rollout of the @entity87 , he got high marks for introducing a game - changing product in a stylized fashion , then getting off the stage
( @entity94 giants @entity95 and @entity96 have been accused of being rambling and unfocused at similar unveilings
) reports say @entity74 shares @entity9 ' penchant for attention to detail ( some would say micromanaging ) and , like @entity9 , he 's been willing to take the company into new and unexpected directions
" i 've met @entity74 personally , and he is mesmeric
brilliant smile , quick mind , very engaging and decisive , " @entity28 told @entity0
" he has the same obsession with the ordinary consumer ; to make and sell things from the consumer 's point of view
... @entity74 has @entity9 ' focus and drive
he 's a little bit maniacal in his drive and ambition
" cons : despite the @entity87 line , @entity75 is , at its core , a content company
the mobile devices are a means of delivering books , music , movies and other data to customers as directly as possible
will the public ever be as excited about the ceo of the company that peddles e-books and data - storage space as it was about the one that sold it its personal computers , laptops , phones and music players ? @entity139 , ceo , @entity140 pros : the @entity141 -- @entity9 and @entity142 -- had their garage
@entity139 had his @entity145 dorm room
and in those two rooms , perhaps the two best - known origin stories in tech were born
as head of the social network that has changed the way people use the @entity153 , @entity139 is maybe the only tech boss who , like @entity9 , has become a household name
( " @entity155 " did n't hurt
) he created a product that millions of people now use
and he 's even cultivated his own trademark , casual - wear style , as the @entity139 hoodie is now almost as iconic as @entity9 ' mock turtleneck
" @entity139 has some of the characteristics ( of @entity9 ) , and perhaps the most important one -- the pursuit of a vision , " @entity28 said
" that sets him apart
" cons : he 's gotten better at speaking in public
but as a pitchman , @entity139 still falls miles short of the charismatic @entity9
it 's seems @entity139 would rather be the idea man behind the scenes than front - and - center when it comes time to sell the final product
also , the fact that @entity140 's stock price is not already racing toward @entity95 / @entity5 heights does n't help
@entity176 , ceo , @entity5 pros : well , there 's the obvious one
job 's was @entity5 's ceo
at the helm of the company , @entity176 gets to be the face of every new innovation rolled out by @entity5
he 's got the biggest stage and brightest spotlight in which to put himself forward
cons : @entity176 comes from more of a business background than one of innovation and design
he may masterfully steer @entity5 's course for years to come , but , rightly or not , few observers at this juncture are inclined to give him credit for vision , or influence over products ' design , the way they did @entity9
plus , being @entity5 ceo after @entity9 is like being the football coach who follows a retiring @entity203 or @entity204
what were those guys ' names ? exactly
@entity208 , senior vice president , @entity5 pros : when @entity9 stepped down , there were many who expected @entity208 , not @entity176 , to step up
@entity208 is senior vice president of industrial design and is believed to be the creative mind behind products from the @entity215 to the @entity37 to the @entity216
the @entity218 native already has a knighthood , as well as a healthy dose of @entity9 ' true - believer passion for the product
cons : well , he 's not the ceo
( nor is marketing mastermind @entity224 , another name bandied about to replace @entity9 )
to truly ascend to @entity9 levels , @entity208 would need to set out on his own -- which , at 45 , is doable
it 's hard to envision @entity208 bolting from @entity5 , where he 's worked since 1992
but , boy , it would be fun to watch
@entity231 , ceo , @entity232 pros : if you need proof of how well @entity95 alum @entity235 is liked in @entity236 , just look at the number of folks she 's been able to lure to join her at a @entity232 that was floundering when she took the reins in july
at @entity95 , where the former engineer was the 20th employee , she 's credited with everything from the clean design of the search page to becoming one of the leading public faces of the tech giant
cons : it looks like a turnaround has begun at @entity232
but the job 's still a long way from done
if @entity235 becomes the face of a dramatic rebirth , she will have accomplished something few predicted
if she does n't ( the four ceos before her all fell short ) , it likely wo n't hurt her reputation all that much -- but neither will it bump her up to the next level
@entity264 , serial entrepreneur pros : how 's this for an origin story ? @entity264 grew up in @entity267 before leaving home at 17 , without his parents ' consent , rather than serve a compulsory stint in an army which , at the time , was enforcing the race - based apartheid system
he 'd end up in the @entity275 four years later -- although he 'd already sold his first software , a video game called @entity278 , when he was 12
since then , all he 's done is create publishing software @entity279 ( sold to @entity281 for $ 300 million ) , co-found @entity282 ( he owned 11 % of its stock when @entity285 bought it for $ 1.5 billion ) and help create @entity286 , makers of the first commercial electric car
oh , wait ... he also runs @entity288 , a company working on space exploration
director @entity290 says @entity264 was his inspiration for @entity294 's @entity293 character in the " @entity296 " movies
" his ambitions are so huge , " @entity28 said
" he 's definitely a ballsy character
and he 's a good leader , like @entity9
he 's surrounded himself with good people
" cons : with the exception of @entity286 , none of @entity264 's projects , so far , have directly involved consumer products
tens of millions of people had something @entity9 made in their pockets , on their desks or piping music into their ears
among the public , @entity264 may be less well - known than all of the names above -- at least for now
but , at 41 , he 's got time to change that and it would be foolish to bet against him
@entity318 , ceo , @entity320 , @entity321 pros : who ? @entity318 is the wild card on this list
but consider him the representative of a new generation of young , creative tech " makers " who could ascend to loftier heights in the years , or decades , to come
at 22 , @entity318 's @entity320 raised more than $ 20 million in funding
he founded his first web company at 12 and has moved on to start @entity321 , a mobile - payments system that 's also raked in millions from investors
he got rock - star treatment for a speech he gave last year at @entity336
plus , he 's already cultivated a @entity9 - like signature fashion statement -- his trademark orange sunglasses and shirts
cons : in the startup world , for every success story , there are countless washouts
not every young turk even wants to be another @entity9 , and not every killer app has the potential to make millions , or billions , of dollars -- even when they 're well - liked and widely used
good or bad , what lessons did you learn from @entity9 ? share your responses in the comments below , or join the conversation on @entity354 using # stevejobstaughtme
