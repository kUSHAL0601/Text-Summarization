" to be sincere , we are very excited
" more than 1,000 people died when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates torched homes and hacked rivals in violence that raged for months
@entity5 , who backed then - incumbent @entity24 in that election , was accused of funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks
he has maintained that he is not guilty
withdrawal follows a series of setbacks this week , the court rejected the prosecution 's request for an adjournment , giving it a week to either provide more evidence or drop the charges
in light of the court 's mandate , prosecutor @entity38 said , she was left with no choice but to withdraw the charges
" the evidence has not improved to such an extent that mr. @entity5 's alleged criminal responsibility can be proven beyond reasonable doubt , " @entity38 said in a statement explaining her decision
numerous adjournments @entity38 has postponed the start of the trial numerous times , and accused the @entity1 government of withholding key documents in the case against its leader
" crucial documentary evidence regarding the 2007 - 2008 postelection violence ... can only be found in @entity1 and is only accessible to the prosecution through the assistance of the government of @entity1 , " she said
" this crucial assistance was ultimately not provided
" the defense has rejected the accusations
' my conscience is clear ' shortly after she dropped the charges , @entity38 listed a series of setbacks the prosecution faced , including the exposure and harassment of protected witnesses
the @entity1 president has denied any links to the violence , and had pledged to cooperate with the court to clear his name
" my conscience is clear , has been clear , and will remain forever clear that i am innocent of all the accusations leveled against me , " @entity5 said last month
he became the first sitting head of state to appear before the international court when he attended a status hearing last month at the court in @entity82 , @entity83
@entity3 withdrawal ? the international court has also accused deputy president @entity86 of orchestrating attacks in the 2007 election , which he denies
his trial started in september last year
the @entity1 parliament voted this year to withdraw from @entity3 jurisdiction after repeatedly calling on the court to drop the two leaders ' cases
but a withdrawal would take a while to implement because it involves steps such as a formal notification to the @entity100
bias accusations the @entity3 was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes
the nation 's previous administration reneged on a deal to set up a special tribunal to try suspects in the postelection violence , prompting the international court to step in
the @entity113 has urged the court to postpone cases against sitting leaders , accusing it of unfair treatment against @entity119 leaders
the international court has said it is not a substitute for domestic justice systems , and only intervenes if the national judicial system is either unwilling or unable to carry out justice
rights groups have said the court is crucial in ensuring justice for everyone
