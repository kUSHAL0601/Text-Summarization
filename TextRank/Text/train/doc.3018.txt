-- for the oscar - winner and @entity4 a-lister , family takes priority over career goals
a recent brief trip to @entity8 to film " contagion " directed by @entity10 fitted in well with how she wants her life to be : an enjoyable cultural experience then back home to be with her family and continue her other projects that include charity work and the website " @entity18 "
" i am never away from [ my children ] for longer than five days , a week at the most ...
i do one film a year , and then i do the rest of my stuff at home , " she told @entity0
" it is a balance
sometimes i have to not do something that sounds really appealing , but it just does n't work for my family
you ca n't have it all
" despite recent roles in big budget @entity4 films like the " @entity40 " movies , and being in the luxurious position of being able to pick and choose what roles she wants , she refutes her star status
" i mean technically i 'm really not a movie star , you know i kind of do more independent movies
i mean sometimes i 'm in movies that make a lot of money , but i do n't think that 's my niche
" married to @entity50 musician @entity49 since 2005 , she has skillfully taken herself away from the flashbulbs of the paparazzi as much as she can
yet she was once the subject to fevered media gossip , especially when she was engaged to @entity55 in the mid- 1990s
but media intrusion is much worse now , she says
" the funny thing about it is , when i look back now , it 's nothing compared to what people go through now with the tabloids
i think it 's ramped up to a whole other level
it was strange to be followed around and photographed , " she said
" but in the ensuing 15 years or whatever it has got a hundred times worse
when i see high profile relationships now , i think , ' @entity70 ' even though i 'm technically in one
but we sort of do n't do anything public , we try to keep it behind the scenes as possible
because it just generates more interest , and more paparazzi and being followed , and it just undermines the quality of your life
" it 's just unnecessary to be a public couple , and to have your couple - dom or whatever be its own entity , it does n't make sense to have that in the public world
" however she did make public her struggle to cope with postpartum depression after the birth of her second child @entity93 in 2006
it was personally shocking and she felt it was an issue that needed more public attention
" i had n't heard anyone say , ' i 'm having a very hard time connecting to this baby ' so i could say , ' me too '
" i just thought ' i am a terrible mother , i 'm a terrible person , how has this happened , what 's wrong with me , i just do n't feel well
' and luckily , after about four months , i started to really come out of it , because some women experience it for much , much longer , " she said
" but i think that it 's so important for women to know that it happens , it 's common , and there 's nothing wrong with them , and they 're not a bad mother , and to seek help if they need it or at least a support group
