calling it a " cost of war , " @entity1 and @entity2 leaders announced a $ 17 billion compromise bill monday that would get veterans to a doctor more quickly , hire more medical staff , add dozens of new facilities and cut bonuses at the @entity11
as it aims to reshape medical care for veterans , the proposal also would plump up the deficit , adding $ 12 billion in red ink
the bill was hashed out over months and unveiled by the chairmen of the @entity19 and @entity20 after a weekend of negotiations
the deal would pour spending into both short - and long - term programs for the struggling @entity11
that money comprises : roughly $ 2 billion to lease 27 new medical facilities ; $ 5 billion for hiring doctors and nurses and some construction ; and $ 10 billion to go to a new program allowing veterans to seek outside care if they wait longer than 30 days for an appointment or live more than 40 miles away from a @entity34
more than a funding bill , this deal also gives the veterans secretary unprecedented power to quickly fire executives at the agency
anyone fired under that provision would have a week to appeal the decision and the case must be decided within 21 days or the person 's firing goes into effect
that agreement merged @entity2 ' insistence on an appeals process with @entity1 demand for fast consequences
" it is compromise legislation , " said @entity54 chairman @entity53 , a @entity55 independent , " ( there ) was give and take on both sides
" that includes the price tag , which is handled with a combination of emergency spending ( as @entity2 hoped ) and offsets ( as @entity1 wanted )
bad @entity11 care may have killed more than 1,000 veterans , senator 's report says specifically , lawmakers would offset some $ 5 billion of the spending by forcing other changes at the @entity11 , including what will amount to a cap on staff bonuses at the agency
but after those cost cuts at the @entity11 , the deal would add approximately $ 12 billion to the federal deficit
that 's usually something that @entity1 would block , but the two leaders behind the bill argue this issue deserves what they call emergency spending
" funding our veterans ' needs must be considered a cost of war , " @entity53 stressed
the toughest sell may be with spending - skeptic @entity92
but @entity95 chairman @entity94 , a @entity96 @entity1 , insists his fellow conservatives will give the bill the votes it needs
" i believe it will ( pass ) , " he told reporters monday
" taking care of veterans is not an inexpensive proposition
and i believe our members understand that
" republicans may warm up to the increased oversight in the measure , which requires an independent report on @entity11 health care , a commission on access to care and a task force to review the agency 's scheduling system
the 130 - page bill also contains a host of smaller provisions : it increases incentives for young doctors to work at the @entity11 by doubling the amount of their student loans the agency can repay per year
the deal comes under threat of travel clock , as @entity129 plans to leave for a five - week break by friday
@entity94 and @entity53 said they expect both chambers to vote on the legislation this week , though exact scheduling is still under discussion
