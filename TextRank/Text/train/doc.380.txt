-- since president @entity2 assumed power , he 's reshaped @entity5 's foreign policy by recalibrating its stresses on sovereignty and stability , what the @entity5 call wei quan and wei wen
on the one hand , @entity5 has stepped up its emphasis on sovereignty , especially concerning its territorial dispute with @entity15 over the @entity16 ( or the @entity17 , as they 're known in @entity15 )
@entity19 has streamlined its various maritime agencies to make them more efficient and better coordinated , and it keeps sending government vessels to the area to demonstrate its jurisdiction over this region
more recently , it announced a new @entity26 ( @entity27 ) in the @entity28 to assure its sovereign security over territory , territorial water and space in the @entity27
on the other hand , @entity5 has attached more importance to its peripheral stability
despite its earlier skirmish over @entity37 with @entity38 in may , it cut a border defense co-operation agreement with @entity40 , to avoid mutual tailing between their patrols in border areas where there is no common understanding of the line of actual control
and recently , president @entity2 and premier @entity50 visited five out of 10 @entity52 countries , and wrapped up a cooperative deal with @entity54 to jointly develop an oil well in the mouth of the @entity57
@entity5 has also furthered its relations with major powers -- @entity2 visited @entity60 and the @entity61 within the first three months of coming to power , promoting a " new type of major country relationship
" however , the quest for sovereignty and stability at the same time could prove challenging
@entity5 's @entity27 announcement is turning into such a case
origins of the @entity27 the concept and practice of @entity27 are not @entity5 's invention
rather , it was invented by the @entity61 in 1951 , with a purpose of identifying , through various means , incoming aircraft toward @entity79
an @entity27 would usually be much bigger than one 's territorial space , to allow sufficient time for such identification
last weekend , the @entity5 government announced its @entity27 , asking foreign military planes flying over this area to identify themselves or , if necessary , the government would take defensive military action to enforce their identification
it is noted that the @entity27 is a national mandate , rather than demanded by any international law
therefore , any other country has to make its own sovereign choice to follow or not
the establishment of the @entity27 looks to be @entity5 's latest attempt to stress sovereignty and stability
the purpose of such identification is to assure @entity5 's sovereignty over its airspace without disrupting the international law of freedom of flight through international airspace
obviously , @entity5 is able to identify those foreign civilian airlines which routinely fly to and from @entity5
@entity5 will also be able to monitor and identify some foreign military aircraft flying over this zone
establishing such a zone would allow @entity5 , ideally , additional time to predict if some of the flights over the area would be harmful and , consequently , if its defense establishment should take precautionary measures
challenge to status quo ? as establishing an @entity27 is a national endeavor rather than one mandated by international law , it is predictable other stakeholders could view it a challenge to the status quo , which suits their national interests
soon after @entity5 's @entity27 was announced , the @entity61 sent two b - 52 bombers into the new air zone on what the @entity61 says was a pre-planned trip
it is understood that the @entity61 strategic bombers neither loaded bombs nor were escorted by jet fighters , and did n't go too close to @entity5 's territorial space , signaling that the mission was not intended as a military threat
such a restrained challenge seems to have led @entity5 to properly balance its quest for sovereignty and stability
if and when @entity5 's newly declared @entity27 is truly challenged , as long as @entity5 could identify the incoming foreign aircraft and manage the challenge to a certain degree , @entity5 would not send aircraft to " greet " them
but certainly , if the incoming foreign aircraft did not respond to @entity5 's query of identity , and if @entity5 detected a threatening posture , its air force would act in a defensive way
though the @entity61 has presented its challenge to @entity5 establishing such a zone , the country 's @entity27 may have more to do with @entity15
@entity15 's own @entity27 has been as close as to 130 kilometers from @entity5 , and includes the @entity16 , or @entity16 , islands
if @entity5 's inclusion of @entity16 is intolerable to @entity15 due to their dispute over this area , @entity15 's inclusion of the same islands , some four decades ago , has much earlier provoked a similar degree of irritation
@entity15 's establishment of its @entity27 was a breach of the status quo at that time
@entity15 further pushed the envelope last year by " nationalizing " the main islands , representing another effort to break the existing status quo
its persistent changing of the status quo can not go unchallenged
@entity5 's efforts to strike a balance between sovereignty and stability are destined to be difficult
however , facing increasing security challenges , @entity19 is likely to respond in kind , while abiding by international law
the opinions in this article are solely those of @entity176 , a professor and associate dean of the @entity179 at @entity180 in @entity181 .
