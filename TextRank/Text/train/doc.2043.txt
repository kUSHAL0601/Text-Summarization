@entity0 , @entity1 -- after emerging from the rubble of @entity7 's @entity6 palace late in august , @entity3 seized control as the military commander of @entity0
an islamist who had taken little public part in the spring uprising against @entity7 , he claimed his soldiers had won the symbolic battle for the palace , the heart of the @entity1 strongman 's regime
by taking control of @entity0 , @entity3 gained authority over a third of the country 's population and a major slice of its wealth
it was a power play that other opposition fighters bitterly resented
@entity29 , one of several rival commanders , claims his fighters endured far tougher and more significant battles than the siege of @entity7 's palace , not least the struggle to win control of @entity0 's main international airport that lasted several days
in an interview with @entity2 he downplayed @entity3 's success and threatened confrontation , as internal divisions threaten to pull apart the coalition that brought @entity7 down
" who is @entity44 and who appointed him ? " @entity29 asks
" we do n't know him
we are the leaders , we are the revolutionists , we know everything
" @entity29 echoes a much wider complaint that @entity3 is actually a stooge of the @entity50
" we know that @entity44 was in a school and @entity50 sends him money to buy weapons , " he said
in @entity0 today it 's a commonly held belief that @entity3 's @entity55 is getting direct funding from @entity50
these concerns come amid reports that a @entity60 delegation traveled to @entity50 last week to raise the issue
@entity50 has been a principal player in pushing the revolution forward as part of the @entity60 alliance
now there 's growing unease in the @entity1 capital that fractures among the groups controlling the country could have roots in divisions among the international coalition that overthrew @entity7
@entity3 , also known by his @entity74 , @entity75 , was the military leader of the @entity76 , @entity76 , and denies any nefarious ties to @entity50
but @entity1 's rumor mill quickly turns suspicion into fact and he is finding it hard to shake the slur
his @entity76 began fighting @entity7 in the 1980s
after @entity7 successfully crushed the @entity76 , the group went underground and scattered
at its peak , the @entity76 had underground cells in more than 20 countries , including @entity86 , where it shared training camps with @entity89
@entity3 had joined the new revolution with a ready - made army and a political religious ideology to boot
i know this because in 2009 i was trying to interview him when he was an inmate inside the notorious @entity96 jail in @entity0
in his writings then , he was trying to lead the group away from violent jihad towards a more political ideology
the so - called recantation theories , a 400 - page manifesto he and several other fighting group leaders wrote from within the walls of the high security prison was the first ever direct jihadist challenge to @entity108 's nihilistic ideology
@entity108 and @entity3 had never been natural bedfellows , but now they were enemies
still , none of this cuts the mustard in @entity0 today ; he 's just another leader with an agenda
@entity7 himself predicted his detractors had little in common and would soon fight among themselves
sure enough , as weeks of street uprisings dragged out into months of @entity60 bombing , fractures appeared
@entity120 , @entity7 's old ally and military chief who deserted him for the rebels was murdered in suspicious circumstances
many feared it was the handiwork of the @entity126 cutting down a moderate who might have made deals with some of his former boss 's friends
today the fight is a war of words played out in the newly liberated conference halls of the capital
at the weekend , @entity138 ( @entity138 ) chairman @entity137 tried to reconcile the growing differences
after a contentious group meeting with all the commanders , the atmosphere became so heated that he was forced to meet the next day with individual factions seperately
on the capital 's streets , the power struggle has more sinister overtones
first , @entity3 , citing the @entity137 and the @entity138 's backing , called for all heavy weapons to be put under his command or moved out of the city
" we call on all the revolutionary brigades and small local councils to join this framework as acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the transitional council , " he said
it is statements like this that rankle with @entity29
@entity29 claims it is his group , the @entity162 , that has the authority to have the weapons rounded up
legitimacy in the capital , he says , is garnered from the neighborhood councils established to funnel weapons to fighters before the final push to over throw @entity7
but his challenge extends beyond @entity3 to the @entity138 and @entity137 , the man who many regard as the very glue holding the disparate groups together
" we gave this council the legitimacy and if we want we can withdraw the legitimacy from the transitional council ...
then we have no problem with withdrawing its legitimacy , " @entity29 said
the root of the problem is that many @entity1 's are loyal to family , tribe , village and town before nation
they 've fought often isolated in their towns , @entity192 in the western mountains , @entity194 under siege on the coast for 6 months and @entity197 , its own large fiefdom in the east
@entity0 's patchwork of neighborhood councils is but a minor mirror of that
@entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 -- to name but a few -- saw many of the weapons smuggled in to the city over the summer
it 's given them muscle and the power to punch above their weight , as well as some freedom to choose sides
@entity3 claims many are loyal to him
" we have met with all the local revolutionary councils and other small councils and we have agreed on a written statement we will show it to media soon , " he claimed
trouble is @entity29 claims loyalty from some of the same councils
meanwhile , the overnight thump of heavy guns being fired off for fun across many of @entity0 's neighborhoods has dwindled
but no - one here is fooled that they 've gone silent for good
tensions are leading to uncertainty
no - one wants to be boxed in like they were with @entity7 , lives bounded by parameters
revolution has given a taste of freedom and the capital 's citizens desperately want that seductive flavor on tap for good , enshrined in a genuine democracy before @entity126 or anyone else starts taking their choices away
when the men in uniforms with guns and not the politicians in suits start to argue , people get afraid
both @entity3 and @entity29 say they want to resolve their differences by talking
but over the past few weeks since @entity7 's family fled his @entity260 palace , misunderstanding and distrust have grown
reversing it is proving to be a formidable challenge .
