@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 won a @entity4 for the @entity1 bank he founded but now he finds himself in a bitter fight to retain his job
@entity3 pioneered microcredit financing and founded @entity9 nearly three decades ago in an effort to alleviate poverty by lending to the poor
he refused wednesday to bow to government demands and resign from the bank that won him a @entity15 in 2006
" we established @entity9 through a special ordinance , with rules that are specific , according to which my current term as managing director is fully valid , " he said
" @entity22 has three representatives on the board and they have unanimously approved these rules
" @entity9 caught the world 's attention by specializing in providing loans to low - income entrepreneurs who were unable to secure money through regular banks
@entity3 quickly gained a reputation as a " banker to the poor
" @entity1 finance minister @entity36 said @entity3 was too old to run the bank and should step down
" normally the retirement age of a bank 's managing director in @entity1 is 65 , and professor @entity3 is now 70 , " @entity36 said
the pressure stems from allegations in a television documentary that @entity3 illegally diverted @entity9 money
@entity9 denied the charges and @entity46 , a key bank donor , found no evidence of wrongdoing
but the larger debate has been over the notion of microcredit itself
its critics have charged that lenders were making big money off small loans
@entity1 prime minister @entity58 minced no words when she compared @entity9 's operations to " sucking the blood from the poor in the name of alleviating poverty
" " it is a question of explaining to her , " @entity3 told @entity2 in a recent interview
" she probably has no close connection to that , all the good things that microcredit has done globally , not just in @entity1
" @entity3 has admitted serious problems that have surfaced recently in the world of microfinancing
poor families have complained about debt burdens and loan sharks who charge an exorbitant interest
@entity3 conceded some lenders have taken advantage of the system
but , he insisted to @entity2 , that a few bad apples should not undermine the idea of microcredit
" the idea will not disappear , " he said
" it is a question of teething problems
it is a question of misuse and abuse of the idea
" @entity36 said the push for @entity3 ' resignation had no link to politics , but many analysts say @entity3 is still under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party four years ago during an interim , unelected military - backed government
that party was later abandoned
@entity3 faces a defamation charge for comments he made four years ago to the @entity107 news agency that politicians were only in " power to make money
" several prominent figures have stepped up in @entity3 ' defense , including @entity113 , the former @entity115 president and @entity117 @entity116 , who chairs a newly formed " @entity119 " initiative
" one of the priorities is also to support the independence of @entity9 and its founder @entity125 , who together were awarded the @entity4 in 2006 , as they have been the target of an ongoing pressure campaign of rumors and misleading information , " the group said in a statement
@entity2 's @entity130 and @entity131 and journalist @entity132 contributed to this report .
