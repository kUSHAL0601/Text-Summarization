@entity0 , @entity1 -- ex-new @entity1 police commissioner @entity3 was sentenced to 48 months in prison thursday after pleading guilty to charges of lying to @entity8 administration officials who vetted his unsuccessful 2004 nomination for homeland security secretary
the sentence , handed down by @entity13 district judge @entity12 , exceeded the 27 - to 33 - month prison term recommended by federal prosecutors
" with great power comes great responsibility and comes great consequences , " @entity12 said in court
@entity3 , accompanied by his wife and son , addressed the court before his sentencing
" i make no excuses , " the former police commissioner said
" i take full responsibility for my actions
i have learned from this
i know i will be punished , but i only wish you would allow me return to my wife and two little girls as soon as possible
" @entity3 , 54 , pleaded guilty in november to tax fraud and six other felonies and has been under house arrest in @entity35 , @entity36 , since then
he must surrender to authorities to begin his sentence by may 17
after the sentencing , @entity3 told reporters he wanted to " apologize to the @entity13 people for the mistakes i 've made and for which i have just accepted responsibility
" " as history is written , i can only hope that i will be judged for the 30 years of service that i 've given to this country and the city of @entity1 , " he said
in court papers , prosecutors said @entity3 denied to a @entity52 official that there was " any possible concern " about his relationships with contractors involved in renovating an apartment of his or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors
@entity3 had been scheduled to go to trial on a variety of corruption charges , including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $ 255,000 in renovations to his @entity68 , @entity1 , apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of @entity1
he pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax - related counts in november
@entity3 was @entity1 police commissioner from 1998 to 2002 , a tenure that included the september 11 , 2001 , attacks that destroyed the @entity76 and killed more than 2,700 people
he spent a brief stint in @entity79 training the country 's police force after the @entity13 invasion in 2003 , and president @entity8 nominated him to be homeland security secretary in 2004
however , @entity3 withdrew from consideration after allegations surfaced that he had employed a nanny with a murky immigration status
in 2006 , he pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while he working as city corrections commissioner
under his plea agreement , he paid $ 221,000 in fines and avoided jail time
his admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron , former @entity1 mayor @entity94 , who said his endorsement of @entity3 had been " a mistake
" @entity3 made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to @entity8 in 2008 , according to court papers released in october .
