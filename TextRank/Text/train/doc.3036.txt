at least six people were killed yesterday in exchanges of gunfire between the rebels and armed forces
authorities said it was unclear how many hostages were still being held by the estimated 300 armed @entity8 rebels in the blockaded areas of @entity9 , a mainly @entity31 city on the southern coast of @entity33
@entity34 and local government secretary @entity35 told a press conference that authorities believed as many as 180 people -- which he described as " human shields " -- could be being held hostage
" these are very soft estimates , " said @entity35 , who flew in from @entity43 to supervise operations
hundreds of troops have been deployed to @entity9 in response to the crisis
" it 's hard to determine ( whether ) they 're hostages or just residents of the area , but we are taking these numbers quite seriously and that is why the military and the police have exercised restraint
" @entity35 did not say whether the rebels had made any demands " there are ongoing talks , formal and informal , in various stages of maturity , " he said
" we are also seeking to validate the bonafides of those presenting themselves as mediators so that we are not led astray in these talks
" an @entity71 spokesman told the @entity73 newspaper that the group was holding 35 hostages
" we seized them by the roadside so the soldiers wo n't shoot when they see us , " he said
according to a statement issued by @entity81 , the crisis began at around 4.30 a.m. local time monday when government forces clashed with armed rebels heading for the city by boat
six people , including a policeman , a navy serviceman and four civilians , were killed during the course of these clashes
she said the rebels had planned to march on the city hall
the @entity71 , a separatist movement founded in 1971 by @entity97 with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for @entity100 in this mainly @entity102 country , signed a peace deal with the central government in @entity43 in 1996 -- though some of its members have broken away to continue with a violent campaign
under the terms of the 1996 agreement , @entity97 was named as governor of an expanded @entity111 in @entity33 ( @entity33 )
last month @entity97 issued a " declaration of independence " for the @entity120 nation -- referring to @entity33 's indigenous @entity8 population -- after complaining that the @entity71 had been left out of a recent wealth - sharing agreement with an another insurgent group , the @entity113 ( @entity113 ) , which has fought for decades to set up an independent @entity115 state on the resource - rich island of @entity33
