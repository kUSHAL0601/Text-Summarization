@entity0 -- politics trumped progress on friday as president @entity4 and @entity6 leaders traded blame for $ 85 billion in forced spending cuts after they failed to come up with a compromise to avert the harshest impacts
the president signed an order required by law that set in motion the automatic , government - wide cuts
@entity4 and congressional leaders from both parties met for about 45 minutes at the @entity18 , but no agreement emerged to avert the cuts that both sides oppose
after weeks of campaign - style events intended to inspire public outrage over the cuts , @entity4 sought to temper his description of their impact while making clear he thinks @entity6 intransigence prevented a deal to avoid the economic harm they 'll cause
" we will get through this , " he told reporters
" this is not going to be an apocalypse as some people have said
it 's just dumb and it 's going to hurt
" full text of @entity4 order still , a @entity18 budget office report sent to @entity40 and released with @entity4 's order said the cuts would be " deeply destructive to national security , domestic investments , and core government functions
" the action was described in the report as " a blunt and indiscriminate instrument " that was " never intended to be implemented and does not represent a responsible way " for the country to realize deficit reduction
@entity53 report to @entity40 in a sign of the potential impact , the @entity54 sent furlough notices to employees that warned they may be forced to take days off without pay in coming months
similar furloughs , as well as reduced services , were expected at other agencies if the cuts do n't get replaced or eliminated
military leaders have warned of impaired readiness of @entity67 forces
shame and blame : why @entity0 needs couples therapy however , the full impact of the cuts were n't expected until april at the earliest
the cuts amount to roughly 9 % for a broad range of non-defense programs and 13 % for the @entity75 over the rest of the current fiscal year , which ends on september 30
they were included in a 2011 deal to raise the federal borrowing limit as an unacceptable outcome if @entity40 failed to agree on a comprehensive deficit reduction plan
@entity4 's press conference on spending cuts however , election - year politics stymied progress on such a deal , leading to the situation friday in which both sides acknowledged being unable to prevent something neither wanted
" there are smarter ways to cut spending , " said @entity18 speaker @entity91 , @entity92 , after the meeting with @entity4
@entity91 repeated his past assertion that the @entity6 - led @entity18 has offered proposals to replace the forced spending cuts while the @entity101 - led @entity100 has not , as well as his party 's opposition to any increased tax revenue to offset the forced spending cuts
others who also took part in the @entity18 gathering were senate majority leader @entity109 , senate minority leader @entity110 and @entity18 minority leader @entity111
in the @entity18 briefing room , @entity4 told reporters that @entity6 in @entity40 " allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful ( tax ) loophole to help reduce the deficit
" " as recently as yesterday , they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the well off and the well connected and they think that that 's apparently more important than protecting our military or middle class families from the pain of these cuts , " @entity4 said
he was referring to a procedural vote on thursday in which @entity100 @entity6 blocked a @entity101 proposal that called for eliminating some tax loopholes as part of a package with spending cuts
@entity91 and @entity6 say the president and @entity101 have yet to propose a serious plan to reduce spending , including costly entitlement programs , on a scale necessary to bring chronic federal deficits and debt under control
both @entity4 and @entity91 foreshadowed the next major spending showdown - a march 27 deadline for @entity40 to authorize funding to keep the government running for the rest of the fiscal year
4 myths about the spending cuts @entity91 told reporters that the @entity18 will take up a measure next week to authorize federal funding beyond that deadline
" the president and leaders agreed legislation should be enacted this month to prevent a government shutdown while we continue to work on a solution to replace the " forced spending cuts , said a statement by @entity91 's office
although the funding measure is unconnected to the spending cuts , @entity4 indicated he was open to a broader agreement that would resolve both issues
" i do know that there are @entity6 in @entity40 who privately , at least , say that they would rather close tax loopholes then let these cuts go through , " said @entity4 in response to questions from reporters
" ... in the coming days and the coming weeks , i 'm going to keeping on reaching out to them -- both individually and as groups of senators or members of the @entity18 -- and say to them , ' let 's fix this , not just for a month or two , but for years to come , ' because the greatest nation on @entity177 does not conduct its business in month - to - month increments or by careening from crisis to crisis , " @entity4 said
spending cuts : when they 'll really bite @entity1 's @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .
