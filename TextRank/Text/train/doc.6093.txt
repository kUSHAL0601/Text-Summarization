-- tens of thousands of anti-government protesters are expected to join a march on @entity5 's capital as the country celebrates its independence
the protest was called by former @entity5 cricket captain and leader of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) political party , @entity8 , who declared it a " march of independence
" he has demanded the resignation of prime minister @entity18 amid claims of vote rigging during last year 's election
another prominent opponent of the government , outspoken cleric @entity22 , also called on his supporters to join what he described as a " revolution march , " sparking fresh security fears
last week , at least five of his supporters were killed during clashes with security forces in the country 's northwestern @entity32 province
@entity22 , who led protests against @entity5 's government last year that brought the capital to a standstill , has accused the @entity18 government of corruption
@entity22 has previously called for the military to be involved in the electoral process , causing alarm in a country with a history of coups
critics accuse the cleric , who was until recently based in @entity49 , of working on behalf of the military -- an allegation he denies
he maintains that he is working only to ensure a corruption - free electoral process
security operation thousands of security personnel have been deployed along the planned route from the city of @entity57 to @entity58 , while massive shipping containers and reels of barbed wire have been used to seal off many roads
cell phone coverage has also been temporarily suspended across some areas
under @entity66 of @entity5 's penal code , the authorities have prohibited " all kinds of gatherings of five or more persons , processions / rallies and demonstrations at any public place , " while control of @entity58 's security has been handed to the army
representatives of opposition leader @entity8 told @entity0 that they planned to arrive in the capital at 6 p.m. local time ( 9 a.m. et ) on thursday , where they will rally in the city 's " red zone , " a tightly controlled area containing many government buildings
@entity5 's @entity86 reported that an agreement has been struck between authorities and protest organizers to permit the rally on the condition participants remain in @entity58 for one day only
@entity0 could not confirm this
government response on wednesday , in a rare address to the country , prime minister @entity18 refuted accusations of electoral rigging and stressed that @entity5 has moved forward over the past 14 months in terms of " currency value , foreign investment and economic growth
" in an apparent attempt to appease @entity8 's demands for an investigation into electoral fraud last year , @entity18 offered to form a commission consisting of three @entity110 judges to investigate the claims
but at a press conference shortly after the prime minister 's address , @entity8 said the government 's response had arrived too late in the day and that he was now officially calling for the resignation of @entity18
protest leaders are expecting around 100,000 people to join the march during what is a national holiday to mark @entity5 's independence following @entity125 rule in 1947
@entity5 , so often a nation in crisis , is currently involved in a costly military campaign against militants in its restive northwestern tribal region
but the air and ground offensive has displaced an estimated 500,000 people -- including 180,000 children according to the @entity135 -- from their homes in @entity137
7 killed in @entity5 drone strike , sources say
