@entity0 , @entity1 -- from her @entity0 kitchen , @entity3 is lobbying legislators , crafting signs and making phone calls as she wages a battle to allow gays and lesbians to marry in her state
the married mother of two does n't have a personal stake in the fight
rather , @entity3 represents the growing number of people nationwide who support gay rights regardless of their own sexual orientation
" i have gay and lesbian friends and family who are raising children and creating lives , and they deserve to be treated fairly , " she says
as national polls show a shift in attitudes about same - sex marriage , @entity3 's state of @entity1 is one of three poised to put the issue to an up - or - down popular vote for the first time next month
while support has grown , there are still many who oppose allowing gays to marry and are doing their part to strike the measure down
the rev. @entity38 and his wife , @entity39 , of @entity40 in @entity0 run workshops for single african - americans in an effort to encourage strong marriages and discourage sexual behaviors that can lead to hiv / aids
" i do understand and accept that there are other patterns for families , " @entity47 says
" however , the basic prescription for marriage , i embrace it as a biblical prescription
a man and a woman
" her husband is quick to point out that though the @entity63 support the traditional view of marriage , it " does not mean that we do n't love our gay , lesbian and transgender brothers and sisters
" " it means that we do n't take our direction from the president , whoever he or she may be
it is a reminder to us that @entity72 loves the sinner , but hates the sin , " @entity38 says
what a difference voters have mostly agreed with the @entity78 ' views
thirty - eight states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same sex , mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman
in the six states -- @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 -- and the @entity97 where gays and lesbians have won marriage rights , it was because of actions taken by judges or legislators , not voters
but what a difference an election cycle makes
four years ago , three states -- @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 -- joined the list of those with constitutional amendments banning same - sex marriage , while @entity116 banned same - sex couples from adopting
this year , @entity1 , @entity118 and @entity97 could go the other way
@entity118 could represent the biggest turnaround
the state rejected their governor 's decision to allow same - sex marriage in 2009 , but recent polling suggests a shift
the @entity129 of @entity130 released a poll october 10 saying " 55 % of @entity133 plan to vote in support of same - sex marriage " and another 1.3 % are leaning that way , the @entity128 reported
@entity97 and @entity1 , meanwhile , are voting on whether to affirm decisions made by their legislatures and supported by their governors
" the biggest difference going into this election as opposed to the last election is that a majority of @entity148 now support the freedom to marry , we have a president of the @entity148 that supports the freedom to marry , we have six states and the @entity97 where gay people can share in the freedom to marry , " says @entity139 , founder of @entity140 , a group supporting the right of gays to marry
a @entity2 / @entity157 poll in june found that a majority of @entity148 support marriage rights for gays and lesbians , reflecting a dramatic shift in public opinion over the past two decades
the number of @entity148 who say they have a close friend or family member who is gay or lesbian , meanwhile , has jumped from 49 % in 2010 to 60 % today , the first time in @entity2 polling that a majority of @entity148 have said that
in the 1990s , most @entity148 said they did not know anyone close to them who was gay
@entity173 , the executive director of the @entity96 chapter of @entity175 , says ties with gay people have prompted non-gays to support gay rights causes in increasing numbers
" when you come at something and you know someone who is gay , it takes the fear out of the issue and makes it clear that it 's just a simple matter of equality , " he says
the november votes come as courts are moving to overturn the @entity194 , one of the biggest obstacles to gay rights supporters
the divisive act , passed in 1996 , bars federal recognition of marriages between people of the same sex and says states can not be forced to recognize them
timeline : same - sex marriage on thursday , a federal appeals court in @entity96 became the nation 's second to strike down the law , saying that it violates the @entity212 's equal protection clause
read the ruling ( @entity214 )
a federal appeals court in @entity216 made a similar ruling in may
the appellate court decisions mean the next step is likely to be a review by the @entity148 @entity221
related : federal court strikes down @entity194 courting minority voters in @entity1 , gay rights advocates hope minorities will turn out to support the ballot measure -- known as question 6
nearly 30 % of voters in @entity1 are black and 8.4 % are @entity228
both communities have shown a surge of support since may , when president @entity232 came out in support of same - sex marriage
@entity236 polls taken before and after @entity232 's announcement showed an 18 - point jump in the number of african - americans who support same - sex marriage
also , 52 % in a recent @entity242 national poll of @entity243 said they support same - sex marriage , a significant increase from 2006 when 52 % said they opposed it
partnerships with racial and ethnic minorities became more important to the gay and lesbian community after 2008 , when @entity111 voters approved a ballot measure to ban same - sex marriages
voter exit polls showed strong support for the measure by blacks and @entity243
@entity139 , of @entity140 , says that gay rights groups reacted by reaching out more aggressively to minority communities and encouraging gays and lesbians who are minorities to talk to their own friends and families about gay rights
" i think it will be huge if the african - americans of this state do what i think they 're going to do , which is to recognize that everybody is entitled to equal protection under the law , " says @entity3 , who is black
also supporting allowing gays and lesbians to marry in @entity1 is the @entity276 , which has put the civil rights group at loggerheads with clergy such as @entity38
@entity38 accuses gay groups of forging convenient ties with black and @entity228 communities , while doing little to champion other minority causes
" where is this money for education to pour out to @entity228 and @entity289 - @entity148 communities , " @entity38 asks
@entity290 , a spokesman for @entity291 , says the group is focused only on question 6 right now and not other minority ballot issues like a local version of the @entity295 , which aims to protect undocumented young immigrants from deportation
@entity298 , a married father of three from prince @entity299 , has turned his opposition to question 6 into a full - time job
he sees the ballot measure as a threat to his own personal freedoms
" we are making a fundamental shift in what society sees as marriage , " he says
" when we look at it , people are asking to change our religious and civil liberties
" big money @entity315 6 has attracted big money from supporters and opponents around the country
a recent @entity321 poll showed the gay community winning the issue by a 9 - point margin just days after @entity96 mayor @entity325 donated $ 250,000 to @entity291
hedge fund manager @entity326 donated the same amount
former @entity329 commissioner @entity328 lives in the @entity97 , but he and his family have donated $ 100,000 to @entity291
in past campaigns to expand marriage rights , little connection was made between dollars spent and outcome , and gay rights organizations were not always leading the way on collecting money from out of state
this time , if gay rights groups are n't outpacing opponents in raising out - of - state funds , they 're close
@entity173 , @entity343 and @entity326 's combined donation of $ 600,000 is nearly as much as the entire budget of their opponents
the @entity348 , which opposes allowing same - sex marriage , has a $ 2 million matching grant challenge on its website targeting the november initiatives
the @entity353 , a @entity354 organization that opposes same - sex marriage , acknowledged last week that it has spent at least $ 6 million since 2005 on a variety of initiatives opposing the expansion of marriage rights
in the @entity1 race , gay rights groups appear to be leading in fund raising , with $ 3.2 million to $ 835,000 for their opponents
according to the @entity364 , gay civil rights activists in that state are ahead $ 10.5 million to $ 1.8 million
@entity118 gay rights supporters have $ 3.35 million to their opponents ' $ 430,000 , according to the @entity367 on @entity368
" the top goal for the second half of 2012 is to win one of these ballot measures , " @entity139 says
" we 've shown that we can win the freedom to marry in public opinion
we 've shown that we can win the freedom to marry in courts
we 've shown that we can win the freedom to marry in legislatures
... we 've shown we can win the freedom to marry with the support of both @entity382 and @entity384 legislatures
the last barrier we have to overcome is to show we can win the freedom to marry in an up - or - down vote on the ballot
