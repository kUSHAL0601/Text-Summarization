-- the @entity1 announced further easing measures on friday , as economic data suggested slowing growth and persistent deflationary forces in the world 's third - largest economy
the @entity1 increased the scale of its key asset - purchasing programme by @entity10 ( $ 61.7bn ) to @entity11 , while adjusting the terms to allow it to buy more government debt , and with longer maturities
it also kept interest rates at between zero and 0.1 per cent
before the announcement market expectations had been building that the @entity1 would underline its commitment to the " powerful monetary easing " as it was described by governor @entity19 during a trip to the @entity21 last week
politicians within @entity23 have also been urging the @entity1 to do more to fight the nation 's chronic state of mild deflation , threatening to strip the bank of its independence should it fail to act aggressively
analysts noted , however , that friday 's move was at the low end of expectations of an additional @entity34 to @entity35 of easing
" while it is positive that the @entity1 acted , it is not sufficient to recover its long - lost credibility as an inflation - fighter , " said @entity37 , chief @entity23 economist at @entity39
economic data on friday supported the case for continuing loose policy
industrial production rose a less - than - expected 1 per cent in march from february , while manufacturers said they planned to cut output by as much as 4.1 per cent in may
while consumer price inflation numbers were a little brighter , with the headline nationwide index rising 0.5 per cent year - on - year , core @entity55 in @entity54 ( excluding food and energy ) fell by 1 per cent in april from a year earlier , deteriorating from -0.9 per cent in march
this " chilly set of data " showed that manufacturers are still cautious on the outlook for exports , leaving @entity23 reliant on buoyant domestic demand as its main source of growth this year , said mr @entity37
in february the central bank surprised markets by adding @entity66 to its asset - purchasing programme while adopting a firmer goal for inflation of 1 per cent , touching off a fall in the yen
since then , though , the @entity1 has kept its settings largely unchanged
in march the board expanded the terms of a special lending facility set up in june 2010 , while earlier this month it confirmed details of a new @entity78 lending facility , denominated in @entity21 dollars , which it announced in march
meanwhile , the yen has resumed its strengthening trend
in the past month it has gained against every other @entity83 currency
one hour after the announcement on friday the yen was 0.4 per cent weaker at 81.23 against the dollar , while the nikkei 225 stock average gained 0.3 per cent
" not moving [ on friday ] was not an option , " said @entity88 , chief @entity23 bond strategist at @entity90 in @entity54
