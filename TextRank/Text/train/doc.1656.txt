-- @entity1 , whose television adventures on the fictional island of @entity5 have delighted children around the world for years , is now on a real - life mission to help kids with autism
@entity1 is part of a new online game to help autistic children recognize different emotions
the steam locomotive and his friends are the stars of a new game in @entity20 , designed to help autistic children recognize emotions
@entity22 ( @entity23 ) , a nonprofit that provides services to people diagnosed with the developmental disorder , unveiled the game on its web site tuesday
the game asks players to recognize which engine has a sad face , or which is happy or angry
children with autism often have a difficult time distinguishing different facial expressions
each time a child plays the game , he / she is presented with a different sequence of emotions
in doing so , the game takes advantage of the single - mindedness of autistic children to assist in their development
" it 's a great way to help develop social and communication skills , " said @entity45 of @entity23
a study conducted in the @entity49 found that autistic children were far more fascinated by the television series , " @entity53 , " than they were with other fictional characters
the study , by the @entity54 , summarized that the show held such appeal because of the clear facial expressions of the characters , the pacing of the program and the easy - to - follow story lines
" we got those results down here , and we thought , how could we leverage that strength and give a little back to the community ? " said @entity63 with @entity64 , the company that handles licensing for the characters in @entity20
@entity45 said one of the reasons @entity1 is particularly stimulating and motivating for children with autism is that it 's very predictable
" children can understand the clear visual messages -- the big smile on the front of the engine , " he said
" the messages it communicates are very concrete , not abstract
and the emotions are primary emotions
" autism is a developmental disorder that affects physical , social and language skills
it usually appears before age 3 , though the earliest signs are subtle
more doctors and researchers are referring to " autism " as " autisms , " because each child 's case is different , as are the causes , helpful therapies and potential treatments
the @entity20 nonprofit unveiled the game this month to coincide with @entity102 in that country
after all , as the show 's theme song attests : " @entity106 and green and brown and blue ; they 're the really useful crew
