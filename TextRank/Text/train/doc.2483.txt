@entity0 : a disturbing , drug - induced experience brought on by the overconsumption of marijuana edibles
usage : " aww man , i ate all those cookies and now i 'm dowding , hard
" ok , so " dowding " may not be a real word -- yet -- but its namesake , @entity12 columnist @entity10 , knows a thing or two about a bad trip
she went to @entity16 earlier this year and famously freaked out after eating too much marijuana - infused chocolate
" i became convinced that i had died and no one was telling me , " she wrote of the experience
or , as dr. @entity23 might have explained , " you took too much , man
you took too much , too much
" related : @entity12 's @entity10 inspires effort to educate @entity25 about edibles now , thanks to new rules coming on line early next year , marijuana newbies may have an easier time avoiding @entity10 's fate
starting in february , all recreational marijuana edibles have to come in single - serving sizes or sections
and some of @entity16 's edible makers are already cranking out the personal - sized goodies
10,000 personal - sized goodies , that is , for each pound of marijuana they produce
at @entity44 here recently , executive chef @entity43 was making a seasonal favorite , pumpkin pie
the single - serving pies , like the chocolate chip cookies , brownies and @entity50 , are made with butter infused with marijuana , or cannabutter
get it ? ) related : pumpkin pot pie for her batch of pie crusts , @entity55 used butter simmered in about a half pound of weed and then strained
butter is the medium of choice because it tastes good and is easy to digest , explained owner @entity65
and all her single - serving baked goods contain 10mg of @entity67 , about equivalent of smoking a joint , @entity65 said
but , it 's a different kind of high
" it 's more of a body high , when you smoke it 's more psychoactive , " she explained
but eat too much and you could soon find yourself dowding
and that 's where the smaller sizes come in handy
" breaking our products into single servings makes it intuitive for someone to eat one serving and know that if they are going to have more , they actually have to take another bite , " she said
" they do n't have to try to do the math and cut a cookie or a truffle up into several pieces
" and that should help keep nubes like @entity10 from going to pieces .
