-- it was a june day in 2000
the @entity2 were facing the @entity3 at @entity4
i was on hand to profile one of @entity9 's players for @entity10 , but my cell phone rang , and a dreadful request followed
" supposedly @entity14 and @entity15 are dating , " my editor said
" can you go ask him about it ? " glub
i was 27 years old , relatively new to the baseball beat
there are things i 'd have been willing to ask @entity14
do you like cats ? what 's your favorite song on the new @entity26 cd ? have you ever been to @entity27 ? the one thing i did n't want to ask him about was his all - over - the - gossip - pages relationship with @entity15
alas , i needed to keep my job
i entered the @entity2 clubhouse and immediately spotted @entity14 , alone by his locker , changing into his uniform
" @entity14 , " i said , " i hate asking you this , and i 'm really embarrassed , but my editor insisted
he wanted me to approach you about @entity15
" i expected @entity14 to tell me to bug off
i expected @entity14 to demand my removal from his space
i did not expect what ensued — laughter
" listen , " he said , grinning , " i understand you 're just doing your job
and i 'm not mad or irritated
but i 'm not going to comment , because it 's no one 's business but mine
just because i play baseball does n't mean i have to tell everyone everything
my life is my life
" we shook hands , and i walked off — content and relieved , but mostly impressed
now , 14 years later , with @entity14 announcing that the upcoming season will be his last , i remain impressed
really , when i think of @entity14 , the classy @entity2 shortstop whose 2019 @entity59 induction is a 100 % lock , the word that pops into my head is encouraged
yes , i am encouraged
@entity14 , you see , does not have a @entity65 account
he does not refer to himself in the third person or have his nickname tattooed across his back
( come to think of it , he does n't really have a nickname
) he 's never gone out of his way to publicly humiliate an opponent or prop himself up with inane boasts of superiority
if the words " i 'm the man " ever escaped his lips , they were surely followed by , " ... who ordered the pizza about 20 minutes ago
i decided to pick it up instead
can i also grab a bottle of water and some napkins ? " throughout the first 18 seasons of his career , @entity14 has often been labeled " dull " by the media
his answers to questions are unimaginative and full of cliché baseball nothingness blather
in hindsight , however , such lameness is almost to be admired
we live in an era where too many athletes feel as if they need to draw attention to themselves — for confidence , for commercials
if you 're not tweeting trash talk , you 're texting trash talk
or demanding money or respect
@entity14 has both money and respect , byproducts of a dogged work ethic and a need to play with 100 % ferocity , health be damned
his 3,316 hits are the most in @entity2 history , and his 256 home runs , 1,261 rbis , 348 stolen bases and .312 lifetime batting average serve as odes to a continued brilliance
most important , you never hear a bad word about the man
back in 1997 , @entity10 ran a cover story on the next generation of @entity125 shortstops
the piece highlighted the skills of @entity14 , @entity129 's @entity128 , @entity131 's @entity130 , @entity133 's @entity132 and the @entity135 ' @entity134
the men were listed as near - equals , and writer @entity138 noted that , " not since 1941 have so many young shortstops arrived with this much potential
" before long , however , things changed
@entity134 never learned to hit
@entity132 spent many years in the game as a good but not especially great player
@entity128 was doomed by accusations of doping
that left @entity14 — the most understated of the group , the most professional of the group
he will be remembered by many people for many things
among @entity2 fans , he 's grouped with @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 as pinstriped royalty
among @entity159 fans , he 's a thorn to the skull
among @entity163 fans , he 's a killer of dreams
to me , though , he 's a guy who merely wanted to be a guy
that 's what makes him exceptional
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .
