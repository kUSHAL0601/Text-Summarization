-- @entity2 leaders and the @entity3 struck a last - minute deal to avert the feared fiscal cliff monday night , with vice president @entity6 headed to the @entity7 to pitch the plan to fellow @entity9
" @entity13 , " @entity6 , who became the @entity9 point man in the talks , told reporters
" did you think we would be here @entity17 ? " a senior @entity9 aide told @entity0 that if caucus meetings went well , a @entity2 vote could come " within the hour
" but the @entity21 went home long before midnight , meaning nothing will get through @entity24 before the combination of tax increases and spending cuts lawmakers have been scrambling to head off starts to kick in , at least on paper
a source familiar with the deal told @entity0 that the @entity2 proposal would put off the cuts for two months and keep the expiring bush - era tax cuts for individuals earning less than $ 400,000 or couples earning less than $ 450,000
president @entity36 has long demanded that the threshold be set at $ 250,000
tax rates on income above those levels would go back to the @entity42 - era rate of 39.6 % , up from the current 35 % , and itemized deductions would be capped at $ 250,000 for individuals and $ 300,000 for couples
that would generate an estimated $ 600 billion in additional revenue over 10 years
taxes on inherited estates will go up to 40 % from 35 % , but the exemption will be indexed to rise with inflation -- a provision the source said was added at the insistence of moderate @entity9
unemployment insurance would be extended for a year for for 2 million people , and the alternative minimum tax -- a perennial issue -- would be permanently adjusted for inflation
child care , tuition and research and development tax credits would be renewed
and the " @entity65 " -- reimbursements for doctors who take @entity69 patients -- will continue , but it wo n't be paid for out of the @entity36 administration 's signature health care law
@entity6 had been in negotiations with @entity2 minority leader @entity71 , @entity72 , since sunday afternoon
senate majority leader @entity73 and @entity3 minority leader @entity74 , both democrats , agreed to the plan in calls with president @entity36 , a @entity9 source said monday night
in the @entity3 , @entity80 sources said earlier monday that there 's little practical difference in settling the issue monday night versus tuesday
but if tax - averse @entity3 @entity84 approve the bill on tuesday -- when taxes have technically gone up -- they can argue they 've voted for a tax cut to bring rates back down , even after just a few hours , @entity80 sources said
that could bring some more republicans on board , one source said
economists warn the one - two punch of tax increases and spending cuts , known as " sequestration , " could push the @entity99 economy back into recession and drive unemployment back over 9 % by the end of 2013
@entity36 had chided lawmakers for their last - minute scramble earlier monday , hitting a nerve among several @entity84 in the @entity2
latest updates : final fiscal cliff scramble " they are close , but they 're not there yet , " he said
" and one thing we can count on with respect to this @entity24 is that if there is even one second left before you have to do what you 're supposed to do , they will use that last second
" the president warned that if @entity84 think they can get future deficit reduction solely through spending cuts " that will hurt seniors , or hurt students , or hurt middle - class families without asking also equivalent sacrifice from millionaires or companies with a lot of lobbyists ... they 've got another thing coming
" that irked @entity84 senators who have been grappling for a deal with the @entity9 majority in that chamber
sen. @entity139 , @entity140 , called the president 's comments " very unbecoming of where we are at this moment " and added , " my heart 's still pounding
" " i know the president has fun heckling @entity24 , " @entity139 said
" i think he lost probably numbers of votes with what he did

at the @entity161 , a @entity161 official said as many as 800,000 civilian employees could be forced to take unpaid days off as the armed services face an expected $ 62 billion in cuts in 2013 -- about 12 % of its budget
those workers perform support tasks across the department , from maintaining aircraft and weapons systems to processing military payrolls and counseling families
the @entity161 believes it can operate for at least two months before any furloughs are necessary , but has to warn its civilian workforce that furloughs could be coming , the official said

but @entity24 failed to substitute other cuts by the end of 2012 , forcing the government to wield what the budget office called " a blunt and indiscriminate instrument
" in its place , the @entity2 plan would use $ 12 billion in new tax revenue to replace half the expected deficit reduction from the sequester and leave another $ 12 billion in spending cuts , split half - and - half between defense and domestic programs

" no deal is better than a bad deal , and this looks like a very bad deal the way this is shaping up , " sen. @entity216 , @entity217 , said monday morning
late in the day , nothing had changed that would cause him to support the package
conservative lobbyist @entity227 , whose @entity228 pushes candidates to sign a pledge never to raise taxes , said the plan " right now , as explained " would preserve most of the @entity234 tax cuts and would n't violate his group 's pledge
" take the 84 % of your winnings off the table , " @entity227 told @entity0
" we spent 12 years getting the @entity9 to cede those tax cuts to the @entity99 people
take them off the table
then we go back and argue about making the tax cuts permanent for everyone
" but @entity247 , who served as labor secretary in the @entity42 administration , said the $ 450,000 threshold " means the lion 's share of the burden of deficit reduction falls on the middle class , either in terms of higher taxes down the road or fewer government services
" in addition , he said , the plan does nothing to raise the federal debt ceiling just as the federal government bumps up against its borrowing limit
and that , @entity80 sen. @entity265 told @entity0 , is likely to be " a whole new field of battle
" " we just added 2.1 trillion in the last increase in the debt ceiling , and spending continues to go up , " @entity265 said
" i think there 's going to be a pretty big showdown the next time around when we go to the debt limit
" @entity0 's @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .
