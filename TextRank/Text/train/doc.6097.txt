-- @entity1 expands access to health insurance for tens of millions of people come january 1
dental care for adults , however , is not included , and experts say we 've got a potential oral health care crisis coming
studies show that people who have insurance are more likely to get regular dental care
but only about 2 % of older @entity14 have dental insurance of any kind , according to a new report
" until we have an expansion of this kind of coverage , and until we have people really recognizing what this means for their overall health , i do believe we have an unimaginable tragedy on our hands , " said @entity18 , president and ceo of @entity20
@entity32 's organization published the report " state of decay : are older @entity14 coming of age without oral health care ? " which shows that baby boomers -- who have , for the most part , kept their natural teeth -- could be facing some serious oral health problems over the next decade
people with low income and racial and ethnic minorities are particularly vulnerable , according to the report
how brushing your teeth lowers your risk of cancer " it 's an issue that is particularly important that is not always talked about , " said @entity50 , dean emeritus of the @entity51
" people in the @entity14 are retaining their teeth , and as a result , teeth that have been in use for 50 or 60 or 70 years will have problems
" neither @entity60 nor the @entity1 includes adult dental coverage , although some pediatric dental care is covered
even the @entity64 insurance that adults buy to expand their plans ' benefits still wo n't cover dental procedures
less than 1 % of dental services are covered by @entity60
and neglected dental health can turn into even bigger medical issues
" for instance , if you have diabetes and you have gum disease , your metabolic control will be worse , " @entity50 said
" there is a lot of data showing that periodontal disease can increase your risk for heart attacks and strokes
there are so many ways this can impact your overall health
that is why regular access to care is so important
" the study put together by @entity20 ranked states in terms of the oral care their populations receive
seventeen states received a " poor " grade
the states were evaluated on edentulism , which is the fancy word for total loss of teeth
other factors included community water fluoridation , adult @entity106 coverage , access to dentists and a state oral health plan that addresses older adults
some states ' medicaid programs cover adult dental care
however , of the 17 states that received a " poor " grade for dental care , the majority are led by @entity119 governors who have refused or are leaning against expanding @entity106 under the @entity1
dental screening that could save your life @entity123 is ranked the worst
@entity124 and @entity125 tied for second to last
the other states rated as " poor " are @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141
" some of this ' poor ' care is in direct relation to the economic changes our country has experienced , " @entity32 said
" a lot of it , though , stems from the fact that some people see this as a tangential kind of medical care
" emergency room visits for dental health have doubled from about a decade ago
in 1999 - 2000 , there were a reported 1 million cases of adults over 65 who went to the er for dental problems ; in 2009 - 10 , there were 2.3 million cases
" dental care is extremely expensive , and the older adult will require the more extensive care , " @entity50 said
" the frustrating part is that we have some great technology now : dental implants , for instance , work remarkably well , but they are beyond the means of much of the population
" @entity175 's teeth : what you should know not all states fared as badly in the report
@entity180 ranked at the top of the list , with @entity183 a close second
" we wanted to show that there are states that are getting close to having a model kind of care that others could replicate , " @entity32 said
according to the report , @entity180 ranks high in terms of communities with fluoridated water , a @entity106 program that covers dental care for adults , a state oral health plan that addresses this population and , perhaps consequently , a low rate of edentulism
the report suggests that @entity180 still needs more dentists to serve its population
there is some good news : the number of federally qualified health centers that provide dental care have increased , and 41 of 50 states have state oral health plans
there is also a bill in @entity213 that would widen the @entity1 , @entity60 , @entity106 and veterans benefits to include dental health
that legislation , though , is in its very early stages
the @entity20 also put together a website toothwisdom.org that offers a handy guide on where you can find dental care in your state
it even gives suggestion on transportation options to these caregivers if an older person is unable to drive
@entity229 offers funding to help communities understand
