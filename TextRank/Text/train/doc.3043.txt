@entity0 -- @entity4 authorities arrested six people wednesday on suspicion of smuggling african elephant ivory worth hundreds of thousands of dollars , law enforcement officials said
imports of african elephant ivory have been banned in the @entity4 since 1976
the defendants arranged to have ivory from @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 shipped into the @entity4 disguised as wooden snakes , guitars and statues , authorities said
" the defendants plundered precious natural resources for personal profit , " @entity4 attorney @entity17 and other officials said in a statement
" their illegal trade threatens the continued existence of an endangered species and will not be tolerated
" federal agents tracked at least eight shipments , including one worth an estimated $ 165,000
federal agents used surveillance and shipping , phone and bank records to track the suspect shipments
arrests were made in @entity0 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37
the @entity39 and the @entity40 division of the @entity41 were involved in the law enforcement operation
one suspect told an undercover federal agent during a purchase that it was difficult to bring ivory into the @entity4 , but easy to sell it at high prices , the government statement said
two other suspects also are accused of paying a courier $ 15,000 to bring a shipment of ivory from @entity11 into the @entity4
the @entity4 banned ivory imports in 1976 , and the convention on @entity56 and @entity57 effectively outlawed trade in elephant tissue in 1989
illegal trade in african elephant ivory is considered to be a major cause of the continuing decline of elephant populations in @entity65
the defendants are expected to appear in court in @entity0 on wednesday
they face jail terms of up to 20 years if convicted .
