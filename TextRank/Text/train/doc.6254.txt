-- the ambush by up to a dozen gunmen of a bus carrying members of the @entity6 cricket team in @entity7 is the realization of fears long held by the sport 's leading players
@entity14 policemen outside @entity15 after masked gunmen attacked the @entity6 cricket team in @entity7 on march 3 , 2009
the @entity6 team had agreed to tour @entity18 after @entity19 pulled out in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in @entity22 last november when more than 160 people died in a three - day siege
the @entity26 team was in @entity19 -- but not in @entity22 -- during the attacks and promptly cut their tour short and returned home
in september 2008 , @entity30 decided to push ahead with a tour of @entity19 despite a series of bomb attacks in the country 's capital @entity36
in march of the same year , they had pulled out of a tour of @entity18 after a spate of suicide bombings
before that , the @entity42 team had not played in @entity18 for 10 years
such was the concern about the security risks presented to players in @entity18 that in august 2008 the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) announced the biennial @entity48 would be postponed until october 2009
the @entity47 announced last month that it was investigating other venues after three countries -- @entity26 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- expressed reservations about touring @entity18
@entity54 pulled out of the 2008 competition citing security concerns
long before that , in 2002 , a suicide bomb blast outside the @entity51 team 's hotel prompted them to pack up and abandon the second @entity63 series in @entity18
the explosion injured the team physiotherapist and killed 11 @entity67 navy experts as well as two @entity14
the previous year , the @entity51 team cancelled a scheduled tour of @entity18 in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks in the @entity72 most of the team stayed on to play , though under increased security , when a suicide attack closed @entity77 's international airport in july 2001
in february 1996 , @entity52 and the @entity79 refused to play in preliminary @entity80 matches in @entity81 after a huge bomb blast killed 80 people and injured 1,200 in @entity77
in november 1992 , also in @entity77 , a suicide bomber detonated a bomb outside a hotel where the @entity51 team was having breakfast , killing four people
five players and the coach were allowed to return home on compassionate grounds
five years earlier , in april 1987 , the @entity51 team cut short a three - test tour of @entity81 after a car bomb killed 100 people at a bus station in @entity77 .
