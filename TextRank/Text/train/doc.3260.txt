@entity0 , @entity1 -- allegations that five @entity8 contractors detained inside @entity0 's @entity9 were somehow involved in the death of another @entity8 contractor last month are " completely false , " a son of one of the detainees told @entity2 sunday
in a @entity2 exclusive , video shows @entity8 contractors taken into custody by @entity1 authorities
four of the five detained contractors work for @entity19 - based @entity18 -- a security firm headed by @entity20 , who , along with his son , @entity21 , has been detained , according to another son , @entity22
a fifth contractor works in @entity0 for another company
" we 're pretty sure they will be questioned there in the next couple of days and released with no charges , " @entity22 said , adding the men appeared in court sunday and were scheduled for another hearing monday
@entity18 was founded by the elder @entity21 , a former member of the elite anti-terrorist unit , the @entity33 , sources with knowledge of the case told @entity2 sunday
the company in @entity38 , @entity19 , has been operating in @entity1 since 2003 , according to its web site
@entity1 and @entity8 personnel took the five into custody early friday in connection with the killing of contractor @entity44 , according to an @entity1 official involved in the investigation and another source with knowledge of the case
three of them allegedly had direct involvement in the death , according to an @entity1 security source
none of the men have been charged
@entity44 was found bound , blindfolded and fatally stabbed in a car in the district , formally known as the @entity59 , on may 22
the 60 - year - old @entity61 , @entity62 , resident owned a construction company that operated in @entity1
the @entity8 @entity64 in @entity0 confirmed that @entity1 authorities took five @entity8 citizens into custody
the embassy said the men were not detained on suspicion of murder , but for an unrelated matter
the five were being held by @entity1 security forces sunday at a jail inside the heavily protected @entity9 , the @entity1 official said
they have been in custody for three days
" they have lawyers there on the ground with them , " @entity22 told @entity2
" they have been there with them the whole time
we have people there who work for us who are bringing them food , clothes -- whatever they need
they 're being treated well , and the @entity89 and the @entity90 are also involved
" the troops also confiscated weapons during the pre-dawn raid on the suspects ' firm , said the @entity1 official , who spoke on condition of anonymity
the four @entity18 detainees were identified by multiple sources as : @entity20 and @entity21 ; @entity100 ; and @entity101
@entity22 identified the fifth detainee as @entity103 , who works for another company
a source close to the suspects , who asked not to be identified , said each of the five men insisted they have alibis that would clear them and that they are anxious to tell their stories to a judge
@entity22 said his father was " not even in the country " at the time of @entity44 's killing
he was heading back from the @entity116 to make arrangements after the death of another @entity18 employee at the time
the @entity8 @entity64 would not confirm the names of the detainees , citing privacy laws
but a spokesman said consular officials have visited with them and " they appeared well
" embassy officials have been visiting them frequently , the @entity1 security source said
the @entity89 and the @entity1 government will negotiate to determine what happens next , according to the @entity1 security source close to the investigation who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case
@entity1 jail workers are treating the five contractors very well and with respect , he said
the @entity141 had known @entity44 for six years from their time in the @entity9 and " respected him , " @entity18 spokeswoman @entity142 told @entity2
" just being in the @entity9 for six years , they became very close , " she said , adding , " everyone is deeply upset about the loss of @entity147 and our deepest sympathy goes to his family
" if the suspects are charged and referred to trial , the case would be sent to @entity1 's @entity156 , the @entity1 official said
if that happens , it would mark the first time @entity8 citizens go to trial in that country since the @entity8 returned the nation 's government to the @entity1
@entity2 's @entity168 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and and @entity167 contributed to this report .
