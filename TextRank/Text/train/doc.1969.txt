for unfair dismissal , demanding 2.9 million euros after his sacked in the wake of @entity8 's disastrous @entity7 campaign
@entity1 was fired by the @entity3 in september for " serious error " and -- under @entity2 law -- a person dismissed under such circumstances has no right to severance pay , although they can dispute the charge before an employment tribunal
@entity1 's lawyer , @entity18 - @entity17 , told @entity19 : " we are requesting 2.9 million euros spread over two payments
" the first is for 400,000 euros and includes compensation for dismissal
the second is for professional and moral prejudice and is worth three years salary , " he added : " you do n't manage a collective crisis by sacking one individual
an amicable parting of ways was a possibility
" the federation came up with totally unfounded reasons for the sacking , and went through with it in an irregular , brutal and aggressive manner
" @entity1 lost his job after @entity8 failed to qualify from the group stages in @entity42 , amid player unrest that saw his squad boycott a training session
however , @entity17 believes his client has a good chance of winning his case
he told @entity19 : " we ca n't forget @entity1 is the only coach to have qualified @entity8 for three consecutive major international tournaments ( two @entity51 and one @entity52 )
" and we sack him for a serious error ! those are not valid reasons and we want to prove that in front of a judge
" it is difficult for him to bounce back
stained by the accusations of serious error means that 17 years of his career has been erased by the stroke of a pen
