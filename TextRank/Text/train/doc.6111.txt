-- in a weekend filled with crashes , rookie @entity1 avoided the mayhem
@entity1 took the lead in the @entity6 standings after winning the @entity7 @entity6 in his @entity8 ahead of @entity10 pair @entity9 and nine - time world champion @entity11
@entity1 , on pole , lost the lead on the first lap as @entity11 pounced but recovered by lap three
in the end he beat @entity9 by a comfortable 1.559 seconds over the 30 laps , with the revitalized @entity11 a further eight seconds adrift in eastern @entity7
" i had n't expected to control the race like that , " said the 20 - year - old @entity1 , who suffered his own share of crashes earlier in the season
@entity1 now leads teammate @entity22 by two points -- 138 to 136 -- although 10 races remain
@entity22 , the winner in @entity7 the previous three years , injured his left shoulder in a heavy crash in practice saturday and missed qualifying
tests revealed he suffered a minor fracture and on sunday morning he decided not to take part in the race
reigning world champion @entity33 broke his left collarbone in practice for the @entity36 @entity6 last month and suffered more damage when he lost control of his @entity10 in practice friday
altogether there were nearly 20 crashes over the weekend on the @entity42 , a circuit with an abundance of challenging left turns
with less than 10 laps remaining , it appeared as if @entity9 -- nursing a hand injury himself -- was ready to make a charge
he narrowed @entity1 's lead from 1.8 seconds to about 1.6
but @entity1 did n't lose more ground and coasted home for a second victory this term , adding to his win in @entity56 in april
" i 'm happy , " said @entity1
" it 's great to win , but you should n't forget that both @entity22 and @entity33 were n't here
" even though he did n't challenge for the lead most of the race , @entity11 claimed a second consecutive podium finish after winning the @entity36 @entity6 -- the first time he stood atop the podium in three years
" i am happy , but i had thought i 'd do better , " said @entity11
" i had a few problems with the rear tires
" it 's not known whether @entity33 and @entity22 will be ready for next week 's race in @entity68 .
