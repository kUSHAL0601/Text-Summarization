-- let 's pretend you just won $ 40 million
do you sprint up and down the street " like a crazy woman " ? break into a " happy dance , " while holding your oversized lottery check ? celebrate by chowing down at a @entity8 buffet with your family ? if you 're @entity11 , the answer is all of the above -- and then some
the 51 - year - old grandmother could n't contain her excitement , when she talked to , sang to and danced for reporters on monday after her big , big win
" @entity17 , thank you @entity18 ! " sang the ebullient , dancing @entity11
the @entity20 immigrant bought the ticket last friday at @entity22 and @entity23 , a store in @entity25 , according to the @entity26
it was a bit of a splurge , because she did n't " have a lot of spending money , " but it was one that would change her life forever
after an initial check on saturday morning , she excitedly told her daughter that she had won $ 40,000
" then ... she checked on the computer , " @entity11 recalled
" she said , ' @entity38 , you 're $ 40 million richer
' " what followed was pure joy
" so i ran down the street like a crazy woman and checked the lottery ticket , and it said $ 40 million , " she said of the winning ticket , which works out to about $ 39.4 million @entity47 dollars
" and then i go , ' @entity48 ' and i ran back up the street , home
and then i go , ' i need a glass of water , ' " added an ever - smiling @entity11 , stirring laughter from the press corps
for years , she worked in factories
beyond that , many of her days have been spent caring for her children and grandchildren
now , the time has come to take care of all of them and herself
that includes the honeymoon she never had , in @entity68 , with her husband , who at first did n't believe they 'd struck it rich but has since quit his job
@entity11 said she also plans on using the money to buy a house " for my daughters and me
" ( but first , she said , the family enjoyed an all - you - can - eat meal at a @entity8 restaurant
) while there 's no hiding their joy , her family is still coming to grips with their new , much richer reality -- after years of hard work , sacrifice and doing what they could to get by
" it still has n't sunk in , " said @entity11 's daughter @entity90 , her eyes welling with tears
" my dad works so hard , and we 've been struggling so much ... $ 40 million is so much money
" @entity98 man wins $ 338 million @entity99 @entity0 's @entity100 contributed to this report .
