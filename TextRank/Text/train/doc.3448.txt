-- former president @entity1 and his wife , @entity2 , are in @entity3 this week , where they renovated a cancer screening clinic in @entity6 and commemorated the victims of the 1998 @entity10 @entity9 bombing in @entity11
the clinic , which is designed help women fight cervical cancer , builds on the former president 's work fighting @entity17 on the continent
while he was in office , @entity1 set up a plan that dramatically reduced the number of @entity17 deaths in @entity3
" i 'm really proud of the @entity10 people for their generosity , " he told @entity0 in an exclusive interview
" i wish @entity10 knew how many lives were saved
" @entity1 also told @entity0 why he respects @entity28 , what he thinks about @entity30 and president @entity31 , and how he 's not going to be around when his legacy is finally decided
â € ¢ on @entity30 : " i think he damaged the security of the country
" â € ¢ on @entity28 : " his legacy will last for a long time
" â € ¢ on @entity31 : " it 's a hard job
he 's got plenty on his agenda
" @entity1 talked about @entity30 , the computer contractor who leaked details about secret @entity10 surveillance programs , to @entity0 's @entity42 in @entity6 on sunday
he said he believes the @entity31 administration " will deal " with the fallout from the controversy unleashed by @entity30 , who is now thought to be holed up in the transit area of a @entity48 airport after fleeing there from @entity49
@entity30 's disclosures about the programs carried out by the @entity52 have shaken the @entity10 intelligence community and put the @entity31 administration on the defensive over accusations of government overreach into citizens ' privacy
but @entity1 refrained from criticizing the current president
" i do n't think it does any good , " he said
" it 's a hard job
he 's got plenty on his agenda
a former president does n't need to make it any harder
other presidents have taken different decisions ; that 's mine
" the @entity70 has defended the surveillance programs as necessary tools to defuse terrorist threats
@entity31 has said he welcomes a debate over how to strike a balance between security and privacy
" i think there needs to be a balance , and as the president explained , there is a proper balance , " @entity1 said
asked about an @entity52 program that tracks people 's internet activity , @entity1 said , " i put that program in place to protect the country
one of the certainties was that civil liberties were guaranteed
" @entity30 has said he leaked information to journalists about the surveillance programs in the hope of ending what he called an excessively intrusive system
the @entity97 were at a renovated health clinic in @entity99 , @entity6 , scheduled to open monday as a cervical cancer screening and treatment center
they hope this will save the lives of thousands of women
in his comments , @entity1 touched on the subject of @entity28 , who is on life support in a @entity109 hospital
" sometimes , there are leaders who come and go
his legacy will last for a long time , " he said of the ailing anti-apartheid icon
reminded by @entity42 that @entity28 had criticized him publicly about the war in @entity117 , @entity1 said he did n't bear a grudge
" he was n't the only guy , " he said
i made decisions that were the right decisions
i never held someone 's opinion against him ; i did n't look at him differently because he did n't agree with me on an issue
" @entity1 also initially said he was n't bothered about his ratings in opinion polls , even if some of them now put him at a similar level to @entity31
" the only time i really cared was on @entity132 , " he said
then , drawing laughter from his wife , he checked himself and said , " you know , i guess it 's nice
i mean , let me rephrase that : thank you for bringing it up
" in any case , the former president said he does n't expect a fair assessment of his legacy in his lifetime
" i wo n't be around , because it will take a while for the objective historians to show up , " he said
" so i 'm pretty comfortable with it , i did what i did ; i know the spirit in which i did it
" opinion : @entity1 's legacy is on the mend @entity155 : you 're starting to remember @entity1 fondly @entity1 43 : ' history will ultimately judge ... i 'm a content man ' watch @entity159 weekdays 7pm et. for the latest from @entity159 click here .
