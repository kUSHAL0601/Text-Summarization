in ruling @entity2 's death penalty unconstitutional , a federal judge said wednesday the system is so broken it unfairly leaves inmates with uncertain fates -- often for decades
in his decision , @entity7 - based judge @entity6 vacated the 1995 death sentence of @entity10 , who petitioned the court to determine whether his death sentence was valid
@entity6 wrote : " allowing this system to continue to threaten mr. @entity10 with the slight possibility of death , almost a generation after he was first sentenced , violates the @entity14 's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment
" the decision will certainly be appealed , said @entity23 legal analysts @entity21 and @entity24
@entity21 said no executions could proceed in @entity2 while the decision stands
in @entity2 , there are 748 people on death row , the most of any state
no executions have been carried out since @entity2 put a moratorium on the death penalty in 2006
four years later , the state sought to execute a man who raped and murdered a 15 - year - old girl , but it was blocked by state and federal courts over concerns about lethal injections
in wednesday 's ruling , @entity6 called the administration of the state 's death penalty system " dysfunctional
" " in @entity2 , the execution of a death sentence is so infrequent , and the delays preceding it so extraordinary , that the death penalty is deprived of any deterrent or retributive effect it might once have had , " he wrote
" such an outcome is antithetical to any civilized notion of just punishment
" since 1978 , more than 900 people in the state have been sentenced to death row , where inmates spend 23 hours alone in their cells
of those people only 13 have been executed ; 94 have died of other causes
@entity6 said about 40 % have been on death row longer than 19 years
" @entity2 's death penalty system is so plagued by inordinate and unpredictable delay that the death sentence is actually carried out against only a trivial few of those sentenced to death , " @entity6 said , noting that it takes an average of three to five years for a death row inmate just to get an court - appointed attorney for an appeal
the judge noted 285 of the people on death row have been there longer than @entity10
" there clearly was a crisis coming
a lot of people have recognized there is a problem with hundreds of people of death row and hardly any executions , " @entity21 said
he noted the situation in @entity2 is so unusual it would n't affect death penalty cases in other states
@entity2 's most recent execution was on january 17 , 2006 , according to the website for the state 's @entity88
@entity90 , 76 , spent 23 years and one month on death row before dying from a lethal injection
he was convicted of orchestrating a triple murder from prison in 1982
@entity95 , executive director of the @entity96 and @entity10 's lead attorney , said he was glad that a federal judge reaffirmed what a state commission found in 2008
" there is no rational explanation , much less any moral or societal justification , for which people are ultimately executed , " @entity95 said in a written statement
" the execution of mr. @entity10 , and the others like him whose meritorious legal claims have gone unheard for decades , serves no valid state interest
" the executive director of @entity111 said the law in @entity2 needs to be changed
" justice requires that we end this charade once and for all , " said @entity113
" it 's time to replace @entity2 's broken death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole
that 's the best way to ensure that convicted killers remain behind bars until they die , without wasting tens of millions of tax dollars every year on needless appeals
" @entity10 ' case is expected to be appealed by prosecutors to the @entity130 , said
@entity131 , a spokesman for state attorney general @entity132 , said her office is reviewing the decision
death penalty facts that may surprise you @entity10 ' case @entity10 was tried and received his death sentence at a time when the attention of the world was focused on another case unfolding on the same floor of @entity144 downtown courthouse -- the @entity146 murder trial
@entity146 , who had assembled a legal " dream team , " was acquitted ; @entity10 was represented by a public defender
@entity10 was convicted and sentenced to death for raping and killing his girlfriend 's mother , @entity150 , a 50 - year - old defense industry accountant
during the trial , @entity10 was portrayed as the product of a broken home with alcoholic parents
an aunt described his childhood as " a living hell
" he grew up in poverty , and his parents used drugs in front of the children and battled violently
his mother beat him and his siblings
he developed a drug habit of his own , which included marijuana and cocaine
he told witnesses that he had heard voices and experienced flashbacks during the year before the slaying
he said the victim confronted him over his treatment of her daughter and pointed a rifle at him , which caused him to flash back to violent incidents in his childhood , according to the state @entity180 opinion affirming his conviction
the court record indicates that @entity10 had spent several years in prison for raping the mother of a previous girlfriend
the @entity2 @entity180 in 2003 upheld the conviction of @entity10 on first - degree murder and rape charges
