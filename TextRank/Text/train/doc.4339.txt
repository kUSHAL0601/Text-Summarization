@entity0 -- @entity1 's @entity2 stepped down from his controversial role as an advocacy anchor at the network at the end of his show wednesday night , saying he plans to seek a more activist role
" over the past six months , it has become increasingly clear that strong winds of change have begun buffeting this country and affecting all of us , and some leaders in media , politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at @entity1 and to engage in constructive problem - solving as well as to contribute positively to a better understanding of the great issues of our day and to continue to do so in the most honest and direct language possible , " @entity2 said during his 7 p.m. broadcast
@entity2 , 64 , said he had discussed the issue with @entity1 president @entity27 , who had agreed to a release from his contract " that will enable me to pursue new opportunities
" in a written statement , @entity27 called @entity2 " a valued founding member of the @entity1 family
" " for decades , @entity2 fearlessly and tirelessly pursued some of the most important and complex stories of our time , often well ahead of the pack , " @entity27 said
" all of us will miss his appetite for big ideas , the megawatt smile and larger - than - life presence he brought to our newsroom , and we 're grateful to have known and worked with him over the years
" with characteristic forthrightness , @entity2 has now decided to carry the banner of advocacy journalism elsewhere
we respect his decision and wish him , @entity50 [ @entity2 ' wife ] , and his family the very best
" @entity2 , who is the last of the 29 - year - old network 's original anchors , said he was considering " a number of options and directions
" he cited the growth of the middle class , the creation of jobs , health care , immigration policy , the environment , climate change and the @entity68 military involvement in @entity69 and @entity70 as " the major issues of our time
" but , he said , " @entity74 of those issues is , in my opinion , informed by our capacity to demonstrate strong resilience of our now weakened capitalist economy and demonstrate the political will to overcome the lack of true representation in @entity83 i believe these to be profoundly , critically important issues and i will continue to strive to deal honestly and straightforwardly with those issues in the future
" @entity89 ' full statement about his departure from @entity1 those issues , he added , are defined in the public arena " by partisanship and ideology rather than by rigorous , empirical forethought , analysis and discussion , " and he vowed to work to change that
in an e-mail to @entity1 staff members , @entity27 described the parting as " extremely amicable , " and said @entity2 ' replacement would be announced soon
@entity2 was with @entity1 from its initial broadcasts in 1980 , acting as chief economics correspondent and host of the business program " @entity107
" his coverage of the 1987 stock market crash won him the @entity110 for excellence in broadcasting
that was one of many awards he received while at @entity1 , including an @entity116 for @entity117 that he received from the @entity118 in 2005
@entity2 left the network in 1999 to found @entity120 , a web site devoted to space - related subjects
he returned to the network in 2001 as anchor and managing editor of @entity1 's @entity107 , which became @entity107
he also acted as lead business news anchor for @entity1 / @entity68 and @entity126 , the forerunner of @entity127
during his second stint at @entity1 , @entity2 positioned himself as " tough , relentless , independent , " lashing out at what he described as the deficiencies and " partisan nonsense " of both major political parties , and injecting advocacy journalism into his coverage of topics ranging from free trade to immigration
his no - holds - barred , sometimes acerbic style brought him a loyal following , but also attracted controversy both to him and to the network , especially over the subject of illegal immigrants
@entity89 will continue as anchor of the @entity145 , a daily radio show that began in march 2008 and is distributed to more than 160 stations nationwide by @entity148
