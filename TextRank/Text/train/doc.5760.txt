@entity0 , @entity1 investigators " are looking at the strong possibility " someone was in the car with a 19 - year - old @entity1 woman moments before a fire engulfed the vehicle , a prosecuting attorney said friday
but district attorney @entity11 would not say what led investigators to believe @entity14 was n't alone just before the fire burned her and the car saturday night near a rural road near @entity17 , @entity1
since then , investigators have released very few details about the crime
@entity22 ' funeral will be saturday in @entity0 , a small town in northwest @entity1
the rewards for information about her case have grown to a total of $ 11,000
@entity29 said investigators have talked to the person who called 911 and have cleared them from involvement in the crime
investigators said they talked to @entity14 ' relatives and " there were no family issues , " the prosecutor said
champion already has said investigators are treating the case as an arson , and an accelerant was used in the blaze
three special agents from the @entity47 in @entity48 were in @entity17 on friday morning looking for clues at the crime scene
the crime scene , next to an asphalt road with no dividing line , is nondescript except for the yellow police tape and the scorch marks on nearby trees and grass
questions abound about how the former high school cheerleader and her car ended up severely burned in this wooded area
after obtaining warrants and cracking a password , police were able to access @entity14 ' phone records and are following up on leads , a prosecutor said thursday
police are searching her data and text records after obtaining warrants wednesday that compelled @entity72 and her cell phone provider to give police access to her phone 's content , @entity29 said
investigators believe her phone will be " the key to everything , " the prosecutor said
she received a call before she left her house , he said
on thursday , @entity29 spoke at a news conference , pleading for public help with the case and asking anyone with information , even if they think it 's insignificant , to talk to police
he said he did n't expect an arrest in the immediate future
@entity29 said wednesday that when firefighters arrived at the scene , @entity14 approached one of them and spoke
champion did n't divulge the teen 's words but said , " it has certainly given us a lead we 're following up on
" @entity14 ' older sister , @entity107 , said @entity14 called their mother from a gas station and told her she would be home right after she cleaned her car
the business , which @entity29 characterized as a rural mom - and - pop store , is about 2 miles from @entity14 ' home
it sells fried chicken , pizza and deli sandwiches , and there is a constant stream of people sharing rumors and random chatter about the killing that has rocked their area
the gas station owner who helped her said nothing seemed out of sorts
" she seemed normal , " @entity132 told @entity2 affiliate @entity133
" she did n't seem like something was going wrong , you know ? she just seemed normal
she just pumped some gas , we had a talk and she left
" he said thursday that one thing struck him as odd : @entity14 pumped $ 14 worth of gas
she was a regular in the store , popping in every day or two , and she rarely pumped more than $ 5 in gas , he said
" i asked her about it , and she said she was going somewhere , " he said
" she was quiet that day , real quiet
" @entity146 said @entity14 was a fixture at the store
everyone knew her , and she was " real friendly , " the attendant said
" not one time have i ever heard her get loud , have a smart mouth
she was always smiling , " she said
a facebook page titled @entity154 has drawn more than 97,000 likes , and that number was climbing rapidly thursday
the page states it was created " to keep @entity14 's name alive & out there
" @entity2 's @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report
