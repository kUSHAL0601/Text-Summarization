@entity0 -- @entity0 breathed a sigh of relief sunday as changing wind patterns created a pocket of clearer skies from a haze of choking fumes
pollution levels measured by the @entity0 government dipped sharply after all - time record levels hit friday
the fumes were blamed on plantation fires in neighboring @entity14
small pockets of people ventured back out to the streets in neighborhoods such as @entity19 , but many donned filter masks to help with the foul - smelling haze
masks quickly sold out at stores when the pollution hit last week
but by sunday , officials handed out emergency supplies of free masks at community centers
although haze levels have receded , officials warned that the smoke could make a strong comeback in the coming days , and may linger for months
that could have serious health implications , said @entity36 , a professor of respiratory medicine at @entity38
" in my patients , i have seen an increase ( in consultations ) by about 30 % or so , " he said , particularly among older people with chronic conditions
" but we are still in early days , " he said
" if this thing drags on for a month , i wo n't be surprised if more people get hospitalized
" many usually crowded cafes along the waterfront sat empty saturday , with too few customers to stay open
but a scattering of tourists braved the haze to take photos at the city 's iconic @entity57 fountain
the smell of the burning peat and wood was distinct
" we 're used to fog , but this was a real ' pea souper ' , " @entity63 expatriate @entity62 said
" it smells like a pile of burning tires next to a bonfire , not pleasant
" it 's hard to predict the final economic impact of the haze on @entity0 's economy
one @entity76 brokerage firm put the potential toll in the hundreds of millions
@entity78 said that the economy had taken a $ 300 million - hit in lost tourist income , closed offices and construction downtime in 1997 -- the previous all - time high in pollution
the current situation could be far more costly , it said
transport officials warned ships to be extra vigilant in the teeming straits between @entity0 and @entity90 because the haze made it difficult to see other boats
it is easy to see the neighboring island from the beaches in @entity0
but the view was not as clear in the past few days , with ships peeking in and out of the thick haze saturday
local shop owners felt the crunch
in one beach side shop , the owner looked forlornly into the horizon as bikes that would normally be rented out stood in stacks .
