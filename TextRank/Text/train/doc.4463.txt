-- a rabbi walks into @entity2 , meets the pope , and tells the holy father that one way to defuse the sex abuse scandal plaguing the church is for the @entity8 to begin promoting a secular version of @entity11 dinner , the traditional @entity13 friday meal
a prominent @entity17 rabbi , @entity15 , spoke briefly to pope @entity18 on wednesday about encouraging parents to eat dinner with their children as a way for the @entity8 to re-establish its pro-family image , which has been battered by the priest sex abuse scandal , @entity15 said
the brief exchange came after the pope 's regular wednesday address at the @entity8 , during which @entity15 was seated on a dais along with other @entity8 guests
when he met @entity18 on a receiving line afterward , @entity15 pitched him on his family dinner initiative , called " turn friday night into @entity32
" " i said ... ' if the church embraces an initiative like this , which is positive , it could put a lot of the scandal behind it , ' " @entity15 said , recounting his chat with the pope
" people will see the church does n't just speak about opposition to gay marriage and abortion
' " the pope appeared to be receptive to the idea , @entity15 said
" ' we have to work together on this , we have to work together on this , ' " @entity15 quoted the pope as saying
but , @entity18 did not make a firm commitment to the family dinner initiative , the rabbi said
the @entity8 was not immediately available for comment
" the church is now perceived as not being a champion of families because the scandal has hit with so much force , " @entity15 said
" i came ( to the @entity8 ) as a friend and as someone who is critical as well
because my criticism is real , the church knows my friendship is real
" following his talk with the pope , @entity15 said he was invited to meet with cardinal @entity67 , who spearheads the @entity8 's @entity13 outreach , with whom @entity15 fleshed out his criticism of the church 's response to priestly sex abuse
@entity15 was invited to the @entity8 to look over documents related to pope @entity75 , the holocaust - era church leader who @entity18 has signaled he would like to move closer to sainthood
the rabbi has been a spiritual adviser to @entity78 , who died last year , and a frequent guest on @entity81 's talk show
a number of recent @entity8 actions have caused tensions between the church and the @entity13 world
last year , @entity18 lifted the excommunication of a holocaust - denying bishop , @entity89
earlier this month , the pope 's personal preacher compared the fury over sexual abuse within the church to @entity95 , though the priest , the rev. @entity96 , later apologized
but @entity15 has been impressed by the @entity8 's overtures to him and to other @entity13 leaders
" i thinks he 's a friend to the @entity13 -- a very close friend , " @entity15 said of the pope
@entity15 said that the @entity8 had shown him documents from its private archive showing that @entity75 , a controversial figure among @entity13 , rescued @entity105 jews during the @entity106
but @entity15 remains critical of @entity75 , saying he displayed " absolute silence in condemning the @entity106 outright , which might have gone to great lengths to prevent it
" the church has said that @entity75 would have put more @entity13 in danger by publicly condemning the @entity106 because it would have provoked the @entity112 .
