-- one of the toughest records to beat in tennis finally fell on monday when the @entity6 brothers @entity3 and @entity4 registered their 271st week at the top of the world doubles standings
the 33 - year - old twins moved past fellow @entity12 @entity11 , who was not only one of the game 's best singles players but also one of the greatest in the two - man format
" @entity11 is a legend
he 's definitely one of the best doubles players in history
we respect and admire what he 's brought to the sport , " @entity6 told the @entity21 website
" to be grouped in the same category and mentioned in the same breath as @entity11 is an honor in itself
we play against @entity11 in exhibitions and he still shows what a talent he is
" the @entity32 have topped the year - end list since 2005
they have won the most men 's doubles titles with 75 , and took their grand slam - leading tally to 11 this year with triumphs at the @entity39 and @entity40
" to achieve this record and surpass @entity11 , who we 've always looked up to , is awesome , " said @entity4 , who is expecting a daughter with wife @entity42 in january
" this ranks up with our record of most team titles
it shows we were consistent throughout our whole career and we did n't want to relinquish the top spot
the @entity32 are the only partnership to have won 700 matches , and they have a record 19 @entity54 tournament titles
with the season now over , next year they can beat @entity58 ' mark of 286 weeks at the top of the men 's singles
" singles and doubles are totally different , but it 's nice to be at the top of doubles
that 's what we do and it 's what we love , " @entity4 said
" i 'm just grateful that we 've been able to do it for so long
we 've now played on tour for 13 years and have been lucky to stay healthy
we still have a great time playing so we do n't plan on stopping anytime soon
when our careers are over , i think we 'll look back and be proud of what we 've accomplished
" they thanked their @entity78 coach @entity77 , who has worked with the brothers since 2005
" since bringing him on board , we 've been a lot more consistent , and he 's worked hard to help us improve each year
without him , this would not have been possible , " @entity3 said .
