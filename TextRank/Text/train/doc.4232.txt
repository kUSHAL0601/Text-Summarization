-- the 10th anniversary this month of the invasion of @entity3 will remind most people of a divisive and dubious war that toppled @entity6 but claimed the lives of nearly 4,500 @entity8 and more than 100,000 @entity3 civilians
what it conjures up for me is the media 's greatest failure in modern times
major news organizations aided and abetted the @entity19 administration 's march to war on what turned out to be faulty premises
all too often , skepticism was checked at the door , and the shaky claims of top officials and unnamed sources were trumpeted as fact
by the time @entity8 soldiers discovered there were no weapons of mass destruction in @entity3 , the media establishment was left with apologies and explanations
the @entity19 - @entity36 administration helped whip up an atmosphere in the wake of 9/11 in which media criticism of national security efforts seemed almost unpatriotic
watch : did @entity41 cross a line in calling @entity43 lazy ? as the war , once sold as a cakewalk , went sour in 2004 , the @entity44 said in an editor 's note that its editors were " perhaps too intent on rushing scoops into the paper , " some of them erroneous stories by @entity54
the paper said its reporting on what turned out to be nonexistent wmds was " not as rigorous as it should have been " and that the @entity44 overplayed stories with " dire claims about @entity3
" i was working at the @entity62 at the time , and i took it upon myself to examine the paper 's performance in the run - up to war
it was not a pretty picture
from august 2002 through the march 19 , 2003 , launch of the war , i found more than 140 front - page stories that focused heavily on administration rhetoric against @entity3 : " @entity36 says @entity3 strike is justified " ; " @entity74 " ; " @entity77 @entity76 it must @entity75 to @entity6 or @entity8 will " ; " @entity79 " ; " @entity80 : prepare for @entity74
" by contrast , pieces questioning the evidence or rationale for war were frequently buried , minimized or spiked
watch : @entity86 uses op - ed to flip - flop on gay marriage @entity90 , then the executive editor , told me that in retrospect , " we were so focused on trying to figure out what the administration was doing that we were not giving the same play to people who said it would n't be a good idea to go to war and were questioning the administration 's rationale
not enough of those stories were put on the front page
that was a mistake on my part
" @entity107 told me that " we did our job , but we did n't do enough , and i blame myself mightily for not pushing harder
" there was a " groupthink " among intelligence officials , he said , and " i think i was part of the groupthink
" watch : should @entity113 give @entity114 another at - bat ? @entity115 , who was the paper 's top military reporter , turned in a piece in the fall of 2002 that he titled " doubts , " saying that senior @entity120 officials were resigned to an invasion but were reluctant and worried that the risks were being underestimated
an editor killed the story , saying it relied too heavily on retired military officials and outside experts -- in other words , those with sufficient independence to question the rationale for war
" there was an attitude among editors : look , we 're going to war , why do we even worry about all this contrary stuff ? " @entity115 said
watch : @entity140 bullying against the press i actually think the @entity62 did a better job than most
and there is no minimizing the difficulties that even the most intrepid journalists faced : they could n't go to @entity3 to investigate for themselves , and most government sources were echoing the administration 's line about @entity152
but that system 's failure casts a dark shadow on the news business that has not entirely lifted
the press needs to challenge what government officials say , whether it is about war or weapons or @entity163 , or whether the impact of federal budget cuts is being exaggerated
the low level of public confidence in the media has many causes , but one of them stems from what happened back in 2003
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .
