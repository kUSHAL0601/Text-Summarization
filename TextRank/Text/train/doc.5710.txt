-- the @entity1 may take over @entity2 -- @entity5 's spiritual home of soccer -- every september and october but it was a racecourse that played host to one of gridiron 's biggest star 's saturday as @entity13 @entity12 flew in to cheer on his racehorse
a veteran of three @entity16 , the 33 - year - old wide receiver broke off from pre-season training to attend the @entity19 at @entity20 -- an hour east of @entity21 -- even taking up bookmaker @entity23 on a Â £ 5,000 ( $ 8,560 ) @entity25 charity bet
but there was to be no touchdown for @entity12 on @entity29 soil as his 25 - 1 shot -- named @entity31 -- ridden by jockey @entity32 , finished fourth behind the winner and favorite @entity34
@entity12 chose the horse 's name after he missed out on the draft upon completing college
while horse racing and soccer have enjoyed a close relationship in some countries -- @entity5 internationals @entity43 and @entity44 have snapped up their own racehorses -- the bonds are less common in @entity49 sport
@entity12 caught the racing bug through a family friend , taking a small stake in two horses in 2011 and when the opportunity arose he snapped up @entity55
" i really enjoy the racing and training aspect because they are very similar to football players , " @entity12 told @entity58 's @entity57 newspaper friday
" they have short careers , and injuries play a huge part , so how you train them and get them ready is very similar to how we train and get ready
" it 's kind of cool to see the similarities between the two athletes
" the four - year old gelding is highly regarded as a fine sprinter and won the $ 300,000 @entity76 at @entity77 in june .
