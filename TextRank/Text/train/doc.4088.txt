-- the oohs and aahs of the @entity4 holiday will be more subdued this year in @entity5 , where months of severe drought have led to restrictions on fireworks across much of the state
not only are dozens of counties imposing restrictions on small - bore pyrotechnics like firecrackers and bottle rockets , but cities such as @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have canceled municipal @entity4 displays because of the tinderbox conditions
" temperatures are in the triple digits , and we 're not seeing any relief , " @entity22 , deputy chief of operations for the @entity19 fire department , said thursday
wildfires have already reached into the city limits and destroyed three homes , and months without significant rain have left grasslands brown and dry , looking " like the dead of winter
" canceling the fireworks shows is " causing a little bit of a stir , " said fire engineer @entity38 , a @entity16 fire spokeswoman
" but it 's for the protection of the people of @entity16
one errant spark and we could have a major grass fire
" why there 's no messing with @entity5 wildfires have scorched nearly 3.3 million acres of @entity5 since november , setting ablaze an area larger than @entity49
authorities have banned outdoor fires in 235 of the state 's 254 counties , a figure the @entity55 called record - setting
firefighters battle to contain @entity5 wildfires @entity5 is the worst - hit of several states in a band of severe drought that stretches from @entity62 to @entity63
more than 90 % of the state is suffering from " extreme " or " exceptional " drought conditions , according to the @entity66 at the @entity67
the " exceptional " category -- the most severe -- covers 72 % of the state , according to figures published thursday
only a small patch of northeast @entity5 , from roughly @entity72 to the @entity74 state line , has seen anything close to normal rainfall , the @entity78 service reports
on @entity81 's farm in the @entity83 town of @entity84 , the cotton is stunted and the peanut plants are undersized
@entity81 and his fellow farmers are bracing for losses and making preparations to sell off livestock
" @entity92 " where cattle used to graze has been scorched , and one fire in early june left more than 300 cows dead , he said
" our cotton , we ca n't even water it , " @entity81 said
" our money crop is peanuts
it 's taking all the water we can pump just to irrigate our peanut crop , and our peanut crop is not even growing as fast as normal
" at the beginning of the planting season , " the water just would n't wet the ground , it was so dry
" the @entity109 @entity108 on wednesday declared disasters in 213 @entity5 counties due to the drought , along with seven parishes in neighboring @entity114
the move comes after a loss of pasture , grain and forage crops of more than 30 % in the affected district and opens the door to federal support for farmers
the @entity5 agricultural extension service estimates that state farmers have suffered $ 62 million in losses , including buildings , crops , livestock -- even more than 4,100 miles of fences , which can cost $ 10,000 per mile to build , lost to fires
authorities in @entity62 and @entity133 have also been battling extensive wildfires , including one near @entity135 , @entity133 , home to one of the @entity109 nuclear laboratories that produced the atomic bomb
that fire has scorched more than 70,000 acres of land , but firefighters reported some success in limiting its spread wednesday night
firefighters scramble to contain blaze near nuclear lab in the @entity5 oil towns of @entity149 and @entity150 , water is getting to be as valuable as crude oil
reservoirs managed by the @entity153 are running dry , forcing the cities to impose new restrictions on water use
the district has cut @entity149 's water allocation by 20 % this year , and the city 's biggest water source , the @entity162 , is projected to run dry by december 2012 if current conditions continue , municipal spokeswoman @entity157 said
" at this point , that 's the hand we 've been dealt , " @entity157 told @entity0
effective friday , residents can water lawns only twice a week , between dusk and midmorning
about 60 % of @entity149 's water use goes to outdoor irrigation , @entity157 said
violations carry a fine of up to $ 500
in addition , residents are barred from refilling swimming pools , and restaurants will serve water to customers only upon request , she said
this year 's drought is part of a long - term trend dating back to the mid- 1990s , but 2011 " has been one of the worst that we 've had in this period , " said @entity188 , head of the @entity189 of the @entity55
the period from october 2010 through may is one of the three driest since 1895 , he said
" any rain would be good for temporary relief , " @entity188 said
" but right now , we need a weather pattern change or some tropical storms or tropical events to break this drought
more than likely it 's not going to happen until after the summer
" in april , gov. @entity200 called on " @entity201 of all faiths and traditions " to pray for rain
but the state remains parched -- and though @entity207 came ashore in eastern @entity133 on thursday , the storm is unlikely to help , @entity188 said
" there 's a high - pressure system on top of us , steering rain events around the state , " @entity188 said
for @entity81 , that means cotton yields of maybe one - fifth what he grew a few years ago and not enough hay for his cows
with harvest time barely three months away , he and his fellow farmers are running out of time
" @entity222 's in control
i hope that he 'll see fit that we get some rain , " he said
@entity0 's @entity227 contributed to this report .
