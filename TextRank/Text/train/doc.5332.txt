@entity0 -- friends of a high - profile @entity4 dissident found dead in his hospital room wednesday slammed official claims that he hanged himself as " insulting " and " ridiculous
" @entity9 told @entity1 that he had visited long - time labor rights activist @entity10 at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 province , a few days before his death on june 6
" he was in good spirits ... there was absolutely no sign showing he wanted to take his own life
he was also listening to my radio and told his sister to buy him one , too , " @entity9 said
@entity10 was blind , deaf and had trouble walking after spending more than 20 years in prison following the @entity26 crackdown in 1989
he was one of @entity4 's first labor rights activists and was jailed shortly after the june 4 massacre for urging workers to strike , according to @entity30 in @entity4 ( @entity31 )
after spending 11 years in jail , @entity10 was released in 2000 only to be imprisoned again in 2001 for doggedly petitioning @entity12 authorities to pay his medical expenses for injuries suffered through torture in prison
they refused and he was sentenced to a further 10 years for " incitement to subvert state power , " according to @entity31
he was released last may but his family said he had been under 24 - hour police surveillance in hospital
" it 's unbelievable that he could hang himself
he 's weak , could n't really walk down from the second floor on his own , " his friend @entity45 told @entity1
friends described a man who was unwavering in his determination to fight for his beliefs
" it 's an insult to say someone like him killed himself this way , " @entity9 said
" @entity10 said numerous times to me and others that he would keep fighting till the end of his life
it 's ridiculous even to think he would commit suicide and none of his friends or family believes what the police say now
he was killed by others for sure , " he said
@entity10 's brother - in - law @entity69 told @entity31 that hospital staff phoned him and his wife , @entity10 's sister @entity71 , just after 6 a.m. on june 6 to tell them that @entity10 had committed suicide
@entity69 said they rushed to the hospital and found @entity10 's body " hanging by the window
" he noted that @entity10 's feet were still on the ground
" they [ hospital staff ] did not let us get near him , and did not let us take photos
then they dragged his body away , " @entity31 said in statement on its website
" i 've never witnessed a suicide like this , " said @entity87 , communications director at @entity31
how do you hang yourself with your feet on the ground ? " despite the family 's claims that they were n't allowed to take photos , three images of @entity10 said to have been taken after his death have been published on @entity100 , a @entity102 - based @entity4 - language news website
two photos show @entity10 standing by a window with a knotted sheet around his neck , apparently tied to bars on a window above
a third photo shows @entity10 's feet firmly on the ground
he 's still wearing slippers
@entity1 tried repeatedly to contact @entity113 where @entity10 died but no one answered the phone
an official who answered the phone at the publicity office of @entity119 said he had n't heard of @entity10 's case and advised calling another number
attempts to call other government offices also failed
it 's not known how long @entity10 had been in hospital before his death
@entity31 said only that he was being treated for his " deteriorating health
" @entity69 told @entity31 that authorities started monitoring @entity10 on may 22
friends said the phones of @entity10 's sister @entity71 and brother - in - law @entity69 do n't appear to be working
they say they believe the couple has been detained in a hotel near the hospital where @entity10 died
earlier , @entity10 's family and rights campaigners called for an immediate investigation and full autopsy to determine his cause of death
" the @entity4 authorities must thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding @entity10 's death and take seriously the claims made by his family and friends that this was not suicide , " said @entity140 , @entity141 deputy director at @entity142
in the hours after @entity10 's death , a petition appeared online urging his " suicide " to be investigated by authorities outside @entity12 province and for the findings to be made public
it was started by @entity0 - based journalist @entity158 , @entity4 economist @entity159 and literary scholar @entity160
at the time of writing , more than 2,000 people had added their names , including many from who listed their locations @entity4
some entries written in @entity169 listed their location as " hell

you are finally free ! i wish you a good journey ! " @entity180 of @entity181 wrote : " @entity182 investigate and track down the true murderers
let the world know who persecuted and murdered @entity10 , and bring them to trial
" @entity10 's name recently appeared in a list of " political prisoners " who had been detained as of the end of 2011 in the @entity193
