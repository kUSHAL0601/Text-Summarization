emboldened militants , backed by @entity2 tribal leaders , pushed toward @entity3 on friday as increasingly nervous @entity5 officials mulled their limited options to help slow the militants ' advance
in recent days , @entity10 has sent about 500 @entity12 troops to fight alongside @entity15 government security forces in @entity17 province , a senior security official in @entity3 told @entity18
however , that claim was rejected by @entity10 's @entity20
" we have made our position clear
we are not involved in fighting in @entity15 , " ministry spokeswoman @entity23 told @entity18
a senior @entity10 government official told @entity18 that @entity25 is monitoring the situation in @entity15 and could send advisers there , but would not send a fighting force
@entity10 president @entity29 reiterated his nation is prepared to help advice @entity15 if asked
meanwhile , @entity2 tribal leaders have lined up in support of radical islamists from the @entity36 in @entity15 and @entity37 , or @entity38 , making their push toward @entity3 easier , a @entity33 intelligence official told @entity18 's @entity40
as @entity15 further disintegrated , residents fled @entity42 in droves
militants captured the country 's second - largest city this week after soldiers scattered , leaving their uniforms and weapons behind
three explosions hit @entity53 areas in the capital city friday evening , killing one person and wounding 20 people , police told @entity18
a car bomb also exploded in @entity58 , a @entity2 area about 37 miles ( 60 kilometers ) north of @entity3 , killing two civilians and wounding seven others , police officials in @entity3 told @entity18
the spreading violence prompted @entity5 president @entity62 to say the beleaguered government required assistance , but he warned friday that it would take " several days " for the @entity5 to react
" this is not going to happen overnight , " he told reporters
and , he said , the @entity5 will need assurances from @entity15 's government that it will work to find a political solution the crisis
a senior @entity62 administration official said friday that the president has not yet made a decision on whether to act on any military options
but another senior administration official indicated that a decision could come as early as this weekend
airstrikes are among the options on the table , @entity78 spokesman @entity77 said thursday
but there will be no repeat of a large @entity5 troop presence on @entity15 soil
" we are not contemplating ground troops , " @entity77 said
" i want to be clear about that
" @entity5 officials have also discussed bolstering ongoing efforts to send arms , equipment and intelligence information to help @entity15 and its military
@entity95 : wake - up call secretary of state @entity95 said friday that the @entity38 militants are a threat not just to @entity15 , but to the @entity5 and the rest of the world -- and that is why @entity62 is urgently considering his next steps
" every country that understands the importance of stability in the @entity108 needs to be concerned about what is happening , " @entity95 said , speaking at a summit in @entity104
" that is why i am confident the @entity5 will move rapidly and confidently in order to join with its allies in dealing with this challenge
" @entity95 said the latest events had been a " wake - up call " for @entity15 's divided political leadership , which has been accused of failing to address growing sectarian divisions
the @entity5 has a " very direct relationship " with @entity15 , he said
" i do n't think anybody in the region or in this administration believes it is in the interests of the @entity5 to turn our backs on that
" the militants from @entity38 want to establish a caliphate , or @entity129 state , in the region -- stretching from @entity15 into northern @entity37 , where it has had significant success battling the forces of president @entity133
their lightning advance in @entity15 has been aided by support from many @entity2 who feel that the @entity53 - dominated government has marginalized them
@entity137 : summary executions , mass displacement this week 's violence has created a brewing humanitarian crisis , thanks to the displacement of some 500,000 civilians from @entity42 , and sparked fears of widespread rights abuses against civilians
@entity137 @entity149 @entity148 on friday expressed alarm over the rapid deterioration of the situation in the country
" the full extent of civilian casualties is not yet known , but reports suggest the number of people killed in recent days may run into the hundreds , and the number of wounded is said to be approaching 1,000 , " @entity148 said in a statement
she said she was deeply disturbed by reports that @entity38 fighters , including prisoners freed when the militants overran @entity42 's prison tuesday , " have been actively seeking out -- and in some cases killing -- soldiers , police and others , including civilians , whom they perceive as being associated with the government
" her agency has received reports of the summary executions of @entity15 army soldiers during the capture of @entity42 , and of 17 civilians on a street in the city on june 11 , she said
more than 500,000 people have fled the fighting in @entity42 , the @entity180 said wednesday
jittery families eager to leave sat in traffic jams stretching as far as the eye could see
the @entity137 refugee agency said many left with little more than the clothes on their backs and were in urgent need of shelter , water , food and medical care
@entity38 fighters amid civilian population according to several @entity5 officials , the @entity5 military has not finalized a proposed set of @entity38 targets in @entity15 for @entity62 , amid significant military concerns that strikes may prove futile against @entity38 fighters who are dispersed and mingled with a civilian population
several more top - level meetings are scheduled in the next 48 hours , as @entity62 mulls his course of action
" our planning is looking at the full range of options , " a senior @entity5 official told @entity18
those options range from increasing @entity5 surveillance flights over @entity38 areas to potential airstrikes , the official acknowledged

nearly 100 fighters attacked the @entity2 towns of @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 , where they clashed with security forces , and won , said the officials
while the @entity15 army has done little to resist the advance of the @entity38 militants , @entity255 fighters deployed by the semiautonomous @entity255 regional government , in coordination with @entity3 , are having more impact
the @entity255 fighters , known as the @entity231 , are battling @entity38 in @entity15 's eastern @entity17 province , said @entity264 , mayor of @entity265 , a predominantly @entity255 area of @entity17
he told @entity18 that 95 % of @entity266 was now under the control of the @entity231 , while the town of @entity269 is encircled on one side by the @entity231 and on the other by @entity38 , with @entity15 security forces still in the town
on thursday , authorities said @entity255 troops had beaten back militants to control the entire province of @entity277

it added that the detainees were convicted of civilian and criminal charges , not terror related offenses , and that a special pardon may be issued to absolve them from escape - related charges

@entity306 , former @entity15 leader @entity229 's hometown , was under full control of the military thursday , state - run @entity309 said
just a day earlier , it appeared to be in the hands of militants
but that victory claim appeared in doubt again friday , with militants still in the city and still the target of government actions
airstrikes by the @entity15 military killed 70 @entity38 militants and wounded 40 others in @entity306 on friday , state tv reported
@entity15 foreign minister @entity328 said even though the military fled in @entity42 this week , the government has since " taken a number of steps to push back the terrorists

the security concerns were exacerbated by the seizure of 48 people , including diplomats , in a wednesday raid on the @entity357 consulate
@entity357 foreign minister @entity358 said thursday that the health of those captured is " fine
" he said the government was working to secure their release

across the border in @entity37 , it controls towns such as @entity375 .
