-- have you noticed that homelessness is n't worse ? here we are , living through the most protracted joblessness crisis since the @entity5 -- and surprisingly , fewer people are living on the street
the federal @entity8 reported that the number of the chronically homeless declined by 30 % between 2005 and 2007
you might have expected the numbers to spike again when the financial crisis hit but no. since 2007 , the number of chronic homeless has dropped another 19 %
a broader measure of the number of homeless counts the number of people living out of doors on one randomly chosen night
that broader measure has also improved through the economic crisis
between january 2011 and january 2012 , homelessness among veterans dropped by 7 %
to what or whom do we owe this good news ? in very large part , we owe it to the president whose library opened in @entity32 last week : @entity33
for three decades , we have debated what causes homelessness and how to deal with it
is homelessness a mental health problem ? a substance abuse problem ? a problem caused by gentrification and urban redevelopment ? or something else again ? the @entity33 administration substituted a much simpler idea -- an idea that happened to work
whatever the cause of homelessness , the solution is ... a home
in 2002 , @entity33 appointed a new national homeless policy czar , @entity51
a former music agent imbued with the religious philosophy of @entity54 , @entity51 was seized by an idea pioneered by @entity57 psychiatrist @entity56 : " housing first
" the " housing first " concept urges authorities to concentrate resources on the hardest cases -- to move them into housing immediately -- and only to worry about the other problems of the homeless after they first have a roof over their heads
a 2004 profile in the @entity72 nicely summarized @entity56 ' ideas : " offer them ( the homeless ) the apartment first , he believes , and you do n't need to spend years , and service dollars , winning their trust
" many old school homeless advocates resisted @entity51 's approach
they were impelled by two main objections : 1
they believed that homelessness was just the most extreme form of a problem faced by low - income people generally -- a lack of affordable housing for low - income people
focusing resources on the nation 's hardest cases would ( these advocates feared ) distract the federal government from the bigger project of subsidizing better housing for millions of people who did not literally live in the streets
by 2002 , the nation had been worrying about homelessness for several decades
countless programs from state and local agencies responded to some separate part of the problem ; tens of thousands of people earned their livings in those state and local agencies , disposing of massive budgets
" @entity116 first " threatened to disrupt this vast industry
" @entity116 first " was comparatively cheap , for one thing : a homeless shelter might look squalid , but it cost a great deal to operate -- more , oftentimes , than a proper apartment with kitchen and bath
the transition to " housing first " threatened jobs and budgets across the country
there was only one counterargument to these objections : " @entity116 first " worked
it worked from the start , and it worked fast
it worked so well that the @entity137 administration has now claimed the approach as its own , even keeping @entity51 on the job for the first weeks of the new administration
@entity33 remains one of the more controversial and less popular ex-presidents
but if in the next days you happen to walk down a city street , take a moment to notice how many men or women are sleeping there
results will vary from place to place , but on average , there are probably fewer than half as many as a decade ago
the job is not completed yet
but for the first time since the 1970s , the abolition of homelessness has become a real and near possibility
whatever else you think of the 43rd president , that achievement is part of @entity33 's legacy , too
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .
