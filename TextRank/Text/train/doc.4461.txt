@entity0 -- a @entity3 - wide scandal over horse meat in products labeled beef spread still further friday , as @entity8 authorities revealed the results of dna testing on beef products and raided the premises of three more @entity8 food firms
of 2,501 tests carried out on beef products across the industry by noon friday , 2,472 found no horse meat content above 1 % , the @entity14 said
the 29 positive tests involved seven products sold by five suppliers , according to the @entity14
another 962 tests are still under way , the agency said at a news conference
fifteen of the positive tests were for the lasagna products sold by frozen food giant @entity28 that first triggered the horse meat alert last week
the others concerned beef products sold by supermarket chains @entity33 , @entity34 and the co-operative , and burgers made by catering supplier @entity37
@entity33 , @entity39 and @entity34 all issued statements saying they are boosting testing on meat products to protect customers , restore confidence and ensure product quality
@entity46 , group technical director for @entity33 , said the company will " no longer work with the suppliers who fell below our very high standards
" the @entity14 declined to give details of the names or location of the three food premises raided friday
investigations are ongoing , but authorities can not rule out the possibility of arrests , it said
the latest raids come a day after @entity8 authorities arrested three workers at two meat plants , @entity64 near @entity65 and @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68
inspectors toured the plants tuesday and suspended their permits to operate wednesday , the agency said
meanwhile , authorities in northern @entity74 confirmed friday that a dish had been pulled from 47 school kitchens after tests revealed horse dna
the ready - made cottage pie , or shepherd 's pie , came from an external supplier , the @entity79 said
" this does not appear to be a food safety issue but i 've no doubt parents will agree we need to take a very firm line with suppliers , " councilor @entity84 said in a prepared statement
authorities across @entity3 have been scrambling to get a grip on the crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products
fears of mislabeled meat also spread to the sky , where companies that provide in - flight catering in @entity3 initiated reviews of their suppliers
@entity106 said it has contacted all its meat suppliers in @entity3 and has asked for written confirmation that their products do not contain horse meat
another major caterer , @entity113 , is doing the same with its suppliers
the @entity116 intends to begin testing meat across all 27 member states , it confirmed friday
it called for testing 10 to 150 samples per country and at least five tests per country for the presence of the drug phenylbutazone , also known as bute , which is approved for horses but is not allowed to enter the food chain because it can be harmful to humans
over the past week , unauthorized horse meat has been discovered in a variety of products labeled as beef that were sold in supermarkets in countries including @entity8 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140
in the @entity8 , catering giant @entity141 and @entity142 , which owns hotels , coffee shops and restaurants , were the latest to say friday that they had found horse dna in certain beef products
@entity142 said it was removing a meat lasagna and a beef burger from its menus and would work with the @entity14 to implement a robust future testing regime
" we are shocked and disappointed at this failure of the processed meat supply chain , " it said in a written statement
@entity141 said an affected burger from @entity160 had been provided to some sites in @entity140 and @entity162 where it holds the catering contract
it promised dna testing across processed meat products in future
@entity167 in @entity168 also confirmed to @entity1 on friday that horse meat had been found in frozen lasagna dishes in its stores
" the analysis tells us that the lasagnas contained 60 % or more horse meat , " a spokeswoman said
" we have withdrawn up to 8,000 products last week
we are in talks with the factory , the @entity136 company @entity181
" @entity181 was one of two @entity136 firms whose role in the scandal was highlighted at a news conference held by @entity136 authorities thursday
the other firm , @entity189 , should have known that the meat it labeled as beef was actually horse , @entity136 consumer affairs minister @entity187 said
@entity189 was the first company to label the meat as beef , the minister said , adding that 750 tons of horse meat were involved over a period of at least six months
@entity189 should have identified the meat as horse from its @entity199 customs code , as well as its appearance , smell and price , he said
@entity181 also should have noticed anomalies in labeling of the meat it received , @entity187 said
a @entity189 representative told @entity1 the company had acted in good faith
" the company has never ordered horse meat and we never knowingly sold horse meat , " the representative said
the affair has been passed to the @entity214 prosecutor to be investigated as fraud , @entity187 said
the offense is punishable by up to two years in prison and fines of up to â ‚ ¬ 187,500 for the companies involved
@entity187 said there is no reason to doubt that the @entity199 abattoir that supplied the horse meat was acting in good faith
in another twist , @entity8 inspectors said thursday that horse carcasses contaminated with the equine painkiller bute may have entered the food chain in @entity136
@entity8 and @entity136 authorities are working to trace the horse meat , the @entity14 said
the meat industry was first thrust into the spotlight last month when @entity140 investigators found horse and pig dna in hamburger products
the discovery of pig dna in beef products is of particular concern to @entity241 , whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products
jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat
@entity1 's @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 contributed to this report .
