-- the psychiatrist treating the accused @entity4 movie theater gunman was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues , saying he could potentially be a danger to others , @entity0 affiliate @entity1 reported wednesday , citing sources with knowledge of the investigation
the psychiatrist 's concerns surfaced in early june , nearly six weeks before the july 20 killings inside a movie theater in @entity16 , sources told the @entity20 station
twelve people were killed and 58 wounded when the gunman opened fire during a screening of the new @entity26 film
@entity27 , 24 , was charged monday with murder and attempted murder in the case ; he also faces two weapons charges
why @entity27 was charged in ' unusual ' way a court document filed friday revealed @entity27 was a patient of @entity35 psychiatrist @entity34 before the attack
sources told @entity1 that @entity39 contacted several members of a " behavioral evaluation and threat assessment " team to say @entity27 could potentially be a danger to others , the station reported
the " @entity47 " team consists of " key " staff members from various university departments who have specific expertise in dealing with assessing potential threats on campus , the school says on its website
@entity27 was a doctoral student at the university 's @entity55 until june , when he withdrew from the program
sources told @entity1 that university officials never contacted @entity16 police with @entity39 's concerns before the july 20 killings
@entity16 heroes : three who gave their lives " @entity39 made initial phone calls about engaging the beta team " in " the first 10 days " of june but it " never came together " because in the period @entity39 was having conversations with team members , @entity27 began the process of dropping out of school , a source told @entity1
sources told the station that when @entity27 withdrew , the beta team " had no control over him
" @entity1 said sources did not know what @entity27 told @entity39 that sparked her concern
" it takes more than just statements , " one source told the station , explaining that @entity27 would have had to tell @entity39 " something specific " before she would have to report it to law enforcement
" he would have to tell her he had taken steps to make it happen , " another source told the station
one source also told the station that the team may not have been convened because while @entity39 had " serious concerns , there may not have been an immediate threat
" it 's not clear if @entity39 continued treating @entity97 after he dropped out of school , whether she referred him to another medical professional or had any further contact with him , @entity1 reported , citing sources familiar with the investigation
@entity4 shootings : complete coverage @entity106 , chairman of the @entity35 board of regents , told @entity1 he did not know if @entity27 had ever been discussed by the beta team , @entity1 reported
" it 's the first i 'm hearing about this , " he reportedly told the station
authorities have remained silent about a possible motive in the case
prosecutors say they will begin turning over thousands of pages of discovery in the next couple of days
the defense said it needs this information to prepare for the hearing
during the week of november 12 , attorneys expect a preliminary hearing and an evidence hearing that will include several days of testimony
