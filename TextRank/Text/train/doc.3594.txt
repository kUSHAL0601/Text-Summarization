@entity0 -- @entity2 ca n't remember what she was thinking when -- mouth agape , eyes bugged -- she shook hands with @entity8 in @entity9 this week
it all happened so fast , she says
what she does remember is the national response to the photo of her reacting with pure , unadulterated excitement to meeting the former secretary of state
media outlets pounced on the story
the @entity19 captured the reaction perfectly , writing that @entity21 had a " look on her face that has never been witnessed by anyone who is not a dad chaperoning a minivan full of teenagers at a @entity29 concert
" but why was @entity21 so excited ? what does she like about @entity8 ? and who else would she react that way to meeting ? @entity1 spoke with @entity21 friday over the phone thursday
here is our conversation : @entity1 : how did you get to meet @entity8 ? @entity21 : i went to @entity41 unsuspecting that she would come
i had seen her in the elections and i have heard a lot about her
i was just like , ' wow
' i was excited because , i thought , she was saying hi to a lot of people
i did n't think she was going to say hi to me
they went into a coffee shop and we were like , ' oh no , they are going to leave
' and then , she came out and she is like , ' hey you
' and i did n't know who she is talking to
and then i realized it was me and i went up and i turned back at my family
( long pause ) i had never met anybody famous before
( long pause ) i turned back at my family and i , like , i , you know , made the face
@entity1 : what did you think about all the attention your photo received ? @entity21 : well , i love it
because , well , it is not just because ... i think @entity8 is a a really good role model for girls of all ages and it [ the reason she liked the attention ] is n't just because it got a lot of cool places
i am just happy because people know that a younger girl still looks up to somebody like that
@entity1 : what is it about @entity8 that you look up to ? @entity21 : i like her because , like , she is running for president and a lot of people think that girls should n't be president because they are not as smart or they should n't have the same rights
and she is just a good role model for girls because , you know , she is just sort of , like , to everybody , ' girls can be awesome , too
' [ editor 's note : @entity8 herself has said she has yet to make a decision on whether she will run for president
] @entity1 : you are 10
when you were born , @entity8 had been well known for 20 years
how much did you know about her when you met earlier this week ? @entity21 : i did n't know , too , too , too much
i knew that she was the first lady for a while
and her husband is @entity103
and her daughter @entity105 just had a baby
and her niece 's name is @entity21
and that is my name
and when i first went up to her , i said , ' @entity21 , ' and she said that is one of her favorite names
@entity1 : who are some other famous people you would be as excited to see as you were with secretary @entity8 ? @entity21 : oh gosh , well , @entity118 , @entity119 , probably @entity120 and @entity121
did i already say @entity122 ? probably one direction
@entity1 : a local anchor in your hometown joked that you would be the first women president
would you ever want to do that ? @entity21 : maybe ! it is a really hard job
i think , i think , maybe
[ @entity132 's note : @entity21 will be eligible to run for president in 2040
] @entity1 : do you think you could do it ? @entity21 : yeah ! @entity1 : if @entity8 runs for president , what would your advice be to her ? @entity21 : i would say that even if you are different or you are a different gender , it does n't matter what you look like
i do n't know , like , if you wear glasses
@entity1 : if you could vote in 2016 , would you vote for @entity8 ? @entity21 : yes , totally
@entity1 : thanks @entity21 ... @entity21 : thank you
and one more thing : make sure if @entity145 [ her 12 - year old brother ] does give you the permission to use the photo , give him photo cred ! --- ( @entity1 did use the selfie that @entity145 took of his family and @entity8
and , yes , he did get the photo cred
also , some question and answers were edited for clarity
