-- @entity2 's voters will cast their ballots this weekend to decide who will lead the country through a challenging time as it grapples with its leading role in the @entity9 crisis
but just as the world has changed over the four years since the last election in @entity2 , so too has the way election issues are discussed
so , ahead of the polls , @entity0 invited the country 's six leading parties to take part in a social media debate
@entity19 : @entity21 's mrs. @entity20 journalists from across @entity21 have posed a series of tough questions via 15 - second @entity26 video clips , challenging representatives from the parties to respond to them -- and to each other -- in the same short , sharp and shareable way
and while the questions have featured a range of hot topics such as @entity34 , @entity35 and green energy , as on the campaign trail , it is the economy which has dominated the discussion
@entity39 , of @entity2 television channel n - tv , asked whether @entity2 taxpayers would get the short end of the stick from costly attempts to fight the crisis in the @entity9
@entity46 of the @entity47 , sounded a gloomy note : " there will be a rude awakening
the financial crisis is threatening democracy in @entity21
we want owners and creditors to be liable for the losses ... losses should not be socially mutualized any further
" but @entity58 of the ruling @entity59 ( @entity61 / @entity60 ) , insisted : " @entity2 and its people are benefitting considerably from the euro
the risks are manageable and transparent
it would only be a rude awakening if the opposition pushed through their plans for the mutualisation of debt
" @entity71 of the opposition @entity72 ( @entity72 ) disagreed : " the truth is not being told
another rescue package is due for @entity75
the question is what we are spending the money for
mrs @entity19 is one - sided in her focus on saving , and that will not bring the @entity75 economy back on its feet
" while @entity85 of the new anti-euro party alternatives for @entity2 ( @entity87 ) offered a prediction -- and a potential solution : " after the election , @entity75 as well as @entity90 and @entity91 will need further billions , without this being of any help to people in those countries
that 's why we 're calling for a separate currency for the crisis countries , allowing them to recover using their own strengths
" under the rules of the debate , each question is set first thing in the morning ; the parties have until midnight to post their responses via @entity26
if they wish , they can also offer rebuttals to their opponents ' responses
@entity112 : the man who stirred up @entity2 politics viewers watching the clips are asked share them online , and to pick their favourite -- and least favourite -- answers
@entity120 , vice president of digital at @entity121 said the innovative debate format reflected the fresh new ways in which information and conversations were being shared online : " short video is the medium of the moment , as @entity26 and @entity129 are demonstrating
" we think this experiment in @entity2 offers a chance to try a new approach in this exciting area
we 're always keen to innovate in story - telling and this was a great opportunity to try something new
" and just as the decisions made by @entity2 voters on sunday could have a lasting impact on the future of the eurozone , so @entity0 's @entity144 could offer a glimpse of the way political discussions are carried out in the years to come
