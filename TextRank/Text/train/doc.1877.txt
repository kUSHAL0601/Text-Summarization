the head of the bioterrorism lab involved in potentially exposing dozens of workers at the @entity3 to deadly anthrax bacteria has resigned
@entity6 , who headed the @entity7 and @entity8 ( @entity9 ) laboratory , submitted his resignation tuesday , @entity3 spokesman @entity5 told @entity11
he had been reassigned from his post last month , after the anthrax incident was made public
the @entity3 says the potential anthrax exposure happened between june 6 and june 13
the @entity9 lab had been preparing anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the @entity3 's @entity20 campus and failed to adequately deactivate the samples
according to a @entity3 investigation report , the exposure happened because the lab did n't use an approved sterilization technique
it did n't have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed , and there was a limited knowledge of peer - reviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous
the lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe
bottom line , " the scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated , " @entity3 director @entity38 said
it " should have happened , and it did n't
" @entity3 director grilled over safety issues @entity46 finds more @entity3 lab problems
