-- @entity1 says it has captured a top commander of the @entity3 , the guerrilla movement notorious for its attacks on civilians and use of child soldiers
@entity1 commanders displayed @entity9 to reporters after his capture in what they said was a weekend raid in the @entity14
the car is one of several @entity18 countries that has committed troops to hunt down @entity3 chieftain @entity20 , who is wanted for war crimes by the @entity22
" this is a big fish , " said col. @entity23 , a @entity1 military spokesman
" for @entity9 to be in our hands it is a big statement , as far as our efforts to end this rebellion
" @entity9 told reporters he hoped his capture would lead " my people remaining in the brush " to give up , " so that sooner maybe the war would come to an end
" @entity36 , @entity37 special representative for @entity38 and @entity39 , called on @entity1 authorities monday to " not apply amnesty but instead , bring him ( @entity9 ) to justice
" " the arrest and subsequent prosecution of @entity9 would send a strong message to the @entity3 leadership that they will be held accountable for their actions , " @entity36 said
@entity9 was captured with his wife , child and a 12 - year - old girl from the @entity14 , according to the @entity37 @entity9 and his family are in @entity1 custody in @entity56
the unidentified girl remains in the @entity14
it 's unknown why she was with @entity9 , the @entity37 said
@entity20 led a failed uprising against the government of @entity1 and was pushed out of @entity1 in 2006
he has been moving around other countries in the region ever since
@entity63 , a special @entity37 envoy for @entity64 , told @entity0 in march that @entity20 may be in the @entity14 with between 200 and 700 remaining troops
@entity20 is accused of using vicious tactics to recruit children to use them as soldiers and sex slaves and of slicing off ears , noses and limbs of his victims
there are reports of child soldiers brainwashed into killing their own parents
a celebrity - backed video that went viral earlier this year helped make @entity20 's alleged crimes more widely known
the half - hour documentary " @entity80 " was viewed more than 89 million times on @entity82 , but the video also spurred a flurry of questions about its producers ' intentions , their transparency and whether the social - media frenzy was too little , too late .
