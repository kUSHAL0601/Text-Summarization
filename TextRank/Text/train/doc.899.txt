@entity1 : how do you feel watching the situation in @entity3 ? @entity2 : i 'm very sad
i wish that the regime would understand that it has to reform or renew itself and create a new government through free and fair elections
i also wish that the opposition had not resorted to armed violence because i 'm personally against violence in all its forms
i do not see any justification for its use whatsoever
@entity1 : should the outside world intervene in @entity3 ? a : the world should not interfere , especially not militarily
the western world should not use this as a pretext to fulfill its own goals in the region
more from inside the @entity58 : filmmaker @entity60 's tour of ' @entity61 ' in @entity29 @entity1 : are you in touch with friends in @entity3 ? a : i last went to @entity3 a year and a half ago , but i 'm always in touch with my friends there
many of them are in the opposition -- but in the peaceful opposition
many of them share my views that the solution must be @entity3 and through a democratic dialogue
we must reach a new regime that is democratic , plural and secular
@entity1 : are your friends scared ? a : their main fear is for the violence and for the potential for the situation to develop into civil war
they are not scared to speak out
@entity1 : how have events of the past year changed the @entity7 world ? a : there 's definitely a new consciousness everywhere
the question is will this lead to a new political reality and new regimes ? it 's difficult to predict , but i hope so
@entity1 : have you seen changes in @entity30 , where you have lived on and off since 1956 ? a : @entity30 will remain as it has always been : an ongoing project , a work in progress
it 's a project that 's difficult to stop , but it 's equally difficult to continue with
@entity1 : you received no formal education until you recited one of your own poems to the then @entity3 president in 1943
how did that happen ? a : it was almost 70 years ago after @entity3 became independent and the president was touring the country
i was 12 or 13 and i read a poem in front of the president
he called me over and asked what i wanted
i said i would like to go to school , so i got a scholarship to a school in @entity20
more from inside the @entity58 : women and the @entity7 uprisings : 8 ' agents of change ' to follow @entity1 : how did that change your life ? a : poetry gave me a new life
i can always say that poetry allowed me to be reborn
@entity1 : how important is poetry in @entity7 culture ? a : there are two things that are central to our culture : religion and poetry
they were always in conflict
unfortunately now religion is overwhelming poetry , but i have a saying that poetry remains deeply - rooted and strong
poetry has never had any influence throughout history , however poetry creates a new aesthetic , a new beauty , a new type of relations between things and people , and this is not insignificant
@entity1 : what was @entity3 like before 1970 when @entity153 , @entity154 's father came to power ? a : i left @entity3 in 1956 , a few years before the @entity156 became the government in 1963
i was always opposed to the @entity159 ideology
i was always against the one - party state
@entity1 : you left @entity3 after being imprisoned for membership of an opposition party in 1956 , then you left @entity30 in 1982 after the @entity165 invasion
do you feel you have always been in exile ? a : i do n't only feel in exile because of these two departures
there are many other factors making me feel this way : relationships with other people , my relationship with language , my relationship with the world
love sometimes makes you feel you are in exile
existentially , the feeling of permanence is always accompanied by a feeling of exile , of impermanence
@entity1 : how has @entity3 changed since you left ? a : what 's strange is i feel it is i who has changed , not the country
@entity1 : what are your memories of the @entity3 of your youth ? a : i remember the coast , the mountains , the beautiful girls for which @entity3 is famous
i miss swimming in the sea
@entity1 : will you ever go back to live in @entity3 ? a : i would like to go back , but i do n't think my desire will be fulfilled
@entity1 : the @entity38 in @entity0 is currently running ' a tribute to @entity2 ' and an exhibition of your artwork
what does this mean to you ? a : i 'm very happy
there 's a lot of attention and a lot of sensitive appreciation .
