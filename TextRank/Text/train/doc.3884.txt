-- the oldest - known hominid skeleton was a 4 - foot - tall female who walked upright more than 4 million years ago and offers new clues to how humans may have evolved , scientists say
this sketch shows what a 4 million - year - old hominid , nicknamed @entity8 , may have looked like
scientists believe that the fossilized remains , which were discovered in 1994 in @entity11 and studied for years by an international team of researchers , support beliefs that humans and chimpanzees evolved separately from a common ancestor
" this is not an ordinary fossil
it 's not a chimp
it 's not a human
it shows us what we used to be , " said project co-director @entity23 , a paleontologist at the @entity24
ardipithecus ramidus , nicknamed " @entity8 , " is a hominid species that lived 4.4 million years ago in what is now @entity31 , @entity11
that makes @entity8 more than a million years older than the celebrated @entity33 , the partial ape - human skeleton found in @entity35 in 1974
@entity8 's 125 - piece skeleton includes the skull , teeth , pelvis , hands and feet bones
scientists say the data collected from @entity8 's bone fragments over the past 17 years push back the story of human evolution further than previously believed
" in fact , what @entity50 tells us is that we as humans have been evolving to what we are today for at least 6 million years , " @entity47 , an evolutionary biologist at @entity48 and project anatomist , said thursday
analysis of @entity8 's skeleton reveals that she weighed about 110 pounds , had very long arms and fingers , and possessed an opposable big toe that would have helped her grasp branches while moving through trees
@entity8 's brain was believed to be the size of a chimp 's , but she also had many human - like features , such as the ability to walk upright on two legs
her " all - purpose type " teeth indicate that she probably ate a combination of plants , fruits and small mammals , scientists say
" the anatomy behind this behavioral combination is very unexpected and is certain to cause considerable rethinking of not only our evolutionary past , but also that of our living relatives : the great apes , " said @entity75 , professor of biological anthropology at @entity76
many scientists hypothesize that humans took a different evolutionary trajectory from those of chimpanzees , bonobos and gorillas
@entity8 's findings help challenge earlier beliefs that humans evolved from chimpanzees , their closest genetic relatives , scientists say
researchers are still trying to pinpoint when the two lineages -- chimps and humans -- split from their common ancestor
digging up the past has not been easy
scientists stumbled upon the @entity50 fossil in 1994 when a graduate student found a single upper molar tooth
the rest of @entity8 's fossilized bones , sandwiched between layers of volcanic rock , took three years to be recovered and many more to be analyzed
" in many ways , the discovery of @entity50 has been like a marathon , " @entity23 said
" @entity50 and its prevailing anatomy revolutionize the way most of us understood the earlier part of our evolutionary history , " said team member @entity113 , paleontologist at the @entity114
the @entity8 findings are the work of 47 paleontologists and geologists representing 10 countries
the results will be published friday in 11 articles in a special edition of the journal @entity129
until now , @entity130 , nicknamed " @entity33 , " was the oldest fossil studied by scientists seeking to explain human evolution
@entity33 is believed to have lived about 3.2 million years ago in what is now @entity11
many scientists credit @entity11 with taking the lead in helping the world better understand the origins of humans
" this finding points to a deeper sense of our [ humans ' ] interconnectedness , " @entity140 , @entity11 ambassador to the @entity141 , said thursday
" we are all @entity11 at heart
" @entity8 's skeleton resides in the @entity149 in @entity150 .
