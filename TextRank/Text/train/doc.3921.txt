he says it 's his last fight
and it 's been his hardest
after 43 years in @entity5 , @entity4 rep. @entity3 said the campaign for his 23rd term is his final one
the 84 - year - old " @entity12 " wants two more years in @entity10 , but on tuesday , voters will decide if his time is up
he 's a founding member of the @entity13 , and the former chair of the powerful @entity15
but the legend of @entity18 politics is on shaky ground
@entity3 running for 23rd term in the @entity21 @entity3 says he 's ready this time he 's been bruised before
in the 2012 @entity24 primary , victory came by a thin margin
@entity3 beat state sen. @entity26 by fewer than 1,100 votes
the congressman said he did n't put up much of a fight
" i did n't have a campaign last time
when he told me he was running i was in the hospital in @entity33 with a viral infection in my spine
" this time , @entity3 said he 's ready
" well , i do n't have a walker
i do n't have a spinal injury
" @entity3 has also had more time to recover from a humiliating censure in 2010 from the @entity39 @entity21 following a series of ethics violations
2014 midterms : what 's at stake gearing up for @entity45 since 2012 , @entity26 has been gearing up for @entity45
this time , the underdog said he 's counting on an upset and making comparisons to one of the biggest ones ever in boxing : " @entity52 was a big , bad bear when he got into the ring , but ( @entity56 ) @entity55 was faster , smarter than him , " @entity26 said
" he was able to draw circles around him , and he shook up the world and he changed boxing
" if voters want a change now , it may be a measure of how much the district has changed since @entity3 went to @entity10 in 1971
@entity18 's rich african - american history now seems distant @entity66 knows the streets of @entity18 as well as anyone
he gives walking tours , and he often points out the fact that the neighborhood is , " ... not the @entity18 that i grew up in , but a @entity18 i embrace
" a falling crime rate has accelerated real estate development in the neighborhood , but affordable housing remains among the most pressing issues for many with roots in the community
" people are concerned about gentrification , about rising housing costs , about some of the mom and pop shops closing
about being able to afford to live in the community where you are now , " said @entity66
@entity18 has long been known for its rich african - american history
but to @entity18 historian @entity90 , that past feels more distant today
" in the 20th century @entity18 was incontrovertibly ... the cultural capital of @entity92
... is it still ? i would say now it 's the custodian of that great history
" both say racial and ethnic politics not part of race today , the demographics are different
so is the district itself
part of the @entity105 was added to @entity18 's district before the 2012 primary
the 13th @entity108 now has a @entity110 majority
if elected , @entity26 would become the country 's first @entity112 - @entity39 congressman
both candidates insist that racial and ethnic politics should n't determine the outcome of the race
" we never had a political battle in my congressional district in 43 years based on where you were born or what religion you have , " @entity3 said while campaigning saturday
2014 midterms : complete coverage turnout could be key according to a @entity130 / @entity129 poll released the week before the primary , the vast majority of voters said the race or ethnicity of the candidates makes no difference to them , the same poll shows @entity3 has a 70 - point lead with blacks and a 5 - point lead with whites , while @entity26 has a 24 - point lead with @entity142
overall , the poll gives @entity3 a 13 - point lead ( 47 % -34 % ) against @entity26
insiders suggest the race is tighter than that and too tough to predict
a key factor : turnout is expected to be low
both campaigns will have to battle to get voters to the polls on tuesday
the congressional race is the only item on the ballot .
