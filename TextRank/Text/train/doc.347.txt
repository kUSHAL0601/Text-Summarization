@entity0 , @entity1 -- a former @entity0 police lieutenant pleaded guilty wednesday to obstruction of justice in connection with the police shootings of civilians in the days after @entity9 and court documents unsealed with the plea suggest that other officers will be indicted in the case
former lt. @entity17 was convicted of " conspiring with a group of @entity0 police officers to obstruct justice by engaging in a cover - up of the true circumstances surrounding the shooting , by @entity25 officers , of a number of individuals , " @entity15 attorney @entity14 of the @entity16 of @entity1 said at a news conference
two civilians were killed and four were wounded in the shootings on the @entity32 on september 4 , 2005 , days after @entity9 roared ashore on the @entity33
read the criminal complaint the guilty plea does not signal the end of the investigation into the incident , @entity14 said
" know this : the investigation continues , " he said , adding that " this investigation is being conducted very aggressively , but also very fairly
" the federal indictment unsealed wednesday signaled that other indictments are likely
" [ @entity43 ] he incident involved at least seven @entity25 officers who drove to the @entity32 in a rental truck in response to a call for police assistance , " the indictment said
@entity2 @entity0 affiliate @entity50 reported that two other officers have received target letters from federal prosecutors
such letters are sent to targets of grand jury investigations
legal scholars said they expected more indictments in the cover - up of the shooting but that it 's unclear whether any officers will be charged for the shooting itself
" there 's no evidence the officers shot out of malice , " said @entity65 , a professor at @entity67 ' @entity66
" it was probably negligence , ratcheted up to a federal offense by the cover - up
" @entity17 , the officer who pleaded guilty wednesday , conspired with other police officers to cover up the shootings even though he believed them to be " legally unjustified , " according to the federal indictment
among @entity17 's actions , he fabricated stories , statements , a 17 - page report and a follow - up report , and lied to federal agents , @entity14 said
the shootings occurred after several officers , responding to a call for assistance , drove to the bridge and encountered six civilians who were walking across it to get food and supplies , the indictment says
the officers fired , killing one person -- later identified as 19 - year - old @entity95 -- and wounding four others , according to the indictment
witness in 2006 : @entity0 cops shot man in back once they reached the other side of the bridge , the officers started shooting again , killing @entity106 , a 40 - year - old severely disabled man , the indictment says
@entity106 was shot seven times -- five times in the back , the coroner has said
@entity17 arrived on the scene after the shooting , learned that his police colleagues " planned to provide false stories about what had precipitated the shooting " and " encouraged them to do so , " according to the indictment
among other things , @entity17 did not ensure police collected evidence , suggested that colleagues get rid of some shell casings the shooters had left behind and went along with a plan to plant a gun near the bridge , according to the indictment
the officers falsely arrested @entity106 's brother on eight counts of attempted murder of a police officer , according to the indictment
@entity135 was held for weeks before being released without any formal charges filed against him
state prosecutors pursued criminal charges against several police officers without success
in august 2008 , a judge quashed indictments against @entity144
@entity145 and @entity146 , officer @entity146 and former officer @entity147 , all of whom were facing first - degree murder and attempted murder charges
in addition , he threw out attempted first - degree murder charges against officers @entity154 and @entity156 , and attempted second - degree murder charges against officer @entity158
federal prosecutors opened an investigation after the judge 's actions
the failure of the state prosecutors ' strategy is another reason legal scholars say they expect the federal indictments to hinge on the cover - up instead of the shooting itself .
