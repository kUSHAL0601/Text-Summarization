-- you would think that fans watching a golf tournament on site would be more susceptible to being hit by an errant ball than a golfer but that was n't the case at the @entity9 in the @entity10 on thursday
in a rare occurrence , @entity13 's @entity12 was struck on the head and was taken to hospital as a " precaution , " the @entity11 said
he was receiving treatment but was okay , the @entity11 added
" the latest report from hospital is that all neurological tests have come back clear , " the @entity11 's tournament director , @entity19 , told the @entity11 's website
" we wish @entity12 a speedy recovery
" the 31 - year - old @entity12 -- who earlier this year became the first @entity13 to win on the @entity11 -- was on the 16th fairway when he was hit by @entity28 's shot from the 14th tee
@entity12 was attended to on site by a doctor and paramedic as a concerned @entity28 looked on before an ambulance transported him to hospital
play had to be suspended but resumed about two hours later
fellow golfers @entity37 of @entity38 and @entity39 of @entity40 are staying with @entity12 and have pulled out of the event , the @entity11 said
entering thursday , @entity12 was 27th in the race to @entity44 standings
