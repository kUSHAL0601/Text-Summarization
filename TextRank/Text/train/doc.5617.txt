@entity37 , a @entity38 - trained planner , proposed the trail as a respite from the physical and mental impacts of industrialization and urbanization in 1921
walking the entire length of the trail , between @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , @entity50 , has become a distinctly @entity23 pilgrimage , weaving through the religious roots of the nation , and providing stunning views of eastern terrains ranging from isolated valleys to lines of blue - tinted mountains

in the @entity74 and @entity60 versions , the @entity61 , while powerful , are not malicious and mean no harm
but @entity77 immigrants turned the spirit of the mountain solely into @entity80 ( or @entity80 ) , a demonic being , with a moose head , eagles ' wings and feet and a human body
@entity85 , on a failed attempt to bushwhack all the way to the summit , declared that @entity80 is " always angry with those who climb to the summit of @entity91

the @entity32 painters produced multiple canvasses of the ethereal mountain , where an inscrutable @entity0 ruled the heights , and divine providence flowed down the slopes and watered the pastures and farmsteads of the @entity25 below

the @entity301 treated animals as members of neighboring tribes , who celebrated seasonal dances in their townhouses , just as the @entity301 did
hikers can enjoy the southern-most @entity1 spruce fir forest , and have the chance to view , not just numerous black bears , but endemic species such as the red - cheeked salamander and @entity321 fir

they are friendly to humans , assist lost hunters and support the @entity301 in battle
these gentle inhabitants of the heights love music , and local residents still report hearing the sounds of their drums and dances
several bald mountains or peaks with distinctive rock formations along the southern stretch of the trail are also associated with the @entity301 monster slayer tale of the giant horned lizard , the @entity362
a @entity364 medicine man pursued the ferocious beast , from nearby @entity366 , @entity48 , through @entity367 and the @entity368 in the @entity369 , in @entity297 to its home on @entity371 on the @entity297 / @entity298 border
