when 33 @entity2 miners were trapped underground in 2010 , the government sent @entity4 cameras 2,300 feet down to film the group and their eventual rescue
@entity7 had a @entity4 camera strapped to his chest when he skydived a record 24 miles on october 14
cinematographer @entity10 mounted a @entity4 onto the back of a great white shark and another in a fake seal to film inside a shark 's mouth
but the small , wearable video cameras are also being used to document less dramatic events , like babies being cute , cross-country road trips and the @entity21 's favorite video subject , cats
the dizzying variety of places @entity4 cameras have gone shows how the product has grown from a niche tool for surfers into to the rugged video camera of choice for recording physical , outdoor , dangerous or first - person footage
@entity4 has found a unique place in the camera market by focusing intensely on its main product : a tiny wearable waterproof and shockproof hd camera that can be mounted almost anywhere
the newest version of the device is the @entity39 , announced this week , which is 30 % smaller than its predecessors
the new models record higher - quality hd video ( up to @entity44 ) , still images and audio , and cost between $ 200 and $ 400
the company was started by surfer @entity49 in 2002 , taking off with its first hd camera offering in 2009
@entity49 has managed to break into a market dominated by big names with long histories such as @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58
with the camera market split into two main categories -- high - end digital slrs and camera phones -- @entity4 is carving out a third category : high - definition action
part of the company 's success stems from its unique approach to marketing
like its founder , many of the company 's 300 - plus employees embody the adventurous @entity4 brand and live the lifestyle
they 're surfers and skydivers , diy tinkerers and video geeks
the company has a tight relationship with its customers , constantly finding and featuring cool videos it finds on @entity84 or @entity85 that were shot with a @entity4
the media team puts the cameras in the hands of big - name athletes such as @entity90 and @entity91 and takes part in large events like the @entity7 jump and the @entity95
luckily for @entity4 , its cameras are natural viral video stars and apparently look delicious to seagulls : a seagull in @entity100 grabbed a @entity4 and dropped if off on top of a castle , and another in @entity103 took one for a ride over the bay at sunset
the two bird videos alone have racked up over 5 million views in total
a video shot on a @entity4 of a mountain biker being taken out by a gazelle has more than 14 million views
other companies shell out huge amounts of money for that level of exposure
@entity119 , @entity4 's creative director of media production , encapsulates the spirit of the company
he looks and acts the part of an adrenaline - loving @entity125 dude , rocking tattered t - shirts , sun - bleached blond hair and a scraggly beard
@entity119 met @entity49 and his wife , @entity131 , in 2002 on a trip in the @entity133 , off the coast of @entity135 in @entity136
the group instantly connected and began traveling together
@entity119 and @entity49 were fixated on finding the best way to record their surfing exploits without a professional photographer , eventually trying to attach a 35mm waterproof film camera to a wrist strap fashioned out of an old surfboard leash and rubber bands
@entity49 and his wife brought a couple thousand bean - shell belts back to @entity125 from @entity136 and sold them out of their @entity149 van for cash
all the while , @entity49 was experimenting with the camera , sending the first prototype to @entity119 in 2004 to test while he traveled around the world
working with existing camera companies to license their hardware for a wrist strap turned out to be difficult , so @entity49 went to @entity159 and commissioned a cheap camera in a waterproof case
he established a proper company called @entity163 , hired employees , hit the trade shows and even went on @entity166
in november 2009 , @entity4 released its first hd camera
it 's since sold more than 3 million hd cameras
@entity4 is n't a typical @entity170 technology company
it makes hardware , it 's been profitable from early on , and not including some original funding from friends and family , it has taken on only modest amounts of outside investment -- including an undisclosed sum from the @entity179 - affiliated @entity179 last year
what it does has in common with its software - making neighbors is the hacker spirit
@entity4 employees and users are constantly tinkering with and modifying the camera , inventing mounts and unexpected uses
at the company 's @entity191 headquarters , engineers and designers regularly create inventive mounts , only a handful of which every actually make it to production
@entity4 customer and fisherman @entity198 created a custom torpedo - shaped housing for his camera and dragged it behind a boat , catching amazing underwater video of dolphins
the camera has broken out of the sports world thanks in large part to these creative customers who are constantly coming up with new " would n't it be cool if ... " scenarios
scientists and companies have found that the camera also has practical uses , like collecting data
there were multiple cameras strapped to the 72 - foot @entity220 boat that capsized and was dragged out through the @entity221 into the ocean on tuesday night
the racing team had been using the cameras to collect data for training
( unfortunately , the damage to the multimillion - dollar boat was extensive , and the cameras were lost at sea
) a plasma - based rocket company has placed @entity233 in a thermo - vacuum chamber for analysis when it fires test rockets
meteorologists have sent the devices up on weather balloons , and oceanographers have sent them out to sea
the @entity243 military uses @entity244 and the optional night vision mounts
for the launch of its newest hd camera , the company is pushing harder to reach a more general audience , with television commercials , print ads and sponsorships
it organized an elaborate day of extreme activities in @entity103 for journalists , including rides in fighter jets , in race cars and on the back of @entity220 racing boats
it sent people up hot air balloons , on the back of motorcycles and scuba diving with sharks at the @entity268
@entity4 has some competition from companies like @entity56 and will probably see more similar products on shelves as bigger camera companies try to duplicate its success
for now , it is enjoying showing off its new hardware and the rad hd videos it captures , whether they 're of cats or fighter planes .
