@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 and electric vehicles might be leading the charge , so to speak , towards cleaner transport , but will cars powered by air and the sun ever surpass the sales figures of gasoline cars ? @entity12 boss @entity12 with his @entity14 which start a six - month trial at two @entity17 airports in 2009
click here to read about the latest hydrogen and electric cars a breath of @entity22 it might seem ridiculous , but air -- yes , air -- can power a car
compressed air , stored in a carbon - fiber tank and then released , expands to drive the engine 's pistons in the same way that petrol gases do
a @entity32 - based company , @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is at the forefront of the air car 's push to market
former @entity38 engineer and @entity12 founder @entity12 has been working on the technology for almost two decades and is producing a fleet of different models including the @entity44 , the @entity45 and the @entity46
@entity48 's biggest car maker , @entity49 , and a @entity51 startup , @entity12 , have both signed deals with @entity12 and hope to have air cars on the road by 2010
in the @entity51 the starting price will be nearly $ 18,000
in october 2008 , @entity57 and the @entity59 airline @entity58 announced that they will be testing out @entity12 's " @entity14 " for six months starting in spring 2009
the four seaters will ferry passengers around @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity64
@entity12 says one tank of compressed air will take you about 60 miles in the @entity44 , which has a top speed of 35 miles per hour
as you 'd expect from a car that runs on air , there is zero pollution
verdict compressed - air engines are not new technology -- the @entity77 were powering trams with compressed air back in the 19th century
but the air car is highly unlikely to surpass the gasoline car and does n't have enough oomph to seriously challenge new electric and fuel - cell vehicles
@entity85 , an electrical engineer from the @entity87 's @entity86 , says : " they are interesting , but the problem is that the specific energy -- energy per unit mass -- is very high in air cars
" professor @entity93 from the @entity94 at the @entity87 's @entity95 says : " it 's an idea that 's worth pursuing , but compressing air is both a strength and a weakness
the big advantage of conventional engines is that you can put fuel with a high energy content in a tank and get good range
with a compressed air engine the range is not spectacular
" @entity109 solar cars harvest sunlight to drive an on - board electric motor
you 're probably familiar with the solar cars that look a bit like a stingray on wheels , but those are n't commercially viable and are mostly entered into endurance races like the annual @entity120 in @entity121
a @entity77 motor company , @entity122 , has produced an electro - solar hybrid
the @entity124 -- a car with roof - mounted solar panels which power an electric motor -- was so popular , @entity122 says , that they have adapted it into a commercial model
the @entity130 is yours to own for $ 30,000 and uses solar panels to collect energy to power an electric engine
it has a range of about 30 miles and has a top speed of 30 mph
the car is featured in the 2008 movie , " @entity139 , " starring @entity140
it is rumored that the @entity142 -- which passed the one million worldwide sales mark in 2008 -- has a new model due out next year that will be fitted with solar panels on its roof to power the car 's air conditioning
verdict @entity122 has demonstrated that it is perfectly possible to produce solar powered vehicles
but they are expensive when you consider the level of performance they can deliver
professor @entity93 says : " solar power has a long way to go
at the moment you simply do n't have the energy density to do anything special
" but @entity85 thinks that solar could assist the growth of electric cars
" your garage could have solar panels on its roof , store up energy during the day and charge your vehicle at night , " he said
" and parking lots and the like could be fitted with solar panels
so there are ways that those two can play together
" the future @entity178 , @entity179 at the @entity180 in @entity181 , says : " we are talking about a new paradigm here because we know the old paradigm is going to go away
" for hydrogen , or any new fuel for that matter , to succeed there has to be a policy decision
at the moment it 's not cost effective and it 's not going to be cost effective until we get into the tens of millions of units per year
there is no way of getting around this
politicians have to decide when they want to put a policy in place
it 's not an economic decision , it 's a policy decision
" but any major changes are going to take a long time , he says
" the issue is manufacturing
last year we made 60 million cars worldwide
that 's two cars a second
that 's the current level of production
it has taken many years to get up to that rate , " @entity178 said
