editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- back in the mid-zeroes , i remember reading a lot of stories about a buildup of trash in the @entity25 so massive that it had formed a floating island of waste the size of @entity29
its colorful nickname was the @entity32 , and what was even more mind - boggling than the purported scale was that pretty much the only places you could dig up any substantial info about it were in minor oceanographic and environmental publications
you also could n't find a photo of it to save your life
@entity53 , the idea that one of the biggest environmental disasters of our age had been going on outside nearly everyone 's awareness piqued our curiosity , so we decided to head out there ( the middle of the ocean ) and see it for ourselves
the @entity32 is located at a natural collecting point at the center of a set of revolving currents called the @entity63
the middle of the @entity63 is more of a meteorological phenomenon than an actual place : a consistent high - pressure zone north of the @entity68 that , combined with the extremely weak currents , helps keep the ocean surface as placid as lake water
@entity72 has been sucked into this area from the encircling currents for as long as the @entity25 's existed , but up until the last century this process ended with the refuse safely biodegrading and being reabsorbed into the food chain as nutrients
with the advent of plastics , however , the @entity32 has transformed from a fertile feeding ground to the oceanic equivalent of a desert
and a particularly crap - strewn desert at that
see the rest of toxic : @entity88 we chartered a trip through the middle of the mess with capt. @entity93 of the @entity94
capt. @entity93 is credited with discovering the @entity32 in its present , trash - choked state , and at the time was one of the few people studying the extent and effect of the pollution
our voyage into the center of the @entity63 took eight days of round - the - clock sailing on a 50 - foot catamaran with a crew of six ( including @entity9 's three - man filming team )
by the time we got to the beginning of the patch , anticipation and cabin fever had conspired to make our expectations of " @entity88 " unreasonably high , but what we found still managed to surpass them
to the naked eye it looked no different from any other part of the ocean , except that every few minutes something really strange would float by
for instance , one time it was a hard hat with @entity127 writing on it
another time it was a motorcycle tire
another time it was a child 's life preserver with a cartoonish shark bite taken out of the side
once it was an enormous telephone - pole - shaped thing that could have easily wrecked our ship if we 'd been on a slightly different course
here we were in one of the most remote stretches of water in the world -- thousands of miles from land , had n't seen another ship in days -- and everywhere around us was civilization 's detritus
it would have been some consolation to think that the @entity32 was simply the result of careless sailors , but researchers estimate up to 80 percent of the trash originates on land
that not only meant that the shampoo bottle or birthday balloon we scooped up had most likely spent years traveling around the currents of the @entity158 before ending up in our path , but that there were countless others in the middle of the same journey
it was a colossal bring - down
then we started taking some samples of the water , and that 's when we realized things were even worse than we thought
watch what the water samples showed
