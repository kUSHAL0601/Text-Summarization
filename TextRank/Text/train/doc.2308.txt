@entity0 -- bullying and harassment in schools often includes violations of federally protected civil rights , the federal government warned tuesday in new guidelines for educators on how to address the problem
if school administrators fail to properly deal with harassment based on gender , race or other issues , they risk being cited for contributing to a pattern of civil rights violations that could , in extreme cases , lead to a cut in federal funding , according to top officials who spoke to reporters on a conference call about the new guidelines
" in extreme cases , schools could be stripped of their federal education monies if they do n't comply with all of our civil rights laws , " said @entity26 , assistant secretary for civil rights
also on the call were @entity32 , secretary of education , and @entity35 director @entity34
the issue of harassment gained prominence this year after a spate of suicides by students who were being bullied
president @entity42 has called for greater awareness of the problem , saying the nation must " dispel the myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage or an inevitable part of growing up
" the guidelines were part of a letter that began " @entity53 " sent tuesday to thousands of schools , colleges , universities and school districts around the country that included examples of bullying and harassment cases that constituted violations of federal civil rights laws
in addition , the government said the @entity35 will host a conference next year on preventing bullying and harassment , building on efforts by @entity32 's department and other agencies
in august , the @entity42 administration hosted the first @entity73 and launched a national campaign against bullying
@entity76 said the government proposed $ 410 million in fiscal year 2011 spending for " successful , safe and healthy students , " a 12 percent increase over 2010
in a statement tuesday , the @entity80 welcomed the new government guidelines for making clear that most religious , gender and sexual harassment comes under federal civil rights prohibitions , but it called for expanding the federal law to eliminate any doubt
" though the guidance goes far under current law , it does not replace having a federal statute that explicitly protects " lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender students , said @entity91 , the director of the @entity80 's @entity0 legislative office
@entity91 called for @entity97 to pass the @entity98 , a bill pending in the @entity35 and @entity100 that the @entity80 said would guarantee that homosexual and transgender students are explicitly protected from harassment and discrimination under federal law .
