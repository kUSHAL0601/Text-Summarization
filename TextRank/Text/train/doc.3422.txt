@entity0 , @entity1 -- explosions and anti-aircraft fire thundered in the skies above @entity0 early sunday , but it was not clear whether they resulted from another round of cruise missile attacks by allies determined to stop @entity11 's offensive against @entity1 opposition forces
@entity2 's @entity13 witnessed the development a few hours after nearly 1,000 people gathered at @entity11 's palace in the capital
the crowd chanted , waved flags and shot off fireworks in support of the government
a defiant @entity11 said @entity1 will fight back against undeserved " naked aggression
" his military claimed nearly 50 people , including , women , children and clerics , were killed in saturday evening 's attacks
there was no independent confirmation of that statement
@entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 military forces , convinced that @entity11 was not adhering to a @entity38 - mandated cease - fire , hammered @entity1 military positions with missiles and fighter jets in the first phase of an operation that will include enforcement of a no - fly zone
an eyewitness in @entity0 reported seeing signs of gunfire rising sunday morning from the direction of nearby @entity50
the @entity52 activist said she heard " continuous gunshots " and at least two loud explosions
it was not clear if the airport was also being used as a military installation
the eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said she did not hear the sound of flying aircraft
more than 110 @entity64 missiles fired from @entity34 and @entity36 ships and submarines hit about 20 @entity1 air and missile defense targets in western portions of the country , @entity34 vice adm. @entity62 said at a @entity72 briefing
the @entity34 will conduct a damage assessment of the sites , which include @entity76 missiles and communications facilities
a senior @entity34 military official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the cruise missiles , which fly close to the ground or sea at about 550 miles per hour , landed near @entity83 and @entity0
the salvo , in an operation dubbed " @entity86 , " was meant " to deny the @entity1 regime from using force against its own people , " said @entity62
@entity91 photos showed flashes of light and smoke funnels as missiles soared from a destroyer into the night sky
earlier , @entity35 fighter jets deployed over @entity1 fired at a military vehicle saturday , the first strike against @entity11 's military forces , which earlier attacked the rebel stronghold of @entity103
prime minister @entity104 said late saturday that @entity36 forces also are in action over @entity1
" what we are doing is necessary , it is legal and it is right , " he said
" i believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people
" @entity36 defense secretary @entity113 said the @entity114 deployed @entity116 fast jets , which flew 3,000 miles from the @entity36 and back , " making this the longest - range bombing mission conducted by the @entity114 since the ( 1982 ) @entity117 conflict
" while there were no @entity34 warplanes flying over @entity1 late saturday , the coalition was softening @entity1 positions before enforcing a no - fly zone , @entity62 said
the @entity1 military , in a statement broadcast on state tv , said , " an enemy attacked the state on march 19th with rockets ... those enemies killed 48 martyrs -- mostly women , children , and religious clerics
they left more than 150 injured
the majority of these attacks were on public areas , hospitals and schools
they frightened the children and women near those areas that were subject to this aggression
" @entity11 , speaking early sunday on @entity1 state tv , said the @entity38 charter provides for @entity1 's right to defend itself in a " war zone
" weapons depots will be opened , he said
" all you people of the @entity153 nations and @entity154 , and @entity155 and @entity156 , stand with the @entity1 people in its fight against this aggression , " @entity11 said
air attacks on several locations in @entity0 and @entity83 have caused " real harm " to civilians , a @entity1 government spokesman said
an eyewitness in @entity83 said @entity11 's forces are targeting fuel and power stations in an effort to make citizens believe the damage is being done by coalition forces
the eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said people celebrated allied airstrikes on loyalist positions in the city
@entity2 could not verify the account
shortly after the first missile attacks , @entity34 president @entity182 informed the @entity34 people of the efforts by a " broad coalition
" " the use of force is not our first choice , " the president said from @entity188 , @entity189
" it is not a choice i make lightly
but we can not stand idly by when a tyrant tells his own people that there will be no mercy
" @entity182 is planning for the @entity34 portion of the military action in @entity1 to only last for a few days , according to a senior administration official , who was not authorized to speak about sensitive military matters
" after that we 'll take more of a supporting role , " the senior official said
@entity182 authorized @entity34 military force from @entity189 on what happened to be the eighth anniversary of the start of the war in @entity213
coalition partners say @entity11 has failed to adhere to a @entity38 resolution that imposed the no - fly zone and ordered him to stop attacks on civilians
" he 's clearly been on the offensive , " the senior @entity34 military official said of @entity11
" he said that he was going to do a cease - fire and he continued to move his forces into @entity103
" earlier saturday , @entity11 issued defiant messages to international powers
" i have all the @entity1 people with me and i 'm prepared to die
and they are prepared to die for me
men , women and even children , " @entity11 said in a letter addressed to @entity182 and read to reporters by a government spokesman in @entity0
@entity182 , secretary of state @entity233 and @entity62 used the term " unique capabilities " to describe the @entity34 part of the effort
officials have said @entity34 military forces are meant to augment @entity241 , @entity242 and other @entity243 troops
in the next few days , @entity34 military officials expect to hand over control to a coalition commander
@entity247 and @entity248 also are part of the coalition
" our air force will oppose any aggression by @entity258 against the population of @entity103 , " said @entity35 president @entity251 , speaking after a top - level meeting in @entity253 over the @entity1 crisis
the international meeting -- which included @entity243 and @entity241 partners -- focused on how to take on a @entity1 government bent on destroying the fledgling opposition movement under the @entity38 resolution authorizing force to protect civilians against the @entity11 government
rebel forces in @entity103 used a captured army tank as a victory symbol , @entity2 's @entity268 reported
earlier saturday , incoming artillery rounds landed inside @entity103 , and @entity275 tanks rolled into the town firing rounds , witnesses said
a flaming fighter jet plummeted from the sky , nose - diving to the ground
@entity282 , the opposition military spokesman , said the plane was an old @entity284 that belonged to the rebels
as night fell over @entity103 on saturday , the city became quiet and calm
while plumes of smoke could be spotted , the @entity275 tanks seen earlier were not in sight
@entity290 told @entity2 that " tens " had been killed in @entity103 on saturday
he said @entity11 forces had withdrawn from the city and that they were positioned 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) outside @entity103
@entity2 could not independently verify those details
@entity11 -- in a separate letter addressed to @entity251 , @entity104 and @entity38 @entity296 ban ki - moon -- called the @entity38 moves " invalid " because the resolution does not permit intervention in the internal affairs of other countries
violence has raged in @entity1 following protests calling for democracy and freedom and demanding an end to @entity11 's almost 42 - year - long rule
it 's a conflict spurred by anti-government protest and resulting regime violence against civilians -- which the @entity38 resolution cites as " outrageous " and @entity251 calls " murderous madness
" @entity2 's @entity268 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 and @entity13 contributed to this report
