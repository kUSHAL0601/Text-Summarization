-- police are asking that the volunteer searches for three missing @entity4 brothers be stopped by friday night
local authorities and federal investigators have been trying to find 9 - year - old @entity7 , 7 - year - old @entity8 and 5 - year - old @entity9 last seen on @entity10
the end of the volunteer searches will allow authorities the opportunity to process what has been done and collected and to " re-evaluate our direction for the following week , " said @entity16 , police chief of @entity17 , @entity4
@entity18 , the boys ' father who has been charged with parental kidnapping , is fighting his extradition from @entity22 , authorities said wednesday
a hearing is set for december 14
@entity7 was arrested tuesday upon his release from a mental health facility where he was being treated after a suicide attempt , @entity16 said
although investigators have found " a number of items , " they still do not know the children 's whereabouts , @entity16 said
asked whether he believes that the boys are dead , @entity16 said wednesday , " i refuse to believe that at this point , " saying he wanted to maintain hope
he did , however , repeat his tuesday statement that a positive outcome is not anticipated
investigators have not spoken with @entity7 " in some time , " he said , or developed any additional information
he previously said authorities are skeptical of the information @entity7 has provided
@entity7 said he left the three boys with a woman , whom he identified as @entity44 , the morning before he tried to take his own life -- in part to ensure that they did not witness his suicide attempt
@entity7 said @entity44 was supposed to take the boys to their home in @entity17 , a southern @entity4 town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west - northwest of @entity52 , @entity22 , friday afternoon , @entity16 said
but the boys never arrived
earlier , authorities determined that @entity7 had no " established relationship " with the person he named as @entity44 , and they are n't certain that she even exists
authorities continue to ask for the public 's help , hoping someone saw @entity7 's blue 2000 @entity61 , in which he was believed to be carrying the boys along a 25 - mile stretch of road between @entity17 and @entity65 , @entity22
the last time someone other than a family member saw the boys was at 5 p.m. on november 25 , according to the chief
police say @entity9 is 3 feet , 6 inches tall with strawberry blond hair and blue eyes , and weighs about 40 pounds
@entity8 is 3 feet , 9 inches tall , has brown hair and eyes , weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin
the oldest brother , @entity79 , is 4 feet , 1 inch tall , has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds .
