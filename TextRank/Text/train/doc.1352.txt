-- @entity2 activist @entity1 says he 's done discussing the controversy stirred up by his attack on the @entity5 , accusing a fellow movement leader of turning the debate into " a @entity9 style personality conflict
" the @entity11 , an organization that seeks to represent the @entity2 political movement around the country , has expelled @entity1 and his @entity15 organization because of the inflammatory blog post @entity1 wrote last week , federation spokesman @entity10 said sunday
in response , @entity1 announced in another statement on his blog that , " i am refusing all media requests on this " and canceled a scheduled interview on @entity0 to discuss the controversy sunday evening , citing a last - minute change in travel plans
" that careless individual tea partier who assumed the mantel of ' leadership ' did so long enough to turn a critical and serious movement and delicate peace with skeptical groups into a @entity9 style personality conflict with me at the center , " @entity1 said
" there are internal political dramas amongst the various self - anointed @entity37 ' leaders , ' and some of the minor players on the fringes see the @entity15 and @entity1 as tickets to a booking on " @entity44 [ sic ] the @entity41
' " @entity10 appeared on the @entity46 program sunday morning to announce that @entity1 and the @entity15 -- which has held a series of events across the country to generate support for the movement -- no longer were part of the @entity11
" we , in the last 24 hours , have expelled @entity15 and @entity1 from the @entity11 because of the letter that he wrote , " @entity10 said of @entity1 ' blog post that satirized a fictional letter from what he called " @entity56 " to president @entity57
@entity5 president @entity61 met @entity1 ' statement by telling @entity0 , " good riddance , @entity1
" but he praised @entity2 activists like @entity10 , who is @entity65 , for standing up and " self - policing " their movement
" as the movement grows up , you have to act responsibly and they have to keep doing what they just did to @entity1 and make it clear there is no space for bigots here , period , " @entity61 said
@entity1 wrote the incendiary blog post in response to an @entity5 resolution that called on @entity2 leaders to crack down on racist elements in the movement
the 101 - year - old civil rights group cited signs carried at @entity2 events and racial slurs reportedly shouted at black members of @entity88 during the heated debate over health care as examples of racism in the movement
" dear mr. @entity57 , " began the fictional letter posted by @entity1
" we coloreds have taken a vote and decided that we do n't cotton to that whole emancipation thing
freedom means having to work for real , think for ourselves , and take consequences along with the rewards
that is just far too much to ask of us colored people and we demand that it stop ! " @entity1 went on to write that the @entity2 movement could n't be racist because it opposed government bailouts for @entity108 banks and big corporations
" bailouts are just big money welfare and is n't that what we want all @entity56 to strive for ? " the posting said
" what kind of racist would want to end big money welfare ? what they need to do is start handing the bailouts directly to us coloreds ! " @entity1 , a conservative talk radio host , said the post was intended as satire
he took it down as criticism mounted
some political leaders interviewed on sunday talk shows also said the @entity2 movement itself was n't racist , but needed to distance itself from any elements that bring prejudice and bigotry to its events
" there are some members who have used the @entity2 -- whether it 's the @entity2 itself , there are some individuals who have tried to exacerbate racial tensions in this country , " @entity133 majority leader @entity132 , @entity134 , said on @entity0 's " @entity135
" " i have seen some virulent fliers that have been directed at our members , clearly referencing race , the president 's race and race generally
" on the same show , however , senate minority leader @entity150 , @entity151 , steered clear of the issue , saying : " i am not interested in getting into that debate
