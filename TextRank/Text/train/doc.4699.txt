-- february 18 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 @entity8 , @entity9 transcript this is a @entity12
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity16 , @entity17 : one year after it became law , what is the reaction to the government 's stimulus program ? i 'm @entity25 , and this is @entity0 ! first up : stimulus one year later @entity28 : an absolute success that 's created or saved millions of jobs
a massive waste that has raised the country 's debt
two opinions on the very same subject : the @entity36
most folks just call it the stimulus plan
it was passed one year ago yesterday with a price tag of around $ 787 billion
that has since been re-estimated at $ 862 billion
the goal was to boost the country 's economy by cutting taxes and through government spending
and that is exactly what president @entity49 says the stimulus has done
@entity52 president @entity49 : one year later it is largely thanks to the @entity36 that a second depression is no longer a possibility
it 's one of the main reasons the economy has gone from shrinking by 6 percent to growing at about 6 percent
so far , the @entity36 is responsible for the jobs of about two million @entity52 who would otherwise be unemployed
@entity28 : but other people disagree
in a recent @entity0 poll , nearly three - quarters of the people surveyed think that at least half of the stimulus money spent so far has been wasted
earlier this week , @entity67 representative @entity67 , the @entity68 minority leader , said that people , " are n't getting their money 's worth from the trillion - dollar ' stimulus , ' and struggling families and small businesses are rightly asking ' where are the jobs ? ' " @entity78 @entity28 : so in your view , has the stimulus worked ? got a few comments for you
@entity83 is saying : " without it , we would be struggling in an even deeper recession
" from @entity87 : " what stimulus ? well , we have seen only more jobs cut and more schools closed in my state
" and @entity93 writes that " the process takes a long time , so maybe the key points just have n't been fully recognized
" what do you say ? blog with us from a to z at @entity99
@entity100 @entity28 : another story we are following for you today : @entity100 -- @entity104 carmaker -- says it 's going to hire more quality control workers , do more testing , and get an outside agency to help fix its cars ' problems
the news comes in the middle of a massive recall of more than 8 million @entity100 vehicles worldwide
problems include sudden acceleration brake pedal issues , and some new complaints -- @entity100 says fewer than a hundred -- involve the steering in some @entity120 , @entity100 's second-most popular model
later this month , the @entity122 is planning hearings to ask @entity100 about safety
the company says it will cooperate , and its president has repeatedly apologized
@entity127 , @entity129 president [ @entity130 ] : @entity100 is not perfect
but when we find a problem or are made aware of it , we act as quickly as possible
we are sincerely working on that
as vp @entity135 said , we never covered anything up or ignored any problems
i hope you understand this
@entity141 @entity28 : get your boarding pass
what ? that last one could be what some air travelers hear
the @entity148 is trying out a new safety check , scanning passengers ' hands for traces of explosives
experts say there 's a better chance of finding these kinds of materials if you check someone 's hands rather than checking baggage
the goal , of course , is to help increase airline security
the government says that part of the way it does that is by using different kinds of technology , like these hand swabs
a privacy expert says this policy should n't violate passengers ' privacy as long as the scans are conducted randomly
fast facts @entity179 , @entity17 : time for some fast facts ! @entity5 and the @entity181 make up the @entity183 island of @entity184
@entity185 controlled the island for a time , but @entity5 became a @entity188 colony in 1697
the nation gained its independence from @entity188 in 1804
today , @entity5 is home to about 9 million people , and its capital is @entity4
@entity193 @entity28 : @entity188 controlled @entity5 for more than a century , but this week marked the first time that a @entity188 president ever visited the country
@entity197 , whom you see on the left here , was in @entity5 yesterday
president @entity197 met with @entity5 leaders and toured some of the areas damaged by last month 's earthquake
the @entity188 president was expected to announce an aid program for @entity5 during his visit
this has been the scene at the airport in @entity4 : planes being used to bring in relief supplies
that could change on friday , though
@entity213 says it will start flying passenger planes into @entity5
all passenger flights were stopped after the quake hit
one company official said that offering transportation to and from the country will be a major step toward helping @entity5 rebuild
@entity5 @entity221 @entity28 : some @entity5 have already left the country ; they were evacuated to hospitals in the @entity52 one of them , a classical musician , had injuries that could have affected his career
but as @entity230 tells us , a gift from an @entity52 singer will help him keep making music
( begin video ) @entity234 , @entity0 correspondent : for 18 hours , @entity235 lay buried in the rubble of his music school in @entity4
for 18 hours until his rescue , the concert violinist stayed alert and alive going over in his head , one by one , every concerto at every concert hall he 'd ever played
his legs crushed , bones in his left hand shattered
but the concrete that covered him would not , could not kill him
@entity248 , violinist : i thought my time was up under the ground , and @entity252 says no , you have things to do
@entity255 : three weeks ago , we met @entity235 , who is legally blind , for the first time
he mentioned he 'd like a keyboard to help strengthen the fingers in his left hand so that some day he could again play the violin
@entity262 heard and answered @entity235 's request
@entity262 , @entity264 : what better way to really express our @entity252 's love than to give something that is special to you to someone else who is in need
so , that 's why i did what i did
@entity255 : wonder 's keyboard was packed and shipped , arriving tuesday at @entity6 's @entity277
@entity235 did n't know it was on the way
@entity280 : yes , sir
@entity255 : hey , @entity230 from @entity0
how are you ? @entity280 : oh , my goodness
@entity255 : it 's so good to see you again
i think we have something for you
@entity280 : oh , it came ? @entity255 : it came
it 's coming in the door right now
@entity280 : oh , my goodness
@entity255 : now , who sent this to you ? @entity262
@entity255 : as the keyboard was set up , @entity235 was carefully moved to a wheelchair
@entity297 : the chair is over here
@entity297 : so , i 'm going to have you go sideways
keep your legs on the bed
@entity255 : he sat over the keyboard , his legs , one held together with metal rods , resting on pillows
@entity280 : i 'll play something
@entity255 : he began to play
of course , a @entity262 song
even the fingers on his damaged left hand glided across the keys with a gentle touch
@entity235 will be out of the hospital soon
when that happens , he 'd like nothing more than to play a concert for @entity5
he on the violin and @entity262 on the keyboard
@entity280 : i mean , you know , nothing is impossible
( @entity326 ) @entity327 @entity328 , @entity17 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity331 's @entity330 at @entity332 in @entity333 , @entity334 ! how far above the @entity336 's surface is the international space station ? is it : a ) 100 miles , b ) 250 miles , c ) 375 miles or @entity340 ) 1,000 miles ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the international space station orbits the @entity336 from an altitude of about 250 miles
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! room with a view @entity28 : the astronauts on that station have a brand new window to the world -- seven of them , actually
it 's a new part of the @entity354 that was installed during a spacewalk yesterday , the third and last planned spacewalk of space shuttle @entity358 's mission to the international space station
you can see the window covers opening up here
they 're on a cupola , the top part of a new section of the iss. and this is the view it gives : @entity336 from 250 miles up
that center window is about 32 inches across
the cupola , designed to give astronauts a better view of spacewalks and other activities outside the @entity354 @entity374 @entity28 : well , the big night is tonight
i will be live on @entity374 , 7:00 p.m. eastern , 4:00 p.m. @entity376 , answering your questions
log on and ask away ! the address : @entity381 / @entity380
before we go @entity28 : before we go , this might qualify as a half - baked idea
everything seems calm at first , but then -- please , y'all , there 's enough cake to go around
there 's actually a matrimonial method to this madness
that is because one of these lucky ladies ended the day with a proposal : her boyfriend using the ring that she found in that cake
it 's valued at around $ 3,100 , which makes this a true karat cake
goodbye @entity28 : finding the ring is awesome
the on - the - spot proposal , just the frosting on the cake
@entity0 returns tomorrow , but we hope to hear from you tonight at @entity374 ! i 'm @entity25 .
