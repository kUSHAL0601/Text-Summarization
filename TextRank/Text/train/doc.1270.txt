-- here 's a snapshot of @entity3 's defining experiences : beaches , cities , and food and wine
get a sense of which ones fit your travel style and your budget
@entity14 beaches dot @entity3 's rugged coastline
find a secluded beach the @entity17 , southern @entity3 's balmy riviera , sees nothing but blue sky 300 days of the year
admire the ocean views from the roof terrace at @entity23 , in the whitewashed old center of @entity25 , just a block from the beach
rooms are simple , but all have private terraces , and the price includes a generous breakfast buffet and afternoon cake ( doubles from $ 65 )
the most dramatic coastline is along the drive to the medieval fortress town of @entity36
( cars can be rented for around $ 30 a day in @entity25 ; book online with companies like @entity39
) between @entity41 and @entity42 do @entity43 , the cliffs have been broken by the wind and sea into jagged rock formations pierced by blowholes and grottoes
secret half - moon bays of golden sand lie hidden from view from all but the ocean
an hour beyond @entity36 is @entity54 's southwesternmost point : @entity56 @entity55 , a cape whose plunging cliffs are dotted with crumbling medieval churches and castles
more than 500 years ago , @entity3 sailing ships left to explore the world from these shores
there 's great hiking in the fragrant pine woods and peach orchards less than 20 miles inland , around the spa town of @entity69 -- a cluster of tiny houses and 18th - century mansions tumbling down a steep , wooded valley
the trail up to the @entity75 peak has magnificent views out over the coast all the way to the cape
families from @entity82 take weekends on the beaches of @entity85 , less than 20 miles from the capital
there they jostle for space on three broad , short beaches and wander , ice cream in hand , along the ocean esplanade or the clusters of narrow streets crowded around the town 's imposing fort
for wilder , lonelier sand , head to @entity98 , four miles west
this sweeping , gently curved shoreline is pounded by some of the best surf in the eastern @entity102
an almost constant wind makes for superb windsurfing ; a world championship is hosted here most augusts
but watch out for those rips and prepare for cold water
while the @entity17 is good for swimming from spring to autumn , you 'll need a wet suit around @entity85 for all but the summer months
the town is easily reached from @entity82 ; trains leave from @entity114 station every 15 minutes and take just over half an hour ( $ 4.50 round trip )
but if you choose to stay , take a room at the @entity117 , a 16th - century manor in a quiet @entity85 backstreet ( doubles from $ 30 )
there 's a pocket - size former @entity122 on the hotel grounds
@entity124 at opulent chapels and palaces @entity82 spreads in terra - cotta and cobblestone over seven hills , staring out over the @entity130 to the shimmering @entity102
a rugged @entity132 castle tops the skyline , and the streets are lined with baroque churches and @entity137 art nouveau buildings
@entity138 coach : friends explore @entity82 and beyond allow at least three days for a first visit , and make time for the @entity143
extravagantly decorated doorways lead through long cloisters to a church supported by pillars adorned with stone ropes and coils of faux seaweed
these rise to a fan - vaulted ceiling whose thousands of tons of stone somehow look light and airy
many @entity3 notables are buried at this monastery , including @entity159 , author of @entity3 's national epic , @entity161 , and the explorer @entity163
the @entity164 is one of the world 's great small museums
oil magnate @entity164 acquired a huge collection of @entity170 , @entity54 and @entity171 artifacts and @entity173 art , which was brought to @entity82 after his death
highlights include intricate @entity177 jewelry , opulent @entity132 carpets and tapestries , paintings by @entity181 and @entity182 , and an extensive collection of @entity185 's art nouveau glassware
finish your day with a late afternoon 's wander around the narrow , cobbled streets of the @entity190 neighborhood on a cliff overlooking the 18th - century city center
there 's a pretty medieval square or a magnificent church at every turn
the most beautiful is the @entity197 , whose simple exterior hides what was said at the time to be the most expensive chapel ever built -- a feast of rich gold work and beguilingly complex mosaics of lapus lazuli , ivory , agate , and precious metals
built in @entity210 in 1742 , it was blessed by the @entity211 before being transported in its entirety to @entity82
it 's an easy day trip from @entity82 to @entity215 , a former royal retreat in cool forested hills near the coast
it looks like a @entity221 fantasy : pastel tiered castles crown the hilltops ; faux - @entity132 domed palaces lie hidden in wooded gardens ; and extravagant , neo-gothic mansions loom at the top of steep driveways
the grandest of all is the @entity230 , rebuilt by @entity3 's half - mad @entity232 king - consort in the late 18th century ( park and palace admission $ 14 )
it 's a fascinating mishmash of @entity240 colonnades , @entity236 / oriental turrets and windows painted in garish pinks and yellows
the interior of the building is preserved as it was when royalty fled during the 1910 revolt -- down to the tables set for dinner and the lamp - stand statues of turbaned @entity250 holding light bulbs
sample robust wines and fresh fish every small @entity3 town has its own wine , traditional cakes and cheeses
in the @entity259 , cheeses are curdled with thistle flowers and washed down with rich , earthy red wines
base yourself in @entity264 , a city founded by the @entity177 , expanded by the @entity265 and enriched by the @entity3 kings
each group left its monuments ; the cork forests and vineyards around the city are strewn with @entity273 dolmens , for example
about 150 miles north , in the mountainous @entity276 region , is the village of @entity278 , famous for its red wines and vanilla - flavored cavaca candies -- invented by nuns from the local convents in the @entity284
@entity278 is a delightful maze of winding streets and makes a great base for hiking in the nearby park land , @entity289 , or for visiting the @entity290 , where rock faces are inscribed with @entity293 art. the @entity294 flows out of @entity295 into a deep valley stepped with some of @entity54 's oldest vine terraces
port wine comes from here , together with some of @entity3 's heartiest reds
the @entity301 is easily seen on a boat cruise from @entity42 , a destination in its own right
here stands one of the largest collections of @entity173 buildings in the @entity273
every other corner leads to a little baroque church whose modest façade hides an interior encrusted with tons of gold
winding streets in the city 's medieval center lead down the hillside to the river
wander along the quays in @entity322 across from @entity42 city and drop in on the various port wine warehouses for free samples
it 's a great way to decide what kind to bring home as a gift
cap off your day with dinner on the banks of the @entity294 at @entity333
the house specialties are bacalhau ( salted cod served steamed or in little deep fried crispy balls ) , followed by pork fillets with clams or hake au gratin with seafood sauce
@entity343 is widely spoken , and it 's always more welcome than @entity295 , which might even produce a scowl
@entity3 and @entity295 have an age - old rivalry
visitors trying to speak a few words of @entity3 will make many friends
in the @entity17 , everyone sees the ocean from the beaches
but it 's just as much fun seeing the beaches from the ocean
book an afternoon boat trip out of @entity358 with one of the numerous agents on the @entity361 and be sure to take a camera to capture the golden afternoon light on the crumbling cliffs
@entity3 can be a difficult country for vegetarians
even vegetable soup is cooked with meat stock
be sure to state clearly that you do n't eat any meat or fish -- even as seasoning
for the coolest night out in @entity82 , head to co-owner @entity375 's waterfront warehouse club , @entity376 , which is always packed with the most fashionable crowd on a friday or saturday night
@entity82 has some of the liveliest @entity379 music in @entity54 ; terrific @entity380 , @entity381 and @entity383 singers make the city home
the hottest acts play at the @entity388 nights at @entity389 ( from $ 20 )
for schedules of @entity392 concerts all over @entity82 , e-mail bleza21@gmail.com
@entity3 is a great country for driving
small distances and an excellent and well - signposted road network mean that it 's never a long journey to the next place of interest
and the whole country can be driven from north to south in a little over a day
but beware of @entity3 drivers
hugging the fender and flashing headlamps furiously on the highway is common practice -- as is reckless passing
@entity3 is great for kids
@entity82 has a huge aquarium , and the dolphin and seal shows at the @entity411 on the @entity17 are some of the best in @entity54
there are swimming pools and restaurants here , so you can stay for the whole day ( adults $ 14 )
timing @entity3 is sweltering in the summer ( june through august ) and very busy with @entity54 tourists
the spring ( april through may ) and autumn ( september through october ) are cooler , just as sunny and far less busy
the winter ( november through march ) is wet and cold
