@entity1 president @entity0 on monday night put the country 's southwest region on the highest possible security alert level , hours after a teacher and three children were gunned down at a @entity8 school in @entity9
the incident at the @entity12 school marked the third time in the past 10 days that a gunman on a motorcycle has fired on minorities in the region
on monday , the teacher was shot dead with his two children , while the school 's director saw his daughter shot and killed in front of him , @entity0 said in a somber speech at the school
the president then returned to @entity26 and addressed the violence again in an evening speech from the @entity29
@entity1 troops were present on streets , at train stations and at other highly trafficked locales in parts of southwestern @entity1 before monday 's shooting , as that region had been on a high alert level for years
@entity0 made a point in his monday night speech to note that @entity1 's security measures for the area will remain high
he also said that he 'll suspend his re-election campaign until at least wednesday , in the wake of the shooting
representatives from @entity1 's @entity8 and @entity47 communities will meet with the president tuesday , when a moment of silence is being planned to remember the victims , according to @entity0
one of the guns used monday was also used in killings of @entity1 soldiers of north @entity55 origin who were shot and killed on march 11 and march 15 , said @entity56 , a spokeswoman for judicial authorities in @entity26
a court in @entity26 on monday opened an investigation into all three killings , under anti-terrorism powers

the dead included a 3 - year - old child , and a 17 - year - old was wounded , according to local prosecutor @entity69
the gunman got close enough to his victims to shoot them in the head , local journalist @entity70 said
in the shooting 's aftermath , families hugged and wept in front of police cars around the school
ambulances and police vans lined the narrow streets of the city , and a helicopter circled overhead as police on foot made their way through the small crowd of shocked locals to get to the building
speaking from the school , @entity0 declared that " everything must be done so the killer is arrested
" " and of course our thoughts are with these families that are shattered -- a mother who has lost her husband and her two children the same day ; the director of the school saw his little girl die before his eyes , " @entity0 said
the gunman wore a motorcycle helmet and fled on a motor scooter after the shootings , @entity105 spokesman @entity104 said -- the same method used in the earlier soldiers ' shootings
" it 's a horrible tragedy , " he said of monday 's shootings
the @entity105 has ordered police across the country to contact @entity8 organizations to arrange increased vigilance , @entity104 said
@entity1 , which has one of the largest @entity8 populations in @entity121 , had 389 reported acts of @entity123 in 2011 , according to representative @entity124 in @entity1 , known by the @entity1 acronym @entity127
its head , @entity129 , and minister of education @entity130 accompanied @entity0 to @entity9
the group later issued a statement saying that , while it is too early to determine definitively the motive for the " horrible " crime , it appears it 's a case of @entity123
it called for increased security at places of worship and study as the investigation continues
@entity141 , the chief rabbi of @entity1 , said he was " horrified " and " upset
" and @entity1 presidential candidate @entity142 said he felt " horror " over the killing
it comes directly on the heels of two other shootings
the first was march 11 , when @entity9 police capt. @entity149 said a soldier was on his motorbike when a helmeted man on another motorcycle shot and killed him
the soldier was not in uniform , and his motorbike did not have any military identification , @entity149 said
2 @entity1 soldiers killed in shooting on thursday , two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black - clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in the southwestern @entity1 city of @entity164 , about 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) from @entity9
@entity1 authorities link soldiers ' fatal shooting the more recent shooting caught the world 's attention , soliciting immediate and strong reaction from @entity8 and other leaders -- many of them thousands of miles away from the @entity1 crime scene
" today , @entity8 everywhere in the world are weeping in sorrow and disgust in the face of this despicable terrorist attack , " said @entity175 , president of the @entity176
" targeting children is a particularly sick and vile act , and nothing can justify it
" @entity187 's prime minister @entity186 called it a " savage crime " and said anti-semitism could not be ruled out as a motive
" we follow with shock the news coming from @entity1 , and we trust the @entity1 authorities to shed full light on this crime and to bring those responsible to justice , " said @entity191 , the spokesman for the @entity187 foreign ministry
@entity199 heightened in @entity201 synagogues police in @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 all said they plan to increase patrols of synagogues and @entity8 institutions , with @entity203 police commissioner @entity209 citing fears someone might stage a " copy - cat " attack
but he and the city 's mayor stressed there is no " specific " intelligence indicating an active threat there
" just because there 's something that happens there , does n't mean there are more threats here
but we take everything very seriously , " said mayor @entity225
@entity228 , national director of the @entity203 - based @entity229 , said that @entity8 people had just as much reason to be vigilant before monday 's attack as after , given some people 's anti-semitism
he said he was " shocked , saddened but unfortunately not surprised " by the @entity9 shooting , which he felt was " targeted to express hatred against @entity8
" " you hope and pray that it does n't happen more often , " @entity228 told @entity238 on monday night
" unfortunately , you know that it 's part of the reality
( some ) people will act out their hatred in a violent manner
