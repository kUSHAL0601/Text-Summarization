-- the posts show how quickly life can change
" @entity3 dressing up as @entity4 , im going dressed as @entity4 ... albeit a short stubby unsexy @entity4 # @entity8 , " wrote one @entity6 user , identified online as @entity7
" going to see the final batman tonight ! so excited ! ! ! " wrote another @entity6 user , @ @entity11
and , in hindsight , most chillingly : " of course we 're seeing @entity16 ... people should never argue with me
" gunman kills 12 in @entity19 theater shooting those posts surfaced before the shootings early friday morning at a late - night showing in @entity22 , @entity19 , of the @entity4 movie " @entity25 , " in which 12 people were killed and dozens more were injured
all three people who were quoted above appear to have been in the theater complex when a heavily armed gunman opened fire on moviegoers , according to police
the third post appears to be from @entity33 , who was reported dead in the shooting
@entity33 was a former sports - news intern at a television station in @entity37 , according to that station , @entity39 29
" it 's true , my former intern @entity33 was a victim in the shootings last night
she used @ @entity43 as her twitter handle , " wrote a @entity6 user identified as @entity45
in the hours after the shooting , her friend mourned her death in real time
" devastated , " wrote a sports radio host in @entity51 , identified online as @entity52
" lost a very close friend in the shooting last night
@ @entity43 came to @entity51 to pursue sports career
" aspiring sports reporter @entity33 feared dead in shooting the horrifying posts highlight a shift in the way our society tells the story of a tragedy , and also how we react to it
before @entity6 , smartphones and @entity67 , it would have been impossible for an event like @entity19 's " @entity69 " to have played out for the global public in real time
the shooting is just the latest instance of social media being used to document a tragedy or a news event even as it is unfolding
a @entity78 man last year unwittingly live - tweeted the raid that killed @entity80
and the war in @entity82 is being documented in large part by citizens and members of the opposition movement who risk their lives to post @entity67 videos and photos of the violence
@entity94 tweeter was ' unaware ' of @entity19 shooting , spokesman says but the social media posts about the @entity19 shooting are a haunting reminder of the visceral power of first - person accounts of tragedy
and also a sign that society these days deals with grieving after an event like this in a much more public and immediate way than in years past
reports of the 1999 @entity110 , for example , which happened only 17 miles from @entity22 , spread in a much different way
thirteen years ago , witnesses talked to tv crews rather than uploading their stories instantly to the internet with mobile phones
shooting turns movie into surreal horror : ' this is real ' some reports from the @entity22 movie theater appeared to come out as the shooting occurred
" now i 'm thinking it was bullets coming through the wall from 9 causing smoke and fire cracker sounds
# aurorashooting @entity131 , " a @entity6 user identified as @entity130 wrote
" never seen so many cop cars in my life
its a parade of lights , " wrote @entity134
" everything keeps replaying in my head
it was so unreal , " @ @entity141 wrote
" i am getting ready to cry
i almost got shot 9 times
i had a chance to be like 50 , " wrote another @entity6 user , @ @entity145
he later added : " i seen a person bleeding out their mouth and gasping for their last breath
thunk the world is ending
" shaky @entity67 videos show people screaming , crying and rushing out of the theater after the shooting , some of them with bloody wounds
another video , apparently taken outside the building by a person who was in the theater next to the shooting , offers a glimpse into the mindset of a person who has just witnessed tragedy
the amateur videographer sounds to be at a loss for words
@entity176 16 , " he says , in a sort of real - time confessional about the event
" there has been a massive shooting here
a lot of people wounded , a lot of people dead
i ca n't really take pictures , just because i 'd rather ( be ) helping people than wanting to take pictures of some pretty ghastly ( expletive )
there 's some guy in a gas mask apparently -- teargassed theater 9
we were in theater 8
it hit a lot of people , a lot of younger people
it 's pretty -- it 's pretty bad
" timeline of worst mass shootings in @entity203 officials also turned to the internet in an effort to make sense of the events
the @entity209 is asking people who witnessed the shooting to tell loved ones that they were ok over social media sites like @entity215 and @entity6
" people do n't know how close you were , so help alleviate that anxiety , " spokeswoman @entity216 told @entity217
and other officials used the @entity205 to offer sympathy
" we certainly appreciate the nation 's thoughts and prayers as our police department continues to investigate the terrible theater shooting tragedy that occurred today , " the city of @entity22 wrote on its @entity215 page
" our condolences go out to the victims and their family members
" are you there ? share your story with us on @entity237 and post your tributes to the victims
@entity0 's @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .
