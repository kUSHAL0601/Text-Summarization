-- last year @entity1 sold out two consecutive nights at @entity4 's famed @entity3 , a venue that most standup comedians aspire to at some point in their career
for @entity1 , who took the arena 's stage as part of his global @entity13 , which also filled @entity16 ' @entity15 and @entity18 's @entity17 , the occasion was so momentous that it deserved its own film
the comedian , along with directors @entity20 and @entity22 , used the performance as the centerpiece of his new movie , " @entity1 : let me explain , " which opens in theaters wednesday
although largely a standup movie , " @entity13 " is framed with a fictional intro where @entity1 is inundated with a barrage of questions about his life and career -- all of which he determines to answer onstage at @entity3
this opening offers the comedian an opportunity to showcase the worldwide aspect of the @entity39 before eventually revealing his entire standup set
the comedian , who has numerous feature films in the works and recently made a brief appearance in the apocalyptic comedy " @entity52 , " spoke with @entity0 in a suite at the @entity49 @entity48 the day of the movie 's premiere
@entity1 , clad in sunglasses to veil his exhaustion , recounted the process of creating " @entity13 , " why he got so emotional onstage at @entity3 and how he might be the busiest person alive
@entity0 : when you were filming your let me explain comedy tour last year , was the intention always to make it into a feature film ? @entity1 : yes
i was n't sure of the direction i wanted to take the movie in , but i just knew i wanted to document everything i was doing that year because it was so much , especially the world tour aspect of it
it was just putting camera crews in place to capture absolutely everything that we did and at the end of it just put the pieces of the puzzle i had in my head together
it all came together well
but as we were going along i tracked it and i knew the pieces i had , and it was just tying them together
@entity0 : how did you come up with the idea for how the movie is framed ? @entity1 : i need a segue into the documentary aspect of [ the movie ] and the best way to do that , i felt , was to jokingly address what 's been happening to me for the past two years
everybody coming up to me asking questions , and when i go to answer it they tell me what their answer is
you do n't allow me to tell them what 's going on -- you tell me what you think you know because you 've heard things about me
it was a different way to open a standup film and i 'm all about being different and trying to break ground with original ideas
@entity0 : do you legitimately feel like you have to explain yourself ? @entity1 : yes and no. at the end of the day your fans are the people who support you in and out
as a celebrity you can try to say you do n't care and say , " this is my life , i do n't live for other people " all you want
we have no obligation to do things for our fans , but my feeling is that we do n't get to where we are or get what we get without the support of our fans
so if there 's questions going around that your fans have because of things that they 've heard , i think you do owe it to them to address it
@entity0 : at the end of the movie you get really emotional about being in @entity3
what does it mean to you to perform in a venue like that ? @entity1 : you 're looking at me achieving a goal that i did n't think was achievable
i 'm sure everyone knows now that only a few have performed in @entity3
that list is so small
now i 'm on that list
i 'm a part of a very small group , which is unbelievable
you relish in that moment for a second
when i did that onstage it choked me up because i genuinely thought about what i 've accomplished and where i was and what i did to get here
and now that i 'm here , the sky 's the limit
i 'm in love with this , with making people laugh
and the fact that i had this venue to do it in was crazy
@entity0 : now that you 've conquered @entity3 , do you have a new goal you 're aiming to achieve ? is there even a bigger venue you could play ? @entity1 : i have no idea where you go next
no idea ! i 'm scared
@entity0 : do you approach standup in the same way you would approach a movie or tv role ? @entity1 : i do n't approach it like it 's a movie role
i genuinely love doing standup and i 'm a comedian first , so for me what makes my standup special is the fact that i do n't have to adapt or adjust
i am who i am
i appeal to everyone , hence in the movie doing a world tour
i 'm not changing , i 'm not adjusting my voice , i 'm not changing my speed and the way that i talk
so i think the prep for that is me just enjoying what i do
@entity0 : when you talk about your family and your kids in your standup , is that coming from a personal place ? @entity1 : personal place
the motivation is wanting to put myself out there so people can see that i 'm genuine and i 'm real
what you see is what you get
i 'm not trying to be someone else
@entity0 : what else do you have coming up beyond " @entity13 ? " @entity1 : i have like five movies coming out
everything will be out in 2014 and 2015
i think i 'm getting the opportunity to play the kind of character i 'm interested in now
the movie " @entity207 , " starring @entity206 and myself , is an action comedy and i 'm doing everything i ever wanted to do in the film
[ i also have ] " @entity211 , " which is a remake of the original , starring @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and myself , and " @entity216 , " which stars @entity218 and @entity219
i 'm about to do one with @entity220 [ and ] i 'm about to do one with @entity221
i 'm sure i 'm forgetting one
@entity0 : and you were just cast in the new @entity225 movie as well , right ? @entity1 : yeah ! my part , from what i understand , is i 'm playing an assistant
i have n't read the newest draft that came in
but it 's a funny reveal cameo he asked me to do
@entity0 : what 's the status of the second season of your tv show " @entity237 ? " @entity1 : that will be in its third season
the second season starts premiering , i think , in september or october , and that 's probably when we 'll start shooting [ the third season ]
@entity0 : what does your average day look like ? @entity1 : no sleep ! right now i 'm probably going on 27 hours awake
so my days are hectic
once i 'm done with this today i go to @entity248
after that i go to the premiere
i got to introduce the premiere
then i get on a plane and i fly to @entity252
i land and i go straight to the set and i 'm shooting until 4 a.m. it 's ridiculously crazy
at some point i 'm just going to shut down
i do n't know when it 's going to happen today , but someone 's going to stop talking to me and i 'm going to be asleep
once i stop talking it 's all over .
