-- february 25 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : northeastern @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated
@entity15 , @entity16 : i 'm @entity18 , and today , @entity0 is taking you to school ! middle school , high school , college : all of them in today 's show
first up , though , we 're heading to the hill
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : @entity28 , where a @entity30 committee is holding hearings on @entity26 recalls
yesterday , the company 's president , @entity33 , explained what he thinks is the reason for some of the company 's recent problems
@entity33 , @entity41 president : @entity26 has , for the past few years , been expanding its business rapidly
quite frankly , i fear the pace at which we have grown may have been too quick
i would like to point out here that @entity26 's priority has traditionally been the following : first , safety ; second , quality ; third , volume
these priorities became confused , and we were not able to stop , think and make improvements as much as we were able to before
and our basic stance to listen to customers ' voices to make better products has weakened somewhat
@entity27 : mr. @entity33 says he 's committed to restoring his company 's reputation
some people have blamed the @entity4 government for not acting sooner
but transportation secretary @entity62 says that is not the case
@entity62 , @entity4 transportation secretary : we have n't been sitting around on our hands
when people complain , we investigate
when there needs to be a recall , we do it
of the 100 investigations @entity74 opens in an average year , there are currently 44 open defect investigations , 5 of which involve @entity26
every step of the way , @entity74 officials have pushed @entity26 to take corrective action so that consumers would be safe
economic outlook @entity27 : meantime , a different committee was hearing @entity86 chairman @entity85 's outlook on the country 's economy
@entity85 heads up the nation 's central bank
he says the @entity4 economy is getting better , but he does n't expect it to grow too much this year ; only about 3 to 3.5 percent
he 's also worried about the job market
@entity85 says it 's still very weak
unemployment is around 9.7 percent
he predicts that 'll drop to around 7 percent , but not until the end of 2012
that statistic might get some help from a new jobs bill being considered by @entity99
the @entity100 approved a $ 15 billion version yesterday
senate majority leader @entity102 called it a " small but important step " in trying to pass a jobs bill
but some critics say the @entity100 's proposal would n't do nearly enough
word to the @entity109 @entity110 , @entity16 : a word to the @entity109 ... nor'easter ( noun ) a type of storm with extremely strong winds , which can produce heavy rain and cause powerful waves nor'easter @entity27 : a nor'easter is what 's on the radar for parts of the @entity4 experts think it could bring rain , snow , heavy winds
and these are areas that have already been hammered by severe winter weather
as you might guess , a nor'easter affects the northeast part of the country
but that 's not where the name comes from
@entity140 , @entity141 : @entity18 , we 'll talk about nor'easter because of the way the wind comes in with the storm
the wind literally comes from the @entity148
we talk about winds ; we talk about a @entity151 wind
a west wind comes from the @entity151
a @entity148 wind comes from the @entity148
and that 's the storm , that 's the wind that picks up all the moisture and dumps it right here in the form of snow across @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162
some spots , before this all stops , with blizzard - like conditions , will have 24 - 36 inches of snow
another big storm for the @entity148 , and people digging out again , @entity18
hero teacher @entity27 : thanks , @entity171
@entity172 is being hailed as a hero
he 's a math teacher who tackled a gunman who opened fire at a middle school on tuesday
the suspect is in custody
two students were wounded in the attack
they were both treated at a nearby hospital
all this happened at @entity183 in @entity5 , @entity6
that is the same town where , eleven years ago , two gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher at @entity188
after that incident , many schools across the nation , maybe even yours , started having emergency drills
mr. @entity172 says that a promise he made during those led to his actions yesterday
@entity197 , @entity183 math teacher : whenever we had had these drills and whenever we had worked with students , i said basically , if something happens and there is something i can do about it , i want to try and do something about it
webcam spying ? @entity27 : around the @entity4 , technology is being used to help education
some schools let you take laptops home
one @entity162 high school included a security measure to protect against the computers being stolen
but a student at the school says the way the technology was used was a violation of his privacy
@entity223 has the details on that
( begin video ) @entity227 , @entity0 correspondent : this is high school sophomore @entity229
his school issued him and more than 2,000 other students laptops for their studies
what the students and families did n't know was that school officials had installed software that could turn on the laptop 's camera without notice , without warning and watch them
before @entity246 knew it , he found himself in the assistant principal 's office at @entity162 's @entity249 , accused , he says , of pushing drugs
@entity229 , @entity251 : i could n't say anything because she was accusing me of selling drugs
i could n't fight back , but i thought that this was terrible , how could they do this ? @entity259 , @entity246 's mom : she said that she had pictures of @entity246 that were taken on his computer of him holding up little , what she thought were pills
@entity266 : how could the school have seen what @entity246 was doing ? we set up a web camera in our office to show you how this all works
this is my laptop and it has a web camera built in to it
that tiny hole right there ? that 's the camera
so , all anyone has to do , whether they 're sitting a few feet away or maybe even hundreds of miles away , is click a button to record everything i 'm doing in front of this web camera
that 's exactly what @entity246 's parents say the school district did
they say the school remotely accessed his computer without his knowledge and snapped a photo of him
@entity246 's family is suing
@entity297 robbins : it was an invasion of privacy ; it was as if we had a @entity301 in our house
@entity266 : the @entity303 is investigating to see if wiretap or computer intrusion laws were violated
the school district says in the last fourteen months , 42 laptops were reported missing or stolen , 18 of them recovered
a spokesman for the school district told @entity0 they would only remotely access the laptop if it had been reported stolen or missing so they could find out who was using it
but @entity246 's parents say his computer had not been reported missing or stolen
if that 's true , why was anyone from the school accessing the camera ? the school district says these are just allegations , and " the district never did and never would use such tactics as a basis for disciplinary action
" in fact , it insists no school administrators could even access the cameras ; only two people in the technology department
a letter from the superintendent admits " ... there was no explicit notification that the laptop contained the security software
this notice should have been given and we regret that was not done
" now , school officials say the web camera security feature has been completely disabled
as for @entity246 and those so - called " pills " he says the school thought he was holding on camera , his mom claims they were candy ! ( @entity348 ) tuition soars @entity27 : all right
we 've covered a story about a middle school about a high school ; it 's time for college
getting there might take more money than ever before
( begin video ) @entity27 : the cost of going to college is skyrocketing
the @entity362 expects to raise tuition by 30 percent for the 2010 - 2011 school year
of course , it 's in a state that has a $ 20 billion budget deficit
but this increase in college costs is something that 's expected nationwide
from @entity371 to @entity372 to @entity373 , public universities are estimating hikes of between 10 and 15 percent
the reason : what else ? the recession
public schools get some of their money from states
states have less money to give , since they 're already in debt
so , schools have to make up their deficits by charging students more
it 's still a lot less expensive to attend a public college , though
average cost this school year for a public university : around $ 7,000
for a private school : more than $ 26,000
what 's interesting about all this is that there 's still more demand for education ; college enrollment continues to climb
for schools , that could be good news : they 'll be likely to get more of the money they need
for students , well , there 's always financial aid , student loans , and the value of a college degree
( @entity348 ) before we go @entity27 : before we go , a story that might warm your heart , and your toes , and the toes of about 200 other people
it is the world 's longest blanket ! this thing just keeps on going
more than 450 feet long ! it 's on display in @entity8 right now
that 's where it was made
then , the behemoth blanket will weave its way around the country
and finally , it 'll either be sold or divvied up and donated to charity
goodbye @entity27 : we wish there was more to tell you , but that pretty much covers it
