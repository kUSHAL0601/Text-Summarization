-- a cache of e-mails leaked to @entity0 is giving extraordinary insight into the life of @entity6 's first family during the regime 's move to crush a now - yearlong civilian uprising
the e-mails were obtained by @entity0 's " @entity11 " from a source in the region after the e-mail accounts were hacked
they appear to shed light on a family often occupied with @entity19 videos and shopping while the brutal crackdown continued , and they also apparently reveal some of @entity24 's influence over @entity6 's president
just before @entity27 delivered a speech january 10 , an aide apparently e-mailed him , saying a political adviser to the @entity24 ambassador was encouraging @entity27 to use " strong and violent " language
in that speech , @entity27 then promised to strike the opposition with an " iron fist
" there are also e-mails from a man named @entity37 , who -- according to his @entity39 page -- is the @entity40 bureau chief for two @entity24 news networks
@entity42 twice offers advice to the president 's aide , who passes it on to @entity27
on christmas eve , @entity37 apparently wrote to an @entity27 aide that @entity48 should not be blamed for a recent attack
" i even received calls from @entity24 and @entity52 , being the director of several @entity24 and @entity55 channels , and they advised me not to even mention @entity48 being behind the incident ... because this would be a serious tactical media error , " @entity37 wrote , according to the e-mail
december 24 was the day @entity6 troops began their onslaught on the @entity61 neighborhood in @entity61 , according to activists
the next day , an apparent e-mail from @entity37 said his " friends " in the city reported armed people in front of every door were threatening residents and forcing them to protest
the next day , with @entity70 monitors on the ground in @entity6 , @entity37 apparently e-mailed the same aide that @entity6 supporters needed to make sure opposition members did not turn out in large numbers in public
" we need to take control of public squares during this period , " he wrote
" at the same time , groups affiliated with us will fill the squares ... so we do n't leave them open for others , since the opposition is getting ready to move with the presence of the monitors
in this case , we will block their way and ( prevent them ) from reaching any square
" @entity0 has tried to reach @entity37 to ask about the authenticity of the e-mails but so far has received no response
however , @entity24 's state - run @entity94 reported @entity37 denied the correspondence , and accused @entity97 media of making up the story
" i am only a journalist and head of @entity94 and @entity100 news channels offices in @entity40 , " he was quoted as saying
the monitors stayed in @entity6 for several weeks , visiting various cities and towns as they tried to assess whether the government was upholding its commitment to end the crackdown
shortly after the monitors ' arrival in late december , an apparently amused @entity27 sent one of his closest advisers a @entity19 video that mocked a theory the regime had hidden tanks during the monitors ' visit
" check out this video on @entity19 , " @entity27 wrote on december 29 , according to the e-mail
the reply in @entity120 : " @entity121 , @entity122 ! ! ! this is amazing ! " some of the most interesting insights in the @entity27 e-mails are personal
in november , as the @entity6 military ramped up its attack on @entity61 , first lady @entity126 seemed more concerned with the latest " @entity130 " dvd , apparently asking a friend to bring the movie when she comes for a visit
the first lady in the past year also seems to have spent much of her time online shopping for expensive jewelry , art , and furniture , and e-mailing boutiques in @entity140 and @entity141
in one e-mail exchange with an art dealer in @entity140 , @entity126 , apparently using a false name , inquires about six artworks that all feature butterflies
the dealer responds that the works cost between Â £ 5,000 and Â £ 10,500 ( $ 7,800 and $ 16,500 )
the art inquiry was sent october 28 , the same day @entity6 protesters staged a massive demonstration in the city of @entity153 , in which they called for an end to @entity27 's rule
on february 3 -- the same day opposition activists reported more than 200 killed in the " @entity61 massacre , " and a day before the @entity158 was scheduled to meet on @entity6 -- the first lady apparently e-mails a friend asking whether she should reserve @entity162 shoes costing as much as $ 7,000 a pair
" these are really iconic pieces for @entity166 and some fabulous styles , " the e-mail says
two days later , mortars and rockets rained down on @entity61 after the @entity158 failed to pass a resolution aimed at stemming the violence
that same day , president @entity27 apparently e-mailed his wife the lyrics and audio file to a song by @entity182 country singer @entity181 with the words , " @entity173 gave me you for the ups and downs / @entity173 gave me you for the days of doubt
" one of @entity27 's advisers apparently sent an e-mail containing a picture of a woman wearing only a g - string and a bra
other e-mails contain suggestions for @entity27 's speeches and indicate further influence by @entity24
@entity194 should use " emotional " language about @entity197 " martyrs , " wrote a female aide named @entity199 , who said she consulted with a number of people , including a political adviser to the @entity24 ambassador
he should " send a huge invitation to the families of the martyrs so it seems like a celebration , " the e-mail said , and " have one of the widows of the martyrs make a strong statement on behalf of the families
" in a december 1 e-mail , @entity199 urged @entity27 to use tough language in his speeches
" threaten @entity216 and show our power as a country and a people in case our security is threatened ( standing in the face of anyone who wants evil for @entity6 -- pointing ... at our real enemy ) , " she writes
" just like you said in your first speech , if a war is imposed on us , we welcome it
" she said @entity27 looked good in a military uniform during a speech and signed off by saying , " i am going to the movies
" one e-mail claims to have duped @entity0 into reporting the words of a fake @entity197 commentator
the woman says she created a fake username on @entity39 and wrote a commentary that she said later appeared on the air
an e-mail sent by the president to himself contains talking points for an interview he gave to @entity245 on the @entity182 tv network @entity246 in early december
he sent the e-mail january 17 ; there is no information on who sent the original message or why he re-sent it weeks later
@entity194 was to briefly mention government reforms , the e-mail said , but not go into detail because " @entity182 are too stupid to understand details
" " it would be worth mentioning how ur personality has been attacked and praised in the last decade according to the media , " goes the e-mail , written in @entity120
" at one point u were viewed as a hero and in other times u were the ' bad guy
' @entity182 love these kinds of things and get convinced by it
" whoever wrote the e-mail ended by saying , " thank you
u are amazing ! " more fawning from his @entity27 's inner circle came in another e-mail , with the sender writing in @entity120 , " i never met an amazing person like u.
. i get so proud when people meet u and go tell the world how amazing ur
miss u. " amid the violence , it appears not even close friends could persuade @entity27 to step down
" it seems like its getting worse rather than better -- is that the case , or is it the media ? what is the long - term plan ? " wrote the daughter of @entity292 's emir to the first lady , according to an e-mail from august
" it seems like there needs to be an exit strategy
" she made a similar suggestion later that month
" from what i see there 's so many innocent lives being lost
there 's still an opportunity for transfer of power , transition without risking a lot , " she wrote , according to the e-mail
" it 's a natural time to address the nation with the intention of stepping down
the lives lost can not be retrieved , but there 's still a chance to keep a positive image
" months later , she suggested exile in @entity320
journalist @entity321 and @entity0 's @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 and @entity328 contributed to this report .
