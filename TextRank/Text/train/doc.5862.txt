-- are human beings set up to believe in a higher power ? some scientists say yes , based on either a " faith gene " or certain areas of the brain that light up on an mri when people pray or think about @entity9
but this is a highly destructive " yes , " because it reduces spirituality to a mechanical function like heart rate or the secretion of growth hormone
the same evidence fuels the arguments of atheists , who claim that if @entity9 is just a chemical reaction , it 's time we quit believing in a deity
at the very least , they say , we should stop glorifying @entity9 , now that he ( or she ) has been demoted far below the exalted status one finds in the @entity29 and the rest of world scriptures
@entity0 : why you 've got ta have faith i think atheists are getting a lot of mileage out of a facile argument
in 1896 , long before brain imaging and the discovery of @entity42 , the famous @entity44 philosopher and psychologist @entity39 published a lecture called " @entity46
" it contains one idea that is a revelation
@entity39 found a way for science to lead to @entity9 instead of defeating @entity9
let me give the revelation a context
@entity39 thought people had a right , perhaps even a drive , to say that @entity9 existed , and even though they could n't offer evidence for their religious beliefs , it sustained them with comfort , hope and so on
@entity0 : find religion without losing control atheists scoff at this rationale , claiming it 's childish to fall back on fairy tales about @entity9 just because they make you feel better
far better to grow up and see what 's before your eyes : the material world operating through random chance without the slightest sign of a higher intelligence , moral authority , afterlife and all the other trappings of religion
but @entity39 was ahead of this argument
@entity0 : the skeptic 's book club what , he asked , if believing in @entity9 actually makes new evidence appear ? that was the revelation , because while believing in ghosts or @entity86 wo n't make either one appear ( so far as we know ) , @entity9 is an aspect of our own consciousness
the deity is continuous with the human mind
when @entity96 said , " seek the @entity93 within , " he was pointing to this very continuity
i am paraphrasing @entity39 and to some extent going beyond his lecture
but what fascinates me is that he hit upon a familiar notion among seekers today : " you will only see it if you believe it
" to a non-believer , this sounds like self - hypnosis
being materialists , they cling to the old formulation : " i 'll believe it when i see it
" but no one ever claimed that @entity9 or higher intelligence or the creative principle in the universe was tangible , like a rock or a tree
gravity is n't tangible , either , but once the human mind decided to look for it , gravity became evident
@entity9 is subtler than gravity but just as evident , and just as dependent on knowing what to look for
@entity0 : who exactly is @entity9 ? to be clear , @entity39 ' belief is not the fervent belief of the religious fundamentalist who uses desperate literal interpretations of scripture to mask his insecurities and limited experience of the divine
this is the pragmatic belief of a working hypothesis applied toward improving one 's life
therefore , i do n't think it 's time to give up on believing
belief is a step ahead of hope
@entity146 can be desperate , empty or false
but when you step beyond hope into belief , you do something both real and positive
you say , " i believe in something , so let it appear
" in other words , you open yourself to knowledge , which is what everyone wants
belief is a halfway house
it opens your awareness to a new possibility , and then you find out whether @entity9 can actually be known
we have countless saints and sages to tell us that @entity9 can be known ; and with all their combined doubt , atheists , materialists and skeptics can not prove that @entity9 is unknowable
the whole issue depends not on religion versus science but on @entity39 's insight that the mind allows nature to reveal itself in greater depth the deeper we are willing to look
i find great encouragement in that insight and thought it was worth sharing
we can all benefit from @entity39 ' sort of pragmatism , which says @entity9 should be adopted as a working hypothesis , even when doubt exists , because as evidence emerges to support our belief , we will succeed in living better in this world
