@entity0 , @entity1 -- it all started with an acoustic guitar and a @entity6 page
@entity7 , better known as @entity7 , began as a one - man acoustic act
making a name for himself with his honest tales of love and loss , @entity9 utilized the then - budding social networking empire to make his music known
@entity9 's songs are an emotional roller coaster that propelled the singer through his self - produced acoustic debut " @entity21 " to his 2008 sophomore release " a twist in @entity26 , " which included a full band and production team
his third studio album , " @entity28 , " hits stores tuesday and will include a more upbeat , electronic feel
returning to his roots , @entity9 self - produced and recorded three new tracks for this latest album in his bedroom with his drummer @entity35
@entity7 's @entity37 location is more than just a home
@entity9 's band mates use it as a crash pad , the singer 's bedroom doubles as a recording studio and his garage / laundry room was converted into the band 's rehearsal space
@entity9 talked with @entity2 from his bedroom studio about the production of his new album , the evolution of his music and maintaining his personal relationship with his fans through @entity56 and @entity57
@entity2 : when did you begin writing material for your third album ? @entity9 : this writing process actually started a lot earlier than you would think
one of the songs on the album was one of the first songs i 've ever written
there were a few songs -- like , for instance , a song called nightmares , on the album ... was a song that i had written for " @entity21 , " which was years ago , like four years ago i think
and there 's a song called " @entity75 in @entity76 , " when i went right after i signed with the label , so it was well before i recorded " twist in my story
" and some of the songs i wrote literally in the studio
... i mean , as far as " @entity83 " and " @entity84 " and all those songs , like literally , " @entity84 " i wrote in february and recorded in february
that was like one of the last things we did
@entity2 : your second album had a bit of a darker tone , but you 've said your new album is more upbeat and reflective
did that just come about with the writing of it ? @entity9 : the new album 's upbeat feel definitely came along with the writing of it
all the albums have kind of spread out and become a different chapter of my personal story
... this album is more about me personally rather than telling stories about a relationship
a lot of it is self - reflection and , you know , owning up to the fact that i was n't a great person at some points and i 'm not proud of some things i 've done or some ways i 've acted , and it 's hard when you make mistakes and kind of brush them under the carpet , and leave them for later , and i finally wanted to deal with that in this album
it was a lot about telling people what 's happened and being able to free yourself after that
once you get that out , you can move on and be happy
i 'm in a really happy place right now because i 'm so focused on music , surrounded by great people and really talented musicians , and i 'm kind of given a second chance now , and i want to really take that and cherish it
@entity2 : when you first started working with music producers on your second album , did you find you liked that better ? and why did you choose to self - produce some tracks on your new album ? @entity9 : i definitely have always liked to do things by myself , just because i like to be a part of it
the more i do , the more it 's my music , personally
of course , working with a producer is a necessary thing when you 're making music , because they 're trying to put your creative thoughts together , and make it as effective as possible in a song form
... being able to do the three tracks on this new album on my own with my drummer @entity155 [ @entity156 ] was a great experience because it was the first time that i 'd gotten to produce something except my first album " @entity21 , " but that was pretty much just acoustic guitar and vocals , so there 's not much production going on , so to speak
@entity2 : " @entity21 " was just you and your acoustic guitar
now you 've added a full band and more production
how have your fans reacted to more production and a bigger sound ? @entity9 : " @entity83 , " it 's the new single , it 's been out on @entity174 for little bit now , and we 've gotten a lot of really , really good feedback
and it makes me happy to see -- going from an acoustic background to this more electronic , rhythmic feel -- they still find the beauty and the honesty in the music , and they can appreciate it , and that 's really important
but there 's always people that are n't into it
for instance , some people will [ give it a bad review ] and say , " what 's going on , what is this ? " then they 'll continue , " it 's not a bad song , but it 's totally not @entity7
" so it 's not necessarily a bad review they 're giving , it 's just that they ca n't get past the fact that i 'm evolving as an artist and i 'm trying to break out creatively
and that 's ok ; you ca n't please everyone because if i 'd still be playing acoustic right now , everyone would be like , " ok , we get it , you 're acoustic , what now ? " i think the evolution 's necessary , and it 's natural , and i hope people can appreciate it
@entity2 : you 've responded to feedback and sometimes criticism from your fans that you 've received online
why do you think it 's important to address that ? @entity9 : i 'm very , very personal with my fans
i twitter like crazy and i facebook like crazy , and i respond to them all the time , and it 's something that 's been important to me since the beginning cause that 's pretty much how i got started
they 're like part of my army , they work with me , and i ca n't do any of this without them
i feel it 's important , rather than ignore them and be like , " whatever , i 'm still selling the album and still selling the song , and one person 's opinion does n't matter
" you know one person 's opinion , two people 's opinions , or five people 's opinions , even if it 's among thousands or hundreds of thousands of opinions , it still matters .
