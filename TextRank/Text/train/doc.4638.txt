@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 greets students , shopkeepers and tourists as he rolls his wheelchair down @entity8 at the speed of a brisk jog , hailing them with , " hi
how ya doin ' ? " marijuana activist @entity3 is a local celebrity in the small district of @entity0 , @entity1 , called @entity13
in this nine - block district of @entity0 , @entity1 , called @entity13 , @entity3 is a celebrity
@entity13 is @entity3 's brainchild , a small pocket of urban renewal built on a thriving trade in medical marijuana
the district 's name comes from a marriage of @entity0 and @entity23 , a city in the @entity25 renowned for its easy attitude toward sex and drugs
@entity3 is the founder of @entity29 , which he describes as a trade school that specializes in all things marijuana : how to grow it , how to market it , how to consume it
the school , which has a curriculum , classes and teachers , claims 3,500 graduates
@entity3 also owns a medical marijuana dispensary , a coffee house , a large indoor marijuana plantation , and a museum / store devoted to the cause of legalizing marijuana
" i really see this as following the history of alcohol
the way prohibition was repealed there , " @entity3 says , adding that he believes he is close to achieving his mission
@entity3 is organizing a petition drive to place a marijuana legalization measure on the ballot in 2010 , and he thinks the measure stands a good chance of being approved by voters
a recent @entity60 showed that more than half the people in the state , where marijuana for medical use was approved more than a decade ago , would approve of decriminalizing pot. the state 's faltering economy is one reason why
if legalized , marijuana could become @entity1 's no. 1 cash crop
it could bring in an estimated $ 1 billion a year in state taxes
@entity74 assemblyman @entity73 is spearheading a cannabis legalization bill in the @entity76
he believes the state 's need to increase tax revenues will work in his bill 's favor
" i think it 's a seductive part of the equation , " he says
@entity73 says there are a number of ways legalized pot could be marketed , " it could be a @entity88 , it could be a hospital , a medical marijuana facility , whatever could be convenient
adequate enforcement of the rules
no driving under the influence
" even @entity1 's @entity96 governor , @entity95 , says legalizing marijuana deserves serious consideration
" i think we ought to study very carefully what other countries are doing that have legalized marijuana , " @entity95 says
but @entity73 says selling a legalized marijuana bill to his fellow legislators remains a delicate matter
" if we held the vote in the hallway , we 'd have it done , " @entity73 says
" but people are necessarily cautious
they are up for re-election
" and that is why @entity3 believes voters will approve a marijuana initiative long before the @entity115 acts
sitting under grow lights in a warehouse filled with hundreds of marijuana plants , @entity3 sums it up this way : " for some people cannabis is like a religion
as passionate as some people are about their religions and freedom to think what they want and to worship as they want
" but all of that is baloney to @entity130
he is president of the @entity131 for a @entity132
he says voters should not be fooled by promises of big bucks flowing to the state from marijuana taxes
" it 's their way of sort of desensitizing our communities , our state and our nation to a drug problem that we clearly need to put our foot down on , and say , ' no more
' " @entity130 points out that @entity1 's medical marijuana law has been poorly regulated , and he expects more of the same if marijuana becomes legalized for everyone
but a substantial number of @entity1 seem to believe that no amount of enforcement is going to make pot go away -- and that it 's time for the state to begin taking a cut of the action .
