-- @entity1 has taken @entity2 to task for comments made by @entity5 about how users experiencing reception problems on their new @entity11 devices should " avoid holding it that way " ( " that way " meaning a grip that blocks the antenna )
the maker of @entity17 - based smartphones authored a post on its blog called " how do you hold your @entity1 ? " -- featuring step - by - step instructions on a variety of grips such as " the cup , " " the balance " and " the four edge grip
" the company goes on to note , " one of the main things we 've found about the one billion plus @entity1 devices that are in use today is that when making a phone call , people generally tend to hold their phone like a ... well , like a phone
" obviously , this is all a jab at the @entity11 ( though @entity2 is never specifically mentioned ) and its supposed reception issues , as @entity1 concludes its post by writing : " of course , feel free to ignore all of the above because realistically , you 're free to hold your @entity1 device any way you like
and you wo n't suffer any signal loss
cool huh ? " on a more serious note , however , you may recall that the two companies are currently embroiled in patent lawsuits and looking to keep the other 's devices out of the @entity49 that seems unlikely to happen any time soon , but for the moment , at least we have a fun aside in the battle between the two companies
