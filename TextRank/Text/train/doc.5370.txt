@entity0 , @entity1 -- no one has ever intentionally taken a nose dive off the roof of the world before
in the 61 years since @entity9 and sherpa @entity10 reached the top of @entity12 , most of the 5,000 - plus people have descended from the summit the same way they came up : on foot
a few have paraglided down
@entity12 men : on top of the world in 1963 the ultra-daredevil plans to plunge off the world 's tallest mountain in may while wearing a custom wing - suit equipped with cameras to share the jump with a tv audience
" i 'm very scared
i think it 's the fear of death or destruction that kind of keeps you above that , " he told @entity2 on wednesday at skydiving practice
" but i 'm not afraid to die
i 'm not afraid to live my life on my own terms
and this is my dream and i am willing to risk everything to make it happen
" it 's not like the 39 - year - old @entity17 is unfamiliar with the 29,035 - foot tall mountain
he was 24 the first time he reached the summit , which at the time made him the youngest @entity47 to do so
he 's scaled the mountain from a base - camp in just 9Â½ hours
and three years ago , he did a test jump from an airplane
@entity12 : by the numbers the star of the @entity55 television show " @entity56 " learned the effect the thin air at that height would have on his summit jump
" i thought i would fall out of the sky a little bit , " he said
" in fact what i did was fly faster and further than i could have in that thicker air ( at lower altitudes )
" when he flies in may , he expects to reach speeds of 150 mph during the 10,000 - foot dive to base camp
@entity71 flier dies after cliff crash horror " i never saw myself as a very gifted athlete , " said @entity17 , who was raised in @entity73
" i do have a very high threshold for pain and suffering at very high altitudes
" he said it 's important to win the mental battle
what 's in your head and heart are more important than what 's in your arms or legs , he said
the @entity87 , which televised @entity89 's tight rope walk over the @entity90 last year and @entity92 's jump from the edge of space in 2012 , has said it will show @entity17 's jump live , though no firm date has been set
@entity17 said he will reach the summit then change into his suit and put on his helmet
he 'll take three or four steps
" and i will be out of there
" police to be stationed at @entity103 following mountain ' brawl ' last year climbers recount deadly traffic jam on @entity12 @entity2 's @entity108 contributed to this report .
