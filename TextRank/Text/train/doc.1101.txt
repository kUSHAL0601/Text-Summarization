-- this week super fans from around the world are gathering in @entity3 to celebrate the 159th birthday of the legendary consulting detective @entity5
never mind that @entity5 is a fictional character
to this day , in books , tv and movies , sir @entity7 's creation remains just as popular as he was when he debuted in the late 19th century
much of @entity5 ' appeal has always been his amazing mind -- how he is able to solve a seemingly insurmountable mystery through simple observation and deep thought
would n't we all like to borrow from his bag of mental tricks ? just imagine the possibilities if you put @entity5 ' brain power to use in the workplace , the classroom or social situations
that 's the premise of @entity27 's fascinating new book , " mastermind : how to think like @entity5
" @entity27 , a columnist for @entity29 and a doctoral student in psychology , explores the latest science to dissect the inner workings of the iconic detective 's mind
in turn , @entity27 uses @entity5 as an example of how anyone can learn to think more clearly , improve his or her memory and generally increase everyday mental power
@entity0 recently spoke to @entity27 about the book and the benefits of learning to think like @entity5
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : how did you become a fan of @entity5 ? @entity27 : i was introduced to @entity5 by my @entity48 when i was young
we had a tradition every sunday night , he would read to us
different stories , different books
" @entity53 , " " @entity54 , " things kids would really enjoy
one sunday we started the @entity5 stories , and it was just a completely eye - opening experience
i remember sitting there riveted
it really stuck with me as i grew older
i realized how powerful they were from a literary standpoint
@entity7 was such a phenomenal writer
i do n't think people appreciate just how good the work really is
he 's masterful with voice , with conversation , with pacing , with description
he has it all down
i was also struck by how incredibly accurate his psychological observations were
@entity5 became this figure who predated modern psychology , neuroscience and our understanding of how the mind works by more than a century
combing through the stories , i thought it would be a fascinating way of looking at the mind by using this fictional character
@entity0 : can you briefly explain @entity5 ' thought process ? @entity27 : @entity5 is really a mindful detective , someone who knows the true value of observation , which means being mindful and in the present moment , really taking in your surroundings , really taking in everything
that type of approach permeates all of his thinking
he 's not just aware of his environment ; he 's aware of himself ; he 's aware of the contents of his own mind
he has a powerful knowledge of how he thinks , what mistakes he is likely to make
@entity5 puts it best when he says it 's the difference between seeing and observing
@entity0 : what is the " brain attic " @entity5 talks about ? @entity27 : it 's his analogy for how we store and process information
how is it that we take the world around us and we form it into the permanent memories that we will then use as the basis of future decisions , future thinking , of future knowledge
the reason he uses an attic is twofold
first , an attic is finite
you ca n't just keep stuffing things up there and expect it not to give
that 's true of the mind as well
the human mind is more expandable than an attic , but there is this finite capacity for working knowledge
which is @entity5 ' second point , and why the analogy works so well
it does n't just matter what you put up there ; it matters how you do it
so if you think about it like an attic in an old house , if there are just boxes everywhere filled with junk and none of them are labeled , you 're not going to be able to find anything
what @entity5 tells you is be careful , label everything , make sure everything is organized and accessible
that way , not only will you know where to find it , but you will remember it better
we really only know what we can remember at any given moment
it does n't matter if you memorized the information , and it 's in your attic somewhere
if you ca n't access it when you need it , you might as well not know it at all
@entity0 : are there everyday benefits of learning to think like @entity5 ? @entity27 : absolutely , this type of approach can make you healthier , happier and sharper
@entity0 : where would you start ? @entity27 : the first thing to do -- and this is difficult in our modern environment -- but realize that multitasking is not your friend
when you multitask , you can not think like @entity5
that 's just anathema to his mindful approach
if we take chunks out of the day where we focus , where we allow ourselves to just do one thing and nothing else , you 'll find your mind becomes better at doing that one thing and better at managing multiple inputs , filtering out distractions and creating a cleaner slate for you to work
when you 're cognitively busy , you 're not thinking as clearly
if you 're someone with a busy schedule who has to multitask all the time , even if you just practice this quiet mindfulness a few minutes a day , just let your mind focus on the present moment , it can make a huge difference in the clarity of your thinking
