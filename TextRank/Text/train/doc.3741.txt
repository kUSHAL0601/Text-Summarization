@entity0 -- a federal appeals court in @entity0 thursday struck down the @entity4 voter id law requiring photos for voters at the polls , calling it racially discriminatory
the decision is a major victory for the @entity11 administration and its @entity13 allies , which had challenged the law
@entity4 attorney general @entity15 promptly announced the state will appeal the ruling to the @entity18
@entity20 gov. @entity19 signed the voter id measure into law last year , but it had yet not gone into effect because the federal @entity24 requires changes in @entity4 voting laws to be pre-cleared by the @entity27
attorney general @entity28 denied the pre-clearance of the measure in march , concluding that @entity4 failed to show the law will not have " the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race
" the three - judge panel agreed
although the law provides for approved voter registration certificates with no photo as acceptable for voting in certain circumstances , the court said the law imposes " strict unforgiving burdens on the poor
" the court noted the requirements will fall heavily on african - americans and @entity48 , who make up a disproportionate percentage of the poor in @entity4
the panel of judges for the @entity53 also said it was ruling only on the @entity4 law , and not issuing a statement about other state voting laws
it noted the @entity27 had approved a @entity59 voter id law in which the state promised to provide free photo id cards to citizens who request them
@entity28 defends opposition to proposed @entity4 voter id law @entity28 praised the court 's decision thursday
" under the proposed law , many of those without the required voter identification would be forced to travel great distances to get one -- and some would have to pay for the documents they might need to do so , " said a statement from the attorney general
@entity28 also repeated his assertion that the law would discriminate against minorities
@entity15 , meanwhile , said @entity4 will immediately take the case to the nation 's highest court , where " we are confident we will prevail
" he said the @entity18 had already approved similar ballot integrity safeguards passed in @entity59 and @entity86
the ruling comes as another three - judge panel in @entity0 is hearing arguments this week on a similar law passed in @entity91
@entity20 - dominated legislatures say such laws are designed to eliminate voter fraud
@entity13 claim there is no voter fraud issue , and that the laws are designed to reduce voting by poor minorities
" chalk up another victory for fraud , " said gov. @entity19 , in a statement on his website
" federal judges subverted the will of the people of @entity4 and undermined our effort to ensure fair and accurate elections
the @entity11 administration 's claim that it 's a burden to present a photo id to vote simply defies common sense
i will continue to work with attorney general @entity15 to fight for the same right that other states already have to protect their elections
" the @entity4 law said those who are 65 or older , disabled or expect to be absent on @entity121 may vote by mail without presenting identification
earlier this month , a state court in @entity125 approved a voter id law requiring photo identification at the polls
@entity18 rips @entity4 redistricting plan as discriminatory
