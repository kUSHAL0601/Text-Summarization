-- four months after an auto accident and reports of extramarital affairs put his golf career on hold , @entity1 announced tuesday that he plans to return to the sport at the @entity8 in april
@entity1 dropped out of professional competition in december after a @entity11 weekend wreck outside his @entity13 home turned a harsh spotlight on the golfer 's personal life
in march , the 34 - year - old golfer issued a public apology for cheating on his wife and said he was undergoing treatment for unspecified " issues
" but on tuesday , he said he was coming back to play in the masters , which he has won four times since 1997
" after a long and necessary time away from the game , i feel like i 'm ready to start my season at @entity28 , " @entity1 said in a statement released by his agent
" the major championships have always been a special focus in my career and , as a professional , i think @entity28 is where i need to be , even though it 's been a while since i last played
" the tournament is scheduled for april 5 - 11 at @entity37 's @entity36
can @entity39 's return restore his legend ? @entity42 , the club 's chairman , welcomed the return of the sport 's top draw
" we support @entity1 's decision to return to competitive golf beginning at this year 's @entity8 , " @entity42 said in a statement shortly after the announcement
" additionally , we support and encourage his stated commitment to continue the significant work required to rebuild his personal and professional life
" and @entity56 commissioner @entity55 added , " we were pleased to learn that @entity1 will be playing the masters in a few weeks
he has invested a lot of time taking steps , both in his personal and professional life , in order to prepare for his return
we all wish him and his family the best as he rejoins the tour
" @entity1 has won four pga championships and six of the association 's @entity68 title
tuesday 's announcement comes nearly a month after @entity1 publicly apologized for what he called " irresponsible and selfish " behavior , which he said included infidelity , and said he was working to " become a better man
" " i have undergone almost two months of inpatient therapy , and i am continuing my treatment , " he said in tuesday 's statement
" although i 'm returning to competition , i still have a lot of work to do in my personal life
" @entity84 ' public woes began with an early - morning crash november 27 outside his @entity87 - area home , when he suffered minor injuries after striking a fire hydrant and a tree with his @entity91
woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions
eventually , he was cited for careless driving
he paid a $ 164 fine and received four points on his driving record
the wreck occurred days after the tabloid @entity101 named @entity84 as having an affair with a @entity104 nightclub hostess
the woman has denied the allegation , but several others have come forward to claim that they had sexual relationships with @entity84 , who is married to former model @entity109
the couple has two children
in his carefully managed march statement , delivered to a small , hand - picked crowd , @entity1 said he was in inpatient therapy for 45 days from the end of december to early february for " issues , " which he did not explain
the controversy prompted several major sponsors to suspend or drop their relationships with @entity1 , who also apologized to his business partners for his behavior
and he denied speculation that @entity109 attacked him the night of the accident , saying she showed " enormous grace and poise throughout this ordeal
