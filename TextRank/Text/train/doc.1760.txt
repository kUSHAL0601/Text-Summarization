@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 on friday took his push for a health care overhaul to traditionally conservative @entity1 , saying a bill to extend coverage to the uninsured while helping those already with coverage will pass this year
president @entity3 discusses his health care plans friday at a meeting in @entity0 , @entity1
however , an influential @entity13 representative said the @entity14 would only pass a health care bill in january or later , signaling continuing rifts within @entity3 's party on his domestic priority for 2009
" we 're taking some time to make sure it 's done right , " said rep. @entity19 of @entity20
" i do n't know that we 'll get something done before january , and even then we may not get it done
we 're going to do it right when it 's finally done
" @entity3 told a largely supportive @entity1 audience at his second of three town hall meetings this week that fixing the health care system requires improving health insurance practices and reducing the costs of treatment
he sought questions from skeptics of his proposed health care overhaul , seeking to confront some misconceptions fueled by opponents @entity13 say are undermining the debate
one man who identified himself as a proud @entity41 supporter and believer in the @entity43 asked how the government would pay to expand health insurance coverage to 46 million uninsured people
" you ca n't tell us how you 're going to pay for this , " said the questioner , @entity47 , a welder from @entity48 , @entity1
" the only way you 're going to get the money is to raise our taxes
that 's the only way you can do that
" @entity3 responded with his oft - repeated explanation that two - thirds of the cost of overhauling health care -- estimated at about $ 900 billion over 10 years -- would come from eliminating waste and improving efficiency in the current system , which includes the government - run @entity65 and @entity66 programs for the elderly and impoverished
the rest would have to come from new revenue , he agreed with the questioner , and he called for reducing the amount of deductions that people making more than $ 250,000 a year can make on their income taxes
" if we did that alone , just that change alone ... that would raise enough to pay for health care reform , " @entity3 said , noting that would meet his election campaign pledge to avoid any tax increase on people earning less than $ 250,000 a year
however , @entity3 said some taxes would have to be raised , and the crowd applauded when he said he believes people with more money , like himself , ought to pay a heavier burden
" we 've got to get over this notion that we can have something for nothing , " @entity3 said
" that 's how we got into this deficit and this debt in the first place
" in reference to emotional and heated debate at some other town hall meetings across the country in recent weeks , @entity3 told @entity47 , " i appreciate your question , the respectful way you asked it , and by the way , i also believe in the @entity43
" afterward , @entity47 said he was impressed by @entity3 's performance but remained skeptical
" i do n't think he knows where that money 's going to come from , " he said
" if he does , he 's not saying
" @entity3 noted there is more work to be done , with @entity109 seeking to merge at least four bills , along with a possible compromise agreement being negotiated by @entity13 sen. @entity112 and five other members of his @entity114 , into a single bill in september
another questioner chosen when @entity3 asked for a skeptic identified himself as an insurance provider who wanted to know why @entity3 and @entity13 are vilifying the insurance industry in the health care debate
earlier in the meeting , @entity3 described what he called discriminatory practices by insurance companies that dropped coverage of people who became sick or refused to cover those with pre-existing medical conditions
@entity3 noted some insurance companies are contributing to the reform debate , but said others are spending millions of dollars to try to defeat any health care legislation
for a health care overhaul to work for everyone , he said , it has to ensure all @entity138 are covered so that insurance companies have incentive to participate
they wo n't be able to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions or " cherry pick " healthy people while refusing coverage for sick people , @entity3 said , so increasing the total numbers covered will be the enticement
on saturday , @entity3 will hold another town hall meeting in @entity151 , @entity152 , before vacationing in some national parks with his family next week
in addition , @entity14 spokesman @entity155 said @entity3 will hold " some events not yet announced " in coming days
while @entity3 has said consensus can be reached on health care reform , contentious town hall meetings held by lawmakers around the country have created a different impression
the @entity14 , and many democrats in @entity109 , hope that by building support in the @entity167 , the president can start to turn the tide
though the region is largely @entity170 , @entity3 made some inroads in the latest election
he won in @entity152 and lost by just a slim margin in @entity1
however , @entity19 's comments in @entity175 , @entity20 , to @entity2 affiliate @entity176 signaled continuing divisions among @entity14 @entity13 over the scope and pace of health care legislation
" we said to the speaker [ house speaker @entity183 ] , the leadership , let 's not rush this thing , " @entity19 said
" let 's do it right , so we 'll have a uniquely @entity138 plan , if the thing passes
" @entity3 's town hall events are just part of a larger @entity13 strategy for winning support in the region
the @entity196 began a tv ad this week promoting the president 's health care plan
a committee spokesman said the ad will run on national cable as well as on local cable in @entity205 , @entity1 , @entity152 and the @entity206
the group @entity207 , which supports the president 's plan , also launched a campaign thursday that includes an ad running in a dozen states -- among them @entity1 and @entity152
but groups opposed to the president 's plan have their own campaigns
one voter in @entity220 , @entity1 , not far from where the president spoke in @entity0 , summarized the kinds of concerns that she and many others in the region have
" i believe that there is a health care crisis , i really do , " @entity228 , who voted for @entity3 in 2008 , told @entity2 's @entity225 on thursday
" do i believe that the government needs to be more involved ? no ! " @entity225 met @entity228 at a clinic that gets half its funding from taxpayers
" the government being involved is fine , " @entity228 said
" it 's just ... when they try and overstep , when they try to say , ' no , this is what needs to be done
