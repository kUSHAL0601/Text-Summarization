-- the nonprofit that pushed last month for @entity3 officials to investigate reports of a massacre in an @entity7 indigenous community said monday that it now believes there was no attack there
" having received its own testimony from confidential sources , @entity12 now believes there was no attack by miners on the @entity19 community of @entity20 , " said @entity11 , director of @entity12
the statement comes after @entity3 state media over the weekend published several reports detailing officials ' accounts from the area , also concluding that no massacre had occurred
@entity3 officials : reports of indigenous massacre false an aerial flyover and ground operation to the community in a remote region along the @entity35 - @entity3 border showed no signs of an attack , @entity38
gen. @entity39 told state - run @entity40
" we can testify that nothing happened , " he said
investigators " also visited other communities in the region , before reaching @entity20 , and also nothing happened there
" on saturday , @entity3 's government ombudswoman said the report was fueled by second - hand hearsay
" it was a false , biased report , " @entity50 told reporters
" the report was made by an indigenous person that heard that another organization had said it
" last month allegations of the reported massacre trickled out of the area , where unauthorized @entity35 gold miners have long clashed with indigenous groups
a declaration on the @entity12 website last month said members of a neighboring indigenous community had heard reports of a massacre from @entity20 's residents
the declaration , purportedly from a group of organizations representing indigenous people and communities in the @entity7 , said of about 80 @entity19 people who lived in the @entity20 community , only three survivors had reportedly been found
@entity12 , which advocates tribal peoples ' rights worldwide , had described it as an " atrocity
" in his monday statement saying that @entity12 no longer believes there was an attack , @entity11 said visitors to the area " had heard stories of a killing in july
" " we currently do not know whether or not these stories were sparked by a violent incident , which is the most likely explanation , but tension remains high in the area , " he said
@entity3 officials said last wednesday that they were investigating the reports of an attack
several days later , a top official said visits to the region revealed that reports about the alleged massacre were false
on saturday , a report from @entity3 's @entity104 news agency said investigators from @entity3 's air force concluded that " levels of illegal mining in the area were minimal
" on monday , @entity11 disputed that claim , saying " many illegal gold miners are currently operating " in the area
" the @entity3 government 's reaction remains shameful
it has not said , even now , that it will remove the miners , and it immediately denied having found ' evidence ' of killings , before even concluding its own investigation , " @entity11 said .
