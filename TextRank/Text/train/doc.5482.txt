-- @entity1 walked out of @entity2 after 20 years , hoping to become a productive member of society
shortly after she was released in june 2010 , @entity1 found a part - time job
she was thrilled -- until she found out that working for $ 13 an hour meant her newly acquired @entity7 insurance would be terminated
@entity7 , a federally run health program , is designed to provide coverage for low - income and disabled individuals
but in @entity15 , where @entity1 lives , single adults without dependents who earn more than $ 8,994 a year do n't qualify
in other states , the qualifying income level is even lower
adults without children in nearly half of states do n't qualify at all
it 's a population known as the working poor : they earn too much to qualify for @entity7 but not nearly enough to pay for private health insurance
@entity1 chose to keep her job and prayed she would n't fall ill. @entity28 worries constantly about her atopic dermatitis , a skin condition that can be controlled only with a prescription medication cream she ca n't afford
" i have to pick and choose when i go to the doctor , " @entity1 said
" when i get really , really sick , i have to go to the emergency room
" experts hope @entity35 will change that
they estimate that 30 % to 50 % of released @entity38 prison inmates will be newly eligible for insurance under the @entity7 expansion that covers people who earn up to 133 % of the federal poverty level : about $ 15,800 a year for a single person
twenty - five states and the @entity45 have chosen to expand their @entity7 programs
and all states must now cover behavioral health treatments at the same rate as they cover physical ailments
so any inmate who qualifies for @entity7 or @entity52 , and those who can afford health insurance , will be able to get help for substance abuse and mental health problems
that care could be the " stay out of jail free " card former inmates need , experts say
whether the infrastructure is in place to support those dreams is another question
a chronic problem roughly 10 million people cycle through @entity38 jails every year , according to @entity70 , a nonprofit dedicated to improving connectivity between health care in and out of the justice system
most are there for short periods before they are determined to be innocent , post bail or are sentenced to probation
only 4 % are sent to prison to serve longer sentences
" in other words , 96 % ... return directly to the community from jail , along with their often untreated health conditions , " nonprofit president @entity80 explained
those who end up in prison often have serious health issues
nearly 40 % percent of inmates have one or more chronic health problems , such as high blood pressure , diabetes or asthma , the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) estimated in 2002
inmates are also three times more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental illness and four times more likely to have a substance abuse problem , said @entity102 , senior adviser to the assistant attorney general in the @entity38 @entity104
the @entity105 estimates that 64.2 % of jail inmates have a diagnosable mental health problem , compared with about 26 % of @entity38 adults
most private health insurance companies do not cover the incarcerated
inmates who were covered under @entity7 upon entering prison have their insurance suspended or terminated , depending on state law , because of @entity7 's " inmate exception " rule
but the real problem is not caring for this population inside , @entity117 said ; it 's caring for them when they get out
until the @entity35 takes effect january 1 , inmates are some of the only people in the @entity38 who are guaranteed access to health care
to deprive them of medical care would violate the @entity130 , which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment , the @entity127 has ruled on two occasions
" a prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance , including adequate medical care , is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society , " justice @entity133 wrote in the more recent @entity135 opinion ( @entity90 ) on may 23 , 2011
but when they leave prison , and most do , there are no such protections in place
men and women who may have gotten their addictions under control or found the right medication combination to ease mental health symptoms behind bars are released into the community without a backup plan
@entity80 tells of newly released prisoners who purposefully commit small crimes with the intent of returning to jail to get the surgeries they need for free
" access to health care can make a huge positive difference for this population , " @entity117 said
" if we deliver the right treatment to the right people at the right time , then we can improve public health , increase public safety and save taxpayer dollars
" separate worlds advocates working to get former inmates the health care they need in the community have a favorite catchphrase : continuity of care
the goal is to have an appointment set up with a provider before the inmate is even released , said @entity188 , @entity189 's director of inmate health services
the former warden remembers how his calls to community doctors used to go : " can you see this patient ? he 's been incarcerated for 10 years
he 's mentally ill. he 's violent
and he has no insurance , so he is n't going to be able to pay for anything
" " it did n't work out too well , " @entity188 said with a hint of sarcasm
" at least today , i 've taken one thing off the table
... you 'll be able to be reimbursed
" there are n't a lot of data on whether access to health care will lower rates of recidivism or the rates at which offenders return to jail
but experts know that treatment of mental illness and substance abuse can help prevent criminal relapse ( @entity90 )
a study done in the early 1990s called the @entity219 and @entity220 ( @entity90 ) found that substance abuse treatment , in and out of prison , reduced the level of criminal activity among participants by about two - thirds
since then , many studies have showed that addiction programs , whether participation is coerced or voluntary , reduce recidivism rates
@entity233 's @entity232 program identifies prisoners who pose a threat to public safety and provides them with mental health treatment for up to five years after their release
the state program has reduced felony recidivism by 42 % among these former inmates , according to a 2009 report ( @entity90 ) , and has saved taxpayers $ 1.64 for every dollar spent on treatment
" the guy who robs banks for a living and sells drugs for a living , that 's what he does , " @entity188 said
" and when he gets back out , he 's going to do it again
but when ( the mentally ill ) get out , they do n't rush back in
" judges would avoid sending these low - risk offenders to jail at all if more treatment options were available , said @entity259 , president and ceo of @entity262 ' @entity261
but state funding for community behavioral programs has long been lacking
@entity259 believes it 's only a matter of time until other states recognize the benefits of expanding their @entity7 programs
experts have also expressed concern that the physician shortage in the @entity38 will only get worse in coming years due to the influx of newly insured patients
and although the " @entity279 " provision of @entity35 provides funding for facilities willing to coordinate primary , emergency and behavioral health care for individuals on @entity7 with chronic conditions , this kind of seamless communication between treatment providers simply does not currently exist in most cities
" we are building the plane as we fly it , " @entity259 said simply
" and if anybody tells you differently , they are misdirecting you
" reaching out the bottom line is that the @entity35 holds a lot of potential , said dr. @entity296 , co-founder of the @entity297 , which encompasses 11 community health centers caring for recently released prisoners
but she cautions that it may not be the cure - all some are promising for @entity38 's inmates
" just because everyone is insured does n't mean you have access to primary care
... just because you have insurance does n't mean you want to go to a clinic or doctor , " @entity308 said
" it does n't mean you wo n't feel discriminated in a health care setting
it does n't mean you 'll feel safe
" former inmates are looking for four specific things when it comes to health care outside prison walls , she said : access to providers within two weeks of release ; doctors who know they have been incarcerated so they do n't feel they have to hide their past ; community health workers who can help them navigate the system ; and a health care facility that has strong partnerships with other organizations in the community that can help them find housing , employment and legal services
all are essential to encouraging this population to seek consistent care and stay out of jail , @entity308 said
@entity340 is working to address some of these issues as a policy specialist at @entity343 , an advocacy group in @entity15 run by formerly incarcerated women
" i realized upon being released from prison that we usually cling to people who have been in the same situation as us , " she said
" i was lucky to have a great support system ... so i made myself out to be that support system for sisters and brothers coming home
" @entity1 plans to apply for @entity7 again under @entity15 's expansion
until it goes into effect , @entity1 said , she will continue to use " home remedies " to treat her skin condition and will avoid going to the doctor unless it 's absolutely necessary
" my biggest fear is that when i do get insurance , i 'm going to have something wrong with me , " she said
" it 's going to be too late
