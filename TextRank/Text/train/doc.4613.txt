-- two - time world champion @entity1 believes the @entity3 title race is now wide open with seven races to go following @entity6 's recent resurgence
@entity1 followed up his controversial victory at the @entity9 @entity8 with second place behind @entity11 in @entity12 , and is now just 20 points behind @entity15 's new series leader
@entity6 face possible further sanctions for the incident at @entity18 last month that saw @entity19 allow @entity1 to take the lead , having already been fined $ 100,000 for breaching the ban on team orders ahead of a september 8 disciplinary hearing of the @entity24
but the @entity26 team are now just 74 points behind leaders @entity15 , with @entity29 second after @entity30 failed to finish in @entity31 and world champion @entity32 was eighth
" we are in a position now that we are able to take the lead of the championship if we win one race , " @entity1 told @entity6 's website
" i think we have to remain calm
we know that four or five drivers will fight until the last race , but we need to use our experience as a team
@entity42 says sorry to @entity43 " @entity6 have won so many championships , and my personal experience as well , fighting for three championships
we have to stay calm , and in these seven races get as many podiums as possible
i think continuity will be key to winning the championship
" @entity30 is hoping to bounce back at the next race , the @entity53 @entity8 at @entity54 on august 29 after having to retire for the second time this season due to mechanical problems
" it was a disappointment , yes , but you have to put it behind you
and you should never think too hard about the ' what ifs ' or the missed opportunities , " the @entity62 driver told his website
@entity3 standings after @entity69 @entity8 " it happened , and we move on -- it 's that simple
and , despite it being a difficult race , i can take some positives away from the @entity12 weekend
i was able to pass a car on track , and the guys once again pulled off a perfect pit stop , to put me ahead of @entity19
" and i also know we can come back even stronger in the final seven races
we have some very promising developments in the pipeline , and we 're making progress in lots of other areas , too
we have dug deep before , and i know absolutely that we will dig deep once more
" with the championship so closely balanced , this is the perfect time for a break
in effect , we 'll resume the season as if it 's the start of the year again : with everything to play for , and none of the top three teams lagging behind on points
that 's really exciting ! " the 2008 world champion said the three - week hiatus was also a chance for the teams ' support crew to recharge their batteries
@entity11 claims @entity3 lead with @entity12 win " you can see on tv how hard the mechanics and engineers work at the racetrack , but you do n't get to see how many hours the men and women are putting in back at the factory , " @entity30 said
" and , believe me , it 's a proper shutdown -- it gives everybody the opportunity to forget about @entity3 for a while and spend time away on their families , which is really important
as for me , i 'm looking at getting away from it all for a little while
" @entity32 revealed that he would be competing in this weekend 's @entity121 , raising funds for charity
" i 'm really looking forward to the event , and i 'm still raising money for the @entity126
it 's for a great cause , making dreams come true for very ill young children , and i 'm proud to be playing my part to help them raise funds , " he told his website
" my trainer @entity134 will be joining me and some of my friends
after the tri , i 'll definitely be looking to get away from it
but even though it 's a nice feeling to get away from @entity3 for a while , you can guarantee that all the drivers will be desperate for the break to end because we 'll want to get back into the car
