-- president @entity1 took a great first step in making our country safer wednesday when he signed executive actions to reduce gun violence and urged @entity7 to reinstate the 2004 assault weapons ban
but the president 's actions do not let the rest of us off the hook
each one of us needs to decide on our own how we will participate in shaping our country 's future
let the families of @entity16 grieve
the rest of us need to get to work
read @entity1 's proposals in 2003 , my cousin 's 15 - year - old son was shot and killed by a robber
my cousin found solidarity with other parents whose children had been snatched by gun violence , making instant activists out of moms and dads
as i thought of the parents of @entity16 over the past month , steeped in their grief , i realized how little i know , how little i have ever wanted to know , about the circumstances surrounding the gun death closest to me
i do n't know what kind of gun was used to murder my own relative
even if i did , what would it mean to me ? i 've never owned a gun nor have i ever touched one
i have never even knowingly been in the presence of one
i have taken false and selfish comfort in believing that guns and the chaos connected to them were worlds away
not wanting to wade into the debate around gun control , my position on guns has been one of naivety and willed ignorance
but i wo n't avoid it any longer
opinion : @entity58 's paranoid fantasy flouts democracy it is much easier to cry in front of my television and feel helpless than to learn what these weapons are , what they do and what i can do to make events like @entity16 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 less likely to happen again
my relationship to my community needs to be one but of action
i have to learn the names and capacities of assault style rifles as i would learn the names and potencies of common poisons for my own safety
a semiautomatic handgun can theoretically shoot 1,500 rounds in seven minutes if a shooter could possible manage it
the @entity85 , a semiautomatic rifle , uses a 20 or 30 - round magazine
it may seem daunting to enter into the fray of a heated issue , to shape public opinion and to push our elected officials to substantive change , but we 've done it before
in the 1960s , everyday people , from maids to college students and church members , said " enough is enough " to the back of the bus , separate water fountains and segregated lunch counters
nearly two decades later , a mother who lost her child to a drunken driver launched the organization @entity108 and led the country to enduring cultural and legislative transformation to stop drunken driving and to institute stricter alcohol policies
voices of the people played a role in the passage of the @entity117 and public opinion pushed @entity7 to pass the 1993 @entity119
politics : would @entity1 's gun violence measures work ? yes , civil discourse can be uncivil
but do n't let toxic internet trolls and television zealots stop you from participating in this vital public discussion
the grieving families of @entity16 and the grieving families of the hundreds of people who will have died from gun shootings since @entity16 will be conscripted to the front lines of the gun control debate
but we ca n't let them fight it on their own
because the truth is , when an average of eight children die from gun violence every day in this country , nobody is left untouched by a shooting death
eventually , that evil will make its mark , directly or indirectly , on all of us
in the wake of the one - month anniversary of the @entity16 shootings , the country 's grief over mass shootings , one - on - one gun violence and unintentional gun deaths weighs so heavily on our collective conscience that once again the nation seems ready to take action
yes , our elected officials must lead and we must hold them accountable if they do n't
but we must do our part as well
we have to organize and shape public opinion to make it easier for the president and @entity7 to do what they must
we can start by educating ourselves
know what these weapons of mass destruction do , know who is trying to stop research on gun safety , know what organizations are pushing for more comprehensive bans
once we 're educated , we can educate our friends and families and build a groundswell , home by home , street by street and block by block
because that is what this is going to take
it 's going to take all of us
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .
