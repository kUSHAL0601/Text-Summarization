@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 leaders on friday gave @entity1 's warring factions four days to lay down their arms after nearly two weeks of widening violence
if they do n't , the leaders of the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) warned they 'll " take action " to stop the conflict that the @entity13 says has killed more than 1,000 and forced some 121,000 from their homes
the warning came the same day the @entity13 said the first of 5,500 additional peacekeepers had arrived in the country
the leaders of the @entity9 did n't specify what sort of action would be taken
but a communique issued friday in @entity22 , @entity23 , appears to throw the group 's weight behind @entity1 president @entity26
in a joint statement by the leaders of the @entity9 said they would not accept a violent overthrow of the country 's democratically elected government , and said any change must come through the democratic process
@entity26 has accused rival politician @entity33 , his former vice president , of trying to stage a coup
@entity33 has denied involvement in a coup
@entity37 broke out between @entity26 's government and supporters of @entity40 on december 15 in the capital city of @entity0
it quickly spread across the country , with reports of mass killings as evidenced by mass graves
@entity26 and @entity33 are longtime rivals from two different tribal clans -- @entity26 is from the @entity50 tribe , @entity33 from the @entity51
@entity1 's government said it has agreed " in principle " to a cease - fire demanded by the @entity9 , information minister @entity52 told @entity2
@entity56 said @entity26 's government is open to " unconditional dialogue " to end the violence
the @entity9 appointed envoys from @entity23 and @entity61 to help broker a deal
@entity33 has n't responded to the proposal , leaving it unclear friday what immediate impact the agreement would have on the fighting
the news of a possible deal comes as @entity13 officials work feverishly to finalize details of sending peacekeeping reinforcements to @entity1
the @entity13 hopes to send them in no later than saturday to help protect the 50,000 people now crowding @entity13 bases , seeking shelter from the fighting
on friday , 72 peacekeepers arrived in @entity0 , according to the @entity13
it was the first group of an additional 5,500 peacekeepers approved by @entity81
the additional personnel will increase the total peacekeeping force in @entity1 to 12,500 soldiers and 1,323 police officers
meanwhile , @entity13 officials and aid workers struggled to protect and provide food , shelter and medical care to those who have fled the fighting , which has spread to seven of @entity1 's 10 states , according to the @entity13
more than 63,000 people have crowded on to @entity13 bases in @entity1 seeking shelter from the violence , requiring a massive influx of aid
@entity13 workers on friday were able to resupply a @entity13 - operated hospital in @entity102 , @entity13 assistant secretary - general @entity99 said on @entity103
the @entity104 also began flying in aid workers and supplies , he said
