@entity0 , @entity1 -- the father of the only @entity5 pow in @entity6 sent a message to his son 's @entity9 captors on saturday : " after 12 years , let there be peace
can we push this forward and make it happen ? " and he sent a message to his son : " i will not leave you on the battlefield
" updates about sgt. @entity24 's case have been sparse since he was captured nearly four years ago after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost
family members have remained reticent for fear of jeopardizing his safety
but the 27 - year - old soldier 's parents spoke out at a rally in home state of @entity1 on saturday , just days after @entity5 authorities said discussion of a possible prisoner exchange with the @entity9 could be on the table during upcoming talks
" we are feeling optimistic this week , " mother @entity40 said
" so many of you have come from far away , and we appreciate the sacrifices you made to make this possible
" more than 1,000 people were in the crowd , including hundreds of war veterans who rode motorcycles into this town
throughout the event , they chanted , " bring @entity53
" local politicians , state senators and police officials also spoke at the event
" we hope he will see this and know of you , " his mother told the crowd
then , she sent a message to her son , " we love you and are eagerly awaiting your return home
" in a statement released earlier this week through a family spokesman , the soldier 's parents said they were encouraged by word that upcoming negotiations might lead to their son 's freedom
" that is encouraging news , especially after not much encouraging news over the past four years , " @entity76 col. @entity75 said , adding that the @entity77 have been talking with military and government agencies
" they know their son has not been forgotten
my brothers and sisters in uniform know we wo n't rest until @entity24 is safely back with his family
" at saturday 's rally , father @entity91 sported a long beard , which he has grown out since his son 's capture as a sign of solidarity
and he spoke briefly in @entity98 , a language that he 's studied during his son 's captivity
he offered a message that he said was meant for the @entity9
" may the peace of @entity104 and blessings of @entity104 be upon you , " he said
" after 12 years , let there be peace
can we push this forward and make this happen ? " speaking in @entity113 , he offered a message in @entity113 that he said was meant for his son
" @entity24 , my son , if you can hear me
... you are part of the peace process , you are part of ending the @entity6 war
tell the truth , and have the patience that can only come from @entity104
we are being tested , " @entity91 said
on thursday , @entity126 spokeswoman @entity125 said the @entity5 expects prisoner exchange to be a topic of talks with the @entity9 , which are slated to take place " in the coming days , " in @entity131 , @entity132
no decisions have been made about transferring any @entity9 detainees held at @entity135
any such decision would have to be made with congressional approval and in accordance with @entity5 law , she said
it wo n't be the first time @entity5 negotiators raise the issue of @entity24 's release with the @entity9
the two sides held meetings in 2011 and 2012 that included the topic of @entity24 's release , with sporadic discussions since then
while the @entity5 has been pushing for the return of @entity24 -- captured in june 2009 in @entity6 -- the @entity9 has been pushing for the release of five of its own men from @entity5 custody in @entity135
@entity125 said the @entity5 expects the @entity9 will raise that issue again when the two sides meet
in the meantime , @entity24 's father said saturday that he 'll never stop pushing for his son 's freedom
" a father does not leave his son on the battlefield
i live in @entity6 , my phone on @entity6 time , " he said
" i will not leave you on the battlefield
you will not be forgotten
we pray soon you will come home
" @entity2 's @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report .
