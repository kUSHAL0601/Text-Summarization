editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity9 is broadband television network of @entity5
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers
( @entity9 ) -- for this installment of the vice guide to @entity24 series , @entity9 co-founder @entity25 traveled to @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 to immerse himself in the seedy , fast - paced , and vastly prolific and amusing world of films inspired by -- and often funded by -- @entity28 's ultraviolent drug cartels , a genre known as narco cinema
@entity28 has long been the superhighway of drugs into @entity36
it supplies most of the meth , marijuana , cocaine and poppy derivatives consumed in the @entity42 , and today the @entity44 drug trade is a $ 100 billion a year industry
about 30 percent of this figure is reported to be repurposed as bribes to government officials and law enforcement
it 's really no surprise at all that drugs permeate every level of @entity44 society , from religion ( yes , there is a patron saint of drug trafficking ) to music , and film is by far one of the most naturally gratifying mediums for the fictitious high - flying antics of outlaw traffickers
today there is a constant flow of b - movie releases featuring drug dealers , good cops , bad cops , women , cocaine and a lot of big trucks
these films love big trucks
see the rest of @entity44 narco cinema at @entity9 @entity79 cinema was born in the 1980s , taking a cue from the b - movie tradition of the @entity44 cinema of the ' 60s and ' 70s
the movement soon turned to action , guns , trucks , cars , explosions , women , and drugs
because 82 percent of the @entity44 population ca n't afford to see these films , cheap , straight - to - video accessibility helped it become increasingly popular
watching these films is now a national pastime
@entity25 decided he needed to be in one of these movies
in time he found @entity98 , one of the biggest directors in the industry , who happened at the time to be shooting two sequels to his hit " @entity104 " ( while the eponymous vehicle is a sedan and not a truck , it does get chased by a lot of trucks in this franchise )
@entity98 invited @entity25 to the shoot and to play a role
@entity25 accepted , picked up a python - skin jacket and cowboy hat and hired a band to sing drug - running songs about him for moral support
@entity120 , as these types of songs are called , are the musical equivalent of narco cinema , and are often the basis for many popular films .
