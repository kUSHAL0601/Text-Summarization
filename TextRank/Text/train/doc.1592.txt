@entity0 -- in the last two months , eight people in @entity3 have died from bird flu , a rare but deadly disease causing concern among health authorities
six of the victims have been children
the @entity11 virus , known to be highly contagious to poultry , typically resembles the flu when contracted by humans
but it kills more than half the people it infects , according to @entity18
of the nine confirmed @entity11 cases in @entity3 this year , only an 8 - month old infant has survived
the infant had received medical attention early , said dr. @entity22 , the @entity23 's deputy director for communicable diseases control in @entity3
the eight bird flu deaths in the last six weeks -- considering that @entity3 has had 19 reported deaths from the disease in the last 10 years -- has sparked increased surveillance efforts
health officials are warning people to wash their hands often , to keep children away from poultry and to avoid eating sick poultry
so far , the nine cases are not believed to be related , although most of them came from the southern region
bird flu research resumes , but not in @entity39 the eight @entity11 deaths in @entity3 occurred with a 15 - year - old girl and a 35 - year - old man on january 21 , and a 2 - year - old girl and a 9 - year - old girl on january 28
in the next month , a 5 - year - old died on feburary 7 , a 3 - year - old girl died on february 13 , a 2 - year - old boy died on february 19 , followed by a death of a 35 - year - old man on monday
he came from the @entity50 in central @entity3 and died after developing fever , coughing and difficulty breathing earlier this month
the patients experienced symptoms such as coughing , fever , difficulty breathing , sleepiness and vomiting
bird flu does not usually pass from person - to - person , but the disease is closely monitored because of concerns that the @entity11 virus could mutate allowing to spread more easily among people
" we conducted investigations and found that all the cases were transmission from the poultry , " said @entity22
" there is no evidence of transmission from human to human at this stage
" all nine patients are believed to have been exposed to sick or dead poultry , according to health authroties
@entity11 typically spreads between birds , but can jump to humans , especially if they 're living in close proximity
the greatest risk of exposure to the virus is through the handling and slaughter of infected poultry
" home slaughtering and preparation of sick or dead poultry for food is hazardous : this practice must stop , " said dr. @entity87 , the @entity3 minister of health , in a statement
" @entity94 also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found
i urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks
" health teams are carrying out " enhanced surveillance " in the villages and communities where bird flu cases have been reported , according to the @entity106
officials are also telling people with flu - like symptoms who have difficulty breathing to seek medical attention immediately
the disease is transmitted through the infected bird 's saliva , nasal secretions or feces
it can spread in markets or places where eggs and birds are sold in crowded conditions
the recent cases prompted @entity129 to announce temperature checks on people traveling back from @entity3 , according to the country 's @entity132
@entity129 had two deaths from bird flu this year
the patients , a 31 - year - old man and 21 - year - old woman died in mid-february in the southwestern area of the country
both had close contact with birds , according to @entity144 , the @entity129 news agency
the only other country with a confirmed @entity11 case this year was @entity147 , where a 36 - year - old woman died in late january
@entity149 slaughters 1.2 million chickens infected with bird flu
