-- the @entity1 ended in december , and veterans and other citizens throughout the country have begun clamoring for local parades to celebrate the return of our @entity1 veterans -- yet only one city in the nation , @entity11 , has held one
in @entity14 , which this week hosted a ticker - tape parade for the @entity16 after they won the @entity18 , mayor @entity19 has said he will hold off on a celebration for @entity1 veterans , as the @entity21 has suggested , because he agrees the time is not right
and president @entity23 has yet to call for broader ceremonies besides a small state dinner to be held later this month for only 200 @entity1 veterans
the question of whether we should commemorate our @entity1 veterans is controversial in a way that it should n't be
this is n't about claiming " mission accomplished " prematurely
the troops are finally home , and @entity34 across the political spectrum ought to recognize and celebrate their service
as an @entity1 veteran , i can tell you : this is n't about glorification
nobody joined the military so they 'd one day get to walk under a hail of confetti
but a commemoration is n't about that ; it 's about validating the morally and politically difficult task of serving your country in war
while most veterans will tell you about receiving hearty thank - yous from strangers or a spontaneous round of applause every now and then , what they seldom mention are the people who feel compelled to qualify their appreciation by noting that they opposed the war
it 's time for that to end
less than 1 % of this country has served in @entity1 or @entity65 , and this has created a civil - military divide that has alienated and isolated this generation of veterans
it has tangible consequences across issues of mental health , employment and education
our government has expanded on the best public policy program of the last century by creating the @entity79
yet some veterans struggle to use the program because of the challenge of attending class alongside students with little understanding of the experiences they 've faced
with new veterans facing 12 % unemployment last year , an epidemic of suicides , and the legacy costs of war , we not only need this country 's unreserved support -- we need its sacrifice
@entity34 need to hire our veterans , invest in their education , and expand on services that will help them heal from the scars of war
instead , we risk repeating our society 's @entity102 - era mistake of marginalizing and ignoring returning service members
already there 's been a grass - roots effort in @entity11 to turn this around
on january 28 , two civilians got on @entity109 and organized a parade there that drew 100,000 supporters and 20,000 veterans from throughout the country
more importantly , though , the event was bookended by a resource fair for veterans
my organization , @entity1 and @entity120 , was one of those providing employment , health and education resources to veterans after the parade
this kind of on - the - ground resource is important , because while the federal government has a critical role to play in funding services to veterans , it 's in the cities and local communities that veterans actually are administered the support they need
for example , @entity137 has created a 311 line that connects veterans with local services to give them resources beyond what the @entity144 can provide alone
that 's why the decision of the mayor of one of the greatest cities in the world not to be at the forefront of these efforts is so disappointing
mayor @entity19 , we exercised leadership overseas -- why ca n't you do the same thing at home ? to the argument that holding parades while we 're fighting in @entity65 would be premature , i say consider this : in 2002 , the first of this generation of veterans left the military behind to rejoin their civilian counterparts
since that time , the number has swelled to more than a million
we ca n't afford to wait for these wars to end to start taking care of those that fought in them
these two wars are inexorably intertwined in the @entity34 consciousness , but for many , they remain separate
when the last troops return from @entity65 in a few years , the @entity1 will be a distant memory
for those who served , there will never be closure , but there can be reconciliation
i know firsthand , having protested the @entity1 and then served in it , how complicated the politics of the last decade were
but this is n't about a war overseas ; it 's about a struggle here at home to take care of this generation 's veterans , that we 'll carry with us into old age
as a country , we 're at a critical point where our approach to this generation of veterans will define whether we become the @entity199 or simply forgotten veterans of a forgotten war
i 've seen the tremendous accomplishments of my fellow veterans overseas when we all worked together
now it 's time to do the same thing here at home
will you have our backs ? follow @entity209 on @entity210

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .
