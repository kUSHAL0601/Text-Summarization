seventy seconds : that 's how long a @entity2 family says it took for things to go horribly wrong as they sought police help dealing with their mentally ill son
@entity9 , 18 , died sunday
according to @entity11 affiliate @entity10 , he was just shot 1 minute and 10 seconds after a third law enforcement officer showed up at his @entity14 home
the three officers all were from different jurisdictions , and family members say that the third officer -- who came from a nearby city -- turned what had been an improving situation into an unnecessarily aggressive encounter that ended in their son 's death
" there was no reason to shoot this kid , " the teen 's stepfather , @entity26 , told @entity10 on monday
" they killed my son in cold blood
we called for help , and they killed my son
" although the @entity40 is looking into the shooting , the chief prosecutor for the state 's 13th @entity38 , which includes @entity14 , says it 's way too early to characterize what happened
" i think that we can certainly understand why this family is upset right now , " the @entity44 newspaper quoted district attorney @entity45 as saying
" they just lost a child , and certainly my thoughts and prayers are with them
but what they want from this office today is justice , and i intend to give them exactly that
" @entity11 first learned of the shooting through an @entity59 sent by a family friend
the @entity59 received more than 50,000 views in 24 hours
the incident happened sunday afternoon when the mother and stepfather of the @entity66 man called police
according to stepbrother @entity68 , @entity9 had schizophrenia and " was having an episode , " and his parents wanted police to subdue him so he could get help
" he 's not doing very good
you 've got to get him someplace , " a man who identified himself as @entity9 's stepfather said on a 911 call , a copy of which was obtained by @entity10
" he wants to fight his mother
... she 's scared to death of him right now
" the caller said that @entity9 " wo n't take his medication " and that his family has had " to put him in before , ( and ) he 's getting real bad again
" " he 's just , he 's not right , " he said
two officers arrived and began talking with @entity9 , according to @entity11 affiliate wway
the situation was relatively calm until a third officer -- a detective from the nearby city of @entity97 -- arrived , the family said
" everything was going good , " @entity26 said , according to @entity92
" then this fat cop from @entity97 walks in the room , walks around the corner , says , ' we do n't have time for this
let 's get him out of here
' " the stepfather said @entity9 tried to run but was struck with two @entity111 charges and fell backward
he said the first two officers to respond got on top of @entity9
@entity10 attributed a slightly different accounting of events to @entity26
in that retelling , the stepfather said officers had pinned @entity9 to the ground after he had been tased and one of the officers said , " we do n't have time for this " and shot his stepson
seventy seconds after the third officer arrived , @entity10 reported , citing police records , police radioed that they had had to shoot the teenager in self - defense
@entity68 , who was not at the house but rushed there in an " absolute panic " and claimed that police restrained him , said his family is outraged by what happened and determined to get justice
" we want the truth to be out there , " he said
" we do n't want the good ole cops system to play out something that ai n't the truth
" authorities have not released the exact sequence of events , including how and by whom @entity9 was shot
a @entity97 officer has been placed on paid administrative leave in connection with the shooting , police chief @entity146 said tuesday
authorities have declined to say whether he was the officer who shot @entity9
the @entity14 sheriff 's deputy sent to the scene has been " cleared , " office spokeswoman @entity152 said
a review conducted by its @entity156 found that the deputy did not violate policy , @entity152 added
@entity66 police chief @entity159 said the same thing tuesday of that department 's officer , who was the first to arrive on the scene
the department said in a statement that , after an " internal review , " it concluded that the @entity66 police officer who responded did not violate department policy or state law
neither the district attorney nor the @entity40 returned messages seeking comment tuesday
@entity11 ireporter @entity174 , whom @entity68 described as a good friend of the family 's , described @entity9 as a slight young man who was never violent despite his mental illness
" all he wanted to do was play drums , " @entity180 said
" he was so awesome
" the late teen 's stepbrother said he did everything with @entity9 -- hunting , fishing , sports and more -- describing him as a " good kid
" " he was my little buddy , " @entity68 said
@entity180 said the incident highlights the need for more understanding and awareness of mental illness
" i was devastated by the news and am desperate to find some kind of good that could come from this horrible situation , " @entity180 said
@entity68 offered a similar sentiment , saying his family hopes to start a foundation to help the mentally ill like @entity9
" we 're uniting together , and we 're going to make this go public , " he said of the family 's collaboration with @entity180
" because the way my brother got treated ai n't right
