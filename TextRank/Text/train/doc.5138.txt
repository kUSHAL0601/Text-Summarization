-- @entity1 claimed his first @entity3 title and denied a tearful @entity5 his 14th grand slam crown after another epic five - set victory , 7 - 5 3 - 6 7 - 6 3 - 6 6 - 2 in @entity7 on sunday
@entity1 holds the trophy as an emotional @entity5 takes in his defeat
as expected , it proved a titanic struggle between the two leading players in world tennis , who were meeting for the first time since @entity1 took @entity5 's @entity16 title last july in another five - set classic
@entity1 , who played the longest match in @entity3 history to beat @entity20 in his semifinal , was expected to show signs of tiredness , but it was @entity5 who wilted in the decider
he dropped his service as @entity1 led 4 - 1 and faltered again when serving at 2 - 5 down , saving three match points but eventually succumbing as he hit a forehand long
it left @entity1 the winner after four hours 23 minutes of seesaw action to claim his sixth grand slam title and cement his position as world number one
at the prize presentation a bitterly disappointed @entity5 admitted he had " felt better " before shedding tears as the crowd gave him a standing ovation
he recovered to congratulate @entity1 , the two men sharing a warm embrace of mutual respect
" it is very special for me
it 's a dream win , one grand slam on a hard court , " said the 22 - year - old @entity1 , the first @entity44 player to win the @entity3
" i 've worked very hard all my life to improve my tennis outside of clay
i 'm very happy , very happy to win the title
" the match started with both exchanging early breaks of service until @entity1 pulled ahead with a further break to claim the advantage
the second set followed a similar pattern , with an early exchange of breaks , but this time it was the @entity62 ace who edged it as @entity1 netted to lose a marathon eighth game
@entity5 looked to be getting on top and had no less than six break points on @entity1 's service in the third set , the @entity70 coming back from 0 - 40 down in a pivotal service game
in the tiebreak it was @entity1 who pulled ahead again , reaching set point with a rare volleyed winner and sealing it as @entity5 double faulted
@entity5 showed his fighting qualities to force a decider , but once again it was his nemesis @entity1 who proved the stronger despite spending nearly 10 hours on court in his final two matches at @entity83 .
