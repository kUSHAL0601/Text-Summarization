-- @entity1 , 23 , invented a way for rural families in @entity4 to replace smoky kerosene and firelight with solar power
through his @entity9 , @entity8 , he has distributed an estimated 10,000 solar lanterns for free
@entity1 's work earned him a spot as one of @entity0 's @entity14 for 2010
below are his thoughts on being selected for this honor
q : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a @entity14 @entity21 ? @entity1 : i was sitting watching a comedy show on a local tv station here in @entity26 when i got the call from @entity0
at first , i thought they were just calling to ask questions
then i was told i was in the @entity14
wow ! i am so , so excited
i wish to thank the @entity30 for choosing me
i really feel humbled , considering all the amazing work being done by all of the @entity21 highlighted this year
q : what will this exposure -- and the $ 25,000 award you 'll receive for being a @entity38 -- mean to your work ? @entity1 : i do hope that being in the @entity14 will create even more publicity about the work that we are doing to help poor communities
we really hope to get support from individuals -- and more so from corporate companies and other nonprofits -- to reach our target of lifting 100,000 households out of poverty by 2015 , by giving them lamps and helping them to set up economic ventures
we want to set up a modern workshop , with modern equipment that will include a plastic recycling plant , all for making the lamps
we need support to do this
q : what do you want people to know most about the importance of your work ? @entity1 : just seeing livelihoods change , especially from the small economic ventures that are being set up [ with ] the money initially spent on kerosene ... it 's the best thing we can ever do for these communities
i can talk and talk forever , i am just so excited now
i really feel encouraged , and i will wake up with more energy to do more .
