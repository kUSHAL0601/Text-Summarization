-- it was one of the most unexpected announcements of the year
in april , @entity3 released the news that its lead character , @entity5 , would die in an upcoming issue of " @entity7
" the story wo n't affect the overall @entity10 storylines , as " @entity7 " takes place in an alternate timeline
still , the visual of @entity10 having been gunned down was quite a shock to fans
with the issue , " @entity7 " no. 36 , coming out today , we now know more details about how @entity10 dies ( spoiler alert , of course ! )
@entity20 , the first openly gay character in @entity3 history , is a senator in the " @entity7 " universe , and he 's in favor of gun control
an attempt is made on @entity20 's life , and @entity10 takes the bullet for his friend
" @entity10 died as he lived -- a hero , representing the best in all of us , " @entity3 ceo @entity29 said in a news release
@entity29 spoke to @entity0 in april , when the news was broken
@entity0 : can you explain the " @entity7 " series for the uninitiated ? @entity29 : " @entity7 " is @entity10 's future
it gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college , which has never really been explored
most fans are familiar with @entity10 as a high schooler , hanging out at @entity47 's @entity46 with his friends
" @entity7 " shows what happens when @entity10 becomes an adult and starts dealing with grown - up issues
each issue is normally split into two storylines , one telling a tale of @entity10 married to @entity55 , another with him ending up with @entity57
the final issue , however , will show readers @entity10 's final fate in both timelines -- and they 're the same
@entity0 : why kill @entity10 ? @entity29 : i think it 's the natural conclusion to the " @entity7 " series
@entity10 dies as he lived : heroically
he dies saving the life of a friend and does it in his usual selfless way
@entity10 has always been a representation of us -- the best of us
our strengths and our faults
writer @entity76 , with input from myself , has crafted an emotional , impactful and classic story that i know will survive the test of time
this is n't a random one - off or " what - if " story that we 're doing as a gag
this is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought
this is the death of @entity10 as we see it , and we 're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import
it 's a once - in - a - lifetime event , and we are being very considerate about it
@entity0 : what are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline ? @entity29 : first and foremost , like with anything we do at @entity10 , we want to tell a great , memorable story
that being said , this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the @entity10 brand
we want to not only show how @entity10 's life ends but also what he means to the world around him
we want to celebrate his life
after the events of " @entity7 " no. 36 , fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death
what 's @entity115 doing ? how are @entity57 and @entity55 dealing with the loss ? it 's not about the attention - grab of the death but about telling a great , evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like @entity10 can be and how important it is to realize that
this is n't a story we 're going to retcon a few weeks from now
this is the conclusion to the " @entity7 " story and timeline , and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at @entity10 's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters , not in just comics but in popular culture
we want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions , from happiness , sadness , anger , joy and pride
we want people to react to this in a strong way because @entity10 is so important to them
@entity0 : how do you hope fans will react , ultimately ? @entity29 : we expect some level of shock , outrage and surprise , followed by understanding
as a company , we are not afraid to take risks
we 're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we 're building here at @entity10
i hope fans will be intrigued by this news , pick up the issues in july and realize they 've been given one of the best comics on the stands
they 'll be handed a piece of comic book history , featuring some of the most well - known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon
we want fans to talk about this for years to come
we think this story is bigger than anything we 've ever done
it 's bold , dramatic and best of all , a fitting end to the life of @entity10
@entity0 : what do you think @entity3 has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years ? @entity29 : we 're a sleeping giant
years ago , before i stepped in as ceo , @entity10 was seen as a dormant , nostalgia brand stuck in amber
we were in suspended animation
people thought the stories were still set in the ' 50s ! now , while the characters -- like @entity57 , @entity10 , @entity55 , @entity115 and @entity200 -- are at their core the same , @entity202 has changed
it 's caught up with the times
the town of @entity202 you read about now is like any other in @entity208
it 's diverse , it 's not problem - free , and it represents @entity208 in an honest way
@entity10 is about being welcoming , diverse and entertaining
we 've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention but keep people entertained
from the introduction of @entity20 , the first regular gay character in comics , to now , the death of @entity10 , we 've not been afraid to take risks
the big thing is , though , our risks pay off because the stories , art and execution are spot - on
we back up what we say
@entity0 : what will be the long - term impact of this story ? @entity29 : well , this is the end
this is how @entity10 dies in the pages of " @entity7
" we will not be retconning , reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of " @entity7
" the main @entity10 line , however , telling stories of @entity10 in high school , will continue
" @entity242 " ( the " @entity10 " zombie series ) will continue , and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters
but as far as we see it , this is how @entity10 dies
that 's how we approached this story and how we 're treating it .
