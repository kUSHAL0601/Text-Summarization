@entity1 's attempt to keep people from fattening up on sugary soft drinks , by banning some of them , would disproportionately hurt small , minority - owned businesses , according to the @entity6 and the @entity7
the two groups have filed a joint brief supporting a lawsuit by the @entity11 in which they say @entity1 's unelected @entity13 overstepped its power in approving the ban the sale of sugary drinks bigger than 16 ounces in certain city venues
due to take effect in march , the ban is meant to combat obesity and encourage residents to live healthier lifestyles , according to the @entity1 mayor @entity25 's office
but many have decried the ban as a sign of the growing " nanny - state " and an unfair intrusion on personal freedom
it was passed in september by the @entity33 , following weeks of intense debate
in their jointly - filed amicus brief , the @entity6 @entity35 and the @entity7 repeatedly claim that small , minority - owned businesses will suffer from the ban while their much - larger competitors will get a pass
the ban will " selectively and unfairly harm small and minority - owned businesses by discriminatorily preventing them from selling large ' sugary beverages ' while allowing their large competitors such as 7 - 11 and grocery stores to carry the banned sugary beverages , " according to the brief

the uneven implementation of the ban will harm the very businesses that can least afford it , said @entity7 spokesman @entity63 " any little thing is going to hurt them ... they 're just subsisting , " he said
the mayor 's office reiterated its commitment to the ban on wednesday , citing the prevalence of obesity among minorities as one of the very reasons why the ban is needed
" the obesity crisis impacting the nation , and disproportionately affecting minorities , calls for bold action and we are confident support will grow as more people learn about the unique impact sugary drinks have on this epidemic , " said @entity77 , a spokeswoman for mayor @entity25
@entity88 has also donated thousands of dollars to an @entity6 health education program called @entity90 , which included $ 75,000 over the past two years
the @entity7 received an equal amount from the beverage giant in 2012 , according to @entity93 , the group 's president
" if this was the first time that @entity88 had given us money , sure it would raise questions , " said @entity95 , president of the @entity6 's @entity1 chapter
" but it 's not the first time ... @entity88 has been supporting the @entity6 national and locally through the years
" at 44.1 % , @entity104 blacks have the highest rates of obesity in the @entity107 , according to the @entity108
@entity109 @entity107 have the second - highest at 39.3 %
at a hearing in @entity1 wednesday , an attorney representing the @entity11 laid the groundwork to request a stay of the ban , according to @entity11 spokesman @entity115
" for an unelected board of political appointees to make decisions that will seriously harm the family - owned businesses i grew up with is unacceptable , " said councilwoman @entity116 , who has also filed an amicus brief in support of the @entity11 's suit , in a statement after wednesday 's hearing
in opposing the ban , both the @entity6 and the @entity7 stress that they acknowledge that obesity is a major problem for their respective communities , but that the ban is the wrong approach to the issue
" we 've been screaming bloody murder for decades now " about an obesity crisis in the @entity139 community , @entity63 said
in their court filing , both groups contend the problem would be better addressed " through education and community programs " that " encourage physical activity and a balanced diet
" in addition to justifying the proposal on health grounds , @entity146 has cited cost - saving as an impetus for the policy
@entity1 spends an estimated $ 4 billion each year on medical care for overweight people , the mayor has said
@entity88 weighs in on obesity fight
