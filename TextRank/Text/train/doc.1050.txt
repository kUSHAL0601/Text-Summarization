@entity0 -- a part - time stripper fired from her full - time newspaper job covering @entity5 high society claims she 's a victim of gender discrimination
@entity7 , 30 , filed a complaint this week asking the @entity10 @entity9 to investigate the @entity12 's decision to let her go after another paper revealed her second job
@entity7 covered high society , general assignments , human interest stories , men 's and women 's fashion and other stories for the newspaper for two months , @entity7 said at a @entity0 news conference thursday
but she " very rarely " worked as a dancer , a skill that helped her pay for college , she said
" sometimes i would just go in for three hours at a time to get a workout in because stage rotation , if you 're doing it in 7 - inch heels , is a really good way to get a workout in , " @entity7 said
" and i did n't have a gym membership
so , on days off i might just go in there in the afternoon and do a couple stage rotations and knock it out
" a rival newspaper , tipped off by an online blog titled " diary of an @entity41 " she wrote anonymously , published a story about her background in march
she was soon told by an editor that she was fired for not disclosing her dancing experience on her job application , @entity7 said
" there was no question on the form that covered my dancing
i answered the questions on the form honestly
" " i was very upset that i was fired , because i had been told by many editors that i was doing a good job , " @entity7 said
@entity56 , a @entity57 lawyer known for championing high - profile cases involving women 's rights , is representing her
she called the firing gender discrimination , which is covered by federal law
" most exotic dancers are female , and therefore to terminate an employee because they had previously been an exotic dancer would have an adverse impact on women , since it is a female - dominated occupation , " @entity56 said
the newspaper management remained mum about @entity7 's charge
" we have not seen the complaint and thus can not comment , " @entity12 spokeswoman @entity69 said thursday
@entity7 , who has a master 's degree in journalism , said that when she decided to dance to pay for college , she did n't think it would keep her from pursuing the career she was trying to build
" some young women will use dancing as a way to make ends meet while they study to prepare for the career that they hope to be able to have for the rest of their lives , " @entity7 said
" these women should not have to live in fear that once they acquire a position in the career that they have worked hard to achieve , that their past work experience as a dancer will jeopardize that position
" she broke no laws by dancing , @entity56 said , and it " does not , has not and will not affect her ability to perform her job as a journalist
" @entity7 said has already found a new writing job in @entity100 for a publication she declined to name
she insisted she has no plan to parlay the media attention into a job covering high society in @entity0
" i really like @entity100 , " she said .
