@entity4 , @entity5 -- " troubling and counterproductive " rhetoric from @entity2 is inflaming tensions on the @entity8 , but ultimately , " we will judge @entity2 by its actions , not its words , " the @entity1 envoy to @entity2 said friday
in its latest bout of saber - rattling , @entity2 on friday warned of the possibility of " strong physical counter-measures " against @entity5 after the @entity16 imposed tougher sanctions against the @entity18 earlier this week
the threat against @entity5 came a day after the @entity18 said it would carry out a new nuclear test and more long - range rocket launches as part of a new phase of confrontation with the @entity1
the statement friday from @entity2 's @entity26 said it would take action against @entity5 if it " takes a direct part " in the @entity16 sanctions
@entity30 slams @entity2 the @entity31 declined to comment specifically on the new threats from @entity33
it reiterated its stance that @entity2 should refrain from further provocations
" now is a moment when i think all parties in the six - party process , in particular here , @entity2 , should turn their attention to how to peacefully and diplomatically address challenges that concern them , " @entity1 envoy @entity37 said from @entity38
the two @entity47 have technically still been at war since the all - out conflict between them in the 1950s
smaller scale clashes have occurred since then , most recently in november 2010 when @entity2 shelled a @entity5 island , killing several people
@entity5 and the @entity1 are often the focus of menacing language from @entity33 , but the latest @entity16 sanctions , a response to a long - range rocket launched last month by the @entity18 , appear to have prompted a ratcheting up of the threats
opinion : for the @entity16 and @entity2 -- game on a displeased @entity64 editorial at the same time , @entity2 's strong words and vow to conduct a third nuclear test -- previous ones took place in 2006 and 2009 -- appear to be testing the patience of its main ally , @entity64 , which voted in favor of the @entity16 sanctions this week
an editorial published friday in the @entity76 - language edition of the state - run @entity64 newspaper @entity77 struck a displeased tone over @entity33 's comments a day earlier
" @entity64 's role and position are clear when discussing the @entity2 issue in the @entity30 , " the editorial said
" if @entity2 engages in further nuclear tests , @entity64 will not hesitate to reduce its assistance to @entity2
" that prospect carries weight , since @entity2 's impoverished economy relies heavily on @entity64 to stay afloat
@entity77 , whose editorial line often but not always reflects official @entity64 policy , made it clear , though , that @entity38 is n't about to cut @entity33 loose
timeline : @entity2 's rocket - fueled obsession " if the @entity1 , @entity97 and @entity5 promote extreme @entity16 sanctions on @entity2 , @entity64 will resolutely stop them and force them to amend these draft resolutions , " the editorial said
@entity77 noted that @entity38 had put " a lot of effort into amendments " to the resolution approved by the @entity30 this week
" it seems that @entity2 does not appreciate @entity64 's efforts , " it said
" it criticized @entity64 without explicitly naming it in its statement yesterday
" the newspaper was referring to a passage in the controversial @entity2 statement thursday that said that " big countries , which are obliged to take the lead in building a fair world order , are abandoning without hesitation even elementary principle , under the influence of the @entity1 arbitrary and high - handed practices
" the @entity77 editorial also suggested that @entity2 should n't rank too highly among @entity64 's priorities
" @entity64 hopes for a stable peninsula , but it 's not the end of the world if there 's trouble there , " it said , referring to the @entity8 that comprises @entity120
" this should be the baseline of @entity64 's position
" the @entity128 on thursday had urged @entity2 and the @entity129 to " keep calm , remain cautious and refrain from any action that might escalate the situation in the region
" how dangerous is @entity2 's nuke capability ? @entity1 concerned but prepared @entity1 secretary of defense @entity134 said thursday there are no " outward indications " that @entity2 is about to conduct a nuclear test , but he admitted it would be hard to determine that in advance
" they have the capability , frankly , to conduct these tests in a way that makes it very difficult to determine whether or not they are doing it , " he said in a @entity141 press conference
" we are very concerned with @entity2 's continuing provocative behavior , " @entity134 said , but he added that the @entity1 is " fully prepared " to deal with any provocations
