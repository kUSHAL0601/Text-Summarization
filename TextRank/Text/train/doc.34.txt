-- if the last several years have taught us anything , it 's that the world is in constant flux
regimes topple , borders are redrawn , whole countries are born anew
while the fighters are remaking their world , however , the lovers are evidently stuck in the 1800s
ask anyone what the world 's most romantic cities are and they 'll likely reply in kneejerk fashion , " @entity18 ... " " @entity19 ... " " @entity20 ... " but what 's so romantic about coffee breath , crumbling infrastructure and the smell of urine ? and what is romance , anyway ? is it a ride on a unicorn over a rainbow through a glitter storm ? or is it the excitation of the senses that forms the preamble for the box spring bustle ? dispensing with the typical fairytale travel planning , we 've opted for a more results - oriented approach to crowning the world 's most romantic cities
because while a romantic city should grab hold of your heart , it should n't stop there
sure , there 's an element of magic to a romantic city , but that magic is supposed to beget love or at least the making thereof
and these cities are municipal viagra
@entity57 , @entity58 place : this former @entity61 colony on the @entity62 offers all of the ornate architecture , rich food and freely flowing booze of @entity18 , without the @entity66
but belying the carefree geniality of its gumbo of assorted peoples is a dark mantle of sinful abandon and occult worship that makes the @entity57 colorful , crass and occasionally creepy
7 under - the - radar cultural destinations people : once the fifth - largest city in @entity76 , @entity57 has been content for decades to rest on its leisure laurels , promoting an atmosphere of laissez faire inhibition that provokes many visitors to spontaneous fits of nudity
things : the charm , fun and filth of the @entity90 ; the mist and mystery of the bayou ; the pomp and botany of the @entity96 ; the majesty of the mighty @entity62
@entity98 , @entity99 place : @entity101 included on lists of romantic things : fear
but it 's an exciting feeling all the same , just one among many aroused in the former capital of communism
it 's all here : the derelict and the opulent , the authoritarian and the lawless , the oligarchic and the proletarian
generations of strife and triumph abound : a @entity119 palace beside a @entity121 square beside a capitalist @entity122
people : loving is romantic but fighting can be too , and @entity98 are historically adroit at both
for those who find romance in power , there 's always plenty on display , as well as a notorious live - for - today attitude that has yet to find the envelope
things : the intellectual arousal of its late night bookstores ; the metamorphosed grandeur of @entity140 ; old factories and warehouses transformed into galleries , clubs and performance spaces ; countless monuments to lovers ; vanishing vestiges of the @entity150 era
@entity151 , @entity152 place : you know what 's romantic ? a beach
you know what 's not romantic ? barf - discharging college kids , shrill children ( shrilldren ? ) and sunburnt albinos in socks and sandals , making coastal mainstays like @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity167 as enchanting as hair on soap
there 's nothing more romantic than being as far from other people as possible , and no other capital city offers this kind of isolation with this kind of beachfront
travel on the cheap : 5 times to go plus , the architecture of this former @entity183 colony often mimics that of its former empire
it 's like they put @entity188 somewhere good
people : it 's 80 degrees ( 27 c ) almost every day of the year -- warm and cool enough to keep clothes and sweating respectively minimal
things : the transcendence of its pristine beaches ; the prehistoric beauty of @entity198 ( the reputed original @entity199 ) ; the eroticism of moutya dancing , which increases as the rhythm quickens
@entity203 , @entity204 place : assimilating generations of native @entity204 , @entity208 expats and @entity210 and @entity211 immigrants , @entity203 is a petri dish of fiery @entity214 and @entity215 culture
but , contrasting their showier @entity220 brethren to the north , the flash and passion of @entity218 simmers without boiling over , yielding a city renowned as much for art and architecture as it is for spherical backsides
people : porteños are an amorous lot , with some of that @entity18 poutiness , only supplemented by actionable desire
it 's a sentiment that often transfers osmotically to visiting tourists
things : the electrostatic sensuality generated by tango -- watched or danced ; the lawns full of frisky youth at @entity239 ; the unparalleled showcase for the city 's passion and potency that is soccer at @entity244
also : always order the steak
@entity246 , @entity247 place : the canals of @entity19
even if you do n't partake of the @entity257 capital 's approved vices , there 's a romance that accompanies the freedom to do so
you know what 's not romantic ? bus fumes
which is why anything in this city is accessible by boat , bike or boot
people : the town is to professionals what @entity272 and @entity273 are to amateurs , offering at the front door the sex and drugs everyone else keeps in back
amsterdammers are the sinful world 's grown - ups
things : the titillation of women twisting in the windows of the @entity288 ; the puritanical eye of the @entity288 's carnal storm that is @entity291 ( " old church " ) ; 10 p.m. summer sunsets ; a kiss under the @entity295 ( " skinny bridge " ) , ensuring fidelity
@entity298 , @entity299 place : think old stuff is romantic ? well , it 's still 1959 in the capital of @entity299 , where the development -- and commercialism -- of the outside world has yet to sneak past the bouncers
the resultant sensations of risk and antiquity in this forbidden time warp make romance unavoidable
so if you ever wanted to have sex in the 1950s , here 's your chance -- but time 's running out
7 ways to go local while traveling people : just about everyone in @entity298 is an artist of some kind , underscored by live music -- and dancing -- everywhere
while not as outwardly sexual as some @entity326 capitals , this populace is as carnal as they come
things : the bars ' n ' cigars of @entity332 's @entity298 ; the intimacy of dinner at an in - home paladar ; the unspoiled virginity of the @entity337 ; the fear - and awe - inspiring @entity338
@entity339 , @entity211 place : if having nowhere to be is your idea of romance , the capital of @entity342 wins on two counts : it 's easy to get happily lost and no one wakes up until 8 p.m. like @entity349 or @entity350 , @entity339 is dense , cultured and cosmopolitan , and is also a beach town , offering fickle lovers a broad romantic spectrum
one avenue that 's no longer available to paramours ? public nudity
it was finally -- in some cases , mercifully -- banned in 2011
people : trend - centric , cocksure , proud and partying , @entity361 will steal your heart if not your wallet
things : the weird feeling in one 's pants upon beholding @entity370 architecture ; the corpuscle of seemingly endless branching alleyways housing the galleries , cafés , bars , restaurants and museums of the @entity379 neighborhood
no two trips are ever alike
@entity18 , @entity61 place : ok
hard as it is to admit , even the laziest " romantic cities " lists are right -- the @entity384 is still among earth 's most enchanting municipalities
@entity18 is an urban engineering conundrum : its architecture all differs vastly , yet simultaneously adheres to a singular , uniform vision , making the world 's most visited city also probably its most beautiful
there , we said it
people : @entity397 , self - righteous , indolent , aloof , tempestuous , hot
the contemptibility of @entity66 is exceeded only by the self - hatred among those of us who lust for them
things : the stupid views of the entire city from @entity406 ; the lousy majesty of the @entity408 ; the crummy uplifting @entity409 of " @entity410 's " ; the idiot engineering marvel of the @entity412 ; the rotten eroticism of @entity414 ; the insufferable grandeur of the @entity416
