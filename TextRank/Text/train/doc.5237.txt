-- an @entity3 grand jury on friday indicted a 52 - year - old man , alleging that he " pulled the trigger " to kill three men who had answered a @entity8 ad for work on a cattle farm , authorities said
@entity11 faces multiple counts of aggravated murder , kidnapping and aggravated robbery as well as a host of other charges , according to the 28 - page indictment released friday by the @entity20 prosecutor 's office
ohio attorney general @entity21 acknowledged there may be more victims , and thus more charges
" we are dealing with serial killings here , " @entity21 told reporters , pleading for the public to provide more information
" are there more bodies ? frankly , we do n't know
if there are , we need to find them
" as outlined in the indictment , @entity11 is the " principal offender " in the murders of three men between august and november 2011 , @entity20 prosecutor @entity34 said
he could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted , given that the murders could meet one or more requirements for that sentence including purposely causing the death of two or more people and murdering people while a fugitive , committing a kidnapping and / or committing armed robbery
" this case deserves the death penalty for a multitude of reasons , " @entity34 said
" this case , we view to be one of the worst of the worst when it comes to horrible murder cases
" @entity11 will be formally arraigned on the charges next wednesday morning , prosecutor 's office spokeswoman april @entity55 told @entity0 affiliate @entity58 by e-mail
he has been in custody at the @entity20 jail since november 16 , 2011 , on unrelated charges -- including drug trafficking and promoting prostitution -- according to jail records posted online
the victims -- @entity67 , 56 , of @entity68 , @entity3 ; @entity70 , 51 , of @entity71 , @entity72 ; and @entity73 , 47 , of @entity74 , @entity3 -- were found dead in separate shallow graves after responding to an online ad soliciting workers , authorities have said
the investigation into the killings began the night of november 6 , when a @entity81 deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a " white , middle - aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm , " according to sheriff @entity86 of @entity81
the wounded man -- who was identified in the indictment as @entity89 , 48 , from @entity90 -- told the law enforcement officer that he had answered an ad on the @entity8 website offering work caring for cattle on a 688 - acre property in eastern @entity3
he met with two males , including @entity11 , and drove with them toward @entity98 , @entity3
after being told a road was closed due to a landslide , @entity89 got out of the car to start walking toward the property , which he was told was nearby
@entity89 told the sheriff that , while walking through a heavily wooded area , he turned around " to see a gun pointed at his head
he deflected the gun and ran " -- getting shot in the arm while fleeing , the sheriff explained late last year
the victim hid for seven hours in the forest before going to a house and requesting help , @entity86 said
" @entity89 lived to tell the tale , but as his story got out , more information came forward about other missing persons who had answered similar @entity8 ads , " said @entity21 , speaking at friday 's news conference with @entity34
the third victim , @entity73 , was killed one week after @entity89 's escape , according to authorities
the attorney general said that the victims were all " down on their luck " men trying to take advantage of an opportunity to " have a better life
" " tragically , it ended in their deaths , " he added
@entity133 , 16 , of @entity134 , @entity3 , who is a high school sophomore , is facing charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder in connection with the killings , and prosecutors are seeking to try him as an adult , according to @entity0 affiliates @entity142 and @entity58
@entity133 's father , @entity144 , told @entity58 in late november that his son had been " manipulated " and " corrupted , " insisting that the teenager is a " mild - mannered gentleman
" the father also said that his son unwittingly dug the graves at @entity11 's direction , @entity58 reported
the boy 's mother said her son denied killing anyone and added that @entity11 portrayed himself as " a chaplain " who gave food to the homeless
@entity34 , the @entity20 prosecutor , noted friday that the judge had imposed a " gag order " in that case , " so we can not give any comments
" as to @entity11 , he will be arraigned on 27 counts -- including , besides the aggravated murder charges , four for aggravated robbery , four for kidnapping , two for grand theft and one for identity fraud -- according to the indictment
@entity21 said the case should serve as a " warning " about the potential perils of the @entity174
he noted that while there are many legitimate uses for the classified website , " many people ... use @entity8 for horrible reasons
" " i 'm shocked and i 'm sickened by how technology and the @entity174 were used in this case to draw in vulnerable people and then execute them , " he said
@entity0 's @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .
