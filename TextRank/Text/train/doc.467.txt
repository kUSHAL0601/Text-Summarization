the @entity0 is getting ready to " swarm " its adversaries
the @entity3 over the weekend released video of tests conducted in august that showed five " drone " boats swarming a vessel that posed a threat to a @entity0 ship
" the @entity0 is unleashing a new era in advanced ship protection , " the service says in the video
controlled by what the @entity0 calls @entity16 for @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , a sensor and software kit that is transferable among small vessels , a fleet of more than a dozen small unmanned boats cruise along the @entity24 in @entity25 , setting up a protective screen on a @entity0 research ship
when a threatening vessel is detected , five boats break off to confront it
" if i was the actual target it would be pretty intimidating to see five boats rushing at me , " @entity31 , pilot of the " bad guy " vessel , said in the @entity0 video
one developer likened the robot boats to " guard dogs " that could swim around a warship and detect threats before they come within striking range
and like dogs , the robot boats actually think for themselves , with their software choosing the best route for each boat to confront a threatening vessel
the drone boats could be armed to fire on adversaries , but fire control would come from a sailor on an accompanying warship
the system also allows the @entity0 to save money because no special boats have to be built to deploy it
the boats used in the august demonstration came from inventory now carried on @entity0 warships , the @entity0 video said
" any boat can be fitted with a kit that allows it to operate autonomously and together swarm on any threat , " the video says
the @entity18 software was originally designed for @entity69 's @entity68 rovers , the @entity0 video says , and adapted for use by small boats
the @entity0 released the video just a week before the 14th anniversary of the terrorist attack on the destroyer @entity76 in @entity77 that killed 17 @entity79 sailors
the @entity76 was attack by a small boat packed with explosives which blew a 40 - foot - by - 60 - foot hole in the side of the destroyer when detonated
it 's the kind of attack @entity0 officials think a swarm of unmanned surface vessels , or @entity90 , could prevent without putting any sailors in harm 's way
" while the attack on @entity76 was not the only motivation for developing autonomous swarm capability , it certainly is front and center in our minds , and hearts , " rear adm. @entity94 , chief of naval research , said in a statement
" if @entity76 had been supported by autonomous @entity105 , they could have stopped that attack long before it got close to our brave men and women on board
" the @entity0 release says swarmboat capabilities could also play a role in protecting @entity79 ports
the @entity115 was part of the tests the @entity0 carried out in august
with the success of the august tests , the system could soon be in use within the @entity0 's fleet
" we believe we will be able to deliver this to the fleet for operational testing within one year , " @entity123 , spokesman for the @entity3 , said monday .
