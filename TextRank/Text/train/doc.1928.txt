-- the 6 - year - old boy swallowed whole in an @entity4 sand dune over the weekend could make a full recovery , a medical official said monday
rescuers dug furiously for three and a half hours to extract little @entity8 , who was recovered unconscious and rushed to the @entity10 's @entity9
but @entity11 , medical director at the hospital 's pediatric intensive care unit , said doctors are signaling progress and possibly a full recovery
the boy is on a ventilator , she said , and is breathing at the capacity of a moderate intensive - care - unit pneumonia patient
he could have his breathing tube out later this week and could be out of the hospital in 10 days to two weeks with rehabilitation to follow , @entity11 said
it 's unclear what kind of lasting health issues he may have
authorities have said they do n't believe @entity8 suffered brain damage from a lack of oxygen and there were no significant injuries to his eyes
a single air pocket in the dune may have saved his life , officials said
at present , doctors are trying to clear sand from his lungs
a family outing turned nightmare the boy and his family had gone friday to @entity46 at @entity47 , in the northwestern corner of the state
it was a day meant to be a fun family vacation at the beach on the @entity54 shoreline
pastor @entity55 , @entity8 's grandfather , said his daughter and son - in - law went with another couple and their children
the incident occurred after the fathers decided to climb @entity46
@entity8 and a friend followed
then the unexpected happened : sounds of screams and a boy lost in the sand
@entity8 had stepped in a sinkhole , and a friend yelled to the fathers that the child was gone , the grandfather said
the fathers frantically tried to dig him out , but the more they dug , the deeper @entity8 seemed to sink in the 11 - foot mound
a call for help went out immediately
rescuers stay focused @entity78 : 9 - 1 - 1
caller : i 'm at the @entity46
and my friend 's son , he got stuck in the sand dune , and he 's like under the sand and they ca n't get him out
@entity78 : ok , can anybody see him or is he completely covered by sand ? caller : uh , yes
my husband and his dad are trying to dig him out
dozens of first responders rushed to the scene with shovels in hand
heavy excavation equipment also was called in
they raced against the clock
" there was lots and lots of guys hand digging , trying to expose him making sure nobody was going to hurt him or anything with any equipment , " one of the rescuers , @entity98 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity100
" we were really losing hope fast , and we tried to just stay focused , " @entity111 firefighter @entity110 told @entity0 affiliate @entity112
" the first two hours was complete misery

@entity8 was cold and appeared lifeless but had a heartbeat
he was trapped vertically in the sand
" one minute you 're thinking , ' we do n't know what we 're going to have , ' and you 're thinking the worst
then you 're hoping for the best , " @entity98 said
" once i had a hold of his head , " @entity110 said , " i was ... just talking to him , you know , just like i would talk to my own son
