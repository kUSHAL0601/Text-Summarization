@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sudden end to a legal battle between dethroned @entity6 @entity5 and pageant officials was prompted by the revelation of a " sex tape , " according to a source familiar with the lawsuits ' settlement
@entity5 was fired in june after lingerie - modeling photos of her emerged that pageant officials said were a breach of her contract
@entity5 sued the pageant in august , arguing her firing was religious discrimination because of her opposition to same - sex marriage
pageant officials countersued last month , demanding their former beauty queen repay $ 5,200 in pageant money spent for her breast implants and give them all proceeds from a book she 's written
a settlement of both lawsuits was signed in @entity29 tuesday , but no details were made public
lawyers and parties for each side were bound by a confidentiality pledge , according to the source
the veil of secrecy was partially lifted wednesday after celebrity gossip web site @entity38 reported the deal was sealed after pageant lawyers presented an " extremely graphic " home video involving @entity5
@entity38 managing editor @entity43 said during a webcast wednesday that he obtained the @entity5 video during the summer , but found it " too racy " to post on his site
he indicated @entity5 was alone in the video
the source with knowledge of the settlement talks told @entity2 those details were accurate
@entity5 's lawyer , @entity51 , responded with a short statement issued through an employee at his law office
" it 's a confidential settlement , and he ca n't discuss it , " the statement said
several calls and e-mail to @entity5 's publicist were not returned wednesday
@entity5 's tell - all book hits bookstores next week , and she is scheduled for media interviews to promote it
pageant spokesman @entity62 said tuesday the settlement means all lawsuit demands are dropped
the pageant had claimed that the contract she signed when she entered their competition last year gave the pageant the rights to anything she wrote
the settlement ended that claim
pageant officials also dropped their attempt to be repaid for her breast enhancement , which was done before she represented @entity1 in the @entity80 competition , according to @entity62
@entity5 , in exchange , withdrew her suit accusing the pageant of violating her privacy by confirming to reporters that her breasts were enhanced , @entity62 said
" we are moving forward from the past and looking towards the crowning of two winners and the new look of the upcoming @entity6 pageant , telecast live on november 22 , " pageant executive director @entity87 said tuesday
" we 're back in the business of beauty , " he told @entity2
there was nothing pretty about the public fight that began in april when @entity5 , 22 , stepped into controversy by declaring her opposition to same - sex marriage while answering a judge 's question at the @entity80 pageant
@entity5 finished as first runner - up
while state and national pageant officials publicly supported her initially , their opinions eventually changed after she continued to make public statements about same - sex marriage
she held onto her crown through may , despite a series of questionable photos that emerged on gossip web sites
those images showed a topless @entity5 , photographed from behind
she was dethroned in june by @entity80 pageant owner @entity118 amid growing complaints by state officials that she was uncooperative and not meeting her contractual obligations
@entity5 filed her lawsuit in @entity123 in august , claiming that her firing was religious discrimination because of her stand against same - sex marriage
the pageant 's countercomplaint said what it called @entity5 's belligerent behavior , lack of cooperation and contract breaches caused her firing , not her opposition to same - sex marriage .
