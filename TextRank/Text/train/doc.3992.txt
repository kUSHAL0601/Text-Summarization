they called 911 and performed cpr until emergency crews arrived and took over , police spokeswoman @entity74 said
the spokeswoman said when @entity2 was found , she was " unresponsive , meaning not breathing , no heartbeat

" on monday , a source close to the family told @entity4 that @entity2 was in " really bad shape
" everyone is " hoping for the best , preparing for the worst " and " praying for a miracle , " the source said
nobody knows what caused @entity2 's unresponsiveness , @entity74 said , but police consider it a medical incident at this time
she said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug - or alcohol - related
the incident report referenced a drowning
police had been to @entity2 's residence recently
somebody reported a fight there on january 23 , but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation , @entity74 said
almost three years ago , @entity13 was found dead in a bathtub at the @entity117 near @entity118 , hours before she was to attend a @entity120 party
a coroner ruled her february 11 , 2012 , death an accidental drowning , with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors
@entity2 is her only child
" she encourages me and inspires me , " @entity13 once said of her daughter
" when i look at her eyes and i see myself , i go , ' ok
' " @entity2 was born in 1993 during @entity13 's marriage to @entity20 singer @entity14 , which ended in divorce in 2007
the daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid- 2000s reality show " being @entity14 , " in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front - row seat to their marital fireworks
mother and daughter performed together on national tv in 2009 , when the two sang " @entity151 " in @entity148 on @entity150 's " @entity149
" given the pair 's close relationship , it 's no surprise that @entity13 's death was a major blow
days after her mother 's body was found , a grieving @entity2 -- then 18 -- was taken to @entity161 because she was " overwhelmed , " family friend @entity157 said
" she loves hard , " @entity157 said then of @entity2
" she 's going to be ok , and we 're going to see to it
" after @entity13 's death , @entity2 talked of pursuing a career in acting and music , just like her mother
in 2012 , she reportedly lobbied for a role in a planned biopic of her mother 's life
@entity174 's " @entity13 , " which was directed by actress @entity175 , debuted in january 2015 , but the @entity13 family was not involved
@entity2 did make her acting debut in 2012 on @entity178 's show " @entity179
" her performance in the small role won praise from @entity178
" she did a fantastic job , " he said at the time
" and that kid has such a future
she 's such an actor
" even before her mother 's death , videos of @entity2 singing surfaced on @entity190 and were quickly criticized by fans who felt her talent did not live up to @entity13 's
concerns that she may have substance abuse issues , as her mother did , intensified in july 2014 after a picture was posted on her @entity197 account showing a young woman who looked like @entity2 appearing to be smoking from a bong
the image had previously made the media rounds two years prior
the caption read : " this picture may be inappropriate but i want to make a connection with you all
do n't worry this picture is n't recent just hear me out
do you know what i feel ? i feel strange i ca n't feel any pain anymore
i do n't take any drugs as of recently
but then there is some situation that force me to do things and the impact i 'll feel pain
i did and i do
" @entity2 later denied that she posted the photo and tweeted that it was done by someone attempting to tarnish her image
@entity2 appeared on episodes of @entity174 's brief reality show " the @entity220 : on our own , " which followed her life after @entity13 's death
one of the show 's story lines revolved around @entity2 's relationship with @entity10 , who had lived with @entity13 and her daughter since he was 12 years old
@entity2 reportedly got engaged to @entity10 , and in january 2014 , she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings along with the words , # @entity232 so # @entity233
" however , @entity14 attorney @entity9 said @entity2 was never married to @entity10
" ( @entity13 ) made me promise several times to look after @entity2 ... and , @entity239 , i will never , ever , ever break that promise , " @entity10 told the entertainment show " extra " afterward , saying @entity13 " just treated me like she gave birth to me
" it was unclear whether @entity10 and @entity71 came into the home saturday morning to find @entity2 in the bathtub or if they had been in another part of the house overnight , said @entity74 , the police spokeswoman
the whereabouts of another man who was in the house when @entity2 was found , @entity71 , are also unclear
but in response to several media outlets reporting @entity71 ' lengthy rap sheet , attorney @entity254 issued a statement tuesday saying his client is a cooperative witness and @entity71 ' most recent arrest in january has nothing to do with @entity2 's hospitalization
@entity254 also told @entity4 wednesday that his client was the one who actually found @entity2 and called 911
@entity254 's comments came after he met with @entity31 police for two hours ; his client was not at the meeting , he said
on january 15 , @entity71 was booked on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute , possession of alprazolam ( aka @entity269 , an anti-anxiety drug ) and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or the attempt to commit a felony , according to @entity278 spokeswoman @entity277
@entity4 has also learned from @entity279 and @entity281 authorities that @entity71 was arrested at least three times in 2011 and 2012 and charged with a host of crimes , including battery and alcohol , weapons , drug and probation violations
@entity254 did not mention the previous arrests in his statement
" mr. @entity71 ' widely reported recent arrest is completely unrelated to the incidents that occurred at ms. @entity2 's residence and there is absolutely no relationship between the events
he has pleaded not guilty to those charges , " it said
" mr. @entity71 has not been accused of anything in connection with @entity2 's injuries
" police obtained a search warrant to look through @entity2 's house , but that 's standard procedure , @entity74 said
concern for @entity2 came from many in the entertainment world
music director @entity311 sent along " healing energy to the daughter of a late great friend
" songwriter @entity315 tweeted , " i hope @entity2 gets the help she needs
" " poor thing , " @entity318 wrote
" almost 3 yrs to the day her mom passed and the same thing almost happened to her
" @entity4 's @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 and @entity328 contributed to this report .
