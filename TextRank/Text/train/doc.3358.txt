-- some athletes respond to a proverbial kick up the backside , but @entity4 seems to have found inspiration from the prick of a cactus thorn
the @entity8 canceled a humanitarian trip to @entity10 to play in this week 's @entity11 , hoping to rediscover his form ahead of next week 's masters
the two - time major winner added @entity15 to his @entity17 buildup after registering just one top - 10 finish since signing a lucrative deal with @entity20 in january which could be worth as much as $ 250 million , and losing the top ranking to @entity22
while thursday 's first - round 72 left him five strokes off the lead , @entity4 roared back with a five - under - par 67 that left him two off the halfway pace
the world @entity27 had a mixed opening few holes , and he dropped his second shot of friday 's second round following a close encounter with a flower of the desert on the ninth fairway
" i should n't have been there anyways , so i guess it was deserved , getting a -- whatever it was -- off the cactus , " @entity4 said on the @entity37 website
the 23 - year - old responded with a birdie at 11 , and three more at the last three holes to end the day tied for fifth and in sight of pacesetter @entity46
" i definitely feel like i made the right decision to come here , and even if i had n't been in this position and have been a few shots back i 'd still feel the same way , " @entity4 said
" i have n't really been in contention this year
so it will be nice to get into the mix. " while his shotmaking has been erratic at times , @entity4 's long game is in fine shape
he managed to get to the green in two at the par - five eighth and 18th -- the latter after a 325 - yard tee shot -- though he missed eagle putts at both
" i think that shows where my game is , " @entity4 said
" those two par - fives are probably the toughest to hit in two with how small the greens are
it shows that my ball - striking is there
if i can keep hitting shots like that into par - fives , i 'll be doing ok
" @entity4 tied for 45th at last week 's @entity74 , where @entity46 was joint second behind @entity76
the @entity77 closed with two birdies to sign for a 68 and take a handy lead over compatriots @entity81 ( 69 ) and @entity82 ( 67 ) as well as @entity84 's @entity83 ( 69 )
two - time major winner @entity85 missed the halfway cut by one shot after following up his 76 with 70 , finishing birdie - bogey - birdie .
