@entity0 -- video showing a naked man being sprayed by an aid worker , apparently as part of a medical treatment and in full view of other migrants on the @entity10 island of @entity11 , has sparked outrage in @entity13
the secretly filed cellphone footage , aired on @entity10 state television channel @entity15 , shows a worker at a migrant center spraying the man while others wait for what officials said was a medical treatment designed to prevent a contagious skin condition called scabies
while the camp manager told @entity1 on wednesday that the video is misleading , the speaker for @entity10 's lower house of @entity28 , @entity29 , said in a post on the body 's facebook page that the reported treatment of migrants was " degrading " and " not worthy of a civilized country
" " those images can not leave us indifferent , " said @entity29 , who was the spokeswoman for several years for the @entity37 refugee agency in @entity0
she said efforts would be made to find those responsible and hold them accountable
the @entity10 @entity43 ordered an inquiry tuesday and said it expected a report from the local authorities within 24 hours
@entity49 home affairs commissioner @entity48 condemned the images -- reportedly shot by a migrant at the camp -- as " appalling and unacceptable
" she said the @entity53 would ask the @entity10 authorities to " shed full light " over what had happened
" we have already started investigations on the deplorable conditions in many @entity10 detention centers , including @entity11 , and we will not hesitate to launch an infringement procedure to make sure @entity49 standards and obligations are fully respected , " she said in a statement wednesday
" our assistance and support to the @entity10 authorities in managing migratory flows can only be continued if the country guarantees humane and dignified reception conditions to migrants , asylum seekers and refugees
" camp manager @entity73 told @entity1 wednesday that accusations that camp staff were humiliating migrants were offensive
" we are aware of what the video shows , " @entity73 said
" but that is not exactly how things work and what really happened
" usually , he said , migrants are given a preventative treatment for scabies inside showers contained in an enclosed cabin where greater privacy can be afforded
they are then given clean clothes to wear , @entity73 said
but he said on the day the video was shot , which he said was december 13 , migrants tired of standing in line began removing their clothes before getting inside the cabin
some asked for the treatment to be done in the open to speed up the process
" in retrospect we should have stopped the treatment that day , " he said
" but at the prospect of either hypothetically breaching the law for omitting to give health assistance to a refugee or hypothetically breaching his / her right to privacy , i opted for the second one
" shipwreck deaths @entity11 made global headlines when more than 300 @entity112 migrants died after their ship sank off its shores on october 3
days later , another 34 people died when their boat capsized
hundreds more have been rescued from often unseaworthy vessels and taken to the tiny @entity121 island 's overcrowded detention center
as the closest @entity10 island to @entity112 , @entity11 is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter @entity49 countries and shipwrecks off its shores are common
many of the migrants are from @entity112 nations , while others have fled war - torn @entity132 , officials say
the @entity10 coast guard told @entity1 in september that there were some 1,250 migrants in residence , in a space designed for 250
in the wake of the october tragedy , the @entity37 refugee agency called on @entity10 urgently to renovate the @entity11 detention center
the agency 's @entity0 - based representative , @entity143 , said the center 's capacity had been reduced from 850 to 250 by a fire in 2011 and had yet to be restored
" the serious degradation of the reception center , with entire families forced to sleep in the open when it rains , is absolutely unacceptable , " he said
he described conditions and services there as below @entity49 standards and urged @entity10 to speed up the transfer of migrants and asylum seekers to better equipped centers on the mainland
