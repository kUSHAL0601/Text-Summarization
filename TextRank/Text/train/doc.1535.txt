-- @entity2 's soccer players can heal the " suffering " caused by the country 's match - fixing scandal by winning @entity5 , says @entity7 star @entity6
the @entity9 forward , who has played in @entity10 since he was 17 , says an @entity2 victory in @entity12 and @entity13 could rejuvenate @entity15 football following a year blighted by corruption allegations
the team 's @entity5 preparations were disrupted by a police raid on their training base four days before the start of the tournament , as several prominent football figures were arrested in connection with a match - fixing and betting investigation
the scandal prompted manager @entity28 to admit his team could pull out of the competition , but instead they have thrived and will face @entity31 in the semifinals on thursday
" what happened with the match fixing and the betting , it was really bad
@entity15 football has suffered a lot and we as players have suffered a lot , " said @entity6 , who moved to @entity7 from @entity9 club @entity37 for $ 32 million in 2007
" but who knows ... @entity2 in @entity5 can turn it around so that @entity15 football can change and come back to world - class standards
" the " suffering " described by @entity6 struck at the very core of @entity28 's team , which beat @entity47 in a penalty shootout on sunday to reach the last four
football culture : who are you ? warrior or tika taka technician ? full - back @entity55 pulled out of @entity2 's squad on may 29 after being questioned by officials probing gambling markets linked to fixing results of matches in @entity10 nineteen others were arrested , 11 of them players in @entity2 's top division , in the ongoing investigation by magistrates in the city of @entity68
the arrests were the latest in a long - running saga that has severely damaged @entity15 football
seventeen people were arrested in a similar swoop last year , including former @entity75 star @entity74 and @entity77 striker @entity76 , who was subsequently banned from the game for three and a half years
the allegations initially centered on the lower @entity15 football leagues but the latest police sweep indicates that suspicion has also fallen on the most high - profile teams
@entity2 reach semifinals after penalty kicks drama meanwhile , @entity6 believes that on the pitch @entity2 's current squad can compete with @entity89 's best sides -- and possibly cause an upset against the highly fancied @entity91
" most people did n't expect @entity2 to get this far , " said the 22 - year - old , who will be representing @entity9 at the @entity94
" @entity31 and @entity97 are really strong
@entity98 has surprised me ; they have @entity76 ( @entity100 ) who is playing really well
but i 'm going to root for @entity2 to get to the final , and i hope they can win it
" it would n't be the first time the @entity2 team had triumphed in the face of adversity
the @entity2 won the 2006 @entity110 in the wake of the @entity113 match fixing scandal , which saw @entity115 giants @entity114 relegated to the second tier and stripped of two league titles
the repercussions of the latest corruption investigation are uncertain , but a repeat performance from the national side would go a long way to lifting the shadow hanging over one of @entity89 's great football nations .
