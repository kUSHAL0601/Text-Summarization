-- a new crispness in the air
the red , orange and yellow of the leaves changing colors
the crunch of the first few leaves on the ground
on that inevitable march toward winter , there are still a few weeks for the casual and determined leaf peeper alike to enjoy the leaves changing color before they fall
never mind that it happens every year
" it 's because it 's fleeting is why it 's new every year , " says @entity18 , editor of @entity19
in each of his 33 years at the magazine leaf peeping has been a fall cover story
first day of autumn : share your photos with @entity27 " it 's fall and the leaves are becoming beautiful ; apple orchards ; and the hawks are flying overhead
it 's a sensual experience , " he says
" if you were to talk to someone in @entity38 who had had 33 @entity39 , they 'd still be excited about it , " says @entity18
" this is our party
" different shades of red , orange and yellow while evergreen trees such as pines and spruces have foliage that has evolved to survive extreme temperature changes , deciduous ( broad - leaved ) trees have evolved to drop their leaves and go dormant for the winter , says @entity55 , a science communication specialist with the @entity58 's @entity57 in @entity59
" it 's such stark contrast , " says @entity60 , who 's based at @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity59
" there are different shades of green , of course , when you start to get that variation of oranges and reds and purples and greens all together
" @entity55 : why leaves change color trees that " have been stressed throughout the year by extensive drought or many other factors , they may decide to pack it in early and go dormant for the winter sooner than during a typical year , " @entity60 says
" this could cause their leaves to fall off sooner or be browner than normal
every year is different and you never can tell how good the foliage season is going to be until it 's here
" the @entity90 's most popular sites who cares if it 's @entity93 Â© to say that first - time leaf peepers should drive @entity96 's @entity95 ; visit @entity62 or @entity97 in @entity59 , or head north to @entity99 in @entity100 ? " there 's a reason why they 're so popular , and these are places i try to go to every year , " says @entity101 , a @entity96 - based trained meteorologist and high school physics teacher who blogs about the fall foliage season for @entity19
if @entity101 has an extra day this year , he 'll head to @entity107 in far northern @entity96 , where the leaves are likely to peak by late september
" the mountains are really jagged and have a feel unlike anywhere else in the @entity90
" photos : fantastic fall foliage between @entity114 northern and @entity116 trees meet peacefully at the @entity117 , a @entity58 area that includes the states of @entity119 and @entity120
" in the @entity123 i think we have some of the best fall foliage , " says @entity121 , a park ranger in the national recreation area
" we are on the border of northern species that usually do n't come down south and the border for some of the trees that grow in the southern region
" the gap is also home to trees living at different elevations
there are sycamores , elms , maples , poplars on a fertile flood plain along the river
at higher elevations , there are various types of oaks and maples to see as hikers head up toward the mountains
tree spotters may be pleased to spot the @entity152 larch , a deciduous conifer that is n't found much farther south
it 's a rare combination of a deciduous tree , which means it loses its leaves each fall ; and a conifer , which has needles and cones
in the fall the larch 's needles turn bright yellow and fall , like leaves
" it grows in wetter areas in the park , and it 's spectacular in the fall , " @entity121 says
head north to @entity100 country @entity171 is @entity173 's favorite season
the @entity99 national park ranger loves the cold and clear weather that is already coming to the @entity100 island
" it smells like fall , the leaves start turning and it gets really pretty , " says @entity176 , a @entity177 by birth
" it 's a beautiful time to be here , and it 's a nice hiking and biking time
" prime leaf peeping season varies a lot throughout the state , she says
trees are likely to change colors in @entity100 during the last week in september , while central and @entity193 @entity100 leaves will likely peak the first week in october
the coast usually peaks the week of @entity195 and the week after , and @entity99 will peak the second or third week in october
@entity176 's favorite spot at @entity99 : " @entity197 is a nice place to climb if you want to get up high
it 's a pretty easy climb and you get beautiful views all together , looking way out into the ocean
" she also likes @entity206 and seeing the leaves on the drive from @entity209 to @entity210 on @entity211
@entity212 peeping out @entity213 although @entity215 tends to dominate articles about leaf peeping , it 's rumored that trees in colder parts of the rest of the @entity152 also have leaves that change colors
as @entity225 heads toward ski season , its national parks are starting to burst into fall colors
@entity228 is known for @entity229 , where aspen trees at lower elevations transform to gold among the evergreens
( @entity229 is also included in @entity234 , a state - designated scenic byway
) @entity225 's @entity236 , home to the heavily photographed @entity237 and 10 ski areas , is also packed with beautiful leaf peeping areas
it 's also the current home of this year 's @entity242
check the impressive evergreens out while they 're still firmly rooted
not surprisingly , @entity245 's five national forests also pack a lot of fall foliage at varying elevations
@entity249 is home to @entity250 , which at 13,161 feet is the highest spot in @entity245
@entity252 's 1.6 million acres includes 13,103 - foot - high @entity253 , within the @entity254
do n't stress about " peak foliage " many veteran peepers go searching for the perfect " peak foliage " moment in @entity59 ( or @entity100 or @entity258 ) when the leaves are the perfect combination of red , brown , orange and yellow , where the red farm house in the distance is perfectly in contrast and the apple cider tastes just crisp enough
" it 's a mythical term , " @entity19 's @entity18 says
" there is no such thing
" fifteen miles down the road , the leaves may have already fallen and another 15 miles down the road , the leaves may not be ready to fall
" think it of it as a continuum and make it a journey
