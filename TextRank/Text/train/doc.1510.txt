-- @entity1 has rebutted @entity3 's explanation for not checking an international database of lost and stolen passports when passengers boarded @entity7 , an omission that may have allowed two @entity9 men with stolen passports onto the plane
@entity3 home minister datuk seri @entity12 told the @entity13 this week that using @entity1 's @entity16 ( @entity15 ) database might have slowed down the process of immigration checks at airport counters
he said the country 's immigration 's equipment could not handle the global database of 40.2 million lost passports
@entity1 fired back on friday , saying the problem can not be blamed on technology or @entity1
" @entity1 's @entity15 database takes just seconds to reveal whether a passport is listed , with recent tests providing results in 0.2 seconds , " the international law enforcement agency said in a statement
" the fact is that the @entity33 consults this database more than 230 million times per year ; the @entity37 more than 140 million times ; the @entity39 more than 100 million times and @entity40 more than 29 million times
not one of these countries , or indeed any @entity1 member country , has ever stated that the response time is too slow
" @entity1 earlier said two @entity9 men , @entity47 , 18 , and @entity48 , 29 , used stolen @entity50 and @entity51 passports to board flight 370
the men entered @entity3 using valid @entity9 passports
the men have not been linked to terrorism
@entity57 is a hub for the sale of stolen or fake passports .
