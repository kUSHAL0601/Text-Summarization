@entity0 , @entity1 -- the flood - swollen @entity3 was cresting at @entity0 wednesday night , hours earlier than anticipated but at a record level of 57 feet , according to the @entity6
" just because we 're at crest at @entity0 , or the level is starting to fall -- the water level is extra high , " said @entity7 , a senior hydrologist with the weather service 's @entity1 office
" residents who live along the river need to keep an eye out and be vigilant
we 're not going to fall to the kind of levels we got to during the large 2008 flood until early june , and wo n't fall below flood stage until mid to late june
" the river , originally forecast to crest at @entity0 thursday morning at 57.1 feet , was cresting ahead of schedule probably because an old levee system in @entity24 , @entity1 , was breached last friday and spread the flood 's flow , @entity7 said
he said at @entity0 the river could reach the 57.1 level as it crested -- more than 14 feet above flood stage and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927
the @entity33 was keeping a watchful eye on the @entity35 , which residents near @entity0 were counting on for protection
it is designed to keep water from backing into the @entity40
the backwater levee was being " armored " by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out , said @entity43 , attorney for the @entity44
but the @entity40 backwaters were already claiming territory and property , as @entity1 gov. @entity48 was among residents owners who watched their rising waters swallow their houses and lands wednseday
@entity53 , spokeswoman @entity48 's office , confirmed that a house owned by the governor in his native @entity57 was flooded by the watery onslaught moving southward down the @entity3
the house is on a lake in central @entity1 near the backwater - flooded @entity40
while areas downriver continued to brace for the growing flood , a glimmer of recovery hope flickered in one area upriver
authorities in @entity67 , in northern @entity1 , reopened a casino with an employee pep rally
" we believe that reopening our doors and putting our friends and families back to work as quickly as possible is an important step on the road to recovery , " the leaders of @entity71 said in a statement
casinos are a critical economic driver in the region
nine were closed due to the flooding of the @entity3 , said @entity84 , spokesman for the @entity85
three will be reopened by the weekend , he said
but the area still has a long road ahead before full recovery
residents of 300 structures under water at @entity93 are still out of their homes , said @entity95 , county spokesman
" the floodwaters need to recede 3 feet before they can go back , " he said
on saturday , the local community is holding a " @entity99 " to benefit the people of @entity93
@entity71 officials , in their statement , said the " near - record flooding has caused untold damage
" farther south , where the @entity3 has not yet crested , residents were working wednesday to clear out their homes and find ways to get by for coming weeks on higher ground
" we 're taking one on the chin -- not only for @entity113 but for @entity111 as well , " said @entity109 , president of @entity111 's @entity110
his parish is in part of the state expected to be flooded as authorities open sections of the @entity119 to help spare other areas of @entity111 , including @entity121
" it 's really hard when you go and visit with a family who own and operate everything they have in the area , " @entity109 said
" the decision has been made , and we 're just going to have to battle it
but we 're fighting people
" as of wednesday evening , 17 bays were open at @entity119 -- one more than earlier in the day -- moving water at an estimated 114,000 cubic feet per second , the @entity33 said
mandatory evacuations will be in effect saturday -- beginning at midnight friday -- in @entity136 , @entity137 and the @entity138 , the @entity133 announced
by 8 a.m. saturday , " the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter , " the parish said in a news release
downstream in @entity144 , @entity111 , residents and officials tried to counter flooding from the rising @entity1 by stacking large containers two - and three - high around riverfront properties
temporary flood control barriers are protecting two medical facilities , a hotel and the city 's conference and convention center , said city spokeswoman @entity156
the @entity157 reopened a section of the river tuesday that it had closed to prevent damage to levees from passing barges
but officials said only one tow vessel at a time will be allowed to pass through the 15 - mile area near @entity144 and @entity167 , @entity1
and they warned they could shut the waterway again if water levels rise to 62.5 feet
" we will continue to closely monitor transits through the area to ensure the safety of the communities as well as the towing vessels and their crews , " @entity157 capt. @entity170 said in a statement
levees along the length of the river appeared to be holding , and water diverted through spillways seemed to be rising more slowly than expected , but @entity111 gov. @entity184 warned residents that plenty could go wrong
" there 's still an awful lot of water headed our way , and it 's going to be here in many cases for weeks , not just a few days , " @entity184 said
@entity111 officials earlier issued advice to residents in flood - affected areas on how to prevent snake encounters and bites
of the 22 species of snakes within the @entity119 , three -- the copperhead , cottonmouth and canebrake rattler -- are venomous
officials said the spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks , and it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage , allowing those who have evacuated to return safely
in @entity1 , 4,937 people have been displaced by flooding so far , said @entity209 , a spokesman for the state @entity210
in @entity111 , more than 4,000 people have evacuated , @entity184 said , citing figures compiled by parish authorities
but , he said , no shelters have been opened in the state
by the weekend , floodwaters also are expected to peak at record levels in @entity167 as well as in @entity218 and @entity219 , @entity111 , according to the @entity6
the flood is the most significant to hit the lower @entity3 valley since at least 1937 and has so far affected nine states : @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity111 and @entity1
despite the misery and destruction , some residents in flooded areas are trying to make the best of a bad situation
" you know i always wanted to fish off my front porch , but i never wanted to do it this way , " former @entity241 , @entity229 , judge @entity242 told @entity2 affiliate @entity243 in @entity244 , @entity229
" we 've had a lot of laughs over it , but we 've had a lot of sad minutes
" @entity242 , who has lived in @entity250 for 66 years , said he would have never thought the water could get that high
while he was n't able to land a big catch , he said the fishing helps to keep his mind off the devastation
" it 's going to be a crying shame when the water goes down and they 're actually going to see the damage they are going to have , " @entity242 said
@entity2 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report .
