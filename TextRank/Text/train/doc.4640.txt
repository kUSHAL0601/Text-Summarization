police officers are among the two dead and 15 wounded after an explosion during a peaceful protest in the eastern city of @entity7 , @entity1 's @entity0 said sunday
four people belonging to a group that received training in @entity14 , @entity15 , have been arrested , secretary @entity8 of @entity1 's @entity9 and @entity10 said on his website
a gun was also confiscated
though there were reports that someone threw an explosive device from a vehicle , the blast appeared to be caused by a remote - controlled device , @entity8 's statement said
footage from the rally shows an estimated 500 people marching through a @entity7 street , many hoisting @entity1 flags , when the explosion sends rally participants and onlookers scurrying for cover
police and others rush to treat three people -- two men , one in camouflage fatigues and another who appears to be in civilian dress , lying motionless on the ground and a third man in camouflage who seems to have suffered shrapnel injuries to his legs
@entity8 's statement and media outlets reported a casualty toll lower than the one provided by the @entity0
the @entity0 and @entity8 agreed that one policeman was among the dead and five officers were among the wounded
one eyewitness told the @entity53 that the blast could have been deadlier
" the march was delayed by 10 minutes , then just as people started to move , we saw the explosion go off just 100 meters away , to our left and on the road side
it seemed like the device was hidden in the snow near a tree , " @entity61 told the newspaper
" luckily a truck was maneuvering there , and it took most of the shrapnel
i saw two dead , lying in blood , just next to the truck , which was completely torn apart by metal shards
can you imagine if it had been later ? my wife and i went to the march with our baby daughter and our older son
" the explosion is a suspected terrorist act , said @entity85 , head of the @entity86 of @entity1 's @entity87
@entity7 has been placed under the highest level of terror alert as a counterterrorism operation is under way , @entity8 said
sunday 's rally marked the first anniversary of the bloodiest day of protests in @entity96 's @entity95 , or @entity95 , against the country 's then - @entity15 - leaning leader and in favor of closer ties to @entity101
some 49 people died on february 20 , 2014 , and close to 100 more suffered gunshot wounds when , according to protesters , government snipers opened fire on them
two days later , president @entity107 fled the country , prompting @entity1 to declare " victory in the @entity95 " and promise a new day for a country long torn between its neighbors , @entity101 to the west and @entity15 to the east
@entity7 has been the target of numerous attacks in recent months
according to a @entity117 report , the @entity0 has declared that 700 separatists have been detained in the city , and several attacks have struck @entity1 's second - largest city since october
among them : a grenade attack on military warehouses on october 19 ; a november explosion at a pub popular with local volunteers and activists ; a @entity130 bombing at a furniture store ; a january bombing at a courthouse that injured 14 ; and a february bombing of a notary 's office
in response to the attacks , police have begun guarding @entity7 's " strategic infrastructure " and have upped security at supermarkets , @entity117 reported friday
sunday 's attack came a day after @entity146 secretary of state @entity145 , appearing in @entity144 , blasted @entity15 for its " land - grabbing in @entity1 " and threatened additional sanctions
" we are confident that over the next few days we are going to make it clear that we are not going to play this game , not going to sit here and be part of this extraordinarily craven behavior at the expense of the sovereignty and integrity of a nation , " he said
@entity158 has repeatedly denied that it is arming separatists and sending its own troops over the border , but @entity145 said satellites and other technology show it 's " no secret " what is happening in @entity1
" we know to a certainty what @entity15 has been providing to the separatists , how @entity15 is involved with the separatists , " he said
a ceasefire that went into effect february 15 remains in doubt , as a separatist offensive to take the key strategic town of @entity173 ended only wednesday when rebels took over the town
shelling also picked up last week in the city of @entity178 and clashes have been reported around the southern port city of @entity181
@entity1 's @entity9 and @entity10 said friday there had been 300 instances in which the latest truce was violated , and the news agency @entity186 published a map saturday showing how the eastern portion of the country is still racked by violence
the ceasefire agreement -- signed february 12 in @entity192 , @entity193 , among the leaders of @entity1 , @entity15 , @entity195 and @entity196 -- aimed to curb this violence
it is supposed to be followed by the withdrawal of heavy weaponry to create a buffer zone , the release of prisoners and steps toward new elections
journalist @entity206 in @entity96 and @entity3 's @entity207 and @entity208 contributed to this report .
