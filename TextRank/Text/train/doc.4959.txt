@entity0 -- a hotly debated measure that offers a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the @entity6 as children won approval wednesday from the @entity9
the 216 - 198 vote , mostly on partisan lines , sends the so - called @entity12 to the @entity13 , where it was uncertain if supporters had the votes to overcome a certain @entity17 filibuster against it
the @entity19 -- or @entity12 -- would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the @entity6 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in @entity6 for at least five years , obtained a high school or general education development diploma and demonstrated " good moral character , " according to a @entity27 fact sheet
even then , only a six - year conditional status would be awarded , and before moving to the next phase , the students would need to meet additional requirements -- attending college or serving in the military for at least two years , and passing criminal background checks
proponents , including president @entity37 and @entity39 leaders , say the bill offers legal standing to young people brought to the @entity6 who have bettered themselves and served their new country , while opponents claim it is a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants
before wednesday 's @entity27 vote , education secretary @entity46 and homeland security secretary @entity47 joined congressional democrats at a news conference to urge @entity51 to pass the bill
" these are not the individuals that are a threat to our public safety or our security , " @entity53 said
" this is an area where ... our nation 's immigration laws have not kept up with our nation 's needs
" the @entity27 has touted the bill as a measure that will strengthen the nation 's military and its economy
a potential beneficiary is @entity71 , a soon - to - be law school graduate with a 3.8 average who wants to serve in the @entity6 military
under current law , @entity71 wo n't even be able to hold a job after he graduates , much less enlist
he is in the country illegally after being brought to @entity79 from @entity80 as a child
" all i want is the opportunity to serve my country and to give back to the country that has given me so much , " @entity71 said
" ... we 're not a problem
" however , rep. @entity88 , @entity89 , said the bill could grant amnesty to more than 2 million illegal immigrants
" @entity95 amnesty is not the only problem with the @entity12 , " said @entity88 , the ranking member of the @entity93
" the bill allows illegal immigrants to receive in - state tuition at public universities , placing them ahead of @entity6 citizens
the bill also is a magnet for fraud
" the @entity27 disputed that the bill will give amnesty , noting in a fact sheet that " it requires responsibility and accountability of young people who apply to adjust their status under the @entity12 , creating a lengthy and rigorous process
" it also points out that @entity12 beneficiaries would not be eligible for federal grants , such as @entity115 , to attend college
" undocumented youth adjusting to lawful permanent resident status are only eligible for federal student loans which must be paid back , and federal work - study programs where they must work for any benefit they receive , " according to the @entity27
" this is not some dream road , easy - picking concession of the @entity51 , of the government , to @entity6 citizenship , " said rep. @entity125 , @entity126 , who delivered an impassioned plea on behalf of the measure
i 'd like to see you get through college without a @entity115
no government assistance ... no health care
nothing but your own faith and your own determination and your own work to get you through school
and nothing but your own work , your own determination to join the military
" beneficiaries will receive in - state tuition in their state of residence , the same as any student , he said
the @entity155 has said the measure would cut the federal deficit by $ 1.4 billion and increase government revenues by $ 2.3 billion over the next decade
young people who do not fulfill the act 's requirements will lose their legal status and would be subject to deportation , according to the @entity27 fact sheet
@entity12 applicants would be responsible for paying the processing fees associated with their applications , and would be subject to " rigorous criminal background checks and reviews
" @entity12 beneficiaries would not be able to petition for legal status for their family members until after they had satisfied all the requirements
they would also be subject to waiting periods
" the bottom line is that it would take many years before parents or siblings who previously entered the country illegally could obtain a green card , " the @entity27 said
@entity1 's @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .
