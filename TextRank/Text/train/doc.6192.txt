-- the 30 - page @entity3 document detailing the charges against @entity5 accuses the longtime owner of the @entity7 of trying to persuade @entity8 to tell a league investigator she altered a recording and it was n't @entity5 making racist remarks on the audio , the @entity1 reported tuesday
on monday , the @entity3 released a summary of the charges that could lead to @entity3 owners voting to strip @entity5 and his wife , @entity15 , of the franchise they have co-owned for 33 years
in it , the @entity3 said : " in the course of the investigation into mr. @entity5 's conduct , it was discovered that relevant evidence was destroyed , false and misleading evidence was provided to the @entity3 's investigator , and @entity7 issued a false and misleading press statement regarding this matter
" the @entity1 reported that the @entity3 document it obtained alleges @entity5 and @entity8 met on may 2 , about a week after the recording containing racist remarks was released by @entity30 and just before @entity8 was interviewed by @entity31 on @entity32
" @entity5 asked @entity8 to tell the @entity3 that she lied in her previous meeting with the league , " the @entity1 reported
the newspaper also reported the @entity3 is prepared to argue at a june 3 meeting of the @entity3 board of governors that evidence shows that @entity5 and his wife are not estranged and that she helped prepare the team 's press release after the recordings were aired
team president @entity43 also was in on the drafting of the statement that questioned the validity of the recording and suggested it was released by someone seeking revenge against @entity5 , according to the newspaper 's account of the @entity3 document
the @entity1 report also said the @entity3 suggested @entity43 heard the recording on april 9 , weeks before it went online , after a @entity7 employee sent @entity43 a @entity56 document says @entity43 told the employee to delete the audio file and text messages about it from a cell phone
@entity43 is now on indefinite leave from the team
the paper said @entity5 's lawyer , @entity65 , did n't respond to a request for comment
when asked by a @entity0 producer at a tuesday news conference what evidence had been destroyed , @entity3 commissioner @entity68 said he would n't comment on the specifics of the investigation
@entity3 charges @entity76 , schedules june 3 vote @entity3 commissioner feels certain league will oust @entity76 @entity68 said on tuesday he is confident the league will be able to force the @entity76 to sell the franchise for violating the @entity3 constitution
but , the new commissioner said , he would prefer the @entity76 sell the team without the league 's pushing
the chances of that happening appear unlikely
@entity5 , through his lawyer , has sent a letter to the league saying he wo n't pay a $ 2.5 million fine and threatening to sue if he is n't afforded due process
@entity90 has said she wants to maintain her 50 % stake in the franchise
" it is their team to sell , " @entity68 , who has been commissioner for three months , said ahead of the league 's draft lottery
" ( they ) know what the league 's point of view is
if ( they ) wanted to sell the team on some reasonable timetable , i prefer ( they ) sell it than we go through this process
" on monday , the @entity3 officially started the process of terminating the @entity76 ' ownership rights
it sent @entity5 a list of charges that the billionaire real estate investor has until may 27 to answer
the league scheduled the june 3 special board of governors meeting for each side to present evidence
@entity68 also addressed @entity0 's question about a report that @entity5 demanded a three - month extension , saying the 80 - year - old owner needed to abide by the @entity3 constitution , which puts a firm timeline on the process of removing an ownership group
in order to terminate the @entity76 ' franchise rights , 75 % ( 23 ) of the 30 team owners would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale
because @entity5 is banned from any @entity3 activities , he is not allowed to vote , but the @entity7 will have a vote , the @entity3 said
in the case of a forced sale , the league does have a duty to the @entity76 to sell the team for the highest possible price , @entity68 said
the commissioner told reporters if it gets to that point , the league will hire investment bankers to conduct the sale
the league said it has been damaged by @entity5 's racist remarks to @entity8 , which were posted online in april by @entity30 and aired in an interview with @entity0 's " @entity145 360
" @entity68 expressed confidence that eventually a new group will own the @entity7 , who , led by all - stars @entity149 and @entity150 , advanced to the second round of the @entity3 playoffs this season before losing to the @entity153
some analysts have said the team could be worth more than $ 1 billion
@entity157 lists the franchise 's value at $ 575 million
" we know we 're doing the right thing and i know i have the owners behind me , " @entity68 said
the commissioner said he is more than upset by the controversy that has many analysts focused on @entity76 instead of what is happening in the playoffs
" it was something deeper than anger , " he said
@entity0 interview damages @entity5 's case in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's " @entity174 " last week , @entity5 talked about his relationship with @entity8 and racism in @entity177 , and he trashed @entity178 and other minorities
" that 's one problem i have
jews , when they get successful , they will help their people
and some of the african - americans , maybe i 'll get in trouble again , they do n't want to help anybody , " said @entity5 , who is @entity183
some owners said privately -- and @entity189 owner @entity188 said publicly -- after the scandal first unfolded that it would be difficult to vote on removing an owner for a personal conversation
@entity0 's @entity193 told @entity145 on monday that his interview has changed some minds , according to @entity3 insiders she had spoken with in the past week
" if there were any owners who were concerned about should we be kicking someone out for a private tape , ( they ) now feel more comfortable , " she said
" because @entity5 went on television with you and made statements that were abhorrent to so many people , they feel as if they are on much firmer ground to kick him out
" @entity5 's lawyer last week , @entity5 hired @entity65 , an antitrust lawyer who has worked with him in the past , to fight the @entity3
@entity65 's office has had no comment to @entity0
@entity90 has said she wants to keep an ownership stake in the team but does n't want to be the controlling partner
her attorney , @entity213 , said monday she still hopes to resolve the " dispute with the @entity3
" " based on our initial assessment , we continue to believe there is no lawful basis for stripping @entity90 of her 50 % ownership interest in the @entity7
she is the innocent estranged spouse , " @entity213 said
but the @entity3 said @entity5 's remarks are deemed actions of the entire ownership group
in his interview with @entity145 , @entity5 repeatedly denied he is a racist but said he made a mistake making the remarks that were recorded
in the recording , which drew widespread condemnation from fans , players and the league after it appeared on @entity30 , @entity5 chastises @entity8 for posting pictures online of herself with african - americans , including @entity3 legend @entity178
he tells her not to bring @entity178 to @entity7 games
" admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put ( @entity237 ) on an @entity238 for the world to have to see so they have to call me , " he said
" in your lousy f * * ing @entity244 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " he said during a different portion of the recording
@entity8 , who has largely avoided the media since the scandal began , is scheduled to appear on the " @entity251 " show on wednesday
@entity5 , who has owned the team since 1981 , said he was baited into making the remarks
the @entity7 ' turbulent season ended last week in a 104 - 98 loss to @entity153
the @entity153 won the series four games to two
@entity76 : i 'm not a racist , i 'm a giver @entity178 : i 'm going to pray for @entity5 opinion : @entity5 is clueless , here 's the @entity178 i know @entity0 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .
