-- president @entity2 's decision to grant some benefits to the same - sex partners of federal employees is seen by some as his attempt to extend an olive branch to the gay and lesbian community , but critics say it 's " too little , too late
" some critics say president @entity2 has let the gay community down
" it seems to me at least to be a nice gesture , but a disappointment , " said @entity17 , a senior editor at @entity18
the memorandum @entity2 signed wednesday is not expected to grant health and retirement benefits to same - sex partners , as that is prohibited under the @entity25
" it will absolutely be seen as something good -- but i think , for example , it not including full health insurance -- that is going to put a real microscope on that question
you know , why not ? " @entity17 said , adding that the memo applies only to federal employees , so most people will not be affected by it
@entity38 , the spokesman for the @entity39 , said the lack of full benefits in thursday 's memorandum shows a lack of commitment to the gay community
" that 's the part that just shows that the @entity2 administration really is n't serious about their promises to the gay and lesbian community
things like the health benefits , things like retirement benefits and coverage for spouses
these are the core issues , " @entity38 said
" why start the marathon if you 're not serious about ending the race ? " he added
@entity62 officials involved in discussions with gay - rights advocates say that @entity2 favors extending full health care benefits to same - sex couples but that will take legislation to accomplish
@entity38 said @entity2 has had multiple opportunities to fulfill his promises to the gay and lesbian community -- including by repealing the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and standing against the @entity75 motion filed last week in support of the @entity25
" here we are , several months after he 's been inaugurated , and we 've gotten basically nothing
so it is too little , too late , " @entity38 said
@entity62 spokesman @entity81 said @entity2 will keep his word
" [ extending benefits to same - sex couples ] is a matter of fairness
the president is committed to ensuring that fairness as well as working on and fulfilling other promises that he has made in the campaign around things like ' @entity93 , ' " @entity81 said
the president has faced sharp criticism over the @entity75 's filing in support of the @entity25 , which opposes same - sex marriage
the act used the government 's interest in opposing incestuous marriages to support its position against same - sex marriage
openly gay rep. @entity104 said the @entity2 administration made a " big mistake " and is calling on the president to clearly explain his views on the matter
" the wording they used was inappropriate , " the @entity110 @entity109 told the @entity111 in an interview published in the paper 's wednesday edition
many gay activists have called on @entity104 and other gay members of @entity119 to speak out against the recent @entity75 brief
the rancor threatens to disrupt a big @entity123 gay fundraiser in @entity124 next week
vice president @entity125 is the guest at next thursday 's @entity123 's @entity126 in @entity124
critics are calling for @entity104 and other gay congressional leaders to boycott the dinner , for which tickets go for $ 1,000 to $ 30,000 a plate
activist @entity133 and blogger @entity134 , two well - known gay rights advocates , announced that they were pulling out , citing disappointment with the @entity25 brief
ireport.com : share your thoughts on @entity2 and same - sex marriage the president also rankled gay advocates before his inauguration when he named megachurch pastor the rev. @entity146 to deliver the invocation at his swearing - in
@entity146 , in an interview with @entity150 , likened homosexuality to bestiality and incest
he also supported @entity155 's @entity154 , which banned same - sex marriage in that state
during the @entity146 controversy , @entity2 -- who frequently spoke in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the campaign but has said he opposes same - sex marriage -- declared himself " a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian @entity166
" given the support @entity2 received from the gay community during the campaign season , @entity17 said so far , the @entity2 administration has let gay and lesbian rights activists down
@entity2 got 70 percent of the vote from those who identified themselves as gay , lesbian or bisexual , according to @entity0 exit polls
" i think there is an overwhelming feeling that he has not lived up to expectations on these matters , " he said
but , he added , " there 's some sympathy for him -- there 's the worst recession since the @entity188 , troops are in two different countries in the @entity191 -- so there 's a lot on his plate
" @entity17 said @entity2 's full agenda , however , should n't be used as an excuse to delay action on gay rights issues
if the administration waits until there is a news hole , then the issues will be subject to a lot of debate , he said
" in the middle of the health care debate , saying we 're going to do health care , we 're going to fix the economy and then this other [ gay rights ] stuff -- of course it 's right
it does n't require a national debate , " he said
" this is stuff that 's been debated forever
@entity166 does not need a huge national debate on some of these issues , " @entity17 said
@entity17 said while @entity2 has disappointed the gay community , he still has some time to make good on his campaign promises
" i think people will wait through the first two legislative sessions , but then after that some of this stuff does need to move to the front , " he said .
