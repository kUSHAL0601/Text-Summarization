@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 opposition leaders joined the current ruling party monday in a new government to replace the country 's ousted president , while @entity9 @entity8 ban ki - moon called for a return to stability " as soon as possible
" the government will be led by current prime minister @entity13 , who took charge of the @entity16 country when longtime president @entity18 @entity17 fled last week
@entity13 's 19 - member @entity19 will include three opposition leaders and 10 independents , he announced monday
the new government will be tasked with leading @entity1 toward new elections , he said
street clashes continued in @entity0 on monday , three days after @entity17 's departure , with police firing tear gas into crowds of demonstrators in @entity0
@entity30 called on the new government to restore stability and the rule of law " as soon as possible
" @entity17 fled to @entity33 on friday after ruling the country for 23 years
his ouster followed weeks of protest over what @entity1 said were poor living conditions , high unemployment , government corruption and repression
@entity42 , a former parliament speaker , was named acting president saturday
he promised to restore stability and respect the constitution of the @entity16 country
speaking in @entity47 , @entity30 told reporters the new government should protect human rights and guarantee freedom of speech and association
but he said he remained " extremely concerned " about the ongoing clashes in the streets
" this is a moment for the @entity1 people to strengthen the country 's longstanding culture of political moderation and its attachment to peace , " he said
" i call on the government and all stakeholders to ensure a prompt restoration of the rule of law , and to respect and accommodate the aspirations of the people
@entity1 must regain its stability as soon as possible , to pursue the path of development and prosperity
" the new government includes opposition leaders @entity72 , who will serve as health minister ; @entity74 , education minister ; and @entity76 , minister of local development
among the holdovers is @entity78 , the interior minister
@entity78 , speaking later on state tv , said 78 people have died in the clashes across several weeks and 94 have been injured , among them many police officers
he urged people to stop riots and to work with police
he vowed that those who should be held responsible for mistakes of the past will be punished
and @entity78 ended his speech saying , " yes for democracy , yes freedom , no for chaos
" @entity78 also said the cost of the turmoil of recent weeks is 3 billion @entity1 dinars ( about 1.6 billion euros , about $ 2 billion @entity95 )
the announcements came a day after the country 's army clashed with armed gangs and remnants of @entity17 's personal guard
police have arrested looters and as many as two dozen of the ousted president 's relatives since friday
public protests continued monday , as about two thousand people packed into a major road in @entity0
as the demonstrators tried to work their way toward the headquarters of the ruling party , police opened fire with tear gas
opposition officials told @entity2 there were other peaceful demonstrations in towns in central and southern @entity1
@entity1 's unrest was triggered by the december suicide of an unemployed college graduate , who set himself ablaze after police confiscated the fruit cart that was his source of income
recent diplomatic cables from the @entity128 in @entity1 , disclosed by the @entity130 website , revealed growing discontent with what @entity1 believed was widespread corruption and nepotism within @entity17 's government
experts say the kinds of protests seen in @entity1 could inspire similar actions , particularly by unemployed young people , in other @entity142 nations
in the weekend 's chaos , a group of @entity145 hunters visiting @entity1 said monday they were stopped on the streets near @entity148 and beaten
some of the men 's eyes were swollen and blood - filled
one man had apparently been beaten on the back
another man had a head injury
" to be fair , when we look back , we can understand that our guns scared them , " said one of the men , @entity155 , who met with @entity2 monday morning
the men said by the time the army came and understood the hunters were tourists , they had been badly beaten
" if the army did n't find us , we would have been dead , " @entity162 said
@entity163 , a witness to sunday 's clash between government troops and @entity17 's loyalists , said most tunisians have rallied to each other 's aid since the uprising
" we are proud of those people -- simple people , young people , normal people -- who take care of each other , " @entity163 said
@entity2 's @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .
