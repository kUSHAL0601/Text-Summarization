-- the @entity1 on wednesday announced charges against @entity3 , accused of orchestrating the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , and four others accused of involvement in the plot
" if convicted , the five accused could be sentenced to death , " the @entity8 said in a statement
along with @entity3 , the others are @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16
the charges allege that the five are " responsible for the planning and execution of the attacks of sept. 11 , 2001 , in @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity25 , @entity26 , resulting in the killing of 2,976 people , " the statement said

the convening authority has referred all charges to a joint trial
" why @entity51 ca n't close @entity52 the convening authority , the @entity54 , referred charges to a capital military commission , the department said
" each of the five accused have been provided , in addition to their detailed defense counsel , learned counsel , possessing specialized knowledge and experience in death penalty cases , to assist them in their defense , " the @entity8 said
the chief judge of the @entity69 will assign a military judge to the case , and the five will be arraigned at @entity73 , @entity74 , within 30 days of service of the referred charges upon them
wednesday 's action is a refiling of charges against the accused conspirators
the military initially charged @entity3 in 2008 , but president @entity51 stopped the case as part of his effort to close the @entity1 detention center at @entity73
ten years of ' @entity52 ' -- and more to come unable to close the center , @entity51 attempted to move the case to federal court in @entity23 in 2009 , only to run into a political firestorm
the plan was dropped after complaints about cost and security
last april , attorney general @entity95 announced the five would face a military trial at @entity73
the @entity98 opposes the military tribunals
they " are sure to be subject to continuous legal challenges and delays , and their outcomes will not be seen as legitimate
that is not justice , " the group said wednesday
@entity98 executive director @entity108 said the administration is making a " terrible mistake by prosecuting the most important terrorism trials of our time in a second - tier system of justice
" " whatever verdict comes out of the @entity52 military commissions will be tainted by an unfair process and the politics that wrongly pulled these cases from federal courts , which have safely and successfully handled hundreds of terrorism trials , " @entity108 said
" the military commissions were set up to achieve easy convictions and hide the reality of torture , not to provide a fair trial
although the rules have been improved , the military commissions continue to violate due process by allowing the use of hearsay and coerced or secret evidence
