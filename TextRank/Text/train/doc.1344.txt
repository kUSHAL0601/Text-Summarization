editor 's note : @entity2 is director of the @entity3 at @entity4 , @entity4
@entity5 is the director of the @entity6 and @entity7 in the @entity8 at @entity9
both have testified before @entity11 in support of federal hate crime legislation and are co-authors of a book on hate in @entity17 , due to be published next year
@entity2 says a new federal hate crime law is needed to combat violent incidents of bias
@entity21 , @entity22 ( @entity23 ) -- @entity17 needs a coordinated and multifaceted response to combat the continuing scourge of violent hate crime like the crime committed at the @entity28 on june 10
the @entity29 , originally introduced by sen. @entity30 a decade ago and nearly passed during the most recent legislative session , is expected to go before the @entity32 for a vote soon
@entity17 attorney general @entity34 testified on its behalf thursday before the @entity36
it is a crucial step in the nation 's evolving response to hate crime
a hate crime occurs when an individual intentionally targets a victim or their property because of his or her actual or perceived race , color , religion , national origin , ethnicity , gender , gender identity , disability or sexual orientation
while some have argued that these kind of laws criminalize free speech , the @entity17 @entity61 unanimously ruled in the 1993 case , @entity62 , that well - drafted hate crime laws are constitutional and do not punish speech
rather they enhance the penalties only for acts that are already considered crimes
the act is named for @entity68 , a 21 - year - old gay college student who was kidnapped , robbed , tortured and left to die , tied to a fence in a remote area outside of @entity71 , @entity72 in october 1998
his mother @entity73 has been a tireless advocate for hate crime laws and victims
the @entity76 remedies legal loopholes in federal and state criminal law that fail to protect against bias - motivated attacks based on such characteristics as sexual orientation , gender , gender identity and disability
it also removes antiquated " klan era " language that forces federal prosecutors to tie violent racial attacks to a small number of activities such as participating in a jury , voting or using hotels
as recent events have indicated , today 's violent hate offenders , unlike their predecessors , will often swing into brutal action on their own initiative without waiting for a victim to exercise a specific activity covered by old 1960s laws
however , much of the act 's potency lies not in what it punishes , but rather in its recognition of the primary role local authorities now play in combating hate crime
nearly all hate crime investigations and prosecutions in the @entity17 are handled by state and local authorities , such as the @entity118 or @entity119 , @entity120
gone are the days where masses of federal agents and soldiers had to swoop into states to protect new students and freedom riders from thugs in @entity131 - dominated municipalities
the act has a clear bias in favor of local prosecution and has restrictions that require federal prosecution only in limited cases where the leadership of the @entity140 approves
however , reporting data indicates that some states apparently provide limited assistance to hate crime victims
these jurisdictions report either zero hate crimes or a handful of crime to the @entity149 , year after year , while neighboring states with similar demographics and crime profiles report far more
a 2005 @entity154 victimization study found that only a small fraction of hate crimes nationally are actually reported
thus , there appear to be various instances where federal help or prosecution are still necessary
today , in the midst of our economic downturn , federal authorities are needed much more to assist cash - strapped local departments , not as an unwelcome occupying force , but as a desperately needed partner to assist with forensics , technical assistance and investigations
even in police departments with model hate crime investigative units , such as the @entity118 's @entity174 , modern cases increasingly involve interstate travel or internet hate networks , and require sophisticated ballistic and dna testing or computer forensics
these measures may be beyond the capacity of many local police agencies , particularly in difficult economic times
the act also provides greater access to local communities for federal training programs and mediation services that can prevent hate crimes before they boil over into violence
our research has established that hate crimes are a qualitatively unique category of offenses
compared to non-bias motivated crimes these crimes are more likely to involve violence , injury , hospitalization , psychological trauma and a greater risk of retaliatory attacks , which can often spill across municipal borders
and while we can not say whether hate crimes overall are actually increasing , there does appear to be an increase in the most violent hate crimes
in 2007 , hate - motivated homicides claimed nine lives , up from three in 2006 , and the last year has seen a steady stream of violent plots and attacks against symbolic targets by hardened hate - mongers
since the beginning of the year we have seen many examples of extremist crimes
here are a few : @entity218 , @entity219 : january 21 -- white supremacist @entity220 22 , allegedly kills two , rapes one , and shoots another while en route to a synagogue to kill @entity224
@entity225 , @entity226 : february 26 -- @entity227 , 60 , a man known for anti-immigrant rantings , allegedly shoots 5 , killing two @entity230 immigrants
@entity231 , @entity232 : april 5 -- neo-nazi @entity233 , 22 , agitated over the belief that president @entity236 would ban guns , allegedly kills three police officers during a domestic violence call
@entity240 : may 20 -- four @entity242 converts are arrested on federal charges relating to a plot to bomb @entity224 and military targets
@entity246 , @entity247 : may 30 -- leaders of the @entity249 allegedly kill a 29 - year - old @entity251 man and his nine - year - old daughter in an attempt to steal drugs and money to finance their civilian border patrol group
@entity119 : june 10 -- holocaust denier @entity257 , 88 , allegedly kills a security guard at the @entity28
two national research reports released last week document a disturbing level of supremacist activities and overall violence against a broad range of groups
another report from the @entity267 counted a record number of 926 hate groups in the @entity17 last year
but there is something more to hate crime 's harms that can not be completely captured by statistics or criminological studies
as the @entity28 attack demonstrates , hate crimes threaten pluralistic democracies in a way that other crimes do not
unlike many other crimes , they are at once discriminatory and terroristic
as law professor @entity291 observed : " the effect of @entity284 on @entity285 was greater than the sum of the damage to buildings and assaults on individual victims
" violence and threats that destabilize the bonds between citizens and the democratic institutions that they share are worthy of additional punishment and federal assistance
moreover , victims of hate - motivated violence are entitled to legal protection no matter where they reside
that is why over two - thirds of the @entity17 public favor hate crime laws , and why the @entity32 should heed their call to pass the @entity76
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity5 .
