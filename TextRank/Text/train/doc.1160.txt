-- a @entity2 woman mauled by a friend 's chimpanzee in 2009 describes in a new video what it was like waking up in a hospital after the attack
unaware she had lost her vision , @entity10 said she asked her brother @entity12 to turn on the lights
" he said the lights are on , " @entity17 remembers , and " little by little , it started to come together
" @entity17 was attacked while trying to help coax her friend 's 14 - year - old pet chimpanzee back into her house
@entity27 the chimp , which had appeared in television commercials for @entity25 and @entity26 , jumped on @entity17 , biting and mauling her
police later fatally shot @entity27 to stop the attack , which left @entity17 without hands , a nose , lips or eyelids
" i remember laying in the room , and i remember sometimes i would try to scratch my leg , and then i was n't feeling it , " she said
" it 's a different world to not be able to see again or to use your hands and do things for yourself that you have to depend on other people for help now , " @entity17 said
the seven - minute video , released to @entity2 state legislators , features an interview with @entity17 and footage of her walking around the private medical facility where she lives and receives daily assistance for her injuries
representatives for @entity17 will present her case to the @entity57 on friday in hopes that legislators will allow her to proceed with a $ 150 million lawsuit against the state
by law , anyone seeking to sue the state of @entity2 must seek permission to do so
since the attack five years ago , @entity17 has had numerous surgeries , including a face transplant
she sued @entity71 , the owner of the chimp , and received $ 4 million for her injuries , but according to spokesman @entity74 , that settlement does n't even begin to cover the expenses for her treatment
part of the $ 150 million she 's seeking would fund a hand transplant , which doctors unsuccessfully attempted at the time of her face transplant
@entity17 hopes they will be able to try again
" i want ... to be able to do more on my own , " @entity17 said
@entity17 is still waiting for an opportunity to square off against the state for injuries she contends could 've been prevented
@entity74 said authorities at the @entity90 ignored a memo sent in october 2008 , four months before the attack , from @entity2 state biologist @entity93 that said @entity27 the chimp was " an accident waiting to happen
" the state , @entity74 alleges , " knew that the chimp was a danger " but did n't do anything to remove it from the home
@entity101 , director of communications for the @entity90 , told @entity0 he is aware of the memo , but he said all statements from the case must come from the state attorney general 's office
in a statement to @entity0 , @entity2 attorney general spokeswoman @entity106 said , " the legal question in this case is : did the state owe a legal duty to protect ms. @entity10 from attack by a privately owned chimp on private property ? under well - settled law , it did not
" " while we have the utmost sympathy for @entity10 , we do not believe that the state is liable for ms. @entity10 's injuries
to decide otherwise would set a very dangerous precedent , exposing the state and its taxpayers to unlimited liability and costly litigation
" in june , the @entity125 denied @entity17 her request to sue the state for $ 150 million
friday 's appeal is the last opportunity for her to get permission to move forward with a lawsuit , and even if it makes it through committee , it would then have to be voted through both the state 's @entity137 and @entity139 before moving forward
" i 'm hoping the legislation will allow me to have my day in court , " @entity17 said
face transplant patients : where are they now ? @entity0 's @entity145 contributed to this report .
