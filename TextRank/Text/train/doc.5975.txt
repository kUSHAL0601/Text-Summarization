the point - blank shooting of two @entity2 police officers this weekend is testing whether mayor @entity4 's brand of unapologetic liberalism can work in a city that 's spent decades under mayors who made law and order a top priority
@entity11 's pledge to reform police practices helped sweep him into office last year
and in recent weeks he 's pushed for the right of demonstrators to gather to protest the killings of @entity17 and @entity18 , two unarmed @entity21 - @entity20 men , at the hands of white police officers
but critics -- including those in the police force -- are accusing him of fomenting an anti-police fervor that contributed to the killings of officers @entity29 and @entity31
on monday , @entity4 tried to reduce tension in the city
" we have to get everyone to move away from anger and hatred , " he said during an afternoon press conference
" if there are differences , we have to address them peacefully
we have to give people faith that their concerns can be heard peacefully across the spectrum and we have to move forward
" he said @entity2 will not " be the kind of city it was meant to be if there is a division between our police and the community
" " the police are our protectors and they must be respected as such , " he added
he said the murders this weekend were " an attack on all of us " during luncheon remarks at the @entity58 shortly before his afternoon press conference
and the mayor also called for a hiatus from the protests that have gripped the city and the nation , saying the should focus instead on @entity29 and @entity31 ' families
" it 's time for everyone to put aside political debates , put aside protests , put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time , " he said
" let 's accompany these families on their difficult journey
let 's see them through the funerals ... then the debate can begin again
" but during his afternoon press conference , he also pushed back against his critics , calling remarks from the head of the city 's police union " wrong and mistaken
" @entity11 also accused the media of contributing to the atmosphere of tension between police and protesters
" what are you guys gon na do — are you going to keep dividing us ? " a visibly angry @entity4 asked reporters , asserting that the media had unfairly focused on a few examples of violence that did not reflect the majority of protesters
" you all are part of this , too , " he added
president @entity104 and attorney general @entity105 have spoken out on the killings of @entity17 and @entity18 , calling for @entity20 to open up a dialogue on race and law enforcement and sharing their own experiences with racism
@entity104 has launched a task force to examine cases where there may be uneven applications of the law and propose fixes
but a startling divide between how white @entity20 and minorities view the criminal justice system , revealed by a new @entity123 / @entity122 poll , underscores the challenge facing both @entity4 and @entity104 as they struggle to find a solution to broken relationship between the police and the communities they serve
the nationwide poll , conducted largely before @entity29 and @entity31 were shot and released monday , shows 57 percent of white @entity20 think none or almost none of the police in their area are prejudiced against blacks
just a quarter of non-white @entity20 feel the same
and while 50 percent of white @entity20 say the criminal justice system treats blacks fairly , only 21 percent of non-white @entity20 agree
the shooting this weekend prompted police departments from @entity141 to @entity142 , to warn their officers to remain vigilant and watch out for potential copycat violence against them
former @entity2 mayor @entity146 said this weekend on @entity123 that @entity4 had sparked " intense , anti-police hatred " with his support for protesters
@entity150 , the head of @entity152 's police union , also lashed out at @entity4 , saying that there 's blood on the hands of those who have supported the protesters and it " starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor
" while @entity4 tried to downplay the politics of the situation during a press conference this weekend , @entity146 and others — largely @entity163 — have argued his policies are directly to blame
" it is the right time to talk about [ @entity4 's ] policies
his policies of allowing protests to get out of control , and of his not emphasizing enough the importance of fatherhood , the importance of education , the importance of an alternative to a public education system that is failing the black children , " @entity146 , a @entity163 , said on @entity171 this weekend
@entity146 also placed the blame on " propaganda " from the president
" we 've had four months of propaganda starting with the president , that everybody should hate the police
i do n't care how you want to describe it , that 's what those protests are all about , " @entity146 said
others took aim at @entity105
" sickened by these barbaric acts , which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of @entity200 , " tweeted former @entity2 gov. @entity196 , a @entity163
still , tensions between the police and the city 's mayors are nothing new , and indeed have n't yet reached the breaking point they saw under former mayor @entity207 , who oversaw — and was unable to control — an all - out riot by police in 1992
then , much of the criticism from police was the same : " he never supports us on anything , " an officer quoted by the @entity216 said at the time
@entity2 police commissioner @entity218 said monday , however , that his first 10 years in the police force , in 1970 , " were around this type of tension
" @entity218 cautioned against politicizing the tragedy , but agreed that the shooting of the two officers this weekend " was a direct spinoff " of the recent protests , and that @entity4 has work to do in rebuilding support within the police community
" i think he has lost [ the trust of ] some officers , " @entity218 said .
