-- @entity2 's story ought to be uncommon , but in post-earthquake @entity4 , it 's not
all she has left of her previous life are a stack of photographs and a few other things scavenged off the rubble of the building she called a home
when the catastrophe struck , as the @entity4 say , her house tumbled , along with many others that dotted the hillside in the @entity20 neighborhood of @entity21 her husband of nine years , @entity22 , was crushed under concrete
she lived in a camp for a while but returned to where she belonged
now she has a tin shack and memories -- photographs carefully tucked away in loose , laminated photo album pages of herself and @entity22
@entity32 , in a suit
she , in a much finer dress than the black sleeveless top and printed skirt she has on now
some people tell her she should get rid of the pictures
what good are they now ? they bring the kind of sadness that seems almost pointless to dwell on
life has to go on for @entity2
she has to survive , if not for herself , then for her 15 - year - old daughter
sadly , @entity4 have grown used to seeing earthquake rubble and the makeshift camps that sprang up after that fateful day in january 2010
the @entity47 , @entity4 officials and private aid agencies have said that @entity4 has made strides in the two years since the quake
but few deny that recovery has been painfully slow
all you have to do is look at @entity54
and she might be considered one of the lucky ones
she has a " home , " however modest
the @entity47 estimated the 7.0 - magnitude earthquake affected nearly 3 million people and killed about 220,000
more than 1.5 million people were left homeless in a country that was already the poorest in the @entity63 and wracked by crisis
consider that 70 % of @entity4 did not have stable jobs before the quake and there were only 5.9 doctors per 10,000 residents
two years later , almost as many @entity4 are still unemployed
@entity70 still clutters the capital and other places
about half the rubble , the equivalent of five football stadiums full , has been removed , according to the @entity47
@entity76 : how to help about half a million people are still homeless
many still live in tents in the shadows of the collapsed presidential palace , perhaps the most visible symbol of @entity4 's misery
" you ca n't stay on the streets , " @entity2 said
" if that 's what you have , you have to rebuild
" she is not alone in her frustration
thousands of @entity4 marched wednesday through @entity20 to the @entity91 building to demand a reform of land laws so they can be freed to build homes , said @entity95 , coordinator of the grass - roots campaign funded by @entity97
" the rebuilding process is mostly led by the foreigners , " she said
" there is no national plan
the @entity4 state does not have the will
" @entity105 , the former pop star who was elected president last year partly because he presented a fresh face in @entity4 politics , campaigned on a pledge to fix @entity4
but it took him months to even form a government and he recently said that motivating people to move in the nation 's " culture of immobilism " has been a challenge
@entity0 photos : @entity4 's children , two years later standing recently on a site where he said more than 600 families had been living in tents until just days ago , @entity105 said the government was able to relocate them in housing
the project , he said , cost $ 9 million because damaged homes had to be either repaired or reconstructed
he acknowledged that many thousands are still waiting
" but it 's about sending the signal , " he told @entity0 's @entity128
" it 's not about having the magic stick and making the problem disappear in one day
if you plant a tree today , in order to enjoy the shadow , you have to wait five years
so changing @entity4 is going to take time and healing the wounds is going to take time
" perhaps that signal can be seen at the tent city that sprang up on the slopes around the tony @entity143
@entity144 , director of @entity146 's aid agency @entity145 , said the number of people living there has dwindled from a high of 60,000 to 20,000
the focus , he said , has shifted from emergency care for the people in the camp to relocating them
the agency has been helping uncover a buried neighborhood nearby
" what we 've done in the past year is we 've transitioned all our services from the camp into the neighborhood , " he said
" so for right now all of our medical clinics , they 're operating in the neighborhood
they 're close enough to camp that the people in the camp can access them , but really they 're community clinics at this point
" trapped in @entity4 : a return to site of catastrophe it 's not just about providing services but also how to make the best use of money
@entity95 said @entity4 are demanding transparency in a land enveloped by corruption
again , @entity105 acknowledged it will be " very difficult
" " i believe the real devil in @entity4 can only stop when we change our mentality , our way of doing things , " he said
after the earthquake , @entity4 became a darling of the international community
@entity47 pledged money and policymakers vowed that out of tragedy would come a new beginning
but two years on , @entity4 are asking : where did all that money go ? a key issue has been the disbursal of the foreign aid that was pledged for reconstruction
the @entity47 said this week that almost 53 % of the $ 4.5 billion the international community pledged for reconstruction in 2010 and 2011 had been disbursed
however , the @entity202 said its analysis showed that only 10 % of the funds disbursed by the @entity205 , which the center said received nearly 20 % of all donor pledges , have been spent on the ground
according to the @entity213 - based research organization , the " @entity209 has approved over $ 3 billion in projects , yet most have not even begun
and only 2.4 % of @entity215 government contracts went directly to @entity4 firms , while @entity217 relied on @entity213 area contractors for more than 90 % of their contracts
" buried alive together , survivors reunite for first time @entity222 , one of many international charities working in @entity4 , said progress is at a " snail 's pace
" " with a new government in place and billions of aid dollars pledged , @entity4 are left asking why there has not been more progress in rebuilding the country , " said @entity222 's country director in @entity4 , @entity228
" the second anniversary of the devastating earthquake must be a call to action , " she said
" despite the apparent slowness of reconstruction , this remains an opportunity for @entity243 s political and economic elite to address the chronic poverty and inequality that has plagued the country since independence
" @entity2 got tired of waiting for aid agencies to help her
it 's difficult , she said , to live like this
but she thought she might as well return to the slopes of @entity255 , dotted with crumbled structures and vacant spots
at least it was home
@entity0 's @entity128 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .
