-- @entity1 's probably wo n't be exclaiming " @entity3 " in this case
@entity5 restaurant owners @entity6 and his wife @entity7
in a @entity10 - and - @entity9 match - up in the world of fast food , @entity5 -- a small @entity14 curry shop in @entity15 -- has won an eight - year legal battle against the hamburger giant
@entity1 's claimed that the prefix " @entity19 " in @entity5 trampled on its trademark
the country 's @entity21 on tuesday ruled that it did n't
" we 're very relieved -- much , much relieved -- that this eight - year - old saga is finally over , " said @entity5 owner @entity23
" we 're a typical @entity28 - @entity27 cuisine
no way people walking into @entity5 can confuse us with @entity1 's
" the sparse 24/7 self - service restaurant in the capital , @entity33 , is popular with blue - collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare , such as biryani rice and fishhead curry
its logo : a chicken flashing a thumbs - up
the eatery opened in 1999
@entity1 's filed suit two years later
" we were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court , " @entity7 said
" we felt that we had nothing in common , because we were not selling any @entity50 fast food
" the hamburger chain , which has 185 restaurants throughout @entity15 , said @entity5 was violating the prefix " @entity19 " and that @entity1 's had the right to protect it
@entity5 , in turn , said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across @entity58
furthermore , it said , the " @entity19 " in @entity5 stands for " @entity60
" a lower court ruled in favor of @entity63 , and @entity7 appealed
an appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling , prompting @entity1 's to appeal this time
on tuesday , the @entity21 -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling
@entity1 's said it accepts the judgment
" we respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment , " said @entity70 of @entity1 's @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity74 region
@entity7 said the ruling means he can now add other @entity5 locations , with its slogan : " @entity83 and so @entity84
