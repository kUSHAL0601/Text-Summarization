@entity0 and @entity1 have slammed a @entity3 report that found crimes against humanity committed in the reclusive @entity1
at the monday session of the @entity8 , @entity0 's representative called a landmark report that was highly critical of @entity1 's human rights record " divorced from reality
" the diplomat 's words indicate that @entity0 , a permanent member of the @entity15 , may block attempts to refer @entity1 issues to the @entity18
in february , the @entity3 @entity19 on @entity20 published a 400 - page report documenting the widespread torture and abuse , and called for urgent action including the referral of its findings to the @entity18 for possible prosecution
@entity29 's representative accused the entire commission of being spurred by " lies " and " hostile forces
" the @entity1 official objected and left when the @entity35 representative brought in the head of a @entity35 association for families , whose loved ones have been reportedly abducted by @entity1 , to make a statement
the almost yearlong investigation by the commission involved more than 320 witnesses in public hearings and private interviews
it listed a litany of abuses including a new mother being forced to drown her newborn , corpses being eaten by dogs and rampant beatings
" if this report does not give rise to action , it is difficult to imagine what will , " said @entity58 , the @entity19 's chair
why @entity1 probably wo n't change despite damning @entity3 report ' scourge of human rights violations ' he urged the international community to take action
" contending with the scourges of @entity67 , apartheid , the @entity69 and other affronts required great courage by great nations and ordinary human beings alike
it is now your solemn duty to address the scourge of human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the @entity1
" @entity1 is a state , the report concluded , " that does not content itself with ensuring the authoritarian rule of a small group of people , but seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens ' lives and terrorizes them from within
" @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity3 , @entity90 said the @entity92 and " other hostile forces " had fabricated the report in an attempt to " defame the dignified image of the @entity1 and eventually eliminate its social system
" he charged that the testimonies by defectors and witnesses were fabrications by criminals who fled @entity1
everyone in @entity1 is guaranteed human rights and freedoms , so maintained
" we defend our social system
it 's the cradle of life and happiness
" so said @entity1 takes " sincere efforts " to make peace in the @entity115 and blamed joint @entity112 - @entity92 military exercises
on sunday , @entity1 launched 25 short - range rockets from its east coast into open water , according to @entity112
so did not address any of the report 's points regarding the right to food , prison camps , torture and inhuman treatment , arbitrary detention , discrimination , freedom of expression , the right to life , freedom of movement , and enforced disappearances , including abductions of other citizens
he blamed the @entity92 saying it should be investigated for " egregious human rights violations
" @entity58 said the diplomat 's statement was a " diversion " instead of addressing human rights concerns
report : @entity1 ' experienced ' in evading @entity3 sanctions @entity0 backs @entity1 @entity1 found support from its staunchest ally , @entity0 , which also disputed the report 's findings
its representative , @entity147 said the report could not be fair and impartial because of " the inability of the @entity19 to get support and cooperation from the country concerned
" during the 11 - month investigation , the commission 's request for access into @entity1 and information were denied or ignored
@entity0 said the inability to get cooperation from @entity1 put the credibility of the report in question
" the commission makes conclusions and recommendations -- many of them are divorced from reality and highly politicized , " @entity147 said
@entity0 also came under human rights criticism by the commission for its policy of repatriating @entity1
many of the repatriated @entity1 are sent to prison camps or even sentenced to death for escaping their country , according to human rights groups
@entity147 defended @entity0 's practice of returning @entity1
" the @entity1 who enter illegally , they have breached @entity0 's laws and border administration , " he said
" they enter illegally , they are not refugees
" @entity0 and @entity1 enjoy a relatively close relationship , stemming from when @entity0 joined the @entity186 on the northern side against @entity3 troops in 1950
@entity0 remains @entity1 's biggest trading partner and has helped sustain three generations of the @entity192 regime
that relationship continues today as @entity0 's nuclear representative , @entity193 was in @entity29 on monday , according to @entity1 's state - run media , @entity195 .
