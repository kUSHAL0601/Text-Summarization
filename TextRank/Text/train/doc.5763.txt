-- it is the case that seems to have no end
@entity4 student @entity3 and her former @entity6 boyfriend @entity5 are waiting -- once again -- for a verdict from an @entity6 court
@entity9 has been back home in @entity11 ever since an appeal court acquitted her and @entity5 in 2011 of the 2007 murder of @entity16 student @entity14
the 21 - year old was found partially naked in a pool of blood in the house she shared with @entity9 in the picturesque town of @entity23 , where both women were exchange students
@entity9 says she is afraid to return to @entity6 , where she spent four years behind bars
" i will become ... a fugitive , " she told @entity6 daily @entity28 this month , when asked what she would do if she was found guilty
@entity6 's @entity31 in march overturned the pair 's acquittals , saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered
the case was sent to a retrial in @entity40 , where a verdict is expected thursday
@entity5 made it to the tribunal
dressed in a purple jumper , sunglasses nestled on his collar , he waited for the start of a session that was going to be beamed around the world
ruling unclear the retrial began last september , refocusing international attention on the case that grabbed headlines in @entity6 , @entity16 and the @entity4 -- but neither @entity9 or @entity5 were present in court
prosecutor @entity55 has said both @entity9 and @entity5 should be convicted and handed a 26 - year sentence for homicide , with an additional four years for @entity9 for slander
both have maintained their innocence
with little change in the case details over the years , it is not clear how presiding judge @entity64 will rule
regardless of the decision ... both sides will have the opportunity to appeal that verdict to @entity6 's @entity31
that process could take months
if @entity9 is ultimately found guilty , @entity6 could request her extradition from the @entity4 ' fugitive ' @entity9 , 26 , and @entity5 , 29 , were convicted in 2009 of killing @entity73 , who was found with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash in her throat
@entity9 has always denied murdering @entity73 and again maintained her innocence in a written statement to the @entity40 court
" i must repeat to you
i did not rape , i did not steal ... i did not kill @entity14 , " @entity9 said a lengthy e-mail , which was presented by her lawyer
@entity5 was in the @entity84 at the start of the retrial but returned to @entity6
in november he took to the stand to make a spontaneous declaration , saying the charges against him were " absurd
" " for me , it 's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination , " he said of what he 's been through
' no one remembers @entity14 ' a lawyer for the @entity73 family said the victim 's brother and sister , @entity99 and @entity100 , would attend court to hear the decision
the @entity73 family welcomed the retrial ruling , their lawyer , @entity103 said in march , adding they believed the ruling that acquitted @entity9 and @entity5 was " superficial and unbalanced
" the @entity73 family believes more than one person was in the room when @entity73 was killed , he said
" no one remembers @entity14 , while the two defendants write books , speak to the media and earn money , " @entity103 told the court in closing remarks last month
@entity119 advocates for @entity9 one person who has been advocating for @entity9 is @entity119 -- the @entity120 man who walked free last november after being imprisoned for nearly a decade for murdering a newspaper editor
a state appeals court overturned his conviction
" we kind of had this connection in the sense that we 've been through this justice system ... it 's relatively the same
we 've been through this , and there 's not a whole lot of people " who 've had the same experience , he told @entity0 's " @entity136
" " so it 's cool and we can kind of just talk to each other
she wanted to reach out and say if you need to talk to anybody , if you need any help , i 'm here for you
if not , i completely understand
so that 's how we began communicating
" asked about @entity9 ' current state of mind , he said she 's staying positive
" she seems to be doing very well
i 'm impressed with her
it 's so daunting at this time , " he said
" within 48 hours she should know her fate
you ca n't start living life until they actually clear you and until you 're free essentially
so i 'm amazed how she 's doing
she 's working hard on school and continuing life the best she can
she believes the courts are going to do the right thing based on the facts
