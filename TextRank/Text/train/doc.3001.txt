-- a fire that sparked huge explosions and injured three workers on a pair of @entity7 barges is out , the @entity1 said thursday
three workers who were preparing the barges for reloading wednesday night were severely burned , according to mobile fire officials
they were in critical condition thursday at the @entity10 , according to a spokesman
authorities do n't believe any workers are missing
the barge was empty at the time of the initial explosion wednesday night , but authorities believe a spark ignited vapors in it , causing an explosion that ignited a second barge , @entity0 affiliate @entity14 reported , citing @entity1 lt. @entity23
at least seven explosions rocked the barges , according to the @entity1
at the @entity29 across the river they sounded like " planes above you dropping bombs , " general manager @entity26 told wala wednesday
" we were up on a second floor balcony and the sky lit up in orange and yellow , " he said
with the fire out , the @entity1 has lifted the safety zone around the scene , allowing the shipping channel to reopen , the agency said in a news release
the barges are moored across the river from the @entity46 , the cruise ship that lost power in february and drifted in the @entity49 for days before being towed to @entity7 for repairs
at least 500 employees working on the ship were evacuated , @entity51 said
@entity0 's @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 contributed to this report .
