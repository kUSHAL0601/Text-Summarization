-- those pesky drug testers
@entity2 received his @entity3 ( @entity3 ) from prince @entity4 for his services to tennis but the man who ended @entity9 's 77 - year men 's singles drought at @entity10 in july was in danger of being late at @entity12 because drug testers came calling
under tennis ' stringent ' whereabouts ' rule , elite players have to tell testers where they 'll be for an hour every day in case they want a sample
and would n't you know , they showed up at @entity2 's door thursday as the grand slam champion readied for his trip to one of the homes of @entity9 royalty
" they turned up at my door at 8.20 a.m. and i had a taxi booked for half past eight , " @entity2 , recovering from back surgery , told reporters
" i was a bit worried i was going to be late but the taxi did a great job in getting us here
" it 's part of the job but when you have a day like today you are looking forward to , it 's the last thing you need
" @entity2 's moment of panic ended , he traded in his shorts and t - shirt for a smart , dark suit
he was allowed to bring three guests and chose -- not surprisingly -- his parents @entity46 and @entity4 and longtime girlfriend @entity48
" i think they were quite proud , " @entity2 told @entity0
" my girlfriend is massively into anything royal
she was so excited about coming to @entity12 for the first time
" it was a great day for us
" whereas @entity2 made history at @entity10 and at the @entity57 a year ago , it was the first investiture for new dad @entity4 , who filled in for the 87 - year - old queen
according to reports , prince @entity4 chatted to @entity2 for nearly a minute -- one of the longest chats of the day
" he asked me about my back surgery ... and how i was feeling after @entity10 , when there was a lot of pressure on me , " @entity2 told reporters
" i teased him a bit as he had sent a note to me before @entity10 wishing me luck and his wife had written me a letter afterward
her handwriting was beautiful and i told him how fantastic it was compared to his
" i have met him a few times before and he has always been very easy going
he seemed very relaxed today
" the decision to give @entity2 an obe was actually made at the end of 2012
he won gold at the @entity77 and a month later ended @entity9 's 77 - year grand slam men 's singles drought in @entity80
@entity2 wo n't play again this season following his surgery , thus missing out on the year - end championships in @entity84 in november .
