-- @entity2 residents will not be voting on whether male circumcisions should be banned in the city this fall
a superior court judge ordered thursday that the proposed measure , which had initially made it onto the november 8 city ballot , be removed entirely
the measure proposed banning male circumcisions with the penalty of jail time or a $ 1,000 fine
it would not have granted religious exemptions
from the beginning , the controversial ballot measure faced strong resistance from medical , religious and civil liberties groups
should teens make circumcision decision ? superior court judge @entity23 wrote that male circumcision is " a widely practiced medical procedure " and that medical services are left to the regulation of the state , not individual cities
the judge 's ruling was hailed by the @entity32 , the @entity33 and others who had sued to remove the measure from the ballot
' @entity37 ' to @entity2 : @entity39 circumcision " while we are confident that the overwhelming majority of @entity43 would have voted to defeat this extreme measure and are grateful for the outpouring of support from every sector of the community , we believe the right decision was made in the right venue , " said @entity40 , associate director of @entity32
the plaintiff 's efforts were also supported by the @entity53 and @entity2 's @entity54
and even the @entity2 city attorney 's office expressed concerns about whether the measure was constitutional
@entity2 's proposed circumcision ban galvanizes religious opposition " it 's unusual for a judge to order an initiative off the ballot , but the proposed circumcision ban presented that rare case where the court should block an election on an initiative , " said @entity61 staff attorney @entity60 in a released statement
" not only is the ban patently illegal , it also threatened family privacy and religious freedom
the court 's order protects fundamental constitutional values in @entity2
" anti-circumcision advocates who had gathered more than 7,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot expressed disappointment and said they would appeal
circumcising our son -- how do we decide ? " to remove an initiative before it comes on ballot is an extraordinarily irregular thing to do , " said @entity85 , who is part of a @entity88 advocacy group that says the surgery violates human rights and likens it to " male genital mutilation
" " to go to this length to have it struck from the ballot is undemocratic , " he said
" it 's very , very unfortunate
