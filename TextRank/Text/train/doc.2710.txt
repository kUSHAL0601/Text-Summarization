@entity0 -- @entity3 's president is fighting back : no , he did not steal a @entity5 ring
and no , he 's not rocking the diamond - encrusted prize on his finger , either
president @entity9 's spokesman denied that the leader kept a @entity5 ring that @entity13 ' owner @entity12 wanted back
both sides agree that the ring , with its 124 diamonds , changed hands during @entity19 's visit to @entity20 , @entity3 , in 2005
the @entity21 reported on remarks made by @entity19 , 72 , at a @entity24 awards gala thursday
" i took out the ring and showed it to ( @entity9 )
and he put it on and he goes , ' i can kill someone with this ring , ' " @entity12 said , according to the @entity21
" i put my hand out and he put it in his pocket , and three @entity34 guys got around him and walked out
" in the quotes used by the @entity21 , @entity19 did not specifically say that @entity9 stole the ring ; the paper characterized his remarks that way in the headline and story
@entity19 did say , however , that he had wanted the ring back
" i had an emotional tie to the ring
it has my name on it
" the @entity13 ' owner said he then received a call from the @entity50 at the time telling him it would be in the best interest of @entity54 - @entity3 relations to claim it was a gift to @entity9 , the @entity21 reported
@entity19 said thursday he played along
a few days after the 2005 incident , amid confusion as to whether the ring was a present or was kept by mistake , @entity19 issued a statement saying it was a gift
that 's the way @entity9 sees it , the president 's spokesman said sunday
" what mr. @entity12 is saying now is weird , " @entity67 said
" i was standing 20 centimeters away from him and mr. @entity9 and saw and heard how mr. @entity12 gave this ring as a gift
" the 4.94 - carat ring is in the @entity74 's library , where all official state gifts are kept , he said
it is worth more than $ 25,000 , according to multiple reports from 2005
a @entity19 spokesman said sunday the story is a humorous anecdote that @entity19 " retells for laughs
" " he loves that the ring is at the @entity74 and , as he stated back in 2005 , he continues to have great respect for @entity3 and the leadership of president @entity9 , " said @entity82 , a spokesman for @entity83
" an added benefit from the attention this story gathered eight years ago was the creation of some @entity13 fan clubs in @entity3 , " he said
there is some solace for @entity19 , as he also received rings for the @entity13 ' @entity5 victories in the 2001 and 2003 seasons
@entity5 rings can fetch much more when they are auctioned , depending on who wore them
the 1991 @entity5 ring of @entity103 @entity102 sold last year at auction for more than $ 230,000
there were rumors @entity107 bought the ring , but the actor denied it
at least one ring has been used to raise money for charity
in 2008 , former @entity13 defensive player @entity114 raffled off one of his three rings to raise $ 150,000 for several children 's charities
@entity9 announces marriage split @entity1 's @entity119 reported from @entity0 , and @entity120 reported and wrote from @entity121 .
