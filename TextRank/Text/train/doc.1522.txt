-- " you 've got to save your best leadership for home
" these are the words of retired @entity6 commander lt. general @entity5 at a recent speaking event on leadership in the 21st century
two nights ago , i found my two most active roles in life -- family man and journalist -- intersecting in a crisis
it was 3 p.m. on tuesday afternoon when my wife alerted me
i was enjoying my afternoon off , comfortable in the warmth of our home , watching the snow from a rare winter storm blanket our deck and backyard
my wife , who is a fifth - grade school teacher in @entity25 , @entity26 , received word that her school was shutting down because of the inclement weather
" honey i 've got the kids
i 'm on my way home , " she said after school was dismissed early , and parents were rushing to get their children
as a journalist , i recognized that a news story was breaking before me
my wife 's normal 20 - minute daily commute was about to turn into an ordeal that would last nearly 24 hours
and i soon discovered that skills honed over years in the newsroom , were my best tools for assisting my wife and children
more than three hours later , she still had n't moved very far
we stayed in constant contact as she inched along the 6 - mile stretch of state highway leading her home
from the news , i soon realized this was no ordinary traffic jam
my family was stuck in gridlocked traffic caused by a one - two - punch of bad weather and poor government planning
@entity59 approached and my wife told me she had n't been able to move the car at all since 10 p.m. the half - tank of gas she started with that afternoon had dwindled , and temperatures were well - below freezing
the kids had n't eaten
there was no restroom in sight
i felt hopeless and helpless
i called @entity68 and explained to them that my wife and kids were stranded in a vehicle among hundreds of other vehicles
i wanted to know how my family was going to be helped
they told me , " we do n't know sir
we 're trying , but we are out - manned now
" filled with adrenalin , i just could n't sit idle with my family stranded
i called local authorities and was told the same thing
by this time , i was so angry , i could n't think straight
i texted a friend who suggested prayer and texted me a bible verse to read , @entity81 4:1 - 14
i took to social media to help me cope with the situation and people reacted with posts of support
i stayed in touch with my wife a minimum of once per hour and at times twice per hour
on @entity90 , i posted : " more than 14 and a half hours , my wife and kids remain stranded in car stuck in traffic because of snow
been on phone w / state police repeatedly who agree w / me
all prayers are welcome as i 'm praying for the safe return of many of my friends in similar situations too
" my wife later told me she cried only once , around 5 a.m. , not knowing when she was going to be able to get the children home
she imagined having to wait for days , maybe until the snow and ice melted
it was so , so cold and she could n't keep the engine running all night for fear of running out of gas
that 's also about when i lost it , i told her -- about 5 a.m. at one point an act of kindness gave her hope : a truck driver knocked on the window in the middle of the night offering water and a blanket
she huddled the girls together in the front seat to keep them warm
" i did n't let the girls see me cry , " she said
i felt so guilty about it all
why did n't i fill up the car with gas ? why did n't i get the oil changed ? how could i drop the ball on my family ? i thought about @entity134 , who i have come to admire even more since hearing him talk about leadership and life lessons
i decided it was time to take action
i called the @entity68 and local authorities one more time
they could offer me very little
i told them if police could n't get my family , it was time for me to try
the state patrol dispatcher advised me to stay off the roads
it was now 20 hours into the ordeal
at day - break , i told my wife , " i am coming to get you
" she said she did n't think i could get to her
i said , " do n't worry about that
against advice of the local and state authorities , i 'm going to try
" i posted a message on @entity90 letting folks know what i was going to do and asked for prayers
the reaction came pouring in
i called my neighbor @entity158 , retired military and current investigator with a local district attorney 's office
taking me in his four - wheel - drive truck , @entity158 expertly traversed the thick ice on bridges passing hundreds of stranded vehicles along the way
i was laser focused on the mission : find my wife and kids and extricate them
i trudged up an ice - covered northbound lane of highway , as @entity177 's pickup made a zig - zag between hundreds of stranded vehicles to get to a safe stop
i grabbed each of my daughters , and carried them one by one across the median strip to the warmth of @entity177 's truck
then i escorted my wife into @entity177 's vehicle
i moved my wife 's car into the median and left it there not knowing or caring when the traffic would start to move
i was leading my family home .
