-- @entity3 is sporting a new scar after an unseen object hit the gaseous planet this week , @entity2 scientists say
this @entity2 image shows a large impact near @entity3 's southern pole
an amateur astronomer in @entity11 noticed the new mark -- seen through telescopes as a dark spot -- on the planet early monday and tipped off scientists at @entity2 's @entity17 ( @entity17 ) in @entity18 , @entity19 , who then confirmed it was the result of a new impact , @entity2 said
it 's not clear what the object was that crashed into @entity3 's poisonous atmosphere
@entity28 , a @entity17 scientist , told the magazine @entity29 that it could have been a block of ice from somewhere in @entity3 's neighborhood , or a wandering comet that was too faint for astronomers to have detected before impact
the object created a mark on @entity3 that has the about same diameter as @entity39 , though the object itself was probably only 50 to 100 miles across , said @entity42 , the amateur astronomer who first noticed the scar
the mystery object was likely moving at speeds of about 50 to 100 kilometers ( 31 to 62 miles ) per second when it struck near @entity3 's south pole , @entity42 told @entity0
" that generates an unbelievable amount of energy when it collides with pretty much anything , but especially with something the size of @entity3 , " he said
it is only the second time scientists have been able to observe the results of such an impact on @entity3
the first happened 15 years ago , when comet @entity57 9 broke into 21 pieces and hit the planet 's atmosphere
" given the rarity of these events , it 's extremely exciting to be involved in these observations , " @entity17 astronomer @entity62 said in a @entity2 interview
thermal images taken by @entity2 show the scar as a bright spot , which means the crash warmed the lower atmosphere in that area , @entity29 said
researchers also found hints of higher - than - normal amounts of ammonia in the upper atmosphere
the @entity57 comet also churned up extra ammonia , the magazine said
@entity3 's new spot is n't likely to last long -- probably just one to two weeks , @entity42 said
he pointed out the impact scars from the @entity57 debris lasted only two to three weeks before disappearing
seeing an @entity39 - sized spot appear so tiny on @entity3 's surface led to some to wonder tuesday whether our planet might be in danger of a similar collision
but @entity42 said that should n't be a concern because @entity3 functions almost like a celestial vacuum cleaner , sucking up any objects that would be of danger to @entity39 and its neighbors
" @entity3 is doing a very good job in scooping up a lot of this material that 's still floating around in the solar system , " he said
" it 's just got so much gravity as it swings around the outer part of the solar system , it can really pull in and swallow up many of the cometary objects and debris left over from the formation of the solar system
" so it 's doing a good job in keeping us safe by cleaning out a lot of these bits and pieces
" @entity3 is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest in our solar system
its colorful atmosphere is 86 percent hydrogen and 14 percent helium , with tiny amounts of methane , ammonia , phosphine , water , acetylene , ethane , germanium , and carbon monoxide
the chemicals are responsible for producing the different colors of @entity3 's clouds
the temperature at the top of those clouds is about 230 degrees below zero @entity134 ( 145 degrees below zero @entity135 ) , but it is far hotter near the planet 's center
the core temperature may be about 43,000 degrees @entity134 ( 24,000 degrees @entity135 ) , hotter than the surface of the sun. the most outstanding feature on @entity3 's surface is the @entity144 , a storm of gas that swirls at a speed of about 225 miles ( 360 kilometers ) per hour at its edge
the spot -- which has been shrinking -- has a diameter equal to about three times that of @entity39 .
