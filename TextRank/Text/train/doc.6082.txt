-- they were " wiseguys " or " goodfellas , " the federal government said thursday of five reputed mobsters indicted in connection with a string of unsolved crimes , including the fabled 1978 @entity9 heist at @entity10
in an indictment that reads like the script of " @entity13 , " alleged mob captain @entity14 , 78 , and other alleged members of the @entity16 organized crime family are accused of murder , racketeering , armed robbery , arson and extortion
in the infamous @entity9 robbery , a band of robbers stole about $ 5 million in cash and nearly $ 1 million in jewels from an airline cargo building in the largest cash robbery in the nation 's history at the time
the robbery was part of the story in @entity37 's 1990 " @entity13 " film about organized crime in @entity39
and thursday 's indictment opened with a primer on the hierarchical structure of the mob or " @entity47 " and one of its most notorious families , the @entity46 , with explanations of the roles of its boss , " consigliere " or underboss , administrations , crews , captains , soldiers , associates and " goodfellas
" " as alleged , @entity14 devoted his adult life to the @entity65 , with a criminal career that spanned decades , " @entity60 , @entity61 attorney for the @entity62 , said in a statement
" far from a code of honor , theirs was a code of violence and brute force
those suspected of cooperating with law enforcement paid with their lives
" she added , " neither age nor time dimmed @entity14 's ruthless ways , as he continued to order violence to carry out mob business in recent months
" also charged in the indictment were fellow @entity84 family members or associates : @entity14 's son , @entity86 , @entity86 , @entity86 " @entity88 and @entity87
four of the five defendants pleaded not guilty thursday before @entity61 magistrate @entity90 , who said that no bail would be set now because of the violent nature of the charges
@entity86 , who was not arraigned thursday because his lawyer was unavailable , will be arraigned friday
the defendant did not appear in court
@entity14 's lawyer , @entity97 , arrived in the crowded courtroom with a large plastic bag filled with prescription drugs for his client , who , he said , had triple bypass surgery in march
the courtroom was filled with @entity14 family members and federal agents
" @entity14 said that we are going to trial on this case -- there will be no plea , " said @entity97 , who joked that the indictment was giving @entity37 the basis for a sequel to " @entity13
" " short of a dismissal , there will be a trial
@entity97 said his client has high blood pressure in addition to the recent triple bypass
" we 're gon na try to put together a sufficient bail package so he can get bail , " he said
" but he 's not a very wealthy man , unfortunately ... my client is n't in the position to put $ 10 million on the government 's table , either for bail or for some sort of a special deal
" of his client 's alleged involvement in the fabled heist , @entity97 said : " innocence
he did n't do it , had nothing to do with it
pretty much all the people that did it got murdered ... so , the fact that my client did n't get murdered would suggest that he did n't have anything to do with it , so i 'll start right there
" @entity14 is the first accused mobster to face charges in the @entity9 heist
@entity148 , a former federal prosecutor who investigated the @entity9 heist , told @entity0 that authorities were able to confirm at least eight killings reportedly connected to the robbery
" you know at the time it was an extraordinarily big deal , " said @entity148 , who played himself in the film
" it was the largest robbery in the history of the @entity61
for whatever reason , the tabloids in @entity39 took a fancy to this case
they were fascinated by it , and what was happening was that a lot of the people who were allegedly involved in the robbery in some form ... were turning up dead
" the only person convicted in connection with the @entity10 heist was @entity171 , a @entity9 cargo agent , @entity148 said
@entity171 , who was arrested a few months after the robbery , was convicted of being the " inside man " who provided information that helped the robbers carry out the heist , @entity148 said
other crimes described in the indictment also sound similar to events portrayed in the film -- a 1969 murder , burning a @entity39 building and a racketeering operation that used threats of violence to extort money from victims
" these ' goodfellas ' thought they had a license to steal , a license to kill , and a license to do whatever they wanted , " @entity194 , assistant director - in - charge of the @entity196 's @entity39 office
" however , today 's arrests of the five members of the @entity16 crime family brings an end to their violent and ruthless ways
" @entity0 's @entity202 , @entity203 contributed to this report
