@entity0 -- @entity3 agents temporarily deployed to @entity4 received an average of about $ 45,000 in excessive overtime because they billed the government for 16 hours a day throughout their 90 - day assignments , according to a @entity10 audit
justice department inspector general @entity11 released the audit on thursday
the audit , released thursday by inspector general @entity11 , found the agents routinely submitted the overtime with the blessing of their managers from 2003 through 2007
the report says the excessive overtime totaled $ 7.8 million
" the @entity3 inappropriately permitted employees to regularly claim overtime for activities that are not compensable as work , such as time spent eating meals , exercising more than 3 hours per week , and socializing , " the report said
the socializing included going to movies and cocktail parties
the @entity3 promptly responded to the report , acknowledging the overtime policy was designed to encourage @entity3 employees to volunteer for @entity4 duty , but should not have been used and has now been corrected
the 88 - page report documenting the overtime issues found the @entity3 had initially approved the policy of paying for 16 - hour days because conditions were harsh , there were few recreational opportunities and employees were always " on call
" but the audit said that violates federal pay guidelines
the @entity3 admitted that " a flawed system was allowed to develop and remain in place too long , " but it also sought to explain how the practice started
" early in the conflicts in @entity47 and @entity4 @entity3 managers traveled to those war zones and saw first hand the challenges of a 24/7 threat environment
@entity3 employees lived with sniper attacks , mortar fire , and roadside bombs as part of their daily work environment
they attempted to adapt a long established domestic pay system for domestic law enforcement to unprecedented wartime assignments for @entity3 personnel
" @entity3 agents in @entity4 perform a variety of duties , according to the bureau 's web site
agents interview suspected terrorists captured by the military ; gather intelligence ; collect evidence from crime scenes like car bombs or mass graves ; and investigate crimes committed by @entity76 against @entity4 , as well as those that @entity4 commit against their fellow citizens
the inspector general 's report said overtime pay was less excessive for @entity3 personnel in @entity47
the report also found that somewhat less excessive overtime was paid to agents from other @entity10 agencies who were sent to @entity4 , including deputy marshals , and @entity88 and @entity90 agents .
