federal prosecutors were preparing charges sunday against the surviving suspect in the @entity4 bombings even as authorities said they believed he and his brother were allegedly preparing to carry out more attacks when their plans were disrupted
authorities have not said publicly what charges will be filed against @entity12 , but a @entity14 official , who has been briefed on the case , told @entity16 he will face federal terrorism charges and possibly state murder charges
@entity19 , 19 , remains in serious but stable condition with a gunshot wound to the side of the neck , a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity16 on sunday
it is unclear whether @entity19 was wounded during his capture or an earlier shootout with police that left his older brother -- the other man wanted in the bombings -- dead , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity
" he 's not in a condition to be interrogated at this time , " @entity38 police commissioner @entity37 told reporters at a news conference on sunday afternoon
however , another senior federal official who has been briefed on the investigation told @entity16 's @entity44 that @entity19 has communicated in writing with officials several times
even as prosecutors worked to put together a case against @entity19 , @entity37 said he believed the brothers were planning another attack before a shootout with police disrupted their plans
" we have reason to believe , based upon the evidence that was found at the scene -- the explosions , the explosive ordnance that was unexploded and the fire power -- that they were going to attack other individuals , " @entity37 said sunday on @entity55 ' " @entity54
" he did not say whether investigators had identified a specific target
authorities believe the brothers bought bomb components locally , but their guns came from elsewhere , another federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity16
the official , who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case , said authorities are trying to trace the guns
@entity19 was captured friday night , days after he and his brother allegedly planted two bombs near the finish line of the @entity4
the blasts killed three people and wounded more than 170 others
authorities virtually shut down @entity38 and some of its suburbs as part of a manhunt after authorities say the brothers went on a rampage late thursday and early friday
the brothers allegedly hurled explosives at police after killing @entity93 police officer @entity92 and hijacking a car
what 's next for the suspect ? there are questions about whether @entity19 will ever be able to talk given the nature of his wound , sen. @entity101 , @entity102 , said sunday on @entity104 's " @entity103
" " it does n't mean he ca n't communicate , but right now i think he 's in a condition where we ca n't get any information from him at all , " said @entity101 , a member of the @entity105
the government has invoked the public safety exception in the case , a designation that allows investigators to question @entity19 without reading him his @entity118 rights and without a lawyer present , said another @entity14 official , also speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason
secretary of defense @entity124 told reporters on a flight to @entity128 that he has not seen any intelligence that linked the brothers to any terrorist organization , but it was still early in the investigation
but @entity37 told @entity16 that he was confident that the brothers were " the two major actors in the violence that occurred
" " i told the people of @entity38 that they can rest easily , that the two people who were committing these vicious attacks are either dead or arrested , and i still believe that , " he said sunday
the sentiment was echoed by @entity140 police chief @entity139
" from what i know right now , these two acted together and alone , " he said
" i think we have to be ever vigilant , and we 're learning as we go along , but as far as this little cell -- this little group -- i think we got our guys
" hints of a radical ? while investigators piece together the actions of the brothers in the months and days before the marathon bombings , there appear to be hints that the elder @entity19 was becoming radical
the @entity19 family hails from the @entity155 republic of @entity156 and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s
the two brothers were born in @entity160 , authorities said
profiles of the two suspects an @entity164 official said saturday agents interviewed @entity19 in 2011 at the request of the @entity155 government
the @entity164 said @entity155 claimed he was a follower of radical @entity168 and a strong believer and that he had changed drastically since 2010
but a @entity171 official and a law enforcement source said sunday the @entity155 government 's request was vague
the lack of specifics limited how much the @entity164 was able to investigate @entity19 , the law enforcement official said
@entity19 apparently became increasingly radical in the last three or four years , according to an analysis of his social media accounts and the accounts of family members
but so far , there is no evidence of active association with international jihadist groups
in august 2012 , soon after returning from his visit to @entity155 , the elder @entity19 created a @entity187 channel with links to a number of videos
two videos under a category labeled " terrorists " were deleted
it 's not clear when or by whom
a @entity16 analysis of the @entity187 channel has established that one deleted video featured a militant named @entity199 , whose real name was @entity201
@entity16 has located a video clip of the footage in question
@entity155 security services killed @entity201 in december during an assault on an apartment in @entity208 , the capital of the @entity155 @entity210 republic of @entity211
@entity201 led a small group in @entity211 that had links to the main @entity215 militant group in the region , @entity217
older suspect in @entity38 bombings grew increasingly religious , analysis shows separately , a @entity171 intelligence source told @entity16 that investigators are looking into whether @entity19 had any connections with the group , known in @entity225 as @entity226
the source says @entity19 had several computer links to the group in his social media activities , and investigators are looking into the possibility that he received " operational plans " from this group
rebels who call themselves @entity237 of the @entity238 of @entity211 issued a statement sunday that appeared to distance the group from the @entity38 bombings , saying they are not fighting the @entity171
" we are at war with @entity155 , " it said
the statement also said that children are never targets of the group
' he was just relaxed ' as an army of officers hunted for the suspects in monday 's marathon bombings , @entity12 acted like any other college sophomore
he was on the campus of @entity255 every day after the attack until late thursday , a university official told @entity16
@entity19 attended classes and went to the gym and dorm parties while much of @entity38 was at a tense standstill
on tuesday , he and a fellow student were at the campus gym when the bombings came up in discussion
@entity266 said he expressed his shock about the attack , telling @entity19 that it was the type of thing you hear about in @entity272 or @entity273 , not @entity38
he said @entity19 responded : " yeah , tragedies happen man
like these things happen around the world
" a student at the school told the @entity281 she saw @entity19 wednesday night at a party that was attended by some of his friends from intramural soccer
" he was just relaxed , " she said , asking the paper not to print her name
at the dorm where @entity19 lived , students joked thursday as they viewed the @entity164 photos of the bombing suspects on television , a senior who lived in that dorm told the @entity281
" we made a joke like , that could be @entity12 , " @entity295 said
" but then we thought it just could n't be him
" the campus , which was closed during the search for the bombing suspects , reopened sunday morning
moment of silence @entity38 , meanwhile , is trying to return to semblance of normalcy with some streets and business reopening
federal investigators on sunday were lifting crime scene tape and barriers erected during the investigation into the bombings near the marathon 's finish line on @entity313
people throughout @entity315 are being urged to observe a moment of silence monday at 2:50 p.m. , exactly one week after the @entity4 bombings
of those injured in the marathon bombings , 55 remain hospitalized , including three in critical condition , according to a @entity16 count
doctors , meanwhile , said sunday that they are " cautiously optimistic " that a @entity315 transit officer wounded in a shootout with the alleged @entity4 bombers will recover
@entity325 , 33 , remains in critical condition at @entity327 in @entity328 , said dr. @entity329 , a surgeon who operated on the officer
there was life before the bombings , and then life after
" we are all scattered in the pain and horror of this week 's violence , " @entity38 's archbishop , cardinal @entity335 , told parishioners during sunday services at the @entity338
" some of those here were among those injured
but everyone has been affected
" he voiced what so many have been thinking : why would anyone do this ? what were the bombers thinking ? it has been " very difficult to understand what was going on in their heads , " he said
