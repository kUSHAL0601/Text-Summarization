one moment monday morning , a @entity1 flag still was flying over a military base in @entity1 's @entity4 -- the base 's commander reportedly kidnapped by @entity8 troops the day before
later monday , masked troops were at the base , and the @entity1 flag was gone
the bloodless incursion by apparently pro-russian forces onto the @entity1 base in the city of @entity15 -- amid disputed accounts over whether the base commander had switched sides -- was one of the latest encounters between @entity22 troops who are consolidating their hold on the @entity26 peninsula and @entity1 forces who still are there
the incident at the base came a day after @entity32 chancellor @entity31 bluntly told @entity34 president @entity33 by phone the @entity37 - backed referendum on whether @entity4 should join @entity34 is illegal and would violate @entity1 's constitution if it goes ahead on march 16
legal or not , @entity4 referendum will shape @entity1 crisis @entity33 has defended breakaway moves by @entity8 leaders in @entity4 , where @entity34 forces have been tightening their grip on a region that has been the epicenter of a battle for influence among @entity37 , @entity49 and the @entity50 since @entity1 president @entity52 's ouster last month
pro-russian forces last week pushed into the autonomous region in a bloodless siege , prompting criticism from @entity57 nations and @entity1 's interim government
@entity37 has denounced the events that led to @entity52 's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new @entity1 authorities , putting the two countries on a collision course over control of @entity4 , which has longstanding ties to @entity34 and has thousands of @entity34 troops stationed there
@entity33 has said @entity34 has the right to protect @entity34 living in the former @entity70 republic
as tensions mount , @entity1 's armed forces carried out training exercises to test their readiness , the country 's @entity71 said
citing televised comments made by defense minister @entity79 on sunday , it said the army was not calling for full mobilization , as diplomacy was still the preferred method to resolve the crisis
the prime minister of the autonomous region , @entity86 , was recently appointed commander - in - chief by the region 's parliament , giving him the power to form an army , government spokeswoman @entity85 told @entity93
@entity86 told the @entity95 news agency that the decision to form a military stems from " the presence of illegal armed groups in the territory of @entity4 , " comments confirmed to @entity93 by @entity85
so far , it appears a small number of men have joined the new army
opinion : five myths about the crisis masked troops at @entity1 base monday 's appearance of masked troops at the @entity15 base came a day after a @entity8 group appeared to have kidnapped base commander @entity114 at a checkpoint , according to the @entity1 military
when a @entity93 crew visited the base monday morning , the @entity1 military was in charge , but @entity114 still was missing
the deputy commander said that if " they to try blackmail us into giving up the base , it wo n't happen
" three hours later , the crew returned to the base , and the @entity1 flag was no longer flying there
masked gunmen were on the property , looking at the crew from the other side of a fence
the deputy commander told @entity93 said 15 gunmen came to the base with @entity114 , and that the gunmen were planning to take vehicles from the base
@entity93 was not allowed inside
what @entity114 did upon his return is disputed
@entity142 spokesman @entity141 said @entity114 had switched allegiance and persuaded some of the @entity1 troops there to join him
@entity114 and the men who joined him loaded trucks with fuel , radios and other goods to take away from the base , according to @entity141
but @entity114 , talking later to @entity93 by phone , denied @entity141 's account
he said his kidnappers allowed him to return to the base , and that he still was loyal to @entity1
he said pro-russian forces did ask @entity1 troops at the base to change sides monday , but that he did no such thing
he said he still was at the base ; @entity93 could n't immediately verify his location
the control of base was n't immediately clear monday
@entity141 said both @entity1 and @entity34 flags were flying at the base late monday afternoon
@entity33 earlier this month secured permission from his parliament to use military force to protect @entity34 citizens in @entity1
the move came days after @entity52 's flight from the country
@entity52 was ousted after three months of protests against his decision to spurn a free trade deal with the @entity177 and turn toward closer ties with @entity37
are the @entity34 listening ? at the @entity181 , @entity180 ambassador @entity179 told reporters the situation in @entity4 " is worsening by the day
" @entity34 troops are being reinforced and @entity37 appears ready to annex the region , he said after a @entity187 session monday afternoon
" ( the session ) was a call to the @entity34 : we want to negotiate
we want a political settlement
please do n't worsen this crisis , " @entity179 said
but he added , " the @entity34 are not showing any signal that they are listening to us -- not only to the @entity187 , but to all the heads of state and government
" and @entity196 ambassador @entity195 said no " free and fair " vote could be held " while @entity4 is under the illegal control of @entity34 troops and armed militias who are denying access to international monitors
" " in the light of these concerns , if the referendum goes ahead on the 16th of march , its results must be considered illegal and illegitimate by all nations , " @entity195 said
opinion : clock is ticking on @entity4 crisis propaganda war earlier , @entity1 's @entity71 said a group of about 20 pro-russian activists from the so - called @entity4 self - defense squads had broken into the military hospital in the region 's main administrative city , @entity220 , and thrown out its chief
in a later statement , it said the hospital chief was back at work after negotiations but added the premises were being blockaded by the activists
however a @entity93 team that traveled to the hospital found it very quiet , with no one around
a guard on duty said he had not heard or seen anything unusual and that there was no senior official to speak with as monday was a public holiday
in the course of the rapidly changing events of the past week , a propaganda war over @entity1 has quickly developed as each side seeks to strengthen its stance
scenes of balaclava - wearing men without insignia patrolling streets or other premises have now become a familiar sight in the region
reports of confrontations were n't limited to @entity4
in the eastern mainland @entity1 city of @entity257 , just a few kilometers west of the @entity34 border , 50 to 60 pro-russian activists burst into an @entity259 tv station building on monday , editor - in - chief @entity253 said
the intruders initially threatened to burn the building if they were n't allowed to broadcast
but they eventually left , warning that they would return if they are dissatisfied with the station 's news broadcasts about @entity8 demonstrations in @entity257 , @entity253 said
@entity34 , meanwhile , accused far - right groups monday of " conniving " with the new authorities in @entity1
in a statement , the @entity269 condemned " lawlessness " in eastern @entity1 and accused the @entity50 of being silent over violence and detentions taking place against @entity34 citizens , such as one incident last week when it said masked gunmen fired on and injured peaceful protesters
on monday afternoon , @entity181 @entity279 ban ki - moon said he was " increasingly alarmed " by developments in @entity1
" recent events in @entity4 in particular have only served to deepen the crisis
as tensions and mistrust are growing , i urge all sides to refrain from hasty actions and provocative rhetoric , " he said .
