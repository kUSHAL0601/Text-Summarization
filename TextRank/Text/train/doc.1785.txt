-- the @entity1 has seen its global profile skyrocket over the last 12 months with the arrival of several high - profile football stars in big - money deals
the trend continued on thursday with the announcement that @entity10 's @entity9 - winning coach @entity8 will take over the reigns at ambitious @entity12 on a two - and - a - half - year contract
" i dispatched an assistant to go see the club 's matches , which made me even more determined , " the 64 - year - old told a press conference which was broadcast live on @entity17 state television
" i am very enthusiastic about coming to @entity17
" @entity8 has an impressive managerial record , having coached @entity22 to five @entity25 @entity24 titles and the @entity26 in 1996
@entity27 , @entity17 's reigning champions , started the spending spree last year by signing @entity31 playmaker @entity30 from @entity33 side @entity32 for a national record transfer fee
@entity30 has since been joined in @entity17 by former @entity36 striker @entity35 , who , after a prolific career across @entity38 , swapped @entity39 for @entity40 in january
@entity42 's @entity41 will become the latest recruit when he signs for @entity27 from @entity45 champions @entity44 on june 1 , for a fee which eclipses the one paid for @entity30
so what is attracting such stellar names to a country which has a limited football heritage ? " there are things happening in @entity17 football but there is still a long way to go , " @entity53 football expert @entity52 told @entity0
" i ca n't imagine that @entity8 has been always been desperate to work in the @entity1 , though @entity17 is a fascinating place and some of the cities are fantastic
" previous coach @entity61 soo had achieved on - field success with @entity27 , leading the club out of the second tier , to the @entity66 title and into the @entity67
but @entity52 said @entity61 's profile was not big enough for a club with grand ambitions
" it 's all about the name , " he said
" while @entity61 is well - liked in @entity17 and @entity74 , outside the region he has little standing
hiring @entity8 sends the message that @entity27 want to be @entity74 's first superclub
" @entity52 said the surge in football spending in @entity17 has been financed by powerful political figures , but that it may be detrimental to the future of the sport in the country
" the spark is all down to politics , power and connections
the next generation of @entity17 's leaders , including the next president are fans of football , and it is a great way for business leaders to get close to the decision - makers
" there is a huge disconnect between what the game actually needs and what it is getting
there are less than 10,000 registered under - 12 players in @entity17 ( @entity103 , with a tenth of the population has over 300,000 ) and you have to wonder what a similar amount of money would do if invested in the grassroots
" since arriving in @entity111 , @entity35 has seen his role at @entity113
last month , the 33 - year - old was added to former @entity117 manager @entity116 's coaching staff
@entity116 then resigned from his position , paving the way for @entity35 to assume a surprise player - coach role
" the situation is fairly chaotic at @entity111 and the team is pretty mediocre , " said @entity52
" big money was spent on new strikers but what the team really needs is midfielders
" he ( @entity35 ) does seem committed and is starting to talk to the press a little more
he also has the respect of the players , for obvious reasons , and he seems to be taking the coaching role quite seriously
" meanwhile , @entity133 announced on thursday that striker @entity134 has left the @entity136 club following the expiration of his contract
the former @entity140 and @entity141 star has been ravaged by injury during his three years at @entity143 , scoring just five goals in 31 @entity146 appearances .
