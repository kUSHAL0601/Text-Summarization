@entity0 , @entity1 -- the lengthy documents they initially were asked to sign used language even a native @entity4 speaker would struggle to understand
the @entity9 interpreters @entity10 first brought in for safety and cleanup training stirred painful memories and suspicions because they spoke to the elders with a @entity9 dialect and used what some described as " communist terminology
" the closings of fishing areas have been announced on radio stations these fishermen do n't follow , so some have piloted their boats where they should n't , which means tickets from the @entity27 keep coming
for the @entity9 - @entity29 living in the @entity31 region , the oil disaster is especially complicated
it 's made murky by language barriers , cultural misunderstandings and a history of challenges that have shaped them for more than half a century
their ties to seafood run deep and wide
a third of all fishermen in the @entity31 are @entity9 , making them arguably the most affected minority out there
more than 24,000 people of @entity9 origin live in @entity1 , according to the last completed census
about 6,000 live within a two - mile radius in the neighborhood of @entity49 -- distinguishing it , the area 's priest says , as the greatest concentration of @entity9 people outside of @entity55
in the rectory of @entity58 , the rev. @entity56 sits in front of an altar to his ancestors and his catholic faith
religious texts in @entity4 and his native tongue fill the high shelves around him , as do books bearing titles like " @entity68 , " " the evolution of @entity70 " and @entity72 's " @entity71
" here , he introduces some of the kafkaesque oil - disaster trials facing his own people
he talks about their distrust of lawyers -- " sharks , " he calls them -- who 've come in from out of state , circling them with promises and confusing papers
he mentions the mental health concerns -- depression , lack of sleep , tensions in homes -- that need to be addressed , a task made difficult by an absence of @entity9 - speaking therapists in a community that still stigmatizes admissions of emotional trouble
he worries about the lack of job training and opportunities for a people who 've worked in an industry that may suffer for @entity103 knows how long
" these are proud , active people who contribute to their own livelihood , and now they have to be in lines , " asking for handouts , he says
" it is a devastating blow
" about 80 percent of @entity9 - @entity29 in the @entity31 region are connected to the seafood industry through jobs that include fishing , shucking oysters , packing shrimp , and running stores and restaurants , the priest and others say
the work they do is something many brought with them from fishing villages in their native land , a place most of them fled as " boat people " after the 1975 fall of @entity128 and the end of the @entity130
that departure was for many the second time they 'd become refugees
they 'd already uprooted themselves and started over with nothing in 1954 , when their country divided into @entity140 and they , as the @entity143 minority living in @entity55 , ran from the @entity145 rule that took over the @entity140
the former archbishop @entity146 of the @entity147 reached out to them in refugee camps in @entity29 , inviting them to call his home theirs
so they came here in the ' 70s and ' 80s with the help of @entity156 and , over the next 30 years , reinvented their lives once more -- in a climate reminiscent of the country they 'd left behind
they worked hard in a familiar industry that did n't require them to master @entity4 , often leaving their children to be cared for by older siblings and relatives so they could put in long days
they created a self - reliant community where their own local businesses thrived
they planted acres of vegetable gardens along levees , incorporating the agricultural roots of their ancestors
today , people wearing the traditional conical straw hats stoop in their cultivated yards or walk along streets with names like @entity182
a trailer , lined with coolers of freshly caught shrimp for sale at hiked - up prices , is parked in front of a strip mall that includes @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192
@entity193 five years ago marked the third time they lost everything and had to start over
but it was also the storm that gave them a voice
the documentary " a village called @entity204 " -- a reference to the public housing project where they first settled -- debuted on @entity202 last month
it chronicles how the @entity9 - @entity29 living in @entity49 galvanized after @entity193 , making theirs among the first neighborhoods to rebuild
grass - roots organizers established agencies to fight for assistance and empower people , including one for youth called the @entity215 of @entity0 ( @entity216 - no )
the church , which began holding @entity219 just six weeks after the floodwaters destroyed what they 'd created , became a staging ground for construction help and community meals
health clinics sprouted up , as did a new charter school
and collectively , they protested a planned 90 - foot - high landfill of hurricane debris on their neighborhood 's edge , shutting down a move by the city government that they 'd never confronted en masse before
a few years later , in 2008 , they 'd help elect the nation 's first @entity9 - @entity29 congressman , @entity1 @entity238 @entity236
the next challenge : oil over a bowl of homemade pho , a @entity9 beef noodle soup , @entity241 provides a glimpse into how the community is mobilizing to face its newest challenge
he 's the 30 - year - old deputy director of the @entity58 of @entity248 ( @entity249 ) , established after @entity193 , and serves on the rapid response team created by @entity236 after the oil disaster
along with others on the team , he 's been crisscrossing the region , meeting with fishermen and others -- not just @entity9 -- to assess their needs , gather testimonies , answer questions and advocate on their behalf
they 've succeeded in gaining the ear of a @entity10 official , @entity263 , who among other things has approved the hiring of qualified and trained bilingual interpreters
" we had never been exposed to the @entity9 community , " says @entity263 , the @entity10 manager of government and public affairs for the lower 48 states and the @entity31
" clearly , it 's a tight - knit community , and it 's been a steep learning curve for us
the interaction has been great
" even with all he knows about navigating the system and securing whatever assistance is available , whether that 's food stamps or @entity10 claim dollars , @entity56 ca n't persuade some of his own relatives to get the help they so desperately need
" one of my wife 's uncles is a very proud man
i told him to come in and talk about services , " @entity56 says
" he said , ' i ca n't stand in line
what if someone sees me ? ' " while his wife 's uncle wo n't accept assistance , others in the state have driven hours to get simple answers to questions from agencies like the @entity249
the hope , @entity56 and others say , is that grass - roots organizations will sprout up elsewhere to help meet the growing and often different community needs
one such organization has already been formed in @entity306 , @entity307 , an area that is home to about 5,000 @entity9 - @entity29
the @entity308 of @entity309 and @entity310 , led by volunteers , is hoping to step in where the @entity0 organizations logistically ca n't
@entity314 , 36 , is working full - time -- on top of her real estate broker job -- to help wherever she can
she 's accompanying people to the @entity10 claims office
she 's meeting with fisherfolk to discuss their concerns and recognizes with frustration how unqualified she is to talk to them about fights in their marriages
she 's sending testimonials to the state judiciary , in an attempt to force @entity307 to expand assistance opportunities
and all the while , she 's worrying about what the future holds
she sees families falling behind on mortgages -- for their homes and their boats
at about $ 1 million a pop , many of the big @entity306 vessels require payments of $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 a month
the up to $ 5,000 a month that @entity10 is paying out to captains and boat owners is of little comfort to them , especially when there are home mortgages , too , college tuition payments and more
" they 've been doing this for 45 years , 50 years of their life
they 've relied on each other , " @entity351 says
" if this drags out , it will only get worse
" nearly 180 miles away , back over the @entity1 state line , @entity356 is racing around with her clipboard
she and her husband own @entity360 in @entity361 , a small fishing community
it 's a business they took over from her father - in - law , who 's standing around the dock in his " luck of the @entity368 " t - shirt
the shrimp being unloaded off their boat amounts to a third of what they usually bring in , says @entity56 , 27
it was out for two months , but given water closures imposed because of the oil disaster , access to shrimp was limited
" there 's nothing else we can do , " she says , refusing to ponder what the family 's alternative would be if life does n't get back to normal , and soon
" we 've never invested in anything else
" but rep. @entity236 holds out hope that the @entity9 community in the @entity31 will pull through -- because it always has
" we are resilient people
we are survivors , " he says
" it 's an obstacle in life , and we will overcome it
and we will emerge stronger
