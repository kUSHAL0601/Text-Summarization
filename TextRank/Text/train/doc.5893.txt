-- @entity1 piloted a @entity3 airliner
@entity4 hopped a ride on one for his last crusade
this aviation icon even stars in a reality tv show
almost 80 years after its introduction , a few hundred dc - 3s are estimated to still be flying worldwide
that 's kind of unbelievable in an age when dozens of younger types of airliners have already retired to aviation boneyards
" when we take them to air shows i watch people gravitate toward ( them ) , " says @entity17 , co-star of @entity19 's " @entity18
" @entity17 owns @entity26 's @entity25 and its six operating @entity9
" people always have a story
they say their dad or grand - dad flew one ... or they flew on one when they were young
" the @entity3 debuted in the mid- 1930s as an aviation rock star
with its two powerful propeller engines it revolutionized the travel industry by cutting typical coast - to - coast flight time across the @entity37 from 25 hours to just 18
although it typically seated only about 21 passengers , the plane allowed airlines to make a giant leap toward profitability
later a military version of the plane helped win @entity45 by dropping thousands of paratroopers during the @entity48 invasion of @entity49 , 70 years ago this month
result : the @entity3 has touched millions of lives
but what about this plane keeps it flying all these years later ? pilots will tell you the @entity3 wo n't quit because it was so well - built
some say its design and rugged landing gear helped it touch down safely on short runways
a day in the life of the world 's busiest airport but for @entity17 -- age 70 and still flying almost daily -- it 's about love
" you can choose your friends and coworkers but you ca n't choose the one you love
an airplane is the same
and in 1969 , the @entity3 came and it stayed with me , " @entity17 says
during some of the coldest weather on the planet , @entity17 's planes ferry tourists , hunters , adventurers and regional workers across @entity26 's remote @entity80
the 45 - minute @entity3 flights from @entity82 across icy @entity83 to @entity84 are pretty basic
passengers get no meals , no @entity87 , no video
" there 's coffee and cookies and juice , " @entity17 says
there is an alternative to in - flight entertainment : " a lot of passengers like the sound of the engine
it will lull you to sleep
it 's a perfect sleeping noise
" @entity17 's son once said the engines sound like a " funeral procession for the @entity107
" on the flight deck , for @entity17 , it 's all about the plane 's feel
these classic aircraft are controlled with a yoke connected directly by cables to the tail and wings
no fancy fly - by - wire electronics like newer airliners
no flashy heads - up displays for speed or altitude , either
an old fashioned instrument panel works just fine , thank you very much
" it 's very comfortable , " he says
" you 're in your own nest
you have the ability to feel what the airplane 's doing
" @entity131 flies the @entity132 in 2008 , a @entity132 helped @entity1 get out of a jam
fans of the @entity1 film " @entity136 , " may recall actor @entity137 in the cockpit of a beat - up @entity3
" let 's see if this thing will fly , " @entity1 says in the film
does it ? oh yeah
after takeoff , a super-fast jet fires on the @entity132 , forcing @entity1 to use the @entity3 's slow speed to outwit the jet pilot
the jet winds up as a stain on a rocky mountainside
chalk up a win for low and slow
back in the 1980s , a @entity3 served another movie franchise hero
in " @entity152 , " @entity4 flies from @entity153 to @entity154 to the @entity155 and @entity156 on his quest for the @entity159
50 spots , 50 states for 2014 @entity162 getting on board a @entity3 is an uphill climb
the plane 's tail sits on the ground when it 's not flying , forcing passengers to walk up a steeply inclined aisle to take their seats
" one of the most common comments i hear when some passengers come on board is , ' wow , there 's really an angle here , ' " says @entity172 , a longtime pilot for @entity173
three times per week , @entity172 flies dc - 3s loaded with cargo or passengers from @entity185 to the @entity186
in addition to passengers , @entity172 and his co-pilots have hauled horses , atvs and pretty much any legal cargo they can fit through the aircraft door
the @entity132 's rugged landing gear with its big struts can handle rough runways in places like @entity198 or the @entity199 , @entity172 says
" and the air frame is just so strong , it really is
" but the plane can also be temperamental , especially for pilots without much @entity3 experience , says @entity205 pilot @entity204 , who flies a daily @entity3 cargo route from @entity207 , @entity208 , to @entity209 , about 30 miles offshore
" you just have to respect it , not abuse it , " says @entity204
" i kind of feel like i 'm going back in time to the 1940s or ' 50s
" when the @entity3 flies , folks around the airport start shooting photos , @entity204 says
" i always notice that
it 's kind of like a rock star
" @entity204 fears the plane wo n't be around much longer
he says he 'll miss it
back in @entity82 , ice pilot @entity17 sees it differently
he believes the planes could easily fly for another 30 years " they keep making parts , so there wo n't be a shortage , " says this son of a prospector
if anything stands in its way , @entity17 says it will be a shortage of leaded fuel that his @entity3 's engines burn
the environmentally hazardous leaded fuel is being phased out
but losing the @entity3 would be a shame , @entity17 says
there 's simply nothing else like it
the plane is about as near humans will get to growing wings
" @entity245 to your a * * and let the wings extend out , " he jokes
" that 's the closest thing you will come to a human flying
