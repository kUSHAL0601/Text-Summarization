@entity0 -- outside a modest redbrick block behind the @entity5 department store in west @entity0 , a media circus is taking place
well - to - do shoppers laden with bags side - step the tv crews clogging the pavement , asking what all the fuss is about
this is no ordinary apartment block but the @entity15 embassy where @entity17 founder @entity16 has just been granted asylum in that country and is holed up inside the building
@entity23 ' @entity25 ' masks and pump revolutionary anthems including @entity27 's " we are @entity22 " and @entity29 's " @entity28
" scuffles broke out earlier between campaigners and police officers , captured on film by 10 times as many cameramen and watched by handfuls of resigned - looking residents
reporters pack the alleyway beside the building , in case @entity16 makes a bid for freedom in a getaway car
but @entity1 's @entity45 at the scene says this is the same alleyway used by @entity5 ' delivery trucks
the @entity49 sought refuge at the embassy on june 19 in a bid to avoid extradition to @entity54 where he is wanted for questioning over accusations he sexually assaulted two women
explaining the reasons for granting asylum , @entity15 foreign minister @entity59 said thursday there is credible fear that if @entity16 is sent to @entity54 , he could be subsequently extradited to the @entity64 , where he could be charged with espionage and treason
@entity16 published thousands of secret @entity64 government documents in 2010
we know he is still tweeting
at 2.30pm @entity0 time he posted his thanks to the @entity70 in @entity71 : " @entity72 a @entity15 y ustedes
" he may have seen supporting tweets from across the world , such as that from documentary filmmaker @entity77 who urged campaigners to rise up : " @entity79 calls for people to head over to @entity82 consulate in @entity83 now 2 protest @entity82 threat to raid @entity15 embassy
" the @entity82 government insists the @entity82 still has a legal obligation to extradite @entity16 to @entity54
as the @entity92 tweeted : " we are disappointed by the statement from @entity15 's foreign minister that # @entity15 has offered political asylum to @entity91
" it is a sentiment that prompted the @entity15 foreign minister @entity95 Â± o to hit back : " we are not a @entity82 colony
" @entity54 's foreign minister @entity98 however , remained pragmatic , posting : " our firm legal and constitutional system guarantees the rights of each and everyone
we firmly reject any accusations to the contrary
" meanwhile , the @entity16 gags continue to roll in on social media
photos of taxi drivers apparently called to the @entity15 embassy with signs to pick up one @entity16 have been retweeted hundreds of times
then there 's @entity113 , who joked on @entity114 : " @entity15 gave @entity17 founder @entity16 assylum
apparently , @entity118 founder , @entity117 , is heading there now too
" @entity45 contributed to this report
