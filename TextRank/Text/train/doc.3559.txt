@entity0 , @entity1 -- three @entity4 presidents met with their defiant counterpart in @entity1 tuesday in an effort to defuse the country 's political crisis
no details of the meeting in @entity0 , the administrative center of the conflict - torn country , were immediately available

presidents @entity20 of @entity21 , @entity22 of @entity23 and @entity24 of @entity25 were next meeting with @entity15 's challenger , @entity27 , who also claimed victory at the polls and who has the international community 's support as @entity1 's legitimate leader
the three heads of state represent the 15 - member @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , which held an emergency meeting last friday in @entity38 and delivered an ultimatum to @entity15 : step down or face the threat of military force
@entity15 's minister of interior @entity42 said sunday the three leaders would be " received as brothers , friends
" " we will listen to them , listen to the message they are carrying , " he said
" if they abide to our constitution , we 're going to talk ... our constitution is not negotiable

the @entity36 delegation met earlier tuesday with @entity56 - @entity55 , @entity59 secretary - general @entity58 's special envoy ; and a representative of the @entity61

" and the @entity113 has halted lending and disbursing funds to @entity1 and has closed its office in the country
