resource rich and home to some of the world 's fastest - growing economies , the stage is set for @entity6 to become the world 's next industrial juggernaut
but making this dream a reality remains a major challenge
a lack of railways , ports and quality roads has hindered @entity6 's development in recent years
but today , economic heavyweights such as @entity18 and @entity19 are pumping billions of dollars into @entity6 to transform the continent 's fortunes and stake a claim in the world 's next high - growth territory
and last month , the @entity26 and the @entity27 launched a fundraising initiative for @entity29 , a project aimed at speeding up infrastructure ventures on the continent
here , @entity32 takes a look at some of the big projects set to take @entity6 by storm
tell us what you think about them in the comments section below
@entity42 -- @entity43 potentially the world 's largest hydroelectric dam , the @entity46 is a project to tame the mighty @entity48 and provide much - needed renewable energy for up to 500 million @entity50
with work scheduled to begin in october 2015 , it 's claimed the @entity46 would produce 40,000 megawatts ( mw ) of energy , that 's twice as much as @entity18 's @entity54 , currently the world 's largest
read this : @entity43 's mega dam ambitions in may , the government of the @entity43 announced the first phase of its grandiose plan , a $ 12 billion development , dubbed @entity62 , which will produce 4,800 mw
@entity64 estimates suggest that just 11.1 % of @entity43 's population has access to electricity
but with the whole project estimated to cost $ 80 billion , analysts says that raising funds will be a challenge
@entity71 -- @entity72 -- @entity74 railway project -- @entity77 / @entity76 / @entity75 stretching almost 3,000 kilometers and connecting three @entity80 countries , the @entity71 - @entity74 railway could be the continent 's answer to the @entity83
starting in @entity77 's second city with a stop - off at the @entity76 capital , @entity72 , the rail line will circumvent @entity88 before heading for its final destination of @entity74 , @entity75
with work scheduled to start on the @entity71 - @entity92 section next month , the whole project is due to be completed by march 2018 with an estimated cost of $ 13.5 billion
@entity94 -- @entity77 @entity95 is a $ 9.2 billion dollar technology and financial metropolis project located southeast of @entity92
dubbed the " @entity100 " the project is part of " @entity103 , " the @entity77 government 's plan to improve the quality of life for its citizens

but the state will provide only 5 % of the funding , with the rest expected to come through land leases to private companies
@entity122 -- @entity124 / @entity123 this 650 - kilometer railway will link up the @entity124 capital of @entity127 and the @entity128 in the small @entity130 nation of @entity123
the project is part of the @entity124 government 's @entity134 plan and is set to cost $ 1.2 billion , according to estimates from consultancy @entity137
@entity123 represents @entity124 's only seaport access and would significantly reduce the cost of goods and transportation for the landlocked country
the @entity143 -- @entity124 @entity124 's ' under construction ' renaissance dam is set to be as grand on scale as it is in name
scheduled to be completed by july 2017 , the enormous barrier will cost the @entity124 government $ 4.7 billion and is being assembled by @entity153 engineering firm @entity151
the @entity143 will sit on the @entity155 river in the @entity156
creating 12,000 jobs and generating 6,000 mw of energy , the dam will also serve neighboring @entity160 and @entity161 , which both rely of the @entity164 's water resources
the project has caused controversy in @entity160 and @entity161 , as both countries are concerned the dam will give @entity124 control over the flow of water
@entity173 project -- @entity6 once completed , the @entity174 will be a 96 mw solar photovoltaic ( @entity177 ) plant in @entity6 's @entity178 -- one of the biggest solar installations in the continent
in may this year , @entity183 giant @entity182 , which has spent more than $ 1 billion in renewable energy projects in the @entity185 and @entity186 in recent years , made a $ 12 million investment in the scheme
the project will create 300 construction jobs and 50 permanent operational jobs , according to the @entity6 @entity192

other @entity80 countries are also following the solar craze
earlier this year , @entity205 , in @entity204 , launched what 's described as @entity6 's biggest solar pv plant so far , a 15 mw solar pv plant that will supply energy to nearly 10,000 homes
@entity210 a major cosmopolitan transport project to connect @entity214 's largest city , the @entity211 is designed to ease congestion and speed up journey times for the city 's inhabitants
