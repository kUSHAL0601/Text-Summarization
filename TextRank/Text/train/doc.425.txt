-- is @entity1 a hero ? @entity4 citizens -- and @entity1 fans and haters alike -- have been debating this question since gov. @entity8 announced he would fly the state 's flags at half - staff for the singer saturday as mourners attend her funeral in @entity15 , @entity4
@entity8 's decision has been widely criticized -- 77 % of @entity19 readers called it " inappropriate " in one informal and unscientific poll
but he has strongly defended the order , hailing @entity1 as " a daughter of @entity4 " who should be honored for her " cultural contributions
" for decisions like this , there is a federal " @entity28 , " which stipulates only that the flag be flown at half - staff to honor deaths of certain public officials , adding that governors can honor members of the government or military from their state
opinion : @entity1 's glorious voice but regardless of what the official code says , the standards around flag - flying have been fuzzy for years
most of @entity8 's prior orders to lower the flag have honored service members killed in combat , yet he issued the same order after the death of @entity51 , the saxophonist for @entity53 's @entity52
@entity54 received the honor years earlier
so there 's some precedent here for musicians , and @entity1 's astronomical album sales certainly make the case for her cultural influence
her ascent from humble @entity4 roots to pop superstardom offers a source of pride for @entity8 and other @entity70
and flying a flag at half - staff could provide a form of collective mourning , a way to rally a community around things they share -- like a hometown hero whose music touched countless people throughout the state and around the world
is all that enough to merit an honor usually reserved for people who 've performed tremendous services -- and made incomparable sacrifices -- for their country ? true , @entity1 's rendition of " @entity89 " is by far the most acclaimed ( and best - selling ) recording of the national anthem by a pop singer
but should that enter her into the ranks of @entity97 heroes ? indeed , giving this honor to @entity1 seems to illustrate what psychologists @entity99 and @entity101 have called our increasingly " watered - down " view of heroism
@entity99 and @entity101 argue that we pay a cultural price when we praise athletes and celebrities as " heroes " : we lose sight of the strong moral qualities that should define heroism , and we lose touch with what it takes to nurture more demanding forms of heroism
" by diminishing the ideal of heroism , " they write , " we keep ourselves from confronting the older , more demanding forms of this ideal
we do not have to challenge ourselves to see if , when faced with a situation that called for courage , we would meet that test
" through their research , @entity99 and @entity101 have come up with their own criteria for what constitutes a hero
for one thing , heroism entails some type of quest , for example to save a life or to uphold a principle
it also involves real sacrifice or risk , including a risk of one 's own life
who meets these standards ? the 30 service members for whom @entity8 has lowered the flag clearly do
in fact , the sad truth is that for more than a decade , @entity1 sat on the end of the moral spectrum opposite from presidents and war heroes
her struggles with drug addiction and her troubled marriage to @entity157 tarnished her public image
she became an object of scorn and derision
and , ultimately , i suspect that this is part of the reason we 're seeing such effusive tributes to her now
yes , some critics of @entity8 's half - staff decision say it sends the wrong message to give this level of recognition to someone with a history of substance abuse
but i ca n't shake the feeling that the official , government - sanctioned respect @entity1 is getting in her death is on some level a reaction to all the insults she endured in her life
when @entity1 's life and voice fell apart , many of her onetime fans and longtime critics showed little sympathy
the flag flying at half - staff feels like a way not just to honor her virtues as an artist , but to show remorse for how she was treated as a person
" what i would say to everybody is , ' there but for the grace of @entity206 go i , ' " @entity8 said
but i do n't remember any politician embracing her as " @entity4 's daughter " after she did her embarrassing " crack is wack " interview with @entity210 , after she checked into rehab , or after @entity157 was charged with physically abusing her
in that light , a flag flying at half - staff seems more like an apology than an honor -- an act of contrition for spurning a women who suffered addiction and abuse
behind the tributes lies guilt and , too late , some compassion
@entity8 says he believes people are questioning his decision because of @entity1 's drug problems
but maybe it 's partly because of her troubles , not in spite of them , that she 's being honored
