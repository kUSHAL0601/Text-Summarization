-- it 's been 30,000 years since @entity2 walked the earth , but now we can hear what they sounded like , according to a @entity7 anthropologist
neanderthal man apparently sounded like a frog croaking or a human burping when talking
@entity11 of @entity12 in @entity13 reconstructed @entity2 vocal tracts to simulate their voice with a computer synthesizer
the result is a single syllable that sounds strange and unremarkable : part croaking frog , part burping human
but @entity11 says that 's because @entity2 lacked the " quantal vowels " modern humans use
" they would have spoken a bit differently , " @entity11 said at the annual meeting of the @entity26 in @entity27 this month
" they would n't have been able to produce these quantal vowels that form the basis of spoken language
" @entity34 magazine discussed @entity11 's findings and linked to his vocal simulation on its web site
listen to neanderthal man speak @entity11 used 50,000 - year - old fossils from @entity40 to make his reconstruction , @entity34 said
he plans to simulate an entire @entity2 sentence , the magazine reported
to reconstruct the vocal tracts , @entity11 teamed with linguist @entity45 , who worked in the 1970s to deduce the dimensions of a @entity2 larynx based on its skull
