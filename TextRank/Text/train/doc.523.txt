in the video , the boy , who has been identified as @entity10 in prior @entity7 videos , sports long hair and wears a black sweater and military fatigue pants

the boy stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol high

we are scaring ourselves with @entity7
within the ranks of hordes of terrorists , we have a good intelligence network
this allows us to track the movement of those who are of interest to us
