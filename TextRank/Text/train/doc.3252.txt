-- imagine yourself on a ferryboat deck with a latte in one hand , your overnight bag at your feet , and the dazzling @entity7 , @entity8 , skyline filling the horizon behind you
while the boat churns across @entity12 , the @entity10 disappears from view and a shoreline materializes in the distance
@entity16 is about 35 minutes from @entity7 by ferry

@entity118 's @entity117 , along the waterfront , serves some of the best fish - and - chips on @entity23
@entity121 's dishes stand out despite its location next to a gas station
7:30 p.m. while several restaurants offer live music , @entity124 and @entity125 , a wine bar , are the island 's best adults - only venues
on the first saturday of each month , @entity132 improv troupe grabs the local playhouse stage
or catch independent films at @entity135 , a 1936 movie house on the island 's south end
if you have n't already eaten , make a pre-showtime stop at nearby @entity141 for the island 's best thin - crust pizza
10 p.m. there 's more to see and do tomorrow , so head back to your hotel for some shut - eye : the @entity148 wins praise as @entity31 's premier accommodations , with four well - appointed rooms and three luxurious townhomes
@entity153 provides traditional motel amenities , and more than a dozen @entity155 and rental homes dot the island
two of the most exquisite : @entity158 , a 5 - acre retreat with spring - fed ponds , waterfalls and gardens , and @entity163 , with a 180 - degree view of @entity23
9 a.m. @entity165 up with traditional morning fare at @entity168 's @entity167 or @entity169
for a lighter option , try @entity171
you wo n't find toast on the bakery 's chalkboard menu , but order it anyway
when the thick - cut wheat slices and jam arrive at your table , you 'll be glad you did
10 a.m. there 's still time to explore @entity31 's compact commercial district , which offers everything from a top - notch travel store to a distinctive candle shop

then indulge your sweet tooth at either @entity204 or @entity205
1 p.m. before the sun sets on your visit , stop at the @entity208 to uncover a history tied to shipbuilding , strawberry farming , and @entity213 internment during @entity214 or stroll the boardwalk that leads from @entity148 to the ferry terminal
