-- @entity3 overdosed on " aspirin and a sleep aid " and was rushed to a @entity8 , @entity7 hospital monday night , her manager said
the overdose came the same day she read a court complaint from a woman who alleged that @entity3 carried on a yearlong affair with her husband , according to manager @entity15
" her injuries are not life threatening , " @entity15 said
" she was dehydrated and exhausted at the time
" she was expected to be released from the hospital tuesday , he said
@entity3 publicly acknowledged the affair in a statement tuesday issued by @entity15 that said " @entity3 fell in love with mr. @entity26 and believed that he loved her
" " @entity3 is heartbroken and is sorry for any pain she may have caused , " @entity15 said in a written statement to @entity0
" yesterday , she was totally overwhelmed by the lawsuit and the media attention
" the former " @entity33 " winner was hospitalized overnight but was expected to go home tuesday , @entity15 said
the police report obtained by @entity0 said @entity15 called 911 to report the overdose at the singer 's home in @entity8 , @entity39
in a child custody case filed last week , @entity40 charged that @entity3 and her husband , @entity26 , became romantically involved last august
the singer fell in love with @entity26 based on lies he told her , @entity15 said
" @entity3 believed mr. @entity26 when he told her he was not happy in his marriage and his heart was not in it , " @entity15 said
" she believed him when he told her he and mrs. @entity40 separated in the late summer of 2009
she believed mr. @entity26 when he told her he lived elsewhere
" @entity26 even took her to a residence where he claimed he lived apart from his wife , @entity15 said
photos of @entity3 and @entity26 were published online in recent months , prompting questions about their relationship
" @entity3 gave inconsistent interviews about the status of her relationship with mr. @entity26 because sometimes they were on and sometimes they were off , " @entity15 said
" when they were on , they spent most of their time together when she was not traveling with work
" she read @entity40 's child custody complaint for the first time monday , @entity15 said
" she knows some of the allegations in mrs. @entity40 's complaint are totally false , " he said
" there are others she strongly doubts
there is plenty she does not know
" the petition , which said the couple separated in june , described a phone conversation in july in which @entity3 allegedly told the wife : " he do n't want you
... maybe the next time that you get a husband , you 'll know how to keep him
... that 's why he is here with me
" while @entity3 is not directly involved in the current legal case , @entity39 is one of only a few states that allow a spouse to sue a third party who interferes with a marriage for alienation of affection
the @entity92 , @entity39 , native has enjoyed a successful recording and acting career since winning " @entity33 's " third season
her second album , which has received favorable reviews , will be released on august 24 , while the second season of her reality show debuts next month
