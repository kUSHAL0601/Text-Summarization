@entity0 , @entity1 -- at 39 years old , @entity3 really has no business trying to pitch in the major leagues
in the harsh reality of professional sports , he 's a has - been
just do n't tell him that
the former first - round draft pick last pitched for the @entity9 in 2005 after a 10 - season career spent mostly as a left - handed reliever
" you go as long as you can , " he told @entity2
" i had a good friend tell me , ' man , just make them tear the uniform off of you
you can do whatever you 're gon na do for the rest of your life
you ca n't play baseball forever
' " in the middle of the 2011 baseball season @entity3 announced in a first - person article for @entity25 that he would try a comeback
after his brief major league appearance in 2005 , he pitched subsequent years for one team in @entity29 and three in @entity30
this time , he wrote , he would agree to a risky medical experiment that would involve injecting his own stem cells into his injured pitching shoulder , which he hurt in an initial comeback attempt last spring
@entity3 was following the path of 37 - year - old @entity36 , who in late 2010 went through the same procedure
@entity36 wound up restored to health and pitched credibly for the @entity39 in 2011
@entity3 telephoned the doctor who treated @entity36 and agreed to pay about $ 3,000 for the procedure
@entity3 and the physician , dr. @entity42 , agreed to @entity2 's request to follow the procedure and report on the outcome , no matter what that turned out to be
in late august , @entity3 went to @entity42 's @entity47 office and watched as some of his own stem cells were extracted from fatty tissue around his waist
the stem cells were then spun in a centrifuge and emerged as something called platelet rich plasma ( @entity55 ) , which athletes have been using in recent years to restore their health
@entity3 returned several weeks later for a follow - up @entity55 injection
no human growth hormones , which are a banned substance in major league baseball , were used
both @entity3 and @entity42 told @entity2 they were well aware of the risks
" we really do n't have a good uniform idea of what constitutes platelet rich plasma , " @entity42 told @entity2
" i mean , what is it ? you could ask 10 doctors and they 're going to give you 10 different answers
we really need to get together and form an idea as to what it is
" one doctor contacted by @entity2 says the whole process is essentially worthless
" there are many , many misstatements , direct inaccuracies and errors in the way that growth factors and stem cells are portrayed , " dr. @entity77 , president of the @entity78 , said after reading an informational packet written by @entity42 , available to patients on his website
" if it were subjected to a critical analysis by experts in the field , it would be dismissed as unfortunately superficial and inaccurate
" none of that seemed to matter to @entity3 , who said all he wanted was a chance to pitch one last season in the major leagues
@entity2 followed him after his injections through a grueling series of workouts
first , he had to regain his arm strength by hitting tennis balls hurled at him by a machine
then , he had to throw a football at a moderate pace
finally , in october , he began to throw a baseball again
@entity3 felt that his arm strength was back to normal and his fastball was back to its usual velocity
@entity3 has converted himself into a sidearm pitcher , abandoning the customary over-the - top delivery
his specialty , he said , would be to come in briefly in the late innings of a game to get one or two left - handed batters out and the unusual pitching motion would make him more effective against lefties
but finding a spot on a major league roster would be difficult , even if he were healthy and even though left - handed relief pitchers are a valuable commodity
@entity2 correspondent @entity121 talked to @entity3 at his home in suburban @entity123
" do you ever lay in bed and think , ' am i delusional ? ' " @entity121 asked
" there 's times where you question yourself , " @entity3 said
" anything you want to do , if you have a passion about it , you 're gon na do whatever it takes to do it
and so that 's where i 'm at
there 's times doubt definitely creeps in
" on @entity138 , @entity3 found himself at a baseball stadium in @entity140 , capital of the @entity141
he had paid his own way there to try out for a job as a reliever for one of the four teams playing in the @entity149 round - robin playoffs
his agent had a friend who was also an agent in the @entity141
after two days of waiting , @entity3 finally had his tryout -- and he won a job
the pay for two weeks with the @entity155 ? $ 2,500 , less that one - fifth of what a major - league rookie makes
@entity3 pitched in five games during the @entity141 postseason
he did n't allow a hit in his first four appearances but gave up four runs in final game there
when he returned to the @entity165 , he could n't find any big league teams interested
finally , he managed to get a tryout with the @entity169
again , he thought he did well but there was no contract
no return to major league baseball
@entity174 is still at home without a pitching job
he 's helping coach several youth teams
he still works out and contemplates pitching in an independent league
he was able to get a temporary baseball - related job
he auditioned for a role in an upcoming movie biography of @entity185 general manager @entity184 , who signed @entity186 to his first major league contract
@entity3 will have a speaking role as a pitcher on one of the @entity185 ' opponents
he just hopes that it wo n't be his final time on the mound .
