long before the candidates set foot on stage in @entity4 , president @entity0 headed into the final debate of the 2012 campaign with the biggest advantage of all : he 's already commander - in - chief
the foreign policy face - off on monday was devoted to a subject on which presidents can speak about decision - making in the first person and challengers ca n't
as recently as a few weeks ago , coming off a rocky foreign summer tour and a widely panned response to the deadly september 11 attack on the @entity19 diplomatic mission in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 seemed headed for a tough night
but that was before the administration faced its own politically charged questions on the @entity21 assault over security and its response to what actually occurred and who may have been behind it
five things we learned from the final debate whether it was a reaction to the @entity38 's handling of the situation or just a reflection of @entity22 's overall growing strength , several recent polls suggested @entity0 's edge on foreign policy had narrowed
and @entity22 's biggest strength in the debates so far -- an aura of unshakeable confidence -- promised to be a critical asset in a night devoted to leadership
more than what he said , voters reacted to the way he said it
foreign policy is an area where many voters do n't feel entirely confident themselves ; @entity19 are less likely to have passionate and strongly held positions on currency speculation or trade negotiations than on abortion or taxes
read a transcript of the debate winning the policy debate is important
but looking like the stronger leader might be an even bigger priority
last time , @entity22 pushed so hard on details about the president 's response to the @entity20 attack that he unintentionally let him sidestep the heart of the original question about diplomatic security
it was a mistake he did n't seem likely to make twice
but this time , he barely pressed the president on @entity20
instead , the night played like a mirror image of the first debate
@entity22 approached the face - off with a cautious frontrunner strategy : a priority on appearing presidential and , wherever possible , emphasizing common ground
debate 's global reaction : disappointment and @entity0 took on the aggressive underdog role , needling @entity22 with virtually every response
on a night where sharp policy distinctions were in short supply , the president even tried to turn the areas of agreement into an attack : " you say you would do the same things we did , but you would just say them louder
" from one angle , @entity22 's approach -- to sound presidential and stay largely above the fray -- was the best strategy to win over the women voters he needs
and on a night where the final debate of campaign 2012 competed with both @entity108 and the pivotal game of baseball 's @entity111 championship , women may well have made up a larger share of the viewing audience than ever before
fact check : @entity0 , @entity22 and @entity116 but allowing your opponent to come across as the tough guy when the showdown is a 90 - minute audition for commander - in - chief is a risky strategy -- especially when you 're a challenger with a short foreign policy resume who needs to convince voters you 're strong leader who can keep the country safe
@entity22 had the benefit of seeing the president 's play - it - safe strategy flop in the first debate -- which made his decision to adopt it in the final one even more puzzling
so the only candidate with an actual foreign policy track record was n't the one who faced the toughest attacks tonight
the president did n't necessarily score a knockout -- but he did land the most punches
this was the last , best chance for @entity0 and @entity22 to make their pitch to a sizable audience in every battleground state
so , since foreign policy has n't exactly ranked high on voter priority lists this year , virtually every question ended up with an answer close to home
for more than 10 minutes , the debate stayed focused on domestic education policy , the deficit and jobs
@entity0 wins final debate , but does it matter ? a question about @entity19 's role in the world drew an answer about the @entity19 unemployment rate
@entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 all rated mentions ; @entity166 and the @entity167 did n't
the candidates had one , extended tense exchange over the auto bailout and " @entity172 " investment
in @entity175 's post-debate poll , voters gave @entity0 the edge on performance -- but that opinion did n't necessarily shift their votes
the most recent pre-debate surveys show @entity22 gains resulting in a virtual tie among likely voters nationally , and hinted at momentum in key swing states like @entity4
if @entity22 's measured performance drew higher marks from women or the vanishingly small sliver of remaining swing voters , he might be able to maintain that momentum
but unlike previous debates , there was a big gender gap , with women responding much more favorably to @entity0 's performance and men giving a small advantage to @entity22
the president has retained a healthy edge among registered voters ; if the debate boosts @entity205 enthusiasm , the likely voter model could shift , and the president would see a bump in the polls even if he failed to win over a single undecided voter
the first debate dramatically altered the campaign dynamic ; but in a race now so tight that 1 - or 2 - point swings practically rate surge status , the question is whether monday 's winner can expect any major impact at all
were your questions answered ? let us know on @entity221
