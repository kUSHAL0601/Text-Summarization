@entity0 , @entity1 -- three @entity5 cricket players at the center of a gambling scandal have been charged with " various offenses " by the sport 's governing body , the @entity3 announced thursday
team captain @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 have all said they were innocent but have been provisionally suspended pending a decision on the charges , the council said
" we will not tolerate corruption in cricket -- simple as that , " said the council 's chief executive , @entity17
" we must be decisive with such matters and if proven , these offenses carry serious penalties up to a life ban
" a fine could also be imposed as part of the punishment
@entity17 cautioned that the players ' guilt has not been proven
" that is for the independent tribunal alone to decide , " he said
meanwhile , @entity5 high commissioner @entity33 told reporters after meeting with the players that he believes their claims of innocence
" they have not been proven guilty , " @entity33 told a throng of reporters
" and until you are proven guilty , you are innocent
" a police investigation into the alleged scandal is continuing , but no further meeting with police or questioning of the men is scheduled , he said
@entity33 did , however , vow to take legal action to defend the players if necessary
" i think we will go to the court of law to defend them , " he said
eighteen - year - old @entity14 is the youngest - ever bowler to reach 50 test wickets
he took six wickets -- considered an impressive feat -- against @entity1 in the test on which the betting allegations are centered
for such an exciting prospect , already hugely popular in his homeland , to be tarnished by a scandal like this has depressed many cricket fans in @entity65
@entity13 has already courted controversy in his career
he has tested positive for steroids twice , and soon after the second offense , he was caught with a recreational drug in his wallet at the @entity73 airport and was kept in detention for three weeks
the betting allegations emerged sunday in the @entity77 tabloid @entity76 , which reported that two @entity65 players deliberately bowled " no balls , " or fouls , during their @entity81 series with @entity1 in @entity0 last week
it said the alleged ringleader made 150,000 pounds ( $ 232,800 ) in the scam
@entity1 won the match at @entity87
it ended sunday afternoon , after the scandal broke
@entity33 said thursday it is possible the players are the victims of a setup , saying they have been " maligned by the media " and are the victims of " character assassination by the media
" " you have to investigate to find out whether they 've been set up or not , " he said
referring to the @entity76 -- a newspaper known for its sensational headlines -- he added , " what is the reputation of those people who have brought us this story ? " team manager @entity103 said @entity0 's @entity104 have already questioned him and the three players
several people have been arrested in connection with the case
the @entity104 arrested a 35 - year - old man late saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers and released him on bail sunday , and customs officials arrested three people sunday on suspicion of money laundering
@entity65 's president @entity117 also ordered an investigation into the scandal , his spokesman said sunday
@entity2 's @entity120 and @entity121 contributed to this report .
