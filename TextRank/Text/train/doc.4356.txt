a female juror in the murder trial of former @entity4 star @entity3 was dismissed tuesday by @entity6 judge @entity5 for talking about the case
the juror had said it would be difficult to convict the ex-player without a murder weapon and discussed inadmissible evidence , @entity5 noted
the judge dismissed the juror after ordering the public out of the @entity16 courtroom for a hearing that included defense lawyers , prosecutors , witnesses and the juror
the closed - door session was " no broader than necessary to protect @entity3 's right to a fair trial , " @entity5 said
after the hearing , @entity5 also said there was " credible evidence " that the dismissed juror had expressed interest in being part of the @entity3 jury and had attended more @entity4 games than the juror admitted on a questionnaire
" the juror 's recollection of conversations is not supported by the credible evidence , " the judge said
the juror 's presence on the jury " posed a substantial risk " to the fairness of the trial , she added , and the dismissal was necessary in " the best interest of justice
" @entity3 , 25 , pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of former semipro football player @entity48 , 27 , who dated the sister of @entity3 's fiancee
two alleged accomplices , @entity52 and @entity53 , have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately
the trial resumed tuesday afternoon , with @entity55 , 23 , who was dating @entity48 at the time of his death , returning to the witness stand
her sister , @entity59 , is @entity3 's fiancee and mother of his child
on tuesday , @entity55 broke into tears when she recalled a call from a state trooper with word that " @entity48 was dead
" @entity55 testified that she later visited her sister and saw @entity3 , who placed his hand on her shoulder to console her
@entity3 told her " he 's been through this death thing before and it would all get better with time , " she testified
after @entity3 left the home , @entity55 testified , her sister @entity59 kept receiving cell phone calls and text messages
@entity55 said her sister seemed " secretive , " her responses " very short
" @entity77 would go to the basement to continue the conversations , her sister testified
one time , @entity55 told the jury , her sister went down to the basement with what appeared to be a new garbage bag folded in her hand
@entity59 later left the house , returned and asked to borrow her sister 's car , @entity55 testified
the sister , who had never borrowed @entity55 ' car before , said she was going to the bank to get money for the housekeepers , according to @entity55
last week , @entity55 testified that she introduced @entity48 to @entity3 on her birthday in august 2012
@entity55 told the jury that @entity48 and @entity3 were in the " beginning stages of a friendship
" she said the two men and others would gather in @entity3 's basement " man cave " -- with fitness and theater rooms , a bar and pool table emblazoned with the @entity4 ' logo -- to smoke marijuana
but @entity55 said she was not aware of her boyfriend and @entity3 ever getting together outside of the home except for the day @entity48 was killed
in opening statements thursday , defense lawyer @entity109 said the two men were close friends and that @entity3 had no reason to kill @entity48
@entity109 described the victim as one of his client 's " partying pals " who was known as the " blunt master '' for the marijuana cigars he often procured for @entity3
the two men could have been brothers - in - law , he said
" @entity3 is not the murderer of his friend , " @entity109 said
" in june 2013 , @entity3 was planning his future , not a murder
" the case has divided the @entity55 sisters , who sit on opposite sides of the courtroom -- shaneah with @entity48 's mother and @entity59 with @entity3 's family
prosecutor @entity131 has told the jury that @entity3 not only orchestrated the killing , but also participated in it and covered it up
@entity135 summed up the prosecution 's largely circumstantial case , telling the jury that @entity3 and his associates killed @entity48 and then " took evidence with them and tried to and , in some cases , were successful in destroying evidence
" the three picked up @entity48 and drove to a secluded area where he was shot and killed , @entity131 said
a marijuana blunt found near @entity48 's body had traces of both his dna and that of @entity3 , @entity131 said
@entity3 's dna also was found on a .45 - caliber shell casing found in a car he had rented
a footprint at the industrial park where @entity48 's body was found matched sneakers worn by @entity3 , the prosecutor said
@entity48 , who was shot six times , was shown in photos on his back in the industrial park where his body was found
the defense said the one - time @entity164 star worth $ 40 million was targeted by police and prosecutors in the death of the semipro football player because of celebrity status
@entity3 " never had a chance " as authorities zeroed in , @entity109 told the jury
" as soon as they found out @entity3 -- a celebrity football player for the @entity4 -- was a friend of @entity48 's , it was over , " he said
on june 16 , 2013 , @entity48 was riding with friends in a black @entity177 , which police later learned was rented by @entity3
close friend @entity179 was with @entity48 when he said @entity48 got a text from @entity3 , asking to hang out later that night
as they parted ways , @entity48 told @entity179 he 'd see him later
@entity48 's body was found the next day
the judge has blocked any mention that @entity3 was indicted in two other killings in @entity187
@entity3 pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of @entity189 and @entity190 outside a bar in @entity187 in 2012
a trial date has n't been set
@entity1 's @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .
