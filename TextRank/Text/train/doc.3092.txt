one thing appeared certain when @entity1 announced thursday how much money its @entity4 e-readers brought in over the past three months : the news would be lousy
revenue from the company 's @entity8 for its fiscal 2013 third quarter declined 26 % from the same period a year ago , primarily as a result of slumping sales of the devices
is the bookseller just losing ground to rival @entity16 and its market - leading line of @entity18 ? perhaps
but many tech analysts see something else happening : the booming market for tablet computers is starting to make the dedicated e-reader obsolete
" it 's not that the @entity4 failed , " said @entity24 , a digital analyst at @entity26
" it 's that the world of tablets exploded , going faster than anyone expected , putting us in a place where tablets are now a fundamental part of our computing and lifestyle entourage , not just a handy device to consume a bit of media
" @entity41 rocked the computing world in 2010 with the release of the @entity44 , introducing the world to the concept of user - friendly tablets
while they already existed in some form , tablets were pretty much unknown to all but the most tech - savvy among us
since then , all @entity41 has done is sell more than 120 million of them
competitors struggled to come up with a worthy alternative until late the next year , when @entity16 -- already a leader in the e-reader market -- rolled out its simpler , smaller @entity56 , priced at $ 199 , far lower than the @entity44
its relative success not only inspired the launch of devices such as the @entity61 7 , but it likely nudged @entity41 into the new midsize tablet market with the @entity63
the net effect ? anyone interested in a tablet now probably has a price point with which they 'll be comfortable
and tablets , which are priced similarly to top e-readers , also work well for reading e-books
throw in @entity72 , apps and e-mail -- all on a full - color tablet screen -- and e-readers suffer by comparison
this trend has been particularly unkind to the @entity4
during the quarter that included last year 's holiday season , @entity1 's nook business , which includes e-readers and e-books , suffered a 12.6 % sales decline over 2011 , bringing in just $ 311 million
earlier this month , the company said the nook - related losses they 'll announce thursday would be even bigger than previously expected
the bad news came despite @entity1 slashing the price of its @entity91 e-reader in december to $ 79
@entity16 does n't release detailed sales figures
but the @entity56 clearly emerged as the market leader in the past couple of years , after doing neck - and - neck battle with the @entity4 early on
in the last quarter of 2012 , the company said it increased its sale of e-books and other content for kindles and similar devices by 22 % over the same quarter in 2011
but analysts expect that even @entity16 's success with dedicated e-readers will fade
" it 's a rough market to compete , " said @entity105 , a tech - industry analyst with research firm @entity107 " on one hand , devices like the @entity44 dominate the consumer tablet experience which includes reading
on the other hand , less demand for dedicated devices had helped @entity16 , which already established a strong brand presence with @entity56 as part of a much larger personal - cloud ecosystem
" @entity16 has transitioned well into that new world
this holiday season , the new @entity119 was @entity16 's top - selling device in the @entity56 line , the company announced
second ? the older , and price - reduced , @entity56
hands - on with the new @entity18 and unlike @entity1 , which is strongly branded as a bookstore , @entity16 has created its own online universe of sales , @entity24 said
" as part of @entity1 , the @entity4 is stuck as a media device offered to media consumers when in reality the tablet business is poised for much more than this , " he said
many reviewers actually liked @entity1 's response , the @entity132 , better than the first - generation @entity56
but , as @entity24 notes , its lack of an expansive ecosystem hurt it
when the first wave of tablets hit the market , three years after the first kindle and a year after the @entity4 , e-readers could still boast a significantly better reading experience
e-ink felt significantly more like printed text than a sometimes glare - prone tablet screen , which was difficult to read in bright sunlight
but now , every one of the major tablet makers boasts high - definition screens that ratchet up not just the quality of video and snazzy graphics but the way text appears in reading apps
the general consensus among observers is that they have n't caught up to the dedicated e-readers in text quality quite yet , but give them time
" if you love reading and are looking to invest a chunk of money into a device as a dedicated e-reader , then the @entity44 is not your best bet , " @entity158 , of @entity161 content partner @entity159 , wrote last year in a review comparing the third - generation ipad to e-readers such as the third - generation kindle
( that @entity44 has the same screen as the most recent one )
" the value you can get from devices like the @entity56 ( or several other competitors like the @entity177 or @entity178 ) , will allow you to save money to spend on what is presumably your main passion : books
" but for folks wanting a more complete computing experience , he wrote , the difference was already negligible
" the trouble comes when you start to think of your e-reader as more than an e-reader , " he wrote
" e-ink kindles are abysmal at web browsing , for example , and they do n't run popular apps and games like the @entity44 and other tablets on the market today
" there are other types of reading , like webpages and magazines , that matter just as much as books to many readers , too
for those needs , an @entity44 's retina display will display images and text like a champ
" so , is there any future for dedicated e-readers ? @entity24 says that as @entity16 continues to establish itself as an internet clearinghouse for all sorts of goods ( both physical and digital ) , the @entity4 , which got a $ 300 million infusion from @entity211 last year , could look to selling textbooks and other educational tools
a rumored plan to split the e-book division off from @entity1 's brick - and - mortar stores could come as early as thursday and would be a perfect jumping - off point , he said
" all the more reason for @entity4 to separate from @entity1 , turning to its investment partners like @entity211 and @entity223 and saying , ' let 's see how far we can take this platform into productivity and education , ' " he said
" of course there 's risk there , but there was risk in getting into the tablet business
