the obscure banking provision that threatened to derail the recently passed government funding measure was derided by @entity2 as a sop to @entity4
but some on the left have a @entity8 problem with the " @entity9 " -- they were for it before they were against it
at issue , was the so - called push - out regulation , which was designed to prevent banks from using government insured money to make risky investments -- like the loan swaps that fueled the 2008 financial crisis
buried inside the 1,600 - page spending proposal to keep the government running is a small provision to end that prohibition
but last fall , that same proposal was considered by the @entity26 - controlled @entity25
the bill , the majority of which was written by @entity30 and other @entity4 banks , passed with the support of 70 @entity2
on thursday , 28 @entity25 @entity2 seemingly changed their mind , voting against the spending bill that included the rollback provision -- a provision that became the rallying cry for progressive democrats hoping to kill the bill
of course , the massive legislation gives lawmakers lots of potential explanations for why they changed their votes
but whatever the explanation , in politics , it 's still scored as a flip - flop
many progressive democrats complained that the rollback was snuck into the bill at the last minute
not true , said @entity26 and @entity2 sources familiar with the negotiations
it had been an issue for weeks
on the @entity25 floor , @entity56 rep. @entity55 blasted the rollback as a danger to consumers
" they know that we bailed out the big banks and know that we would be putting them at risk one more time to bail them out if we allow them to do this risky derivatives trading , " she said
the top @entity70 on the @entity71 , @entity69 urged her colleagues to vote against the spending bill unless @entity26 removed the regulatory rollback
she was shocked to learn that both president @entity75 and vice president @entity76 were calling lawmakers asking them to pass the bill
but just two years ago , @entity69 supported a proposal that would have done exactly the same thing she opposed last week , allowing banks to buy risky financial instruments with government backed money
back then , even @entity2 rep. @entity85 , whose name is on the @entity4 reform law , supported the rollback
@entity69 evolution on the issue started a year and a half ago - in the wake of a high profile scandal involving a trader known as the " @entity94 " who engaged in swaps that generated billions in losses
she opposed the measure the @entity25 passed last fall , arguing regulations should stay in place overseeing these transactions
@entity69 defended her new position saying in a statement to @entity106 that , " it 's become clear that @entity4 derivatives trading has not yet been sufficiently reigned in by our regulators
" she says she 's in good company , noting that @entity85 , who has since retired from @entity111 , has changed his position and supports barring banks from using government - backed money on risky transactions
but the idea was never beloved by @entity2 to begin with
championed in 2010 by then - @entity2 sen. @entity121 as she tacked left during a tough primary fight , then - treasury secretary @entity118 and then - @entity120 chairman @entity119 -- both @entity75 picks -- were unsupportive
related : @entity111 passes spending bill , avoids shutdown so perhaps it 's no wonder that the rollback became a bargaining chip
@entity2 sen. @entity128 , the spending bill 's key @entity129 negotiator , defended the rollback arguing the legislation also boosts the budgets of regulators in charge of policing @entity4
" i do n't want the derivative market to go wild
this is not the @entity138
we made sure that we put money in the federal checkbook , " she said on the @entity129 floor friday
" agencies that are in charge with enforcing the rules to protect against abuse are funded
" @entity2 agreed to kill the swaps regulation in return for republicans agreeing to increase the budgets of two financial regulators , the @entity152 and the @entity153 , and taking other changes to the @entity4 reform bill off the table , according to multiple government and industry sources
a @entity2 @entity129 aide said the financial agencies ' funding levels were negotiated separately and had " nothing to do " with negotiating the rollback legislation
@entity25 press secretary @entity164 said friday it was hard " to account for all of the conversations that took place " while the @entity25 and lawmakers were negotiating the spending bill
but a financial services lobbyist noted that nobody on either side of the aisle wants credit for helping banks
" everybody had enough deniability that they were ok with it , " the lobbyist said
" there was no press release going out about it
