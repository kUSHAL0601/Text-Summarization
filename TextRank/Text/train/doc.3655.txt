-- some @entity2 writers used to like @entity3
choosing their words carefully , they might say they tolerated him
those who churned out hugely popular soaps and television shows thought @entity2 's president , in his mid- 30s when he took power in 2000 , wanted to be known as a modern leader who defended free expression
some said @entity3 even looked the other way when a sketch comedy show aired for several seasons that made fun of corruption in @entity2
at worst , many reasoned , the young president would n't be anymore hard - line than his father , @entity19 , who had long kept a purple - knuckle grip on all media in @entity2
in hindsight it seems @entity3 was the greatest actor of them all , suggested @entity26 during a recent phone interview from his @entity29 apartment
it was dusk when he picked up the phone
the screenwriter and novelist , one of the most famous writers in @entity2 , usually spends this time of day writing
but lately he said he 's had trouble concentrating
now he finds himself looking out to the street , watching people gather for demonstrations
their loud demands fill the night
" it is a completely different world than a year ago , " he said
" people at night do not sleep
" @entity26 's career hit a stride at the same time @entity3 took power
he remembers all the talk of change from @entity2 's new leader in the early 2000s , just as the proliferation of satellite television throughout the region suddenly gave @entity2 access to different entertainment and points of view
demand for new shows skyrocketed
more manuscripts than ever were flooding into @entity3 's so - called censorship committee ( it never had a formal name )
@entity64 , to creative optimists such as @entity26 , was the new frontier , a democratic movement not even the regime could stop
@entity26 had known since he was a kid that he wanted to be a writer
his parents , olive tree farmers in @entity73 , said he should do something else
they talked about law , so he went to law school
but could he be a lawyer ? " i was either going to become a writer or commit suicide , " he told @entity0
with his natural flair for drama , he got a gig writing for tv to support his passion for fiction
to his surprise , he liked the industry
and it liked him back
@entity26 became one of the most sought after dramatic television writers of his generation , a @entity2 @entity91
in 2006 , after toiling for 13 years , @entity26 published " in praise of @entity93 , " a @entity95 novel that tells the story of an @entity73 family surviving against the backdrop of the real - life 1980s bloodbath between @entity2 's military and @entity103 militants in the city of @entity105
critics hailed it as a classic , praising its intricate and colorful storyline
they lauded @entity26 's particularly deft ability to narrate in the voice of a young girl
the book was nominated for the @entity114 , known as the " @entity116 " prize
@entity118 's regime promptly banned " in praise of @entity93
" from fiction to @entity121 @entity2 artists give an oh - well shrug to censorship because it 's just part of life in the country , @entity26 said , so he did the same
a poetry and fiction magazine he worked on for years had been banned , and government censors frequently tore his television scripts to bits
he coped , usually with humor
he laughs about smuggling his books across the @entity135 border and giving a moody but curious guard a copy
booksellers sold " in praise of @entity93 " by reportedly switching the book 's jacket with another
but @entity26 finds very little funny anymore
the violence marring @entity2 for more than a year has left him sad and furious , he said
so the writer is doing what few established artists still living in @entity2 are , especially those who made their professional mint " working " with the regime to produce television shows
he is aligning himself publicly with the opposition
now rather than devoting his days entirely to fiction , the novelist is writing on his @entity121 page , constantly posting notes of encouragement to the opposition
he posted march 15 , the anniversary of the start of the @entity2 uprising : " on the occasion of the birth of the revolution , can we all remove from our dictionaries words that reference sectarianism -- @entity166 -- @entity167 -- @entity168 -- @entity169 -- and avoid speaking about weapons
... " on @entity172 , march 8 , he posted : " on this day there is no woman besides the mother of the martyr , the sister of the martyr , and the daughter of the martyr , and all the fighters of this great revolution
" @entity26 told @entity0 , " i want to be close to my people , supportive of them and the revolution
" @entity185 choice for @entity2 artists @entity26 's recent outspokenness shows how artists have survived for years under artistic oppression in @entity2 , said @entity190 , an anthropologist who lived in @entity2 off and on until 2010
she studied pop culture and media there and befriended actors and writers such as @entity26
@entity2 artists have always faced a stark choice , she says
" they can choose exile , which is often unfeasible and of no benefit to the country , " she said
" or they can compromise , an option that can lead to an ultimate good if it enables them to convey subversive or critical messages , however muted
" @entity26 's comments may put him in danger , @entity190 said , noting several reports have been published about the @entity2 authorities monitoring dissidents ' phone and internet activity
it 's possible , she said , that @entity26 's fame has inoculated him from arrest or other harm
whatever might be keeping him safe , @entity26 is n't going to stop supporting what he calls " the revolution , " even as violence bears down on his city
increased violence in @entity29 , marked by recent twin car bombings that killed at least 27 people and clashes between the military and rebels , portend a dark future for the capital , he said
the fighting has all but stamped out any hope that @entity29 could fulfill its potential as an international arts haven , as many predicted a few years ago
in the late 2000s and even as protests against @entity3 's regime began , blogs and mainstream news organizations raved about @entity29 as the @entity239 world 's nerve center for contemporary art. foreign capital was flowing into @entity2 , which prompted a startling push toward modernity in the capital -- at least on the surface
high - end galleries and boutique hotels opened
glossy magazines such as @entity249 wrote breathlessly about @entity2 's first lady , @entity250
@entity29 ' new opera house was the rage
@entity254 @entity253 lauded the opening of a new media gallery that sponsored the first international video arts festival in the country
the @entity259 reported @entity2 's art scene might be the @entity261 , quoting a @entity263 travel agent scoping out @entity29 so she could entice rich collectors to go on a buying tour
the buzz was n't all highbrow
even @entity269 hip - hop songs shouted out to @entity29 a few years ago
@entity270 and @entity271 told everyone the party was there
a story for the past and future pop culture in @entity2 was driven largely by tv shows for which @entity26 wrote -- melodramas that kept viewers tuning in daily
@entity26 and his tv colleagues became so confident that they could push boundaries with @entity3 that they would send in fake scripts with scenes that would never make it past censors
" we saw it as a game between us and the regime ; one time we won , one time we lost , " @entity26 recalled
" sometimes we would intentionally add a scene in a script that we knew would not pass
but we just did it to make a point
" the ardor of this ostensible openness informs @entity298 's " in praise of @entity93
" he set the story against the backdrop of @entity2 politics and violence in the 1980s , knowing full well it would irk censors
many younger readers , including those protesting for a freer @entity2 , have told him they are reading his book and re-examining his contemporaries ' writing to learn about the country 's past violence
" many of the youth do not know the details of what happened in the ' 80s so they are going back and reading ... , " he said
" they are feeling really angry that the same cycle is happening all over again
" " in praise of @entity93 " has been translated into several languages , but for the first time , it 's about to be published in @entity323
@entity26 said he is excited about this translation and hopes it will help more people understand the nuances of his country
he wants the world to see what he has seen and to know @entity2 is more than a nightly news story of blood and despair
he is quiet when asked if he would ever leave @entity29
the question is absurd to him
he would never abandon @entity2 , he said , even if it meant greater personal safety and more artistic freedom
" if i had the choice to remain silent in @entity2 or leave and speak my mind , i would choose to remain silent and stay here , " he said
" i feel that i need to remain close to my people and to the revolution and speak of what i believe
" @entity0 's @entity343 contributed to this report .
