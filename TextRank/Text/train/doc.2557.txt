-- congressional investigators are accusing the @entity2 of violating its employee gift limit with rewards of @entity5 , digital cameras and other electronics , just as a video emerged of a lavish conference that shows employees drinking and making jokes about wasteful spending
the video , first obtained by @entity14 on friday , offered a glimpse inside the agency 's $ 820,000 conference in @entity18
an administration official confirmed the authenticity of the video and provided a copy to @entity0
reports of the lavish conference have prompted taxpayer outrage , embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on the wasteful spending by the agency that acts as a real estate agency for the federal government
" these videos reinforce once again the complete lack of judgment exhibited during the 2010 @entity33 , " said @entity29 , a @entity2 spokesman
" our agency continues to be appalled by this indefensible behavior , and we are taking every step possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again
" the latest news comes just days after the @entity41 documented massive overspending by the @entity2
the fallout from the report 's revelations has sparked a congressional investigation and seen the @entity2 chief step down , two other employees fired and a number of others suspended
on friday , @entity52 investigators for the @entity53 said the @entity2 's @entity2 developed an employee incentive program known as the " @entity55 " that spent nearly $ 500,000 on gifts -- from ipods to gps devices -- that vastly exceeded its $ 99 per - gift limit
they also said accounting for the gifts as well as the justification for giving them were lacking or inconsistent , according to a statement released by rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , chairman of the @entity66 , and rep. @entity67 , @entity68 , chairman of the transportation committee
while the investigation found the @entity2 's massive spending began in 2007 under the @entity75 administration and continued under the current leadership , @entity52 congressmen leading the investigation have hammered president @entity77 over the allegations
" more and more information is coming out about the total lack of accountability and outrageous spending habits of the @entity2 , " @entity64 said in the statement
@entity64 accused the administration of treating taxpayer dollars " like their own private slush fund
" meanwhile , @entity87 chairman @entity86 , @entity65 , has accused the @entity88 of sitting on the @entity90 's findings about the @entity2 for 11 months
the administration has dismissed @entity86 's claims , saying the investigation followed proper procedures
the allegations friday by @entity64 and @entity67 , and the video are likely to inflame the political divide
the video shows employees at the @entity2 's @entity98 in @entity18 putting on magic shows and singing @entity101 songs
in one clip , a person dressed as a clown talks about making work more difficult for others
" @entity109 , if you think the problems we create are bad , just wait until you see our solutions , " the clown warns the audience
the reports of overspending have prompted a bipartisan reaction , with sen. @entity118 , @entity119 , the chair of the @entity120 , saying she will hold hearings on the @entity2 findings next week
@entity0 's @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .
