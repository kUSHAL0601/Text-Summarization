-- one night , back when i was @entity2 's age , i drank six glasses of grain alcohol mixed with grape - flavored @entity5
my roommate @entity6 said it was a bad idea
my other roommate , @entity9 , also said it was a bad idea
my closest friend , @entity11 , insisted it was n't merely a bad idea but the worst idea ever
" you barely touch booze , " he said
" this wo n't end well
" " quiet , " i replied
" i can handle it
" that night , in room 102 of @entity20 at the @entity21 , i vomited into a toilet for 45 straight minutes
@entity6 , who was kindly holding up my head as the cool water reflected onto my face , repeatedly muttered , " i told you so
... i told you so
" alas , i was but a child
i lacked the maturity and wisdom to know what was for my own good
sunday evening , during his team 's 24 - 14 playoff loss to the @entity35 , @entity2 , the @entity36 ' star rookie quarterback , insisted on remaining in the game despite being tossed around like a @entity39 doll with the stuffing yanked out of its legs
during the first half , @entity2 reinjured his previously sprained right knee after falling awkwardly while rolling out of the pocket
he rose gingerly and moments later could be seen behind the @entity36 ' bench , having tape applied
this was nothing new for the kid
earlier this season , in a december 9 game against the @entity51 , @entity2 sprained his lateral collateral ligament , missed the following week and returned with an awkwardly fitted black brace wrapped around the knee
@entity56 : first slowed and then silenced , @entity2 injury spells end for @entity36 this time , with the season on the line , @entity2 and @entity58 , @entity59 's coach , engaged in a halftime conversation
according to @entity58 , the quarterback told him , " coach , there 's a difference between being injured and hurt
i can guarantee you i 'm hurt right now
give me a chance to win this football game , because i guarantee i 'm not injured
" so @entity2 -- in his " six glasses of grain alcohol mixed with grape - flavored @entity5 " moment -- returned
his once @entity74 speed was gone
his tight spirals had been replaced by @entity77 ducks
it reminded one not of a football game so much as the 1982 heavyweight title fight between @entity81 and @entity82 , the one where @entity82 left the ring so bloodied and beaten that @entity85 never again worked the sport
much like prize fighters , defensive football players are trained to locate an opponent 's weakness and exploit it
if a guy 's arm is black and blue , nail it with the crown of your helmet
if a linemen is having trouble seeing with his left eye , gouge the right
there sunday , in the pummeled form of @entity2 , stood a walking , talking weakness
a battered quarterback , defenseless without his tools
the @entity35 , rightly , exploited it
when @entity58 heard @entity2 's plea , he should have looked across the locker room at his son , @entity111 , who serves as the team 's offensive coordindator
were @entity2 his son ( and not merely his quarterback ) , would he have sent him back on the field , sans a leg ? would he have forced @entity111 to face one of the @entity120 's most vicious defenses without a full arsenal ? @entity58 should have thought of all the retired @entity120 players who can no longer walk , can no longer drive , can no longer feed themselves , who -- in the name of toughness and staying on the field -- are pathetic shells of their former selves
it has been reported that , earlier in the season , @entity130 , the renowned orthopedist , never cleared @entity2 to play against the @entity51 , that @entity58 had ignored proper protocols in the name of winning a stupid football game
( @entity58 disputes this , however
) but if @entity130 had not cleared @entity2 to play , the @entity36 organization should be ashamed
if that 's the case , @entity2 should n't be asking himself whether he can play
he should be asking himself whether anyone in power cares for his well - being
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .
