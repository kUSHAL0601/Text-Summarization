-- it 's 25 years since the end of @entity6 rule in @entity7 , and although much may have changed in the @entity9 nation , its production line of gymnasts continues to generate champions
from @entity14 , the sport 's first " perfect 10 " back in the 1970s , to multiple ' 80s gold medalist @entity18 and the post-revolution exploits of @entity20 , the country 's young women have set benchmarks of excellence
standing less than five foot tall , but with deceptively long legs , the 18 - year - old @entity21 is the latest to be dubbed the " @entity23
" having helped @entity7 to a team bronze at the @entity25 , she has blossomed this year -- claiming two golds at the @entity9 championships as the only gymnast to qualify for all four finals and finishing runner - up in the all - round competition at last week 's worlds in @entity33
" i did n't choose gymnastics -- it chose me
i am very glad to have got so far , " she tells @entity0 's human to @entity39
@entity21 was spotted as a child playing in a park , chasing her brother on rollerblades
" i think she noticed the speed and the energy and that impressed her , " @entity21 says of the woman who became her first coach , @entity46 Â¢ mpeanu - @entity45
@entity51 was probably not the sort of pastime available to children during the reign of president @entity56 , whose bloody overthrow in 1989 signaled the beginning of a new era
" i was born after @entity60 , however my parents told me about how much stricter things were back then compared to now , " @entity21 says
" now it 's a very open country and people survive by doing what they can -- it 's much easier than before
i 'm glad i did n't live through that
" nonetheless , she learned the rewards of hard work when , aged five , she joined @entity70 's @entity69 -- an institution renowned for producing champions in a wide range of sports
and when she was selected to the junior squad at the age of 10 , she realized how important gymnastics was to her
" it was a new path that i had to try out and try to go all the way to the end , trusting myself as much as i could , " she recalls
it did n't take long for her to appreciate the thrill of performing in front of a crowd
" i loved being watched by people , " she says
" it 's so important , when you 've been working hard , to be able to show what you 've worked for daily
" @entity21 describes her sport as a " beautiful story that encompasses in all domains an elegance and attention that you have to display when working on the apparatuses , the determination you need to show on each , the pleasure as well
" " you ca n't succeed without pleasure and desire , " she says .
