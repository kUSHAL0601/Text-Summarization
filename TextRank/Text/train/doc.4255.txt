@entity0 -- the aging veterans gingerly walk from the plane in the nation 's capital
some get pushed in wheelchairs
a brass band strikes up @entity10 era tunes
strangers rise to their feet and clap their hands
" why are they doing this ? " says @entity14 , 86 , a co-pilot on a @entity15 during @entity10 " i feel as humbled as a mouse
" @entity18 was overwhelmed as he made his way through the crowd
" the chills came over me
very seldom do you see something like that , " says the 92 - year - old army veteran
these @entity10 veterans have traveled here to visit the @entity28 , which honors the 16 million @entity30 armed forces who served and the more than 400,000 who died in battle
the vets made the trip thanks to a former employee at the @entity37
a physician 's assistant at the @entity37 in @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 was struck by the @entity10 vets he treated and how few made the journey to see the memorial that honors them
" they dedicated the @entity10 memorial in may of 2004 , 60 years after the war had ended
that was a cause of celebration in my clinic
all of the veterans wanted to see it but they were in poor health or did n't have the means to visit it
" " reality set in , " @entity42 says , " they were never going to see their memorial
" @entity42 was determined to change that , because he so admired the quiet grit and heroism of the unassuming men he treated every day
he took his cause to a local air club
" i stood before 150 pilots and told them i was going to start flying @entity10 veterans to @entity0
i said if you want to help me , the @entity10 veteran does n't pay a penny
you 'll have to rent an airplane and cover all the travel costs
" " @entity76 " took to the skies in may of 2005
six planes flew 12 veterans
the next month , eight planes flew 16 veterans
today , it operates like a volunteer airline , with 86 hubs in 33 states
instead of renting small planes , they charter @entity88 jets , thanks to donations that keep the planes in the sky
so far , more than 30,000 veterans have experienced a visit to the memorial , courtesy of @entity76
" witnessing their emotions is what fuels our cause
when you see @entity10 veterans break down in tears because they had no idea how much this nation reveres , cherishes and loves them for what they 've done , it really overwhelms them , " @entity42 says
in the days and weeks before each @entity76 , an army of ground volunteers coordinates every detail of each trip -- from the buses that pick them up to the meals they eat
shortly after @entity119 and his group arrived in @entity0 this day , they were taken by bus to the memorial
many said they were stunned by its size and scope
inscriptions carved in granite recognize specific battles that were fought in @entity130 and across the @entity131
a wall of stars marks the high price of freedom
they paused to remember the 448,000 who died in the war -- and their fellow survivors who did n't live to see this moment
" each of those stars represents 100 men and women who died in @entity10 , and i realized that my division has almost 39 stars on that wall , " said @entity142 , 85 , who stormed the bullet - ridden beaches on @entity144 as a platoon sergeant with the @entity146
@entity42 says the trip often provides closure for the vets who visit
many veterans open up at the memorial and speak in detail for the first time about what they went through
" i 've had exchanges with veterans that are jaw dropping , " @entity42 says
" you ca n't fathom what it 's like to have experienced what they went through fighting for their lives
" the same " @entity76 " that transported the veterans to @entity0 returns them back home , landing just 12 hours after it took off
the elderly warriors seem renewed rather than exhausted by their whirlwind trip
" i will never forget this , " say 86 - year - old @entity177 , who served in the @entity131 on the @entity178
" everybody is so happy and treating us so nice
" @entity182 , 88 , added , " i feel so fortunate to be here
so many did n't make it
" for @entity42 , the founder of @entity76 , the end of each flight is a bittersweet experience
his mission continues with an air of urgency , because less than 10 percent of the @entity30 who served in @entity10 are still alive
an estimated 1,200 @entity10 veterans die every day
" in another five to seven years , our efforts will be a moot point because they will be gone or too infirm to participate in a mission like this , " he says .
