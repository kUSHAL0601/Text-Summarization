a promising way to stop a deadly disease , or an uncomfortable step toward what one leading ethicist called eugenics ? @entity7 health officials are weighing whether to approve trials of a pioneering in vitro fertilization technique using dna from three people in an attempt to prevent illnesses like muscular dystrophy and respiratory problems
the proposed treatment would allow a woman to have a baby without passing on diseases of the mitochondria , the " powerhouses " that drive cells
the procedure is " not without its risks , but it 's treating a disease , " medical ethicist @entity24 told @entity29 's " @entity28 " on wednesday
preventing a disease that can be passed down for generations would be ethical " as long as it proves to be safe , " he said
" these little embryos , these are people born with a disease , they ca n't make power
you 're giving them a new battery
i think that 's a humane ethical thing to do , " said @entity24 , the director of medical ethics at @entity44 's @entity43
" where we get into the sticky part is , what if you get past transplanting batteries and start to say , ' while we 're at it , why do n't we make you taller , stronger , faster or smarter ? ' " but @entity51 , the director of the @entity52 , said there are no changes to existing genes involved
" there is no genetic engineering
it is n't a slippery slope
it 's a way to allow these families to have healthy children , " said @entity60 , whose organization developed the technique along with @entity64 researchers
" what we 're doing is , without at all changing the dna of the mother , just allowing it to grow in an environment that is n't sick , " she added
a @entity76 advisory panel concluded two days of hearings into the procedure wednesday
the panel discussed what controls might be used in trials , how a developing embryo might be monitored during those tests and who should oversee the trials , but no decisions were made at the end of the session
mitochondrial disorders are inherited from the mother
in the procedure under discussion in @entity93 , genetic material from the nucleus of a mother 's egg or an embryo gets transferred to a donor egg or embryo that 's had its nuclear dna removed
the real reason behind the multiples baby boom the new embryo will contain nuclear dna from the intended father and mother , as well as healthy mitochondrial dna from the donor embryo -- effectively creating a " three - parent " baby
in june , @entity111 took a step toward becoming the first country to allow the technique
one in 6,500 babies in the @entity111 is born with a mitochondrial disorder , which can lead to serious health issues such as heart and liver disease
@entity24 said the same technology could be used to modify an embryo to " making super babies , " a practice he said amounted to " eugenics
" " the big issue over the next 5 to 10 years is going to become how far do we go in pursuit of the perfect baby , " said @entity24
" do i think we 're going down that road ? yes
does it creep me out ? yes
are you going to be able to draw a clear line ? i do n't think so
" but @entity60 said the procedure is closer to an expansion of in vitro fertilization , which has been available for nearly 40 years
" it 's a complicated science , so people need to understand the particulars of the biology and not jump to calling it something it is n't , " she said
the last thing she would want , she said , " is for the @entity52 to be involved in anything like designer babies
" " i have children and grandchildren , and i ca n't imagine anything worse
" record number of women using @entity154 to get pregnant
