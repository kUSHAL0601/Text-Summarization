@entity0 , @entity1 -- when people think of @entity5 , three things come to mind : gondolas , art and sinking buildings
the watery city , a treasure trove of renaissance art and architecture , is not normally associated with cutting - edge cool
but recent developments show that the city is in fact thriving -- due in large part to the many artists and designers who have chosen to make the city their home , and because each year it is host to exciting events such as the alternating architecture and contemporary art biennales , and the @entity5 film festival
the yearly influx of creative professionals , in addition to the vast numbers of tourists visiting the city , is starting to forge a different , more contemporary vibe
getting off the beaten tourist track and into local @entity5 haunts can also yield some pleasant surprises
@entity2 's arts and culture show , icon , has dug beneath the city 's old - world veneer , and come up with a guide to the cooler side of @entity5
see : if you want to see contemporary art outside of the @entity43 , which takes place every two years in the @entity45 , look no further than the @entity46 and @entity47
both were developed by @entity50 billionaire and art collector @entity51 to showcase his impressive contemporary art collection , which includes work by artists like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57
the @entity46 , located between the @entity58 and the @entity59 , was developed by @entity61 architect @entity60 , and the interiors are sleek and almost industrial in comparison with the ornate palaces normally associated with the city
other contemporary art spaces to visit include the @entity68 on the @entity69 , which hosts a changing schedule of exhibitions in addition to a permanent collection and a shop selling artist 's books , posters and gifts
currently the museum is hosting a show of work by @entity82 abstract expressionist painter @entity81 and the @entity83 is serving dishes inspired by the artist 's work until the beginning of january -- so if you ca n't take a piece of work home , you can at least eat one
otherwise , check out the @entity91 , a stunning palazzo in central @entity5 that hosts temporary art exhibitions alongside a permanent @entity78 and antiquities
every two years the foundation teams up with @entity97 fashion brand @entity95 to award a prize to a young @entity97 artist , encouraging local creativity and attracting artists to live and work in the city
stay : @entity50 product designer @entity105 , who has lived on the @entity5 island of @entity107 for 25 years , has designed the interior of a luxury hotel called the @entity110
a far cry from the typical @entity5 hotel experience , the rooms feature floor - to - wall mirrors , pop - art inspired chairs and a minimal palette of white and chrome
if you are on a lower budget and craving something other than the heavy brocades and four poster beds prominent in many of the hotels here , head to the light and modern ca ' @entity129 in @entity130
it 's handily located near the rail and bus stations , and is in one of the more typically " @entity5 " parts of the city
featuring modern and contemporary art on its walls and simple , modern furniture , it 's a calm , minimal oasis for @entity143 - weary visitors
drink and eat : @entity5 is known for its mouth - watering food and elegant drinking establishments
@entity148 -- once a drinking hole for the likes of @entity151 and @entity152 -- remains a popular haunt for celebrities and the art crowd , as does the bar at the chic @entity158 hotel , which becomes inundated at @entity43 time
if you want to get away for an evening , a water - taxi trip will take you to @entity107 and the restaurant @entity163 , one of @entity105 's favorites , and an excellent purveyor of delicious fresh seafood
for partying , @entity167 is one of island 's most frequented clubs , a pit - stop for students and tourists as well as celebrities
though the city has acquired the nickname @entity177 ( in @entity1 , @entity178 ) for its ordinarily quiet nightlife , it becomes a party hotspot during the film festival and biennales
events take place in grand palazzos , on yachts moored near the @entity188 and even in an art deco aircraft hangar out on the @entity190 -- if you can bag an invite , these are the places to see and be seen
shop : the aesthetic in @entity5 is smart , chic and understated
though not ideal for bargain - hunting , the city is teeming with boutiques
@entity196 , @entity197 and @entity95 -- @entity97 designers known for their classic designs , and all three patrons of contemporary art -- are the brands to wear for casual bellini drinking and museum hopping .
