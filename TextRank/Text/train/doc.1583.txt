-- " @entity1 : @entity4 " is , in a way , a tough game to figure out
on one hand , the " @entity1 " franchise has provided many hours of enjoyment for fans for 25 years , while chronicling the adventures of everyone 's favorite green - hat - wearing elf , link
on the other hand , i was looking for something that was going to advance the franchise in new directions and possibly break some new ground
" @entity4 " is full of what we 've come to know and love about @entity13
maze - like terrain , challenging dungeons , familiar weapons and , of course , the quest to find @entity1
there is little here that we have n't seen before
@entity33 , @entity13 's trusted horse , has been replaced by a giant bird that carries him to distant locations
unfortunately , there is n't much challenging or exciting about riding around on a flying bird after you 've done it once or twice
( but , since @entity13 is based this time out on a city floating in the sky , trying to ride a horse around could have gotten messy very quickly , i suppose
) i was also confused about where this game falls in the " @entity1 " timeline
link appears to be slightly older , but he does n't have any of his traditional garb or weapons
he is a recruit in the knights ' program and , in fact , has to earn his familiar hat and clothing
contrast that with previous games where @entity13 looks like a kid
unfortunately , @entity13 also seems to be missing his personality
he is , as always , silent , but really shows no reaction to anything that happens around him
in an early segment , @entity13 is getting bullied but shows no outward emotions
it is @entity1 who arrives to chastise the bullies and defend him
@entity71 has said " @entity4 " lays the foundation for the events in " @entity1 : @entity76 , " but it does n't feel like a precursor at all
the gameplay is slow , with plenty of moments of inaction
its pace is almost leisurely as @entity13 goes from one mission or dungeon to the next
there 's no sense of urgency , but that does allow players to fully explore without feeling as if they 're missing something
environments are vibrant , with collectibles and creatures lurking around every corner
there is a maze - like quality when you 're trying to reach some areas -- with only one path in and one path out
usually , some puzzle needs to be solved to open the pathway and allow link to continue
instead of @entity113 ( " hey , listen ! " ) , a mystical creature named @entity107 acts as sort of an artificial - intelligence program , helping out whenever something new comes up or if a player gets stuck deciding what to do next
@entity107 lives in the handle of @entity13 's sword and comes out when summoned
she can also evaluate your gameplay and scan the surrounding area for any dangers or monsters
combat is decidedly different , since the game requires you to use @entity71 's @entity124
defeating monsters , or solving some puzzles , requires precise motions to get past obstacles or slice open new pathways
this was a welcome change from straight button - pushing and injected a new level of challenge into combat
the nunchucks attached to the @entity137 act as your shield during combat and also help with special moves such as rolling or shield - bashing your enemies
the two controllers together work very well and made the combat enjoyable without making it tiring
in the end , " @entity1 : @entity4 " is an underwhelming game that mostly sticks to the successful path that @entity13 has been on for the past 25 years
this is one series that can keep fans happy with its familiar concepts and characters
but the new game 's minor tweaks do n't inject new energy into the franchise
i wonder where @entity71 can take " @entity1 " next without considering some radical changes
" @entity1 : @entity4 " is available now in @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163
it is a @entity124 exclusive title and is rated @entity164 + for everyone 10 years old and older due to animated blood , comic mischief and fantasy violence
