@entity0 -- the @entity3 military says it has found a " sketch " detailing " the deployment of explosives and @entity8 forces " in the @entity10 neighborhood in northern @entity11
the @entity12 says this map from @entity8 shows positions of booby traps and snipers in @entity10
the @entity12 issued a news release friday saying paratroopers found a map that " describes the location of explosive devices and firing positions in the middle of the civilian population in the dense neighborhood , which endanger the life of the civilians
" " that 's what @entity8 has been doing throughout the entirety of the operation -- perversely using civilians as human shields , " said @entity28
gen. @entity35 , officer - in - chief of @entity3 's @entity36
the @entity12 said the map depicts sniper positions at a mosque entrance and in nearby mosques
it shows " the directions the snipers are aiming , " the @entity12 said
the map " indicates that explosives are planted in the entrances of civilian homes
" there are bombs planted throughout the area , including one next to a gas station
" the important point is the disregard for human life in using entrances to civilian homes , " @entity35 said
" they booby - trapped the entrances of civilian houses with explosives put close to them , " he said
" the objective is of course to hit our forces , but a local explosion also damages the houses of the civilians and causes great damage , and likely killing civilians , " he said .
