@entity1 , @entity0 -- forget the @entity3 and the @entity4 -- the ' computer navy ' is on its way , and digital media on the high seas are set to make a steaming comeback
new home ? barges like this one could soon play host to @entity14 's massive data centers
it seemed that floating media firms were a thing of the past when the @entity20 's last major offshore pirate radio station , @entity21 , followed other @entity23 and @entity24 examples and died out in the early 1990s
but , fast - forward 20 years and enter internet giant @entity14
according to a patent application seen by @entity1 newspaper " @entity28 , " @entity14 is considering launching barges up to seven miles ( 11km ) offshore to host the massive data centers required to run its internet search engines
the plan would likely see the data centers -- which consist of huge supercomputers -- use wave energy to power and cool themselves while stationed at sea
in the application @entity14 states : " computing centers are located on a ship or ships , anchored in a water body from which energy from natural motion of the water may be captured , and turned into electricity and / or pumping power for cooling pumps to carry heat away
" energy consumption is undoubtedly a massive issue for these giant data centers
the servers within each data center need to be air - conditioned to prevent overheating -- and considering a company such as @entity58 runs approximately eight million square feet of servers -- that 's a lot of required cooling
according to a 2005 study by @entity64 consulting professor and @entity66 staff scientist , @entity67 , the energy consumption of data centers doubled in the period from 2000 to 2005
the total annual worldwide power bill for the servers at the time was an estimated $ 7.2 billion , according to @entity67
the @entity74 has continued to grow at a rapid rate and other major companies have also been searching for a more efficient method of maintaining their data centers
@entity79 has looked into taking advantage of a cold climate by constructing a data center in @entity83 , while @entity84 is reported to be sending its computers down a former coal mine , using water below the ground as a coolant
but , how workable is @entity14 's project , really ? and does it mark a potential new future for the maritime industry ? dr @entity94 , reader in @entity95 at @entity96 , described the move as " an audacious risk " that will push the boundaries for major companies in future
@entity94 said the project would carry significant risks , but potentially very high rewards
" anytime you take on several new technologies at the one time -- and you are trying to build something highly reliable -- there are going to be real technical challenges , which there will be for these data centers , " he said
some major benefits of @entity14 's project include being able to save money on rent and property taxes by being positioned offshore , as well as saving money on electricity bills
" if you look at the percentage of power being used by these centers ... it seems like a good long - term bet for the future , " @entity94 told @entity2
@entity94 believes @entity14 could also benefit from snaring a " green " image if it is able to harness wave motion to power the computers and their cooling systems , in addition to providing a quality service to users
" one of the reasons @entity14 has data centers around the world is to enhance the user experiences near where many of their users are
this will still allow them to do that
" he said there were some logistical issues , but if the ships were stationed not far from the coast , they should not have too many operational concerns
" at that distance ( 11km ) you would want to provide wired network activity -- some sort of under - sea cable
the sheer bit - rate needed for an operation like this is usually too high for most wireless systems , " @entity94 said
@entity94 does point out there could be plenty of maintenance required on such a system : " the sea is not exactly a friendly environment for cables
" although some commentators have raised concerns about the ships leaving themselves open to attack , @entity94 did not feel it was a major issue
" it 's not the kind of thing you see reported on very often
typically the kind of things we worry about more is network - based attacks
" current data centers are defended by corporate - type security consisting of reception desks and electronically guarded entrances
@entity94 envisages a similar level of protection for the centers at sea , potentially using a protective barrier or guarding vessels
if this project is realized , it offers the potential to alter not only online commerce , but also introduces the potential for new strands of business in the maritime industry
@entity197 spokesman @entity196 said : " so far as i know there is n't anything quite like it
we have n't really seen anything like this since the old pirate radio stations
" @entity196 says that if the project goes ahead -- and more companies attempt to adopt a similar program -- it could provide a sizable boost to the maritime industry through the ships and workers required to establish , run , protect and maintain such operations .
