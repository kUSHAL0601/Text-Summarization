@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 's use of @entity5 warplanes to force a @entity7 airliner to land and be searched on wednesday demonstrated a blunt warning to @entity9 a week after five @entity0 civilians were killed by cross-border artillery fire from @entity7
on thursday , a day after the @entity7 passenger plane was forced to land at @entity15 's airport , @entity0 's prime minister @entity12 announced at a news conference that cargo confiscated from the aircraft included " items ... traveling from @entity21 's agency that exports weapons munitions and military supplies to @entity7 's defense ministry
" @entity0 officials said the use of @entity5 's to intercept the plane as it flew from @entity28 to @entity9 was a show of force , to illustrate @entity0 would not tolerate the use of its airspace for weapons shipments to @entity7
" we wanted to show that we are serious , " said a @entity0 foreign ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
@entity15 delivered a diplomatic note to @entity9 denouncing the alleged use of civilian aircraft to carry military equipment , the @entity0 diplomat
@entity0 officials have still not confirmed exactly what the plane was carrying
just hours after the plane was forced land , however , foreign minister @entity45 said that the passenger plane 's cargo violated international civilian aviation regulations
the @entity7 @entity50 released a statement that said @entity0 's claim " has no truth in it , " and @entity12 " needs to show those equipments and ammunition in order to prove that he is truthful at least before his own people
" @entity0 officials have still not confirmed exactly what the plane was carrying
just hours after the plane was forced land , however , foreign minister @entity45 said that the passenger plane 's cargo violated international civilian aviation regulations
" this is a matter of principle , " he said on @entity0 broadcaster tgrt
" we are determined to stem the flow of arms to the regime in @entity7 which so cruelly kills its own people
it is not acceptable that such a thing can be done by using our airspace
" @entity0 previously has intercepted @entity75 shipments of arms headed to @entity7 through @entity0 territory and airspace over the past year
in those cases , the government remained similarly silent about the exact nature of those shipments , perhaps to avoid embarrassing @entity75 , a major @entity0 trading partner and neighbor
on wednesday , @entity0 's foreign ministry announced the @entity7 plane received a radio message while it was still outside of @entity0 airspace , warning that it was suspected of carrying illegal cargo
but the plane 's pilot did not turn back , the @entity0 statement continued , and @entity5 warplanes escorted it until it landed at @entity94 at 5:15 local time
the @entity0 diplomat said cargo boxes addressed to the @entity98 were found on board , inspected and confiscated
" this is a clear message from @entity0 that it will make it hard for @entity7 to import arms from outside
if the borders and the airspace are being controlled this tightly we can also assume that the sea lanes , the @entity111 ports might also be kept an eye on by the @entity0 navy , " said @entity103 , editor in chief of the @entity105
@entity7 officials accused @entity0 security forces of mishandling crew members during the plane 's stay in @entity15
transportation minister @entity120 went one step further , calling the forced landing a " @entity0 piracy operation
" " they raided the plane carrying weapons , they handcuffed us , took us out of the plane and threw us at the ground , " crew member @entity123 told @entity7 state tv , showing bruises on an arm
@entity21 officials also expressed concern over the treatment of the @entity21 nationals , and alleged that embassy officials were not given information about the situation
according to a @entity21 @entity144 statement , @entity21 diplomats and doctors dispatched to the airport in @entity15 were denied access to the 17 @entity21 among the 35 passengers
@entity0 's foreign ministry responded in a statement thursday , claiming @entity0 authorities learned there were @entity21 on board the plane only shortly before it was allowed to take off and that @entity21 @entity155 officials were then apprised of the situation
" all the necessary precautions were taken to ensure the safety of the passengers , " said the @entity0 statement
analysts say one of the reasons @entity15 has not been forthcoming with what was found on the plane -- although there were initial @entity0 media reports that the shipment may have contained missile parts or military - grade communication equipment -- is that neither @entity0 nor @entity21 is looking to weaken their strong bilateral trade relations
" the @entity0 and @entity21 have agreed to disagree on the @entity7 issue and seem to have reached the conclusion that @entity7 affairs should not effect @entity0 - @entity21 relations , " @entity105 editor @entity103 said
the @entity21 ambassador to @entity0 was invited to meetings at the @entity180 discuss the issue , a @entity0 government spokesman told @entity2
once - strong social and trade relations between @entity0 and @entity7 have grown tense over the past year after the @entity7 government began a bloody crackdown on anti-government protestors
@entity15 backs the anti-government rebels and has called on @entity7 president @entity186 to step down
more recently , the neighboring countries exchanged artillery fire following the death of five civilians killed by a @entity7 shell that fell into a @entity0 border village
