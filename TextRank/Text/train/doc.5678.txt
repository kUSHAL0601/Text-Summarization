-- @entity1 is a rare thing in sport : a world champion boxer who still lives with his parents and a prominent muslim who is not afraid to address the image of @entity9 today
@entity1 tasted international boxing success when he was just 17 , winning a silver medal at the @entity12 in @entity13 in 2004
now 23 , he holds the @entity16 @entity15 title , defended against @entity17 in @entity18 in may
but bright lights and big cities have n't distracted the boy from @entity22 , an unassuming town in northwest @entity24
he still lives , and for the most part , trains , in his hometown
" i 'm so close with my family ... my @entity30 never missed an amateur fight or a professional fight , my uncle 's the same , they 've always been with me that 's why i have so much respect for them , " @entity1 told @entity0
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 's revealed team after his big fight in @entity18 , about his life as a sportsman , @entity42 muslim and role model
@entity0 : why do you love boxing ? @entity1 : it feels like home , even when i step in the ring
as soon as i walk into any gym in the world i feel at home
i know everything , i know what to do
it just feels so comfortable
i can do what i want there
it feels even more comfortable than walking into my own house and my own bedroom
that 's how much i love boxing
i like to entertain when i 'm in the boxing ring ; i like to show speed , power and explosiveness
it 's an art , people need to see [ it as ] that , not as a violent sport , and when i go into the ring to hurt someone it 's because they 're trying to hurt me
that 's the only reason i hit them back
@entity0 : do you enter a different zone as the fight approaches ? @entity80 : i totally enter a different zone
it 's like when i 'm in the gym i 'm 100 percent there ... it 's like autopilot , i 'm just doing it , man , my body 's just making me do whatever
time starts going slower approaching the fight , maybe four days before the fight , time just stops
@entity0 : do you think people look for a race issue when you fight ? @entity80 : being a @entity96 and being a @entity98 a lot of people are going to bring that issue up
i 'm flying the flag for @entity42 and @entity98 , i 'm proud to be @entity42 and @entity42 @entity98 , and i think there 's a lot of people , @entity96 people , just like me
so , when you do get a lot of people [ talking about ] terrorism and stuff like that , it 's only a very small percentage
there 's a bigger picture out there and i want people to follow my footsteps and do what i 'm doing
@entity0 : how does your faith help you ? @entity80 : my faith keeps me humble and keeps my feet on the ground
i pray and i do things privately
it gives me strength when i go in the ring
i know i 'm not on my own , i 've got @entity128 on my side as well , @entity128 's helping me , @entity128 's going to give me that inner strength to go in there and win the fight
boxing in the ring is a lonely place , it 's just you and your opponent , no one else , so you know spiritually when you have that help it makes a massive difference
it gives you so much confidence
@entity0 : do you sometimes just want to be a boxer without the image ? @entity80 : at times i used to think to myself , i 've got a lot of pressure on me , but i 'm happy with it
people see me as a @entity96 @entity42 fighter
i 'm fine with that and being a role model
@entity0 : what does it mean to you to be seen as a role model ? @entity80 : it 's nice , i think i 'm probably the only @entity158 role model in @entity42 , there 's no other @entity96 , @entity98 , @entity161 or whatever role model in the country ... that does put pressure on you but i 'm only doing what i love to do
i 'm a boxer , i 'm a normal guy , i 'm never going to change no matter how big i get
i 'm never going to be big - headed and i hate those who are
i never look down on anyone and i 'll always speak to people , i 've got time for my fans ... even if i have to go out of my way to do it , i 'll take a picture , and i 've been doing that and maybe that 's the reason that @entity128 gives me so much -- and has given me so much -- success
@entity0 : where would you be if it were n't for boxing ? @entity80 : i 've got a lot of friends who were in school with me and they 've taken the wrong path and i think i would 've taken the wrong path with them
i would 've definitely gone the wrong path or maybe still be with my parents
with the respect i have for them , they would 've kept me on the right path , but i would n't be anywhere like where i am now .
