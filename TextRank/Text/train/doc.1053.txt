" the @entity12 inspectors arrived saturday night and are scheduled to inspect the ... site several times
the inspectors will leave @entity0 tuesday
" @entity0 sent shock waves through the international community in september by revealing the existence of the previously secret nuclear enrichment facility near @entity8
the @entity12 announced saturday its inspectors were leaving for the much - anticipated inspection
the agency declined to give more details on sunday
" it is our policy not to comment on the itinerary of our inspectors , " a spokesman for the @entity5 nuclear watchdog told @entity2
the inspectors will visit the installation to make sure it is being used for peaceful purposes , said @entity35 , the head of @entity36 , according to the @entity37
the inspection comes after @entity1 said friday that it needs more time to decide whether to sign onto a deal that could help end the international showdown over its nuclear activities
that proposal calls for low - enriched uranium produced in @entity1 to be sent abroad for further enrichment and then returned for use in medical research and treatment
@entity0 is studying the draft proposal and will have an answer next week , @entity1 diplomat @entity48 said on state - run @entity51
@entity1 informed @entity12 director general @entity53 that it is " considering the proposal in depth and in a favorable light , but it needs until the middle of next week to provide a response , " according to an @entity12 statement
delegations from @entity1 , @entity61 , @entity62 , the @entity63 and the @entity12 met in @entity64 this week to work out details of the tentative deal reached in early october
@entity61 , @entity62 and the @entity63 have indicated their approval of the arrangement
" the director general hopes that @entity1 's response will equally be positive , since approval of this agreement will signal a new era of cooperation , " the @entity12 statement said
after the current inspection , but before the end of the month , @entity1 officials are expected to meet with the five permanent members of the @entity79 -- @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity61 , @entity62 and the @entity63 -- plus @entity82 to further discuss @entity0 's nuclear program
@entity1 's leaders maintain that their nation 's nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes , but many in the @entity89 believe @entity1 is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities
low - enriched nuclear fuel can be further enriched into weapons - grade material
@entity2 's @entity93 contributed to this report .
