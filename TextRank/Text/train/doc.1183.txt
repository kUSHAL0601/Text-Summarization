@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's candidacy received an unexpected boost when @entity7 's @entity6 endorsed him this weekend
the publisher wrote : " we are in critical need of the innovative , forward - looking strategy and positive leadership that @entity13 has shown he is capable of providing
he did so with the @entity15
he did it in bringing in the first @entity18 @entity17 in 40 years and by forging balanced budgets and even a surplus despite the political challenge of dealing with a @entity23 president
" say what you will about @entity13 , but he thrives when it comes to the politics of ideas
@entity13 , a former history professor , is extraordinarily comfortable when it comes to vigorous and open debates about the ideas of conservatism
rarely satisfied with the status quo , @entity13 likes to try pushing the boundaries of what his party stands for
" people overvalue money and undervalue ideas , " @entity13 recently told one newspaper
" that 's part of the core gamble of this campaign
i actually think ideas matter
" his candidacy comes at a time when @entity18 have not devoted much time to intellectual introspection
for decades , the party became comfortable with the privileges of power
republicans spent more time focusing on how they wanted to use their power and protect their political position than on talking about the ideas that the party stood for
the @entity18 loss of control of @entity61 in 2006 and horrendous approval ratings of president @entity63 in 2008 led many conservatives to demand that the party reinvent itself from the grass roots up
yet the tea party movement has had trouble finding national politicians who were interested , or capable of doing the intellectual legwork that revitalization would require
in certain respects , @entity13 fits the bill
the @entity74 entered the national scene in the 1970s , an era when @entity18 had no other choice but to pay attention to their core principles
@entity23 had controlled @entity61 since 1952 and liberal ideas dominated the worlds of think tanks , academia and journalism
from the perspective of conservatives , the only modern @entity18 who had been elected to the @entity17 before 1980 -- @entity87 and @entity88 -- were essentially @entity89
@entity90 , also far too moderate in their view , was an accidental president
so @entity13 and other @entity18 set out to remake the @entity18
attracted by the vibrant conservative movement , @entity13 tapped into the ideas put forth by conservative intellectuals about supply - side economics , deregulation , and anti-communism
although president @entity99 was mocked by some as an actor in the @entity17 who followed his script , @entity99 was like @entity13 in that he spent much of his early adulthood deeply immersed in journals such as @entity105 and in reading some of the prominent thinkers of the time
throughout the 1970s , this generation of conservatives took ideas seriously
they established think tanks such as @entity113 and financed academic scholarship about conservatism
elected to the @entity17 in 1978 , @entity13 adopted an unusual political style that mixed the promotion of conservative ideas with hard - nosed political tactics
he used his positions in the @entity17 opposition to champion the ideas of the conservative movement , while employing aggressive tactics to challenge @entity23
@entity13 went on @entity127 and accused @entity23 of being weak against communism
he used the new ethics rules instituted in the 1970s to bring down speaker @entity130 in 1989
in 1994 , @entity13 was the key person behind the @entity15 , a 10 - point platform for what the @entity18 would do if it retook control of @entity61
while simplistic and a public relations gimmick , it did send the message to voters in 1994 that the @entity18 would be about more than power and patronage
rather , its candidates would come to @entity141 seeking to pursue a series of ideas about government
@entity13 never had much luck in leadership positions
once he was speaker of the @entity17 , his career took a downward turn
he had trouble adjusting to the position of being a leader
colleagues joked that 70 % of @entity13 could be president , while the other 30 % explained why he was not
@entity13 proved unable to tame members of his own party and to bring about a deal
his difficulty controlling what he said in front of the media led to embarrassing moments , such as when he was mocked as a " cry baby " for having complained that president @entity167 did n't speak to him on @entity168 on the trip to @entity170 for the funeral of @entity172 ( though the @entity17 released pictures showing that he did ) and that he had to exit the rear of the plane
in the end , as the partisan wars led to the @entity17 decision to impeach @entity167 , @entity13 was forced to step aside as a result of his own affair , his ethics violations , and the poor results of the 1998 midterms
while it is unlikely that @entity13 , with his personal baggage and lack of discipline , will survive the caucuses and primaries , he could offer republicans a useful boost in the coming months
thus far much of the competition among the @entity18 candidates has been remarkably stale , revolving around the rise and fall of quirky personalities or around debates about who is most likely to beat president @entity199
while all of these are valid and predictable issues for this stage of the campaign , they do n't offer much to inspire
as was evident in tuesday 's debate on national security , @entity13 does n't mind shaking things up
he 'll challenge the @entity18 orthodoxy on immigration and raise questions about how the party should handle challenges such as health care
he will stimulate other candidates to join in these kinds of debates , thinking through what the party should stand for
this would help them make a more compelling case to voters for their candidacy -- beyond simply not being @entity199
this is especially important amid the dysfunction in government that keeps @entity141 from doing much about anything
the idea man has an important role in @entity233 politics , even if he himself is unable to win office
@entity13 fills that role , giving republicans a candidate who is thinking more seriously about what the party is trying to accomplish and how to command the loyalty of voters for years to come
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .
