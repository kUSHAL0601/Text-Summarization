@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 is calling on @entity5 president to immediately rescind an emergency decree that limits constitutional rights such as freedoms of expression , travel and public congregation
@entity12 , de facto president of @entity1 , says he 'll repeal an emergency decree , but not immediately
" the freedoms inherent in the suspended rights are inalienable and can not be limited or restricted without seriously damaging the democratic aspirations of the @entity1 people , " said @entity3 spokesman @entity14 in a statement late monday night
earlier monday , @entity12 announced he would repeal the law , but it would not be immediately
the decree will undergo a legal review , he said
still , @entity12 's announcement was an about - face
he had announced the policy less than 24 hours earlier in response to unrest that increased significantly after ousted president @entity29 secretly returned to @entity1 on september 20 and took refuge in the @entity32 embassy
the 45 - day decree announced sunday night forbids any unauthorized public gatherings , allows officials to make arrests without a judicial order and lets the government close down news media that threaten " peace and order
" @entity12 said he would consult with the supreme court to repeal the decree , after a meeting with the leading presidential candidates
" this decision was made because ( @entity29 ) was calling for insurrection ... but i 'm going to listen to the other powers of the state and we 're going to make the most wise decision in the interests of @entity1 , " @entity12 said , according to the newspaper @entity46
monday marked the three - month anniversary of @entity29 's ouster in a military - led coup on june 28
in the wake of @entity12 's decree , @entity57 , secretary general of the @entity58 , said the @entity62 tv station and @entity63 were reported closed
the owner of @entity62 , @entity65 , told @entity2 that 60 soldiers entered his station monday morning to shut it down
they removed all of the equipment , he said
" they say that we offended the dignity of the president of @entity1 , @entity12 , " @entity65 said , adding that he sees his station not as @entity76 , but " pro-people
" @entity1 soldiers were stationed in front of the shuttered tv and radio stations and would not allow anyone to enter
the @entity83 , the @entity58 and the @entity84 have condemned the coup and demanded that @entity29 be reinstated
@entity12 has vowed that @entity29 will never return to power and has said the deposed president will be arrested if he comes out of the @entity32 embassy in @entity0 , the nation 's capital
@entity12 has accused @entity29 of using the embassy to instigate an insurrection and this weekend gave the @entity32 embassy 10 days to decide the ousted president 's status
@entity32 rejected the @entity1 ultimatum
on monday night , @entity29 addressed the @entity96 via a mobile phone that his foreign minister held up at the podium
a " serious crime is taking place when the voice of the people is silenced and when the people who are being repressed are likewise silenced , " @entity29 said
@entity2 's @entity105 , @entity106 and journalist @entity107 contributed to this report .
