the @entity0 dismissed a report that an agreement had been reached between @entity3 and world powers to begin implementing a deal that requires @entity6 to limit its nuclear program
the announcement followed a report in state - run @entity3 media that a deal had been reached in negotiations between @entity6 and the six world powers , including the @entity0 , to begin implementing the agreement in late january , " we 've made progress in our discussions , and the teams have taken a few outstanding points back to capitals , " @entity15 deputy spokeswoman @entity14
" the two sides expect to finalize the implementation plan soon
" a senior administration official characterized the talks as ongoing
" we 're getting close but just not quite there yet , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations
a senior @entity3 negotiator , @entity32 , told @entity33 that an agreement had been reached following two days of talks in @entity36 between @entity3 and the @entity0 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41
the two sides managed to reach an understanding on the implementation of the agreement and now , their views and interpretations ( of the @entity36 deal ) are the same , " @entity32 told @entity3 state - run @entity33
the nuclear deal struck in november between the world powers , collectively known as the @entity51 , and @entity3 calls for @entity6 to limit its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled the @entity3 economy
the deal has been widely hailed as a successful interim measure to stave off an unwanted conflict over @entity6 's illicit nuclear program
but after initially celebrating a diplomatic success , @entity3 has reportedly lashed out at the @entity0 for releasing a modified version of the agreement to the @entity0 people that does not reflect its interpretation
just last week , @entity3 lawmakers drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60 % if new sanctions are imposed , state media reported wednesday
the move came less than a week after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the @entity73 that would authorize new economic sanctions on @entity3 if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions
. the @entity0 and other western powers believe @entity3 is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment
but @entity6 says its nuclear intentions are peaceful .
