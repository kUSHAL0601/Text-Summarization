more than 20 women have come forward with claims of sexual assault against the comedian
many of the accusations date back decades
@entity33 issued his own statement in response to @entity5 's statement , saying : " the press should be asking mr. @entity5 if mr. @entity1 was at the mansion at ' any ' time during the summer of 2008
if he has proof of his whereabouts during that entire summer then we would like to see it
if he is willing to prove it , then i can comment
otherwise it is just a lawyer talking , which is not evidence
