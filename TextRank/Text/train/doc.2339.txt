@entity0 -- thousands of protesters rallied saturday on a @entity0 street where @entity4 , an unarmed black man , died after a white police officer put him in a chokehold , sparking national outrage just weeks before @entity8 was shot to death by a police officer in @entity11 , @entity12

" i do n't want what happened to @entity4 and @entity8 to happen to them
" the march started on the street where the 43 - year - old , 350 - pound @entity4 crumbled after being placed in a chokehold during a confrontation with the police for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally

" i ca n't breathe ! i ca n't breathe ! " @entity4 said repeatedly , his cries muffled into the pavement
