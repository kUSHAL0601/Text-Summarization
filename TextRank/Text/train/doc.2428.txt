-- out of all the frightening things on television , especially as we near @entity5 , i 'll admit it 's the teen dramas that make me want to leave a light on
between the dead friends and the supernatural ones , shows i love like " @entity11 " and " @entity12 " have scenes suspenseful and chilling enough to make someone watch the action from behind a shielding hand
and yes , that someone would be me
i 'm a sucker for whodunit suspense , but i have a low tolerance for true horror , making slasher films , psychological thrillers , ghost stories and their ilk off - limits if i want uninterrupted sleep
knowing i ca n't hang with the big kids watching " @entity28 " -- incredibly sad , but yes , also true -- surely i could handle a comparatively tame series
the @entity30 's " @entity12 " ? it sounded like nothing more than a lip - glossed , for - tv version of " @entity34
" except while i was scoffing at the spotty acting and cheesy , after - school - special plot turns that dot all teen shows , two things happened : the first was that i became completely invested in the storylines , and two , i realized i was n't giving the source material , show runners or actors enough credit
it 's easy to assume that because of the marketing , because of the network or because these shows -- including the @entity30 's other hit , " @entity53 " -- are adapted from young adult novels , they 'd be like candy to an adult
and for some , that may be true
but i 'd argue that , just as adult fans of @entity60 have been realizing over the past few years , some of the best pop culture just happens to come with a side of teen angst and issues
perhaps everyone 's taking a page from author @entity69 's book and refusing to " cater to the ( bs ) of innocence , " as he told the @entity72 this month
so while the entire cast of " circle " may look like they were pulled from the pages of a junior 's clothing catalogue and one of the leads does bear the same tortured expression of a " @entity83 " star , there was nothing sparkly about the fourth episode , " @entity86
" the show , which is adapted from a fictional young adult series of the same name , centers on a group of teens who are the descendants of witches
as they uncover their powers , they run into a variety of threats , including of course , demons
if you 've watched a show centered on the supernatural before , including the classic " @entity104 , " you 've run into your fair share of demonic appearances
( can we have a moment of silence for an og of scary teen tv ? more than a decade later , i still remember the voice - stealing " gentlemen " of season 4 's " hush
" ) but i had to tip my hat to actress @entity116 , who portrayed the woman who 'd been possessed in that particular " @entity12 " episode , because she officially put " @entity86 " on " do not watch again " status
this probably means there are 13 - year - olds with a greater constitution than me , and i 'm ok with that
while " @entity12 " has n't been at all secretive about the dark turns the series will take , @entity129 's " @entity11 " inched up the creep factor throughout its two seasons
yet another adaptation from a beloved set of books , " liars " offers you the eye - rolling idea of a high school student dating her @entity138 teacher with complete seriousness , but you 'll also get a twisted storyline of a frenemy who may or may not be dead
if you have n't seen the show , which has skyrocketed over the past year to become one of the most popular programs on tv , that 's the central premise : a group of four " pretty " and prone to lying friends reconvene after the death of their fifth bff , @entity154
what draws them together in her absence are the intrusive , uncannily knowing text messages from someone ( or perhaps more than one person ) known as " @entity162 " @entity162 's a complicated character , even when she 's alive , played convincingly by @entity165
but " liars , " part drama and part thriller , raises the stakes with all of the questions surrounding her death
who killed @entity162 , and is she really dead ? because if she is , who 's this creepy " a " that seems to know the secrets of the four main friends ? at first , the " clue " - like guessing game was the main draw , but as season one turned into season two , " a " was revealed to be ruthless
this is n't just a bully , as one speech delivered during the second season tried to claim ; this is a masked stalker , kidnapper and killer who has amazing access to just about everyone and everything
if i asked for a show of hands of who was excited and yet sort of terrified to watch this week 's @entity5 episode , i know without seeing them that mine would n't be the only one raised
that special edition did n't disappoint , what with an opening fright of twin - on - twin violence , a fake - out attack and a @entity5 costume involving a baby mask that might haunt my dreams
i can keep watching , though , because there is something that separates these shows from the rest of the chilling fare that 's offered
the writers give me , and i suspect other scaredy - cats like me , a reprieve
there 's a fine balance between the soapier , sillier plots -- it would n't be a teen drama without a love triangle or a fated love that seems to be doomed -- and the more frightening moments
if you consider yourself a master of suspense , do n't let the baby - faces on teen dramas fool you
if horror has taught us anything , it 's the young ones you have to watch out for .
