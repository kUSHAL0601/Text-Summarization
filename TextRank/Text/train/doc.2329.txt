-- @entity2 's 700 million smartphone users will no longer be able to share stories about politics without official approval , according to new regulations announced by authorities on thursday , which took immediate effect
the @entity10 released a 10 - point document detailing new rules for instant messaging ( @entity15 ) service providers and users
it is the latest move in an official campaign to " clean up the online environment and rein in rumormongers , " according to @entity2 media
although the rules apply to all @entity15 service providers , they are widely seen as targeting @entity25 , the immensely popular mobile app that allows people to share text , videos , photos and audio recording with multiple users at once
public accounts on any mobile @entity15 platform will also need to register with authorities using the real names of the owners
there are 5.8 million public accounts in @entity2 on subscription - based mobile apps , including celebrities , businesses and other organizations , according to state media @entity43
the rules also stipulate that , while the accounts of professional news providers are allowed to post about politics , all other accounts must obtain prior approval from authorities to post -- or repost -- political news
dominating the digital " this is just the latest set of rules to remind everyone who 's in charge and provide yet another legal and verbal framework for silencing troublesome voices , " says @entity54 , commentator on @entity55 and founder of @entity57
a similar set of regulations was imposed on users of @entity68 two years ago , the micro-blogging platform commonly referred to as @entity2 's @entity69
prominent @entity68 users were later detained or prosecuted , on charges both related and unrelated to their online activities
lately , " rumor mongers " have become the target of the official online clean - up
in april , @entity76 , who goes by " @entity78 " online , was sentenced to two years in prison for spreading false information on @entity68
" after the takedown of the @entity82 ( verified accounts with huge follower numbers ) on @entity68 last year , i more or less gave up posting anything to the @entity55 , " says @entity54
" the government has successfully brought @entity68 under control and has become the dominant voice there
i have no doubt that they will succeed with @entity25 , " he adds
another user of a popular @entity25 account on current affairs said that the new regulation " will definitely impact what i 'm going to post in the future
" it 's quite obvious now , other public accounts are definitely going to be more cautious about republishing political news because no one knows how strongly the rules will be enforced
and the term ' political news ' is not quite clearly defined
we 'll wait to see how things go
" a balancing act to many @entity2 watchers , the new regulations that target mobile use has come as no surprise
the three - year - old @entity25 , owned by @entity114 holdings , is unlike any other mobile app. it has taken @entity2 by storm , with a monthly average of 398.5 million users who rely on the app to get all sorts of things done -- from booking taxis to sending virtual hongbao ( customary gift money )
it also extends into e-commerce , gaming , socializing and posting pictures
" @entity25 has turned into the extended operating system of @entity2 's mobile millions , " said @entity0 's @entity128 , a technology enthusiast and host of " on @entity2
" a @entity114 spokesperson said that it " respects related government policies in all markets " where the company operates
" and @entity114 always devotes to create a healthy and secure online environment for our users
we 'll take measures against offensive and abusive activities to show compliance with relevant regulations
we welcome users to report such instance to us via online channel
" staying in the race with its seamless functions , the @entity2 - developed app is fast gaining ground on its @entity153 rivals , such as @entity154
but now that the government is showing an ironclad crackdown on smartphone app freedoms , how can @entity2 mobile developers stay competitive on the global stage ? " this is @entity161 's dilemma
the government wants to develop the @entity55 to drive innovation and economic growth , while keeping tabs on any potential political risk bubbling up online , " says @entity128
@entity167 's @entity54 does n't feel that increased government regulation will have any lasting impact on innovation
" the social media and news aspect of @entity25 is trivial compared to @entity25 's personal messaging function that is replacing @entity181 text messages , its taxi booking and payment system , and wealth management product , and the @entity25 - enabled use of qr codes for marketing
this is a highly innovative fusion of a variety of different digital services , and it 's beautifully engineered
" of course the intellectual repression caused by @entity2 's censorious media , telecom and education systems does hinder innovation , but it does not destroy it
" he adds that he sees workarounds to the regulations should users want to disseminate subversive materials : " the point of the rules is not to delete every single vaguely problematic posting , but rather to stop public opinion from being swayed by non-official voices on the @entity55
" @entity0 's @entity200 contributed to this report .
