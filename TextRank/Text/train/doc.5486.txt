@entity0 -- it used to be that when @entity4 thought of @entity5 , they imagined a festive getaway where margaritas flowed , mariachis played , and every day was @entity9
horrifying stories of random shootings , mass beheadings and mass graves have become commonplace
gunmen think nothing of mowing down a couple dozen teenagers in a disco with machine guns and tossing grenades indiscriminately into crowds during holiday fiestas
@entity5 have almost become immune to carnage , it seems
as a result of such wanton acts of terrorism , and government efforts to combat them , more than 47,500 have died in the last 5Â½ years
many of the dead were believed by authorities to have been connected to the drug trade , but others were innocent civilians -- including women and children -- who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
many @entity5 wrongly put the blame for those deaths entirely on the shoulders of @entity5 president @entity41
the argument goes that , if @entity41 had only left the cartels alone , @entity5 would n't be on fire
@entity41 is a convenient target because he has made it his personal mission to destroy @entity5 's drug syndicates
we 're talking about a half - dozen drug cartels , each of which rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars annually in a country so poor that the average laborer is lucky to earn $ 8 a day
the cartels ' customers are mainly @entity4 , who consume more than their share of illegal drugs
is @entity41 winning his war ? hard to say
it 's true that a few cartels have been weakened ; government officials say that the drug syndicate @entity62 has all but been destroyed
what they do n't say is that , from the ashes , has arisen a new group called @entity67
just recently , in a widely reported case , @entity5 police found 49 mutilated bodies in a small town between the cities of @entity74 and @entity75 near the @entity4 - @entity5 border
heads , arms and legs were chopped off , making it difficult for authorities to identify the dead
q&a : 49 bodies - just another drug war crime ? it 's like a @entity88 tragedy where every act is bloodier than the one before it , and they go on without end
a new generation of drug traffickers aiming to be bosses seems locked in a gruesome contest as to who can be the most vicious
as for blame , @entity5 should at least dole it out correctly
@entity41 is responsible for his decision to use the @entity5 military as the government 's chief weapon against the cartels , in part because so many of the local police in @entity5 are thought to be corrupt or corruptible
and so , when the military is accused of being heavy - handed with civilians and violating the rights of @entity5 citizens , as it has been in recent years , that blame should go to @entity41
but the @entity5 people also bear a responsibility -- for empowering the drug lords
for decades , @entity5 have romanticized the drug trafficking industry in film , music and other aspects of popular culture
there are many " corridos " ( @entity5 ballads ) that tell the story of the rise - from - nothing fellow who becomes the head of a powerful syndicate by relying on his wits and strength
recently , @entity5 actress @entity129 -- who coincidentally was cast as a powerful female drug lord in @entity133 's @entity132 - language series " @entity134 " -- tweeted that she has more faith in @entity5 drug kingpin @entity136 " @entity137 than she does in government
@entity137 heads the powerful @entity139 , and once landed on @entity141 ' list of the world 's richest people with an estimated net worth of $ 1 billion
there are even so - called drug saints that some @entity5 pray to -- inspired by @entity148 - like figures who are seen as protectors of the poor against the government
of course , the @entity152 does n't recognize these saints , but this fact has n't made them any less popular
one of the most popular of the " narco saints " is @entity156 , named after a bandit , who legend has it , was killed by authorities in the early 1900s
known as the " generous bandit " or the " angel of the poor , " @entity162 is a folk hero to some in the @entity5 state of @entity168
and many @entity5 are in shock
they do n't know what to do , or even if they can do anything at all
well , they can do this : they can stop making folk heroes out of murderers and terrorists
they can stop writing poems and songs that honor drug traffickers and instead start praising the @entity5 law enforcement officers who are bravely trying to bring these outlaws to justice
and they can support their government and stand by their president in fighting a battle that needed to be fought
it 's time to step up and take ownership of the drug war -- as well as the circumstances that made it necessary
people on both sides of the border had a hand in helping make this mess
it 's going to take people on both sides of the border to clean it up
