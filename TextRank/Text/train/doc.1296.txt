-- defending champion @entity1 was sensationally disqualified for a false start in the men 's 100 - meter final at the world athletics championships in @entity6 , @entity7 , allowing fellow - @entity9 @entity8 to collect an unexpected gold medal
@entity1 has dominated men 's sprinting since winning 100 - meter and 200 - meter gold at the @entity14 in 2008 , achieving the same feat at the world championships in @entity17 the following year -- smashing the world record in the process
and although he had not entered this year 's worlds in top form , the absence through injury of rivals @entity23 and @entity24 meant he was the hot favorite to retain the first part of the sprint double
however , the 25 - year - old fell foul of the current false start rules , which state that any athlete who jumps the gun is immediately disqualified
@entity1 knew immediately he had started too early and was helped off the track , head in hands , with a packed stadium watching on in disbelief
once the race did eventually get under way , a muted atmosphere ensued as @entity8 -- a training partner of @entity1 -- powered home to win in 9.92 seconds
@entity46 @entity45 , the @entity47 bronze medallist , took silver with a time of 10.08 seconds with veteran 2003 world champion @entity50 of @entity51 and @entity52 claiming a superb bronze medal
" i ca n't find words to explain it
@entity1 has been there for me
i feel like i want to cry , " @entity8 told reporters
" i felt i would win the race for @entity1
" despite @entity1 's shock exit , it proved a good day for defending world champions , with three athletes retaining the titles they won two years ago in @entity17
@entity46 @entity64 retained her women 's long jump title , and compatriot @entity67 won a second consecutive decathlon gold medal
meanwhile , @entity70 @entity69 was another to retain his title , coming home first in the men 's 20 - kilometer walk
@entity75 of @entity76 secured gold in the women 's discus , but there was heartache for @entity83 distance legend @entity82 , whose attempts at a fifth consecutive men 's 10,000 - meter world title came to an end after he was forced to pull out of the final with groin and hip injuries
however , the gold medal still went to @entity83 with @entity92 outsprinting @entity94 @entity93 in a devastating burst to the line
meanwhile , @entity97 made history by becoming the first amputee athlete to compete in world championships history
the @entity101 , who runs with carbon fiber prosthetic running blades , came third in his men 's 400 - meter heat to qualify for monday 's semifinal , with the final on tuesday .
