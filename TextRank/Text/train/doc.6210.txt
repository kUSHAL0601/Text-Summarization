-- if you 've spent any time on @entity2 in the past day or so , you may be wondering : what 's up with all the giraffes ? are they suddenly endangered ? is the circus in town ? is @entity8 having a sale ? no , no and no. ( although depending on where you live , the circus may actually be in town
) photos of the spindly , long - necked animals are the byproduct of a meme that 's been sweeping the social network in recent days
the meme invites users to share a riddle with their friends , who then are supposed to send a private message with the answer ( do n't post it in the comments , obviously )
any user who guesses wrong must agree to change his or her profile photo with one of a giraffe
why a giraffe ? it 's not clear
@entity31 : who is talking on @entity2 about giraffes ? the riddle goes like this : 3:00 am , the doorbell rings and you wake up
it 's your parents and they are there for breakfast
you have strawberry jam , honey , wine , bread and cheese
what is the first thing you open ? ( spoiler alert : the answer is at the bottom of this story
) most users agree there are two acceptable answers , although given that @entity2 is an unruly community of 1.2 billion people , there 's some debate over that
judging by some comments on @entity2 , some users are growing tired of the giraffe riddle
" if anyone shows up at my house at 3 am they had better get a hotel because i 'm not answering the door , " wrote one commenter on @entity0 's @entity2 page
said another , " i got it right , but the giraffe pic cracked me up so i made it my profile pic. " then there was this commenter on the @entity81 's @entity2 page : " truth be told ... upon realizing it was your parents you 'd probably open the wine first
" the answers : " the door " and " your eyes
