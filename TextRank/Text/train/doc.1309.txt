a police report says the wreck was not alcohol - related
@entity34 said she has met @entity58 twice , once in her capacity as the vip director at a club in @entity84 's trendy @entity83 and another time through a mutual friend
" that 's my job : to know these people , to have a relationship with them , to hang out with them , " she told the @entity36

" she said the allegations " must feel horrible " to @entity1 ' wife , @entity95
" the worst part of it , it 's not true , " @entity34 said .
