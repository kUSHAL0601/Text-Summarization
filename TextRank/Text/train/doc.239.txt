five @entity1 presidential candidates are boycotting a proposed @entity3 debate because of what they say were unethical reporting practices by the spanish - language network in how it handled a story concerning @entity1 sen. @entity8 of @entity9
@entity3 tuesday denied allegations that it told @entity8 it might not broadcast a story about his brother - in - law 's 24 - year - old drug conviction if the freshman senator appeared on " @entity16 , " one of the network 's news programs
@entity3 has called the allegations " absurd " and says its july story of the drug bust was reported fairly and accurately
" with respect to sen. @entity8 , @entity3 covered the issue in the same objective and impartial manner in which we cover all important news , " @entity21 , president of @entity3 news , said in a written statement
" @entity3 did not offer to soften or ignore the report about an anti-drug raid that involved the family of sen. @entity8
we would never make such an offer with any protagonist in a news report and we did not make an offer in this case
" @entity8 , the former @entity9 @entity40 speaker , is a freshman senator and a star among @entity1 , who talk about him as a possible running mate on the @entity1 ticket next year
@entity3 has tried for quite some time to have him as a guest on its network news programs , where he would likely face tough questions about his stance on immigration reform
the @entity49 was the first news organization to report the story
it said it obtained its information from various sources , including some from within @entity3
a spokesman from @entity8 's office said that " the @entity49 's article is accurate
@entity3 employees themselves were the first to come forward with this account , and we confirmed it
" rep. @entity60 , a close friend of @entity8 , told @entity61 wednesday that he had talked with @entity8 and his family members " minute by minute as the incident was occurring
" " i do n't think the staffers of @entity8 's office were ... inventing those details
they were very , very clear details
... it was a clear exchange of having the exclusive interview with the senator and that way , not airing the report about the relative of @entity8 , " the @entity1 congressman said
the allegations against @entity3 prompted three @entity77 @entity1 leaders in @entity9 to call for the @entity1 presidential candidates to boycott @entity3 's proposed debate in late january in the @entity9 , just before @entity9 holds its presidential primary
the candidates who have agreed to boycott the debate are former @entity84 gov. @entity83 , @entity86 gov. @entity85 , former @entity88 gov. @entity87 , businessman and former @entity90 ceo @entity89 , and rep. @entity91 of @entity92
@entity3 was proposing to hold a debate on january 29 , two days before @entity9 @entity1 ' presidential primary
@entity61 and the @entity1 of @entity9 are hosting a presidential debate in the days before the primary , and @entity97 and @entity98 , another spanish - language network , also are planning to host on a debate in @entity9 around the same time .
