-- @entity3 president @entity2 has won re-election with 93 percent of the vote , with all districts counted , the @entity1 said wednesday
turnout was registered at just over 95 percent , it said
electoral observers had expected the outcome , and @entity2 claimed victory after early results gave him a huge lead in the nation 's second presidential race since the 1994 genocide
observers said the voting was peaceful and " largely accurate
" @entity2 welcomed the early results at a massive party tuesday at the national stadium in the capital of @entity22
thousands of supporters got free drinks and danced to live music
" this is your victory , this is a victory for all @entity3 , " @entity2 said during the celebration speech , in vernacular @entity27
" our development depends on you
" human rights groups had expressed concern over violence and repression leading up to the vote , but @entity38 , chairman of the @entity39 , lauded the polling as transparent
" elections in @entity3 were conducted in a peaceful atmosphere , " @entity38 said
" the count in the polling stations was transparent and conducted fairly
" but while the vote was highly organized and efficient -- thousands of people had lined up before dawn at polling stations across the country -- observers said @entity3 's democracy faces challenges that include issues of political inclusion and press freedoms
" there was a lack of critical opposition voices , " @entity38 said
" each case appears to be different , but the overall impact is a concern
" of three aspiring candidates , two are under arrest and another has fled to @entity65
three other candidates cleared by @entity3 's electoral commission ran on platforms similar to @entity2 's and praised him throughout their campaigns
the only representatives at many polling stations were members of the ruling party , observers said
" that , frankly , disappointed us , " said @entity38 , though he placed responsibility on the opposition parties
" this right is a key transparency issue
" the vote comes 16 years after @entity3 's genocide left at least 800,000 people dead
militias made up of ethnic @entity83 slaughtered ethnic @entity84 and moderate @entity83 nationwide in 100 days of violence
the killing ended when @entity84 - led militias backing @entity2 ousted the @entity83 government supporting the massacre
in the aftermath , @entity2 transformed his country , turning it into one of the fastest growing nations in @entity94 and -- in the view of some -- a model of economic and social development
@entity2 's administration has mixed patriotic rhetoric with strict rules in an attempt to recreate society , and recently changed the official language for schools to @entity106 , rather than @entity107
" liberation is a process , " said @entity108 , the chairman of @entity2 's party , the @entity109 , and also the country 's ombudsman
" we want to create the nation
