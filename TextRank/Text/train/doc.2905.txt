-- much advice for fathers is written about reluctant dads
but , of course , this is not all of us
before i became a father , i struggled to find advice that really spoke to me , and i hope that the following bits of wisdom speak to other @entity13 dads , men who really want to be the best they can be
let me begin with where it all began for me
in august , in the waning days of @entity17 , the month of fasting observed by @entity18 , i was confronted with a devastating choice
while @entity21 raged through the streets of @entity23 , my wife was in labor in a @entity26 hospital room
she had been laboring for 22 hours , and now , after repeated attempts to control it , she was wrestling with a fever
my son , still inside her , was slipping away from us
his heart rate was rapidly increasing , a sign of his distress
my wife and i are the " do everything natural " couple
we took prenatal yoga , went for prenatal acupuncture , found a loving doula and ate copious amounts of kale , and my wife refused all drugs from the moment her pain began
but like countless others , we had to make a difficult call that day
" let 's end this , " i said
" let 's take the baby out
" in less than an hour , just after the sun set , doctors performed a c - section and pulled our baby boy out
after they clipped the cord and i said the call to prayer in his ear , we brought him around the curtain to his mother
it is strange that we bring our children into rooms that are brightly lit , with sterile walls , surrounded by strangers wearing plastic gloves
i could only imagine my son 's confusion
thankfully , my son heard our voices , the same voices he had been hearing since he was able to hear while inside the womb
on the day of his birth , he opened his beautiful eyes bright and wide ( thank goodness he has his mother 's eyes ) and studied us
it was like he was asking , " who 's responsible for me ? oh , there they are
are they sure they know what they are doing ? " the answer in a word : no. we had no idea what we were doing
my wife and i are both @entity18 , and we both come from large families
i am black , and she is @entity97 - @entity13
we are tied together by faith and an overriding sense that we need to raise our son in a way that is different from how we were both raised
he is very different from us , born into a very different time
but how do we do this ? as a father , i started by laying out some nurturing father principles and assumptions
they are based in my faith but resonate universally
first , my faith tells me that my son is without sin
my wife and i are his " spiritual parents , " with the tough job of guiding him down a righteous path
to do this , we had to be prepared
getting married was step one
waiting a bit before diving into parenthood was step two
sure , we could have waited longer and discovered more about ourselves as a unit and therefore been better parents
but in truth , no one is ever " ready
" constantly strengthening our own sense of faith as he watches is step three
second , my son is good
he does not lie or cheat or steal
he has never cursed , never talked about someone behind his or her back
he smiles at strangers ; he 's calm when we pray
i have to nurture and bring out the best in him
i have to pay attention to him , let him cry and express himself and listen to him even when i have little attention
among the tools i have at my disposal is my example
he will follow what i do more than he will follow what i say
third , my son was born intelligent , as a whole human being , with the ability to express and understand human emotion
i must help fill that brilliance with information and rich experiences that let him see the beauty of the world and understand how to navigate around the ugly
fourth , my son has rights and responsibilities
he has the right to be loved and to find love
he has the right to fail and to succeed , to never go hungry , to never be homeless and to always have a community and a family
he has the responsibility to nurture others , to fight oppression
fifth , i have to be the best human being i can be
it is my responsibility to work even when i can not find work
i must maintain a true and loving partnership with his mother
through me , he must learn to see all people as created equal , to never disrespect women in any way with verbal , emotional or physical abuse
right now , my son is sleeping
i look upon him knowing he feels my love
i also know he can feel stress , tension and negative emotions
as a nurturing father , i should always remember that any mistakes he makes are not a reflection of who he is
at the core , he is a good human being whose soul comes from the @entity181 , and my wife and i have been chosen as the primary caretakers for this vessel of light , this small human being
and we will do the best we know how , praying all along that it is enough
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .
