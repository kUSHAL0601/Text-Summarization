@entity0 , @entity1 -- tears rolled from @entity5 's eyes as the @entity7 soap opera actress told jurors that she really loved @entity9 , the pizza deliveryman she married five years ago
their marriage was real , but it soon fell apart because of his drinking and her focus on a modeling and acting career , @entity5 testified tuesday
closing arguments are set for wednesday in the trial of @entity5 and @entity9 on federal charges their marriage was an illegal sham , intended only to earn her a @entity23 work permit
@entity5 is accused of paying @entity9 , 28 , $ 5,000 to marry her on june 12 , 2005 , but the prosecutor alleged they never lived together as a couple
@entity23 district judge @entity27 blocked defense lawyers from using evidence they said would show @entity5 was set up and turned in by a vengeful photographer angry that she rebuffed his romantic advances
the job of convincing jurors the marriage was real fell on @entity5 , a 28 - year - old actress - singer - model who starred in @entity37 's " @entity36 " soap opera
the prosecutor suggested @entity5 was using her professional acting skills to sell her own fiction
@entity5 testified she married for love , not a green card
" to be in a loving relationship , forever and ever , like my parents , " she testified
the couple did n't have a family wedding because he is @entity49 and she is catholic , she said
they kept separate @entity52 apartments because he could n't break a lease and she traveled a lot , she said
the first months were " very loving , fun , " she said
" we socialized together , passionate
it was the honeymoon stage
" @entity5 and @entity9 separated after less than a year together because " he was coming on very late and drunk , " she said
" we started to fight a lot , sweat a lot , throw things
" the villain in @entity5 's script would be @entity68 , a celebrity photographer she met at a @entity52 casting call about the same time her marriage was " on the rocks , " she said
@entity68 , a 49 - year - old @entity72 native , is the star of his own reality tv show -- @entity76 's " @entity75
" @entity5 said the relationship initially was " professional and creative , " but she eventually engaged in a " short affair " with @entity68 as he helped with her modeling career
" i felt very pressured and i was vulnerable , " @entity5 said as she cried
" it was the biggest mistake i 've done in my life
" her friendship with @entity68 turned into a nightmare when she decided to end the affair , she said
" mr. @entity68 wanted more and more and he knew i was n't able to give it to him , " she said
@entity68 threatened to turn her in to immigration officials , she said
" he was losing it , he was very psycho , " @entity5 said
" i was very scared , because he would n't stop
" the federal complaint against @entity5 said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by @entity68
when @entity68 testified for the prosecution last week he said it was " completely incorrect " that his motivation was to get @entity5 deported
instead , the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against @entity98 , the founder and owner of the @entity101 fashion company , @entity68 said
the criminal complaint named @entity98 as a target of the federal investigation , alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while @entity5 was modeling for his company
@entity68 said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared @entity68 might be extorted by @entity98
" my case has never been against @entity5 , " @entity68 said after his testimony
" i wish her the best
" @entity9 also had his turn on the witness stand tuesday , hoping to convince jurors that he and @entity5 were a real couple at one time
" i was in love with her , " @entity9 testified
" it felt right at the time , so i rolled with it
" he was asked why he asked the actress to marry him after knowing her for only a short time
" i had a tiger by the tail and i wanted to keep her here , " he said
@entity5 and @entity9 sat directly in front of jurors throughout the one - week trial , holding hands much of the time
they could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted , though such cases usually produce shorter sentences , according to the prosecutor
the case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases
@entity5 's show business career began in @entity7 at age 16 when she joined the ensemble @entity142 , her @entity138 biography says
the group toured @entity7 and @entity145 , releasing two top - 10 singles , it says
she started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in @entity7 when she was 18 , it says
@entity5 has appeared in print and tv ad campaigns for @entity101 , @entity153 and @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 , it says
" she was cast in @entity37 's original production ' @entity36 , ' where she was not only a lead actress , but also a lead singer , performing two songs in the soap opera 's soundtrack , " her online biography says .
