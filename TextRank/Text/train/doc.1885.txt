-- it all started with @entity2 -- the original @entity3 -- and the 16th - century @entity5 artists who paid tribute to her with chalk and pastel artwork they drew directly on the street
madonnari , as the artists came to be called , made a living traveling from town to town and collecting coins from people who admired their work
it was the visual arts equivalent of busking , and the tradition continued until @entity21 , when , for obvious reasons , it became impractical to sit in the middle of a street and create art. after the war , the art of the @entity28 languished , but before it could die out completely , a group in the city of @entity32 , @entity5 , decided to revive it
the first i madonnari festival in @entity32 , in the province of @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , was held in 1973 , with some of the prewar madonnari among the participating artists
and that was the catalyst for a new generation of " street painters " who travel from city to city , and festival to festival , creating chalk artwork that hardly lasts longer than the handful of days required to make them
discover the world 's most visited museums typically , a chalk art or " street painting " festival has separate categories for " copyists , " who reproduce famous paintings ; " free artists , " who create original two - dimensional works ; and @entity64 artists , whose work may be realistic or fantastical
many festivals also make room for children , teens and amateurs
the wonder of these works of art is the way they materialize before the eyes of the onlookers
" first , there was nothing , " said @entity78 , founder of the @entity79 , which will take place in november
" now , there is this art. and you watched it happen
" in truth , the art does not spring into existence overnight
it is carefully planned by the artists , who arrive with preliminary sketches and paintings that they will turn into large - scale pieces
where they work is also carefully planned by the festival organizers , who provide them with precisely measured spaces in which to create their work
even the pavement is a consideration , as every patch and crack makes a difference when the asphalt is your canvas
" the quality of the street determines the clarity of detail in the work , " @entity78 said
here are some of the world 's top chalk art festivals that prove where the sidewalk ends , the art begins
@entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 september 14 and 15 now in its second year , this festival was inspired by local chalk artist @entity122 , who has plied his trade on @entity124 in @entity119 for more than a decade

" @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 october 11 to 13 @entity5 might have given birth to the @entity28 , but @entity141 's tradition of street painting / chalk art is just as strong
" some people do n't go to museums , so we make public spaces a place for creativity and art , " said @entity146 , the festival 's director
