-- @entity2 's @entity1 is n't naive
the tech exec has been bopping all around the world lately -- like the nerdy version of @entity6 -- talking to people in completely unconnected places like @entity9 and @entity10 about the benefits of a future powered by the @entity13
he 's seen the statistics -- that only 2.7 billion people , or 39 % of the global population , are online ; that only 7 % of households in @entity19 have internet access ; and that countries like @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 have internet penetration rates of near zero
yet in spite of that , or maybe because of it , @entity1 claimed over the weekend that everyone in the world ( capital " everyone " ) will be connected to the internet by 2020
" for every person online , there are two who are not , " he wrote on his @entity39 page
" by the end of the decade , everyone on @entity41 will be connected
" that 's 6 years , 8 months and 15 - some days from now
pretty soon , huh ? it is
and it probably wo n't happen that fast
as countless bloggers and @entity50 users have pointed out in the past 24 hours , we live in a world where only 63 % have access to " improved sanitation facilities , " i.e. toilets
@entity56 anything is difficult to achieve
but instead of bemoaning the boldness of his prediction , we should take @entity1 's words as a challenge
information access is a human right
and until someone invents a version of that " @entity71 " computer , the @entity13 -- both on smartphones and on the pre-smartphone dinosaurs that sit on our desks -- is the best tool we have for spreading it
everyone should get internet access by 2020
and if not , then soon after
mobile phones no doubt will pull the date closer
still , nothing is assured
it 's somewhat annoying and self - serving that @entity1 is the one rallying people behind this cause
@entity2 sorta runs the @entity13
the company 's executive chairman clearly stands to profit ( even more ) from the rapid expansion of digital communication technologies
and he also is promoting a new book on the subject , which comes out at the end of the month
so the timing of this fortune - telling is suspect
but someone needed to set a date for the world to rally around
and @entity1 and co. may be in a unique position to actually help create a future where everyone can be online
meanwhile , his own travels provide an interesting template for why this matters -- and why getting anywhere near universal and open access by 2020 will be difficult
take @entity10 , which @entity1 visited in january
" @entity106 live in a near - total information bubble , without any true frame of reference , " wrote @entity1 's daughter , @entity104 , who accompanied him on the trip
" i ca n't think of any reaction to that except absolute sympathy
my understanding is that @entity10 are taught to believe they are lucky to be in @entity10 , so why would they ever want to leave ? they 're hostages in their own country , without any real consciousness of it
" it 's easy to see how that could change with access to the world 's information -- and how the current war of rhetoric between @entity10 and @entity126 could be ratcheted down if either of the countries had full and unfiltered access to information about the other side
but it 's also clear that technological access is only one part of the battle
governments around the world must peel back censorship laws and , in many cases , stop actively using the @entity13 to spy on their citizens
that 's likely to be trickier than building infrastructure
@entity1 's march trip to @entity9 also was instructive
" a mobile phone costs $ 1,000 per year and does n't really work anyway , and a tiny number of the 60 ( million ) @entity9 have internet access , " he wrote on @entity39
" there is no data service on their mobile network and no international roaming ... @entity9 is one of the last countries to get connected to the @entity13 , and it will not be a smooth path
" he goes on to question whether cultural trends will influence whether the @entity13 will be used for good or bad as it does expand in that country
" because of the phenomenon of ' anchoring , ' where people believe the first thing they hear and anchor from that point , " he writes , " will the @entity13 be used to inflame special interests after 60 years of silence , or will the essential good nature of @entity9 citizens prevail and will the transition be smoother than many think ? " i hope it 's the smoother transition -- and that it comes soon ( ish )
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity174 .
