-- crowd disorder caused a top of the table @entity4 qualifier between @entity5 and @entity6 sunday to be delayed as flares were thrown on the pitch
the match was deadlocked at 1 - 1 in the famous @entity10 in @entity11 when referee @entity12 briefly held up the match before leading the players off the pitch for over 15 minutes
most of the flares , coming from the @entity18 supporters in the stadium , appeared to be aimed at @entity5 goalkeeper @entity20
the match eventually did come to a conclusion with the score staying unchanged
@entity24 had put @entity5 ahead early in the match , but @entity26 soon leveled after an assist from @entity29 's @entity28
the result leaves @entity6 top of @entity32 on goal difference from the @entity34
@entity35 stays third after a 1 - 0 win in @entity37
@entity39 breaths easier earlier , there was relief for under pressure @entity43 coach after his side beat @entity46 6 - 0 in @entity47 @entity39 had indicated he might resign after another disappointing result after four defeats in his first five games in charge
the @entity43 , who reached the semifinals of the @entity54 under @entity55 , at last showed some of that form as @entity58 and @entity59 both scored twice with captain @entity61 and @entity62 also on target for the @entity64
but the @entity65 kept up the pressure at the top of the group with a fourth straight win , beating @entity70 2 - 1 in @entity71
@entity72 shines for @entity73 in other key clashes , @entity72 's @entity73 maintained its unbeaten start to @entity76 by holding favorites @entity78 goalless in @entity80
@entity81 's @entity72 came closest for the visitors with a first half free kick and a low shot which went narrowly wide after a typical surging run
@entity86 hit the post for the home side , who piled on the pressure at the end
but the match had a controversial note as @entity78 's @entity94 appeared to deliberately elbow @entity95 , who was left with blood streaming from his face
@entity98 later went top of the group with a 3 - 0 home win over @entity102 .
