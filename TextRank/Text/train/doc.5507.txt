-- @entity2 defender @entity1 underwent successful neurosurgery wednesday , having previously complained of acute dizziness during an @entity6 match in september
@entity1 reported the problem during halftime of his side 's 1 - 0 victory against @entity11 , and after facing tests earlier this month , he went under the knife to remove the cavernoma -- a cluster of abnormal blood vessels -- in his brain
the three - and - a - half - hour procedure was " carried out using a surgical microscope and neuronavigator , " according to an official @entity2 statement , while the player 's " neurophysiological activity was constantly monitored
" the cavernoma , which measured three centimeters , was " completely removed
" the statement added : " @entity1 has now woken up and is breathing unaided , and has been informed of the operation 's successful outcome
" he will remain in intensive care for the next 24 hours , after which a prognosis will be formed
" while wednesday 's operation should ensure that @entity31 will be able to play football again , reports suggest that he will not be ready to return to action for up to eight months
the 28 - year - old , who arrived at @entity2 from @entity35 in 2012 , has made just one appearance for the @entity6 club this season , having been sidelined since being substituted at halftime against @entity11
@entity1 has become a key player for @entity2 since joining , making 36 appearances last term as the club booked their place in @entity46 's @entity45 .
