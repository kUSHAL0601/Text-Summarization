-- @entity2 's legislature gave final passage to a measure tuesday to make it the 16th @entity6 state to legalize same - sex marriage
" with today 's vote , @entity2 joins a growing number of states that recognize that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters should be treated fairly and equally under the law , " president @entity8 , a native hawaiian , said in a statement
@entity18 is poised to become the 15th state when its governor signs a same - sex marriage bill given final passage by its @entity22 last week
@entity24 gov. @entity23 has said he would " put our state on the right side of history " by signing it november 20
@entity2 's gov. @entity30 will sign the legislation wednesday morning
the law is set to take effect on december 2
" whenever freedom and equality are affirmed , our country becomes stronger , " @entity8 said
" by giving loving gay and lesbian couples the right to marry if they choose , @entity2 exemplifies the values we hold dear as a nation
i 've always been proud to have been born in @entity2 , and today 's vote makes me even prouder
and @entity45 and i extend our best wishes to all those in @entity2 whose families will now be given the security and respect they deserve
" in addition to @entity2 and @entity18 , same - sex marriage is legal in 14 states -- @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 -- as well as the @entity66
@entity67 and @entity2 allow civil unions
same - sex marriage is banned in every state not mentioned above , except for @entity71 , which has no laws banning or allowing it
proponents of same - sex marriage say they have momentum on their side
in june , the @entity78 rejected parts of the @entity80 in a 5 - 4 decision , dismissing an appeal over same - sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruling same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits
it also ruled that private parties did not have standing to defend @entity53 's voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock , clearing the way for same - sex marriages in @entity53 to resume
but opponents say the fight is far from over
shortly before the @entity18 votes , the president of the @entity98 urged people to contact their state representatives to tell them they support marriage as the union of one man and one woman
" we 've seen how marriage redefinition leads to those who believe in traditional marriage being punished , labeled ' bigots ' and ' haters ' in the public square , and forced to be silent about their deeply held beliefs or face repercussions
and their children ? they 're taught in schools that the values planted in them at home are bigoted and outdated , the equivalent of racism ! " @entity122 wrote in a blog post
worldwide , 16 other countries ( and parts of @entity71 ) also have laws allowing same - sex marriage and domestic partnerships
most of these are in @entity131 and @entity132 .
