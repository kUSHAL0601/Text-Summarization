shortly after his tweet proclaiming " snipers are n't heroes " netted a barrage of criticism , documentary filmmaker @entity0 tried to explain where that sentiment came from -- his war veteran father
the controversial tweet sunday came as " @entity10 , " the @entity12 - nominated biopic of a former @entity13 and sharpshooter , won the weekend box office
" my uncle killed by sniper in @entity18 , " @entity0 tweeted
" we were taught snipers were cowards
will shoot u in the back
" the backlash soon followed
former @entity27 @entity26 and @entity1 contributor @entity28 invited @entity0 to spend some time with terrorist cells overseas , then weigh in on the value of snipers
but @entity0 explained his tweet in a @entity35 post : " my dad was in the @entity37 in the @entity38 in @entity18 his brother , my uncle , @entity36 , was an @entity41 paratrooper and was killed by a @entity43 sniper 70 years ago next month , " @entity0 wrote
" my dad always said , ' snipers are cowards
they do n't believe in a fair fight
like someone coming up from behind you and coldcocking you
it 's cowardly to shoot a person in the back
only a coward will shoot someone who ca n't shoot back
' " the " @entity57 " and " @entity59 " director has long been a staunch advocate for stricter gun control laws in the @entity27 , and his statements are known to court controversy

the box office take trumped previous records for a january opening
" i did n't say a word about ' @entity10 ' in my tweets , " @entity0 wrote on @entity35
" here 's what i think about @entity10 ' : awesome performance from @entity77
one of the best of the year
costumes , hair , makeup superb ! " why ' @entity10 ' is a smash hit actor @entity84 equated the war drama to a @entity87 propaganda film shown in @entity89 's " @entity88
" @entity84 later clarified his statement , tweeting , " i just said something ' kinda reminded ' me of something else
i actually liked @entity27 sniper
it just reminded me of the @entity89 scene
" " @entity10 " is based on the best - selling memoir of the same name by @entity98
@entity98 served four tours in @entity100 with the @entity13 and is lauded as " @entity27 's deadliest sniper
" he was not without controversy of his own , including disputed claims in his book that he punched former @entity106 gov. @entity105 and killed two armed carjackers
@entity98 was shot and killed by a @entity108 in 2013
