-- teenager @entity1 has brushed aside talk about turning professional after becoming the first amateur golfer to card 60 on the @entity3
the 19 - year - old claimed the halfway lead at the @entity6 with his 10 - under - par effort , which put him one shot clear of fellow @entity10 @entity9 in @entity11 , @entity12 in the race for the $ 1.08 million first prize
freshman @entity1 , who was the best - placed amateur at this month 's @entity15 as he tied for 21st , said he wanted to complete his degree at the @entity17 in @entity18 before deciding whether to join the paid ranks
" i 'm not thinking about it right now
i 'm going to try and take care of business this week and then see what 's going on , " the player from @entity23 , @entity21 told the @entity3 website
@entity1 took advantage of soft greens at @entity30 to beat the course record by one shot , having earlier completed a first - round 67
he is seeking to become the first amateur to win a @entity3 event since @entity35 in 1991
if successful , he will then have two months to decide whether to accept a tour place and a two - year exemption from qualifying
@entity1 , who turned 19 in march , would also be the youngest player to win on the circuit since 1900 -- shaving seven months off the effort of @entity41 at the @entity42
" i tried to have no expectations , just so i did n't limit myself , " he said after becoming just the 24th player to score 60 in @entity3 history
he shares a coach with veteran @entity47 , who is one of just five players to card 59 on the @entity10 tour
" i feel bad for the kids in college , " @entity47 , who missed the cut after a second - round 68 left him tied for 110th , told the @entity3 website
" he said he 's going to stay four years ? in four years i 'll be 51
that sounds like a good deal for me
i think he should get his graduate degree
" @entity1 had set a clubhouse lead of four shots when he finished his second round on friday , but that was trimmed to one when @entity9 completed a 63 on saturday
fellow @entity10 @entity63 matched that score to be on 10 - under 130 , three shots off the lead , along with @entity67 ( 65 )
meanwhile , @entity69 golfer @entity68 took a two - shot lead into the final round of the @entity73 's @entity72 in @entity74
the 35 - year - old , ranked 267th in the world , carded a six - under 66 in his third round on saturday to be on 14 - over 202 ahead of sunday 's finale in @entity79
seeking his first title in eight years , @entity68 will be chased by a group of five players on 204 including joint halfway leader @entity83 of @entity84 , who bogeyed his last hole for a 70
@entity87 's @entity86 was also in that group after a nine - birdie 64 , along with compatriot @entity89 ( 69 ) , @entity69 's @entity90 ( 65 ) and @entity84 's two - time major winner @entity91 ( 67 )
@entity93 teenager @entity92 , the youngest player to win a @entity73 event , was four shots off the pace in ninth place after a 66 .
