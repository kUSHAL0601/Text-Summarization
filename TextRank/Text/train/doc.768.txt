@entity0 -- @entity3 's media empire suffered a double blow wednesday as prime minister @entity5 launched a wide - ranging investigation into the @entity8 press and @entity3 's @entity9 withdrew its bid to take over @entity8 satellite broadcaster @entity12
the moves came in the wake of public and political fury at allegations that journalists working for @entity3 illegally eavesdropped on phone messages of thousands of people and bribed police
@entity5 blasted @entity3 's company wednesday as he launched the high - powered investigation
@entity9 executives need to focus not on taking over @entity12 , " but on clearing up the mess and getting their house in order , " @entity5 said
he welcomed the withdrawal of the bid , which came hours before lawmakers voted across party lines to pass a symbolic measure urging @entity3 to give up his effort to take full ownership of the broadcaster , in which he already owns a controlling stake
" it 's the right decision ( for the company ) , but also for the country , " @entity5 said
" now we 've got to get on with the work of the police investigation and the public inquiry that i set up today
" " it has become clear that it is too difficult to progress in this climate , " @entity9 deputy chairman @entity49 said in announcing the company would end its attempt to increase its 39.1 % share in @entity12
opposition leader @entity54 of the @entity55 -- who pushed the vote against the takeover -- welcomed the @entity9 decision and said it would not have happened had lawmakers not pressured @entity3
" the will of politicians was clear , the will of the public was clear , and now @entity8 's most powerful media owner has had to bend to that will , " said @entity54 , speaking as politicians rowdily debated the measure in the @entity63
former prime minister @entity70 , whose family 's private records are alleged to have been obtained by @entity74 newspapers , said it was vital to maintain the right to a free press and the public 's right to information
but , he said , staff at @entity74 , a subsidiary of @entity9 , took @entity82 as a license for abuse and then " cynically manipulated our support of that vital freedom as their justification and then callously used the defense of a free press as the banner under which they marched in step , i say , with members of the criminal underworld
" this " criminal media nexus " claimed to be on the side of the law - abiding citizen but was , instead , " standing side by side with criminals against our citizens
" the criminality was " not the misconduct of a few rogues or a few freelancers , " but was carried out " often on an industrial scale -- at its worst dependent on links with the @entity8 criminal underworld
" @entity70 also defended himself against assertions that his government had done too little to pursue claims of misconduct at @entity74 , saying its relationship with the company was " neither cozy nor comfortable
" the longstanding role of the press as a force for freedom has been subverted , he said
" when it has held in contempt not only basic standards of legality but basic standards of decency too ; when it has replaced freedom with license ; when it has wielded power without ever having been elected to do so ; and when it has regarded itself as not only above the law but above the elected institutions of our country , then all concerned people in this @entity63 should be able to see that what should be our greatest defense against the abuse of power has itself become an intolerable abuser of power
" @entity144 , chairman of @entity146 's @entity145 , said he did not know whether @entity3 , his son @entity3 and former @entity148 editor @entity147 would testify at a hearing next tuesday as requested
" senior executives " of @entity3 's @entity8 newspaper company " will cooperate , " @entity74 has said in a statement , without specifying who
if the @entity155 do not answer the summons , they " will effectively have said goodbye to @entity8 , " @entity55 lawmaker @entity154 told @entity1 wednesday
@entity3 will be " forever tarred " by his association with the scandal , @entity144 said
but he warned against vilifying the press in general
" it was not just newspapers that were responsible for these clearly unacceptable and often illegal activities ; it was also newspapers who exposed them , " he said
" a free press is an absolute fundamental cornerstone of a free society and we must not do anything to jeopardize that
" in announcing the public inquiry into press practices and ethics , @entity5 said anyone " found guilty of wrongdoing -- or of allowing it -- must not only be brought to justice , they must also have no future role in the running of a media company in our country
" the judge leading the inquiry will be able to summon witnesses , including newspaper owners , and compel them to testify in public , under oath , @entity5 announced
the aim is to " bring this ugly chapter to a close and ensure that nothing like it ever happens again , " the prime minister said
@entity3 's company needs " root and branch change , " @entity5 said in the wake of the accusation that victims of phone hacking included a missing 13 - year - old girl , @entity203 , who was later found to have been murdered
@entity5 met with the girl 's family wednesday
@entity54 and deputy prime minister @entity206 met with them separately earlier in the week
the @entity210 are " delighted " by the launch of the judge - led investigation and pleased that politicians across the spectrum are working together on the issue , the family 's lawyer , @entity208 , said after the meeting with @entity5
the investigation will look at whether @entity9 's @entity8 subsidiary , @entity74 , or other newspaper groups broke the law , their relations with the police and politicians and press ethics and practices , @entity5 said
@entity54 hammered @entity5 for having hired a former top @entity74 journalist to be his communications director after the editor left his newspaper , @entity148 , in the wake of one of its journalists going to prison over phone hacking
the editor , @entity237 , insisted he knew nothing about the crime but resigned from @entity148 because it happened on his watch
@entity237 resigned as @entity5 's spokesman this year when the scandal blew up afresh
@entity5 said if @entity237 lied about what he knew , he should end up in court
" if i was lied to , if the police were lied to , if the select committee were lied to , it would be a matter of deep regret and a matter for a criminal prosecution , " @entity5 said
" but we must make sure that we judge people as innocent until proven guilty
" condemnation of @entity3 came from many @entity8 politicians a day after a senior @entity257 senator warned that any @entity3 journalists who illegally eavesdropped on 9/11 victims would face " severe " consequences
sen. @entity261 , the @entity262 chairman of the @entity263 , told @entity1 wednesday he is considering an investigation into whether @entity9 employees broke the law by hacking @entity257 citizens
" my bet is we 'll find some criminal stuff , " @entity261 said , speaking a day after he urged @entity257 authorities to examine whether @entity257 citizens had had their " privacy violated " by journalists at the company
@entity261 and fellow @entity262 sen. @entity274 of @entity275 wrote wednesday to @entity257 justice officials and @entity278 watchdog the @entity279 , urging them to investigate possible violations by @entity9 of the @entity281
sen. @entity282 , a @entity284 @entity283 , also called on @entity257 authorities wednesday to investigate whether any @entity9 employees had broken @entity257 law by bribing foreign officials
and rep. @entity289 , @entity290 , asked the @entity291 to investigate whether @entity9 journalists may have tried to obtain phone records of victims of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks
journalists are accused of attempting to bribe police officers for information -- including personal contact details for members of the royal family -- in addition to the violation of privacy allegations
the @entity148 , which was @entity8 's best - selling newspaper , folded sunday over other allegations of illegal breach of privacy at the order of @entity310
the police officer leading the investigation said tuesday they had identified 3,870 potential targets of phone - hacking and had notified 170 of them
the officer , @entity317 , said a team of 45 police were going through 11,000 pages of documents seized from a private investigator working for @entity148
the documents contain some 4,000 cell phone numbers and 5,000 land lines , @entity5 said
@entity3 flew sunday to @entity0 , hours after the final edition of @entity148 hit the stands
the publication was the first @entity8 national paper murdoch bought , in 1969 , as he began to propel himself from @entity330 newspaper proprietor to international media magnate
@entity74 owns the @entity332 , @entity333 and the @entity334 in @entity8
@entity3 's @entity9 also encompasses @entity335 , @entity336 , the @entity337 and @entity339 publishers
@entity1 's @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343 contributed to this report .
