@entity0 , @entity1 -- crippled by the brutal wind and waves of @entity6 , the @entity3 was sinking
capt. @entity7 had ordered his crew of 15 to abandon ship in the early morning of october 29 , 90 miles off @entity10
searching the ship a final time before escaping to a waiting lifeboat , a crew member peered through the captain 's rarely opened door
there she noticed that @entity7 's treasured framed photograph of his wife , @entity19 , was missing from its place on his desk
during the escape from the 50 - year - old wooden ship , the captain clearly had taken his prized picture with him
now , four months later , that story about her husband 's final moments still touches @entity19
" of all the things he could have grabbed , i guess a picture was n't going to weigh him down , " she said last week from her 1930s historic home in @entity0
" but it was going to be with him
" wearing a medallion carved with the image of the @entity3 , @entity19 , who never took her husband 's name , shared stories she 's been hearing from survivors of the shipwreck
as the @entity46 begins hearings tuesday in @entity48 , @entity49 , to determine if negligence was involved , @entity19 is defending @entity51 against criticism that his decisions somehow put the ship at risk
on october 29 , the three - masted replica of an 18th - century ship -- which starred in classic movies such as @entity61 's " @entity60 " and @entity63 's " @entity62 " -- was threatened by a real - life drama as it took on water and lost power
at one point when @entity7 was below deck , enormous waves tossed the vessel , slamming the captain into a table , said @entity19
@entity7 , 63 , was so seriously injured that he needed help putting on his rescue suit and life jacket as he prepared to abandon ship
@entity19 said crew members ' accounts conflict about whether or not the captain ever was able to escape the @entity3 before it went down

one of his last e-mails to her , she said , was saying he was going to abandon ship
it said " not to worry " because the @entity46 knew where he was
eventually , the @entity46 rescued all but two crew members : @entity7 and @entity92 , 42

she said he always had a " silver lining " floating over his head , protecting him from harm
for 90 hours , the @entity46 searched 12,000 square miles in hopes of finding the captain
then , four days after the shipwreck , @entity19 received a call from the @entity46
" it was just as hard for them to say it as it was for me to hear it -- that they were going to abandon the search , " she said , pausing for a moment
" but i knew they did their best
" of all the terrifying moments and heartbreaking news surrounding the @entity115 disaster , the hardest part for @entity19 is that her husband 's body was never found
her sadness comes in waves
" interesting -- yeah , yeah it comes in waves , " she said with a grin
@entity7 was quite a sailor , his widow recalled -- a breath of fresh air filled with positive energy
he was highly respected in his industry , and everyone wanted to sail with him , @entity19 said
he had some qualities associated with sailors , friends and family said , like enjoying a drink or two now and then with other seafarers at " scuzzy " bars in various ports of call
he also had traits that clashed with the cliche of the rough - and - tumble sailing life
" i never heard a curse word come out of his mouth -- he was so even - keeled , " said @entity19 's daughter , @entity142 , @entity7 's stepdaughter
criticism some sailors in the tall ship community have been critical of @entity7 's decision to leave safe harbor in @entity151 , @entity152 , for @entity0 as @entity6 was steaming up the @entity153
that frustrates @entity19 and her adult daughter , @entity155
people " who were not there " have no right to pass judgment , the @entity156 said
the facts surrounding @entity164 's decisions may come out during the weeklong @entity46 hearing
" the point of the investigation is to determine the cause and to see if there are any changes that could be made , industry - or regulatorywise , to prevent incidents like this from occurring in the future , " said chief petty officer @entity166 , @entity46 spokesman
@entity175 : @entity46 begins hearings into shipwreck @entity19 said she never questioned her husband 's decision to leave port
" i would never even think twice about telling him to do something against his decision
who am i -- i know nothing about that
" the captain 's close friend @entity187 , sitting across from @entity19 at the table in the sunroom , quickly chimed in : " we 'd been through two other hurricanes -- ones with higher seas -- in ' 96
" " the ship was in the best shape it ever been since it was built , " @entity187 said
it had just completed a mandatory inspection required by the @entity46 every two years
while not questioning @entity7 's decision , @entity142 said she wishes her stepfather had never left port
at one of the two memorial services held for @entity7 , surviving crew members presented the @entity156 with a handmade card , signed by all of them
the cards and e-mails from survivors have been a comfort -- evidence once again of that " silver lining
" ' @entity214 ' wrote one past crew member : " i think @entity7 has become a surrogate father for some of us ... to have a consistent and reliable man who encouraged us and gave us responsibility -- changed lives
" @entity19 said she " did n't realize the magnitude or the enormity of people that he touched
" one of the memorial services took place in @entity229 , @entity230 , where @entity142 recalled little sayings @entity7 was known for
crews called them " @entity214 , " including , " wakey wakey , little guppies " and " wakey wakey , little snakies
" @entity19 remembers the couple working as extras in some of the films the @entity3 appeared in
she scrolls through photos on her computer of herself and her husband dressed in costumes
it all brings back bittersweet memories
thousands of other irreplaceable photos were on the captain 's computer and hard drive which she said went down with the ship -- lost forever
but it 's just stuff , she said
" missing @entity7 , i ca n't put that in perspective at all
there 's just emptiness in my soul because he was my soul mate , " @entity19 said , as tears filled her eyes
" i hear it fills in
and i hope it does
" she believes her husband went down with his ship , likely trying to help his crew member @entity263 escape
many sailors have told @entity19 that -- for lovers of the ocean -- there 's no better final resting place
that 's a thought that comforts her , although she would have preferred placing his remains in the sea herself
" i guess silver linings ... come to an end , " she said
" but he had his share of silver linings
