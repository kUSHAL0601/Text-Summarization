-- we are now five days away from the attempted terrorist attack to blow up @entity3 to @entity4 , @entity5
we are learning more each day about the multiple failures in our security and intelligence system that preceded that attack
it is worth discussing the most egregious thus far and the way forward to building a better system
the facts suggest that an @entity15 plot was hatched in @entity16 and involved the same radical cleric who communicated with the man accused in the @entity20 shootings before the deaths of 13 @entity23 soldiers
and the attempt to blow up a @entity23 plane on @entity26 used a bomb technique similar to the one to that was used in august to try to assassinate the chief of @entity30 's counterterror police
having survived this assassination attempt , prince @entity31 flew to @entity33 , where he personally briefed @entity23 intelligence , law enforcement and national security officials both about the assassination attempt and on his concerns about the growing terrorism problem in @entity16
the @entity40 passed some information about flight 253 suspect @entity42 to the federal interagency channel , but they appear not to have passed along all the relevant information that they may have possessed
the @entity46 , which was created post- 9/11 to " connect the dots , " failed to do that and to ask the intelligence community for additional dots
furthermore , we understand that there was an intercept of @entity16 cleric @entity54 advocating @entity15 's use of @entity56 as operatives , but this was never put together with the information about @entity42
@entity54 is the radical cleric who was in contact with suspect @entity62 before the november 5 shooting of 13 @entity23 soldiers at @entity20 , but it appears that no one connected those dots either
our @entity68 allies revoked @entity42 's @entity68 visa for fraud because he lied on his visa application , but they did not inform the @entity23 because it was , in their judgment , not related to a national security issue
as president @entity75 said , there are both systemic and individual failures here
the president is understandably frustrated and under pressure to act
@entity42 should not have been able to get high explosives on a plane , the watch list system should have prevented him from boarding the plane at all , and the @entity23 intelligence community writ large should have been able to collect , analyze and disseminate critical intelligence
we will never encourage the risk - taking and creativity necessary to fix these problems if we indulge in the usual @entity33 bloodsport of the blame game
i have conducted more than my share of reviews , from the @entity93 recommendations to the @entity95 lessons learned
@entity75 needs people outside those directly responsible to look at what happened and provide him with an objective view
he now has the president 's @entity101 ( of which i was formerly a member ) , which can undertake such a review
it has been more than eight years since the tragedy of september 11
while we all wish we could forget the pain of that tragedy , our enemies relish remembering it and planning for what they hope will be their next success
we need to confront the growing sense of complacency in the bureaucracy and among the @entity23 people
we can only prevent a repeated success for the terrorists if the @entity23 people get the facts and the solutions to fix the problems that this incident has brought to light
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity126 .
