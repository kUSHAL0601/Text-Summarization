for many travelers , jetsetting lost its glamorous allure decades ago
still , there are a handful of holdouts who still view flying through the lens of seductive aviation epics like " @entity9 "
for the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 and @entity13 , the charm of aviation 's golden era can be resurrected through their plane - themed collections
@entity11 , for instance , has amassed over 1,000 cabin crew uniforms , which he keeps stored at his home
his collection spans seven continents and as many decades
" at the moment , i want to have them with me , but eventually i would like to make a book -- maybe a coffee table book
to do that , though , i need a big bag of money , " he says
the @entity29 , who wed inside a concorde four years ago , make @entity33 's collection look tame
the couple , who met online and soon bonded over their shared love of plane paraphernalia , spent Â£ 40,000 ( $ 67,000 ) converting their home in @entity40 , @entity41 into a @entity43 airplane , complete with a flight simulator
" the corridor used to be full of aircraft parts
we had to cut a door for the flight deck in the bathroom , " admits @entity13
the collection grew so big that the couple eventually had to outsource it to an office space down the street
they have since started charging fellow flight fanatics for the chance to try out the simulator ( they dub it the @entity61 )
" we wanted people to feel like they were boarding a real aircraft
it adds to the whole experience , " says @entity13 .
