-- the puppeteer who gave @entity5 's @entity4 his voice allegedly threw a crystal meth sex party for a teenage boy in 2004 , according to a federal lawsuit filed this week
@entity9 , now 24 , is the fourth man to sue @entity4 , but he was the first one to publicly claim he had a sexual relationship with him as a teen
@entity9 ' lawsuit is " meritless and barred by the statute of limitations , " @entity13 lawyer @entity12 told @entity0 tuesday
" mr. @entity4 continues to deny any wrongdoing , and we intend to defend this case forcefully
" although @entity9 called it an " an adult consensual relationship " last november , the revelation triggered @entity13 's suspension from @entity5 and eventually his resignation
clash , who provided the high - pitched voice of the iconic furry red @entity4 since 1984 , acknowledged a relationship between " two consenting adults " when @entity9 ' story first emerged , but he said it otherwise was a " false and defamatory allegation
" " i am a gay man , " @entity13 , 52 , said in a statement in november
" i have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter
" when heroes disappoint our kids three other men soon emerged with federal lawsuits , filed last november and december , accusing @entity13 of befriending them as teenager then engaging in sex with them
they are all represented by @entity44 lawyer @entity43 , who also filed @entity9 ' lawsuit monday
@entity4 's lawyer has asked a judge to dismiss the three other suits based on his argument that the men waited too long to sue
the federal statute of limitations on such civil cases is six years , while their allegations involve relationships that ended more than 10 years ago , @entity51 said in a court filing this month
each lawsuit contends that the men only realized in the last year or so that they suffered psychological and emotional damage from their encounters with @entity13
" @entity13 was an adult male living a prominent public life centered around the entertainment of toddlers , while at the same time he was , in secret , preying on teenage boys to satisfy his depraved sexual interests , " the @entity9 suit alleged
while the allegations in the newest suit mirror what the other men contend , @entity9 ' complaint is the only one to allege drug use by @entity13
" @entity13 smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with @entity80 , " the lawsuit said
" @entity13 also gave @entity80 ' poppers ' as a sexual aide
while @entity13 had sexual contact with @entity80 , the chauffeur watched and masturbated
" " poppers " generally refers to alkyl nitrites in capsule form that produce a physical rush when broken and inhaled : crystal meth refers to crystal methamphetamine
@entity9 was 16 when he met @entity13 in @entity92 " at a social networking event for models and actors , " the suit said
" @entity4 told @entity80 he would help @entity80 with his acting career , " it said
@entity4 resigned from his job on " @entity5 " after the first lawsuit was filed in november
" i am resigning from @entity101 with a very heavy heart , " @entity4 said in a written statement at the time
" i have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization
personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work @entity5 is doing and i can not allow it to go on any longer
i am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately
" despite his stepping down , @entity13 's voice will be used for @entity4 through 2014 , as the next season of " @entity5 " has already been filmed
@entity0 's @entity111 contributed to this report .
