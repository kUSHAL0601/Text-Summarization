-- when @entity2 , a 24 - year - old @entity3 woman who lost parts of four limbs to a flesh - eating bacteria , returns home from rehab next month , she 'll find it much different and much bigger than when she left in may
a nearly 2,000 - square - foot addition will nearly double the size of the @entity11 home in @entity12 , @entity3 , east of @entity13 , and be equipped for her special needs
the renovation plans include access ramps , an elevator to the home 's second floor , an exercise room @entity22 will use to continue her recovery , guide rails in the bathroom and a separate wash sink @entity22 can use to clean her prosthetics
the family calls it " @entity30
" " what blows me away is that the construction should be complete in roughly 40 days , hopefully in time for @entity22 's ' graduation ' from rehab , " dad @entity31 said in his blog tuesday
@entity37 , a @entity38 - based company that builds homes in 27 states , is donating the construction addition
@entity2 was released from the hospital to a rehab facility on july 2 after nearly two months of treatment and surgeries
@entity31 's ordeal began may 1 when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the @entity48 , about 50 miles west of @entity13
the line snapped , and she fell and received a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room
doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the bacteria @entity58
since then , her father has blogged about her situation regularly
a facebook page devoted to her fight has nearly 80,000 " likes
" a number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis , or flesh - eating bacteria syndrome
when the bacteria get into the bloodstream , such as through a cut , doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain
advocate : story of rare bacterial infection raising awareness the infection attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20 % of the time , according to the @entity85
dr. @entity86 , chairman of the @entity87 at the @entity88 , estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the @entity90 , though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities
@entity31 says his daughter is " knocking it out in rehab , " committed to her exercise regime like an @entity98 athlete
" her face was red and the vein in her neck was bulging as she pressed herself into her repetitions with serious determination , " @entity31 said of @entity22 's tuesday workout
" it 's like she was training for the @entity98
" on wednesday , she will be fitted with test sockets for her prosthetics , her dad said
if all goes well , in a few weeks , she will begin to be fitted with prosthetic limbs
but her progress appears to come with a tinge of sadness
" as i sit here and type i realize just how fortunate i am , we are , to have hands , " @entity31 said
" take a moment tonight , tomorrow , every doggone day , to thank @entity118 for what you have
taking time to realize your blessings makes life all the more worth living
