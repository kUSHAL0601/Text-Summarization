@entity0 -- @entity3 's leaders begin a highly - anticipated four - day meeting on saturday that is expected to shed light on the direction the world 's second largest economy is likely to take in coming years
the big question for the gathering -- officially called the third plenary session of the 18th @entity12 -- is how hard @entity13 will push for reforms
possible changes include an overhaul of tax , land and family planning policies ; solutions to control an explosion in local government debt ; restructuring @entity3 's massive state - owned enterprises ; and looser controls on foreign investment
@entity1 's @entity0 bureau chief , @entity26 , spoke to @entity27 , the dean of @entity28 at @entity29 about what to expect : what are the challenges that @entity3 faces now ? the @entity3 economy faces many challenges , in the realms of urbanization , industrial upgrading , changing into more efficient market infrastructure , and reforming the financial sector
there are a lot of problems , but many of these are manageable
the @entity3 economy is like a race car making a turn
you want to be very focused to stay on course and maintain constant speed
if you slam on the brake while turning , you may easily lose control and get into trouble
but @entity3 's economic growth has been slowing down -- is n't that alarming ? indeed , the @entity3 economy has been slowing down for the past three years but recent data and other evidence suggests this is changing
i am pretty optimistic that the @entity3 economy will be back on a relatively strong growth track , and then things will move forward
the key is while maintaining a healthy growth rate , we need to further economic reforms
what further economic reforms should @entity3 take ? in the very near term , the @entity3 government should focus on the urbanization process and reform the " hukou " ( residence registration ) system -- to make sure that the new migrant workers coming to the cities have equal opportunities to education , jobs , access to social safety nets and public services
the other key issue is to improve business environment , and this requires government reforms , so that governments do n't interfere too much , control too much , interfere with the market too much and control resources too much
some say that @entity3 needs political reforms as much as it needs to further economic reforms
what kind of reform on the political side can we expect ? the economic reforms can not be separated from the political reforms
and that is a common understanding in @entity3 now
in my view , for @entity3 in the current situation , the most important political reforms are in the government reforms
and in the official government documents , it has been made clear that they want to redefine the three relationships : the relationship between the government and the market , letting markets play a more fundamental role in resource allocation ; redefining the relationship between the government and the society , to let social organizations play more important role in society ; and then , redefining the relationship between the central and the local governments , to make sure different levels of government all have the right incentives to push forward healthy economic growth and social progress
some say @entity3 must keep the magic " 8 " in gdp growth to sustain economic growth and social stability
what do you think ? a certain number of growth rate , like 8 % , is not a magic number
in fact , i would suggest that the government should downplay it , or even do n't publish at all the target of gdp growth
in a market economy -- for a complex economy like @entity3 -- it is very hard to plan what 's going to be the growth rate for next year , or the next five years
the new government is looking for real solutions
so changing the behavior of local governments in @entity3 will be the key in changing the growth model
starting from the central government , getting rid of the gdp target and then , putting in a systematic package of reform to change the local government 's incentives , so that the local officials will be more focused on how to develop the local business and market , how to improve the environment , how to make the city more liveable and changing their incentives to these areas , instead of trying to attract big projects or getting impressive gdp numbers
how worried should we be in terms of @entity3 housing bubble ? how big is it and will it burst ? it is something that we need to be concerned about , but i do n't think the whole housing sector in @entity3 and all housing prices in all of @entity3 cities , are out of control
overall , i think , the housing price in large cities is something that we need to be concerned about , but if we handle this issue well , it is a manageable problem , and it will not necessarily lead to a bubble that will eventually burst and will cause all sorts of financial issues
how risky is it for @entity3 to be pushing further along market - oriented reform ? when you reform , you meet challenges along the way , you face difficulties
in some sense it is more difficult to push forward now than early on , because in these reforms , you need to deal with very complex interest groups , you need to make a lot of compromises and difficult trade - offs
that is a difficult thing to do , but not to push forward is even more risky
the @entity3 leaders realize the urgency of pushing forward economic reforms
how will the coming @entity201 be considered successful ? the meeting will be considered successful if it points to the right direction and take further reforms , lay some cornerstones so that you can clearly see that in the next five to 10 years , the current government will push through series of economic reforms -- so that the @entity3 economy will be on the right developmental and growth track ; so that we that the economy will become more efficient and strong , the society more open and progressive , the government more efficient , less corrupt and more productive in terms of managing the economy and the society .
