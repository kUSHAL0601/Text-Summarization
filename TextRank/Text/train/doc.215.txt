the @entity4 diplomatic office in the @entity6 city of @entity7 was attacked tuesday night , the embassy in the capital @entity2 said wednesday
a @entity6 security source told @entity9 a jihadist group that is suspected of carrying out the strike , the @entity12 , left leaflets at the scene claiming the attack was in retaliation for the death of @entity6 @entity19 no. 2 @entity18
" fortunately , no one was injured " in the improvised explosive device attack , the embassy said
the blast damaged the front gates , the embassy said
" the @entity4 deplores the attack on its diplomatic mission in @entity7 ... we have requested the @entity6 @entity26 to increase its security around @entity4 facilities in @entity6 , " the embassy said
the embassy said the attack would not affect the @entity4 commitment to @entity6
@entity4 officials said tuesday that @entity18 , effectively the terror network 's second - highest leader , was dead
@entity34 , a former senior member of the @entity35 , said that according to his sources in @entity7 , the leaflets also promised more attacks against the @entity4
@entity34 , now a senior analyst at the @entity40 in @entity41 , said the attack involved the explosion of a rudimentary homemade device and the operation appears to have been hastily put together
@entity34 said on tuesday that pro @entity19 groups operating in @entity6 could use the death of @entity18 as a pretext to expand their operations
the @entity12 were first heard from when they claimed responsibility for an attack on a @entity54 office in @entity7 late last month
a purported video of the attack was apparently posted on jihadist websites that regularly feature statements by @entity19
the video showed several rockets being fired into a building at nighttime
in claiming responsibility , the group stated , " we do not recognize [ state ] borders when we plan for our operations , and we have prepared a message that will soon reach @entity4 in response to polluting the clarity of the defiant city of @entity72 , " according to a translation by @entity74 , which monitors jihadist websites
according to several sources , @entity19 has developed a presence in and around the city of @entity72 in eastern @entity6 , where it has recruited and trained militants
according to a senior @entity6 official , there are five " significant " @entity84 leaders in eastern @entity6
they include @entity85 and @entity86 , a former @entity87 detainee
of the five leaders , all but @entity86 have agreed not to carry out attacks , the official said
the official said @entity91 has a training camp outside @entity72 and the @entity94 tribe , which is responsible for security in that area of @entity6 , has the camp surrounded .
