-- people in poorer countries send text messages more often than those in wealthier countries
men in @entity7 and @entity8 access the internet on their phones twice as much as women do
and use of online social networks grew dramatically in @entity14 and @entity15 over the past year , most likely as part of the recent political upheavals in those countries
these are among the results of a new report that measured the usage of digital communication in 21 countries
the survey by the @entity27 's @entity26 found that text messaging is now a widespread global phenomenon : in the countries polled , 75 % of cell phone owners say they text
in almost all the countries surveyed , the use of social networks such as @entity35 and @entity36 did n't change much from 2010 to 2011
two notable exceptions were @entity14 , where 28 % of respondents now use social networks -- up from 18 % last year -- and @entity15 , where social - networking use rose from 33 % to 43 %
@entity35 and other networking tools played a prominent role in the revolution that toppled @entity14 president @entity44 in february
protesters organized so effectively on social networks that the @entity14 government shut down the internet for five days in an unsuccessful attempt to quell the uprising
observers say social networks also have helped mobilize protesters in @entity52 , where tens of thousands have filled the streets to speak out against @entity15 parliamentary elections they say were rigged
the @entity27 survey found that only 6 % of internet users in @entity15 were not on social - networking sites
researchers conducted the survey face - to - face and via telephone in the spring of this year
sample sizes in each country ranged from 700 in @entity64 to more than 4,000 in @entity65
among the survey 's other findings : -- of the countries surveyed , text messaging was most common in @entity70 and @entity71 , where 96 % and 89 % of people said they regularly send texts
by contrast , 67 % of people in the @entity75 were frequent texters
-- in @entity7 , 29 % of male cell phone owners use their devices to access the @entity47 , compared to 13 % of female phone owners
this mobile - web gender gap was also pronounced in @entity8 ( 26 % / 11 % ) and in @entity82 ( 30 % / 14 % )
-- social networking is generally more common in wealthier nations , largely driven by the fact that they have higher rates of internet access
for example , 53 % of respondents in @entity90 and 50 % of respondents in the @entity75 said they use social networks , compared with 5 % in @entity65 and 2 % in @entity94 .
