@entity0 -- on @entity3 , the beginning of this year will look a lot like the end of last year
the fight over extending a payroll tax cut and long - term unemployment benefits picks back up tuesday as @entity9 returns to work after its winter break
while aides in both parties say it 's likely @entity9 will resolve that dispute , @entity11 are still licking their wounds after a public backlash over how they handled those issues and fear that @entity19 will drag out the fight to score more political points in an election year
and @entity19 are concerned that @entity23 @entity11 will insist on adding more items to the measures to try to keep conservatives on board
the presidential campaign will take center stage this year
president @entity30 already has made clear he plans to run against a " do - nothing " @entity9 and will likely highlight that theme during the annual @entity32 address next week
facing that high - profile push against them , and with congressional approval ratings in the single digits and the fight for control of both chambers in the balance , lawmakers know they have a heavy lift to convince voters they deserve re-election
democrats , who run the @entity19 , and @entity11 , who control the @entity23 , acknowledge that outside of the payroll tax cut bill no major legislation is expected to make it through @entity9 this year
however , each party promises a series of bills to advance what it thinks the public wants from @entity3 in response to the weak economy
for both sides , these efforts will be more about political messaging than actually legislating because few , if any , are likely to become law
congressional tensions this week @entity63 will huddle at their annual three - day retreat in @entity65 to map out their 2012 agenda and strategy for responding to president @entity30 and @entity9 @entity19
but high on the agenda at that meeting for @entity23 speaker @entity71 is likely to be an effort to bridge severe divisions with his own rank - and - file , many of whom questioned his leadership over the course of several showdowns with the @entity23 and @entity19 last year
conservatives want @entity71 to be more aggressive in standing for their principles
tensions between @entity19 and @entity11 are also high
the president 's decision earlier this month to make a recess appointment of @entity88 to head the @entity89 while the @entity9 was technically not recessed drew a swift and angry response from @entity11
@entity92 aides privately grumbled the move set a bad tone for the coming year and invited @entity11 to be even less cooperative
and with key economic nominees needing @entity19 confirmation , including a new director of @entity98 after @entity99 was named @entity23 chief of staff , @entity11 could cause problems for the president and @entity19 democrats
senate majority leader @entity104 said sunday on @entity106 's " @entity105 " that @entity9 spent months on issues unnecessarily last year , pointing out that president @entity108 raised the debt ceiling 18 times while in the @entity23
" we 've had obstructionism on steroids , " @entity104 said
a top @entity19 @entity115 leadership aide said the party is n't overly concerned
that 's because @entity19 believe @entity92 obstructionism is at such a high level now -- where filibusters are routine -- they already expect a major fight on every nominee
finishing the payroll tax cut bill when @entity9 limped out of town before @entity126 , it agreed to a two - month extension of a bill that cuts payroll taxes , extends unemployment benefits and prevents a cut in the rate paid to doctors who care for @entity135 patients
as they begin talks on an extension for the rest of 2012 , both sides remain highly skeptical and suspicious of each other
questions linger for congressional negotiators -- how to pay for the $ 200 billion price tag and whether to tighten requirements for unemployment benefits
@entity19 are worried @entity11 will push for other issues , such as renewing their demand for the approval of the controversial @entity150 oil pipeline or the elimination of a range of @entity154 regulations on businesses
some in the @entity92 are wary the @entity23 and @entity19 @entity19 will try again to pass a surtax on millionaires -- something even some @entity19 do n't support -- as a way of painting the @entity92 as protectors of the rich
" the only way this process will not go smoothly and through regular order is if the @entity23 chooses to disrupt it for political reasons , " said @entity162 , spokesman for @entity23 speaker @entity71
informal discussions between @entity23 and @entity19 negotiators have already begun
@entity104 told " @entity105 " that he hopes the @entity171 faction in the @entity23 does n't have the same influence on talks that it did in december 's impasse , calling that " bad for the country
" " i would hope the two @entity11 leaders would have learned from what took place in the previous year , " @entity104 said
debt ceiling again right out of the gate when @entity9 returns , lawmakers will have to respond formally to the president 's recent request to raise the debt ceiling
as part of the choreography agreed to last summer , members will get a chance to vote against the president 's request , but it 's mostly for show because the reality is @entity9 does n't have the votes to block an increase
two other significant bills need attention this winter
one is a new @entity199 bill that is stalled over disputes on labor rights and a costly government program to subsidize air travel to rural areas
senators also want to pass a highway bill that would fund road and bridge construction for the next two years
@entity30 is supposed to formally submit his budget for 2013 in february
last year , republicans criticized his budget for failing to reform entitlement programs like @entity135 and @entity213 , which represent the bulk of the nation 's massive budget deficit
" if he punts again , it will be clear the @entity23 plans to spend the year on autopilot
we think that would be unacceptable to the @entity223 people , " @entity71 's aide said
on the @entity150 matter , the administration already is facing a congressionally mandated deadline on february 21 to approve the project or explain why it wo n't
@entity19 say they expect the @entity23 to reject the plan -- because the administration has said it ca n't finish its environmental review by then -- but @entity11 are promising to continue to hammer the administration on the issue
bills to help the economy and send a message to voters in addition to their push for @entity150 , @entity23 @entity11 are planning votes early this year on legislation that would expand domestic energy production and upgrade transportation infrastructure across the country
the bill will include offshore drilling , energy exploration in the @entity247 ( @entity247 ) , as well as give money to states along with more flexibility to build roads and bridges
the new spending on highway projects would be offset by revenue from oil and gas leases
but the @entity23 is unlikely to support the @entity92 proposals and they are unlikely to go anywhere in the @entity115 - led @entity19
even without much hope for actually passing these bills @entity23 @entity11 aides stress they will continue focusing on measures to boost the weak economy to show they are responding to voters ' concerns , and they emphasize that many of these proposals have had @entity115 support
" @entity273 is going to continue to work hard to produce results for small businesses , working families and middle class @entity223 , " one @entity23 @entity92 aide told @entity1
" if the president wishes to ignore @entity9 and play political games , that 's his decision , but by doing so he will own the gridlock , " the aide said
in addition to the bills on jobs , the @entity23 also is expected to take up legislation to make more transparent members of @entity9 ' stock trades and other financial transactions
@entity92 leaders plan to vote on the so - called " @entity291 " which would ban lawmakers from using any non-public information to trade stocks or make other financial transactions
@entity19 want to draw a line to job creation with almost everything they do this year
that starts with the highway and @entity199 bills , which @entity19 say will create thousands of jobs
it will then continue all year with a myriad of bills @entity19 think will prove to a wary public they are putting jobs first
a measure to fund school construction is another example of a bill @entity19 hope to highlight
lawmakers from both parties say they are determined before the end of the year to prevent deep cuts to the defense budget as called for after the deficit reduction " super committee " failed to reach a deal to slash the deficit
aides said serious work to find alternative spending reductions probably wo n't happen until after the election in november
control of @entity9 as voters go to the polls this year , members are expected to spend less time in @entity0 and more time in their districts making the case for why their party ought to be steering the country 's economic agenda
@entity19 need to pick up 25 seats to regain control of the @entity23 -- a high hurdle , but one many democrats feel is within reach because they think voters will blame @entity11 for the gridlock in @entity0
@entity19 @entity11 feel more confident they can win control of their chamber , especially after the retirements of several key @entity115 senators in states that lean @entity11
right now the @entity19 hold a 53 - 47 advantage
but @entity19 are defending 23 seats this year while republicans are working to hold just 10
the recent announcement by sen. @entity351 , a conservative @entity352 from @entity353 , that he would not seek re-election is seen by @entity11 as another sign @entity19 will lose majority control .
