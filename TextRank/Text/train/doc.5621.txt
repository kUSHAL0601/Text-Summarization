@entity0 -- @entity2 has had enough of " bridgegate
" appearing last week on @entity6 's " @entity5 , " the veteran newsman lamented the fact that so many of his colleagues are stuck on the story of @entity13 gov. @entity12 's bridge problems
they ca n't stop talking about whether members of @entity12 's staff tried to harass the @entity18 mayor of @entity19 , @entity13 , by shutting down traffic lanes on the @entity21 , and whether @entity12 was in on it
do you ever get the sense that the media are on @entity26 while most @entity27 are on @entity28 ? this story confirms it
we 've known that those who spoon - feed us the news march to their own drum , but now it 's clear they have their own agenda
it 's not to pass along the information that helps shape people 's concerns , but rather to tell people what they should be concerned about
@entity2 put it this way : " i do think , across the country , however , when they 're looking at long - term unemployment , and they 're looking at the uncertainty of the @entity53 , they 're saying , ' you 've got to move on , guys
' " i 'm all for moving on
the media can start up again if it discovers evidence @entity12 knew about the lane closures and then lied about it
but i 'm also fond of self - awareness , especially from those of us in the media
so my message to @entity2 is : " newsman , heal thy own network
" in the last couple of weeks , it has begun to look like @entity72 stands for " @entity73
" according to the conservative media watchdog site , @entity75 , since the bridge story broke on january 8 , @entity74 has aired more than 25 full reports in less than 10 days
the angry liberal talk show hosts on @entity6 are even worse , droning on about the bridge story day after day in what is a blatant attempt to smear @entity12
what do you suppose is more annoying ? being stuck in traffic for hours on a bridge -- or watching the media get stuck for days on a story about a juvenile stunt that might , or might not , bloom into a full - blown scandal ? i 'd have to go with the latter , especially when you consider that the media seem addicted to the story in hopes that it could somehow derail the plans of a @entity98 presidential hopeful
it 's a long walk from one to the other , but see if you can follow me there
if @entity12 was in the loop , then he lied at his marathon press conference
if there is one thing that our friends in the @entity110 will not tolerate it 's a liar
that is , at least not a @entity98 liar
that 's part of the problem with this , the sense that a story about partisanship run amok is itself partisan in the way it 's being covered
left - leaning elements of the media are trying to blow it up into a scandal to help clear the way for the likely @entity18 presidential nominee -- @entity127
the other problem is that too many @entity27 have quickly jumped to the wrong conclusion
no , not about whether @entity12 knew about the prank and conspired to inconvenience scores of @entity13 residents in order to bully a political opponent
i 'm talking about the other conclusion -- the one about how being a bully is a negative trait in an elected official , and perhaps even enough to end a political career
is that so ? who made that determination ? think back to the great leaders who helped define the last century -- from @entity145 to @entity146 to @entity147 to @entity148 to @entity149 to @entity150
you had better believe that those people had moments when they acted like bullies
that 's part of politics
besides , it seems like just yesterday that presidential candidates like @entity160 and @entity161 were trying to stiffen their upper lips and overcome the so - called " wimp factor
" we @entity27 are a fickle bunch
@entity27 could use more strength on the world stage
we need n't push around other countries , but -- whether we 're talking about @entity169 or @entity170 or @entity171 -- we also need a president who wo n't let our country be pushed around either
who 's afraid of big , bad bullies ? voters are n't
they keep voting them into office -- perhaps in the hopes that they 'll use their strength for good
i 'm still not sure that @entity12 knows how to do that
yet , if he aspires to greatness , and to be the kind of leader that helps define this century , he had better learn fast
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .
