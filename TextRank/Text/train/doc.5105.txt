-- commercial air travel is already filled with annoyances like shrinking personal space , overpriced meals and frequent delays
for many people , there 's one bright spot to flying : a forced break from making , receiving and hearing phone calls
that could change with the @entity13 new proposal to drop the ban on cellular connections and allow phone calls once a plane reaches 10,000 feet
the @entity13 first pitched the idea in 2004 , before the rise of the smartphone
the reaction from passengers and flight attendant unions at the time was loud and negative : phone calls on planes would be disruptive , annoying and a potential safety issue
the @entity13 decided against the proposal
now people are more attached to their tablets and smartphones
so much so that they rebelled against the ban on using small electronic devices such as phones , tablets and e-readers during takeoff and landing
after reviewing safety issues , the @entity39 and airlines finally gave in this month and relaxed restrictions
an unpopular idea quietly playing games or reading e-books on a tablet or phone is one thing , but chatting away mid-flight does n't seem to be as in demand
in a survey of 1,600 adults by an advisory group , the @entity39 found that 61 % of people supported a ban on making calls while in the air
" i 'm definitely against it , " said @entity58 , travel editor at the @entity59
" people would be carrying on loud , full - voiced conversations right next to someone who does n't want to hear it
" the @entity65 , the world 's largest union of flight attendants , came out against the idea on thursday , citing safety and security concerns
" in far too many operational scenarios , passengers making phone calls could extend beyond a mere nuisance , creating negative effects on aviation safety and security that are great and far too risky , " the @entity65 said in a statement
@entity79 , who blogs about the airline industry on @entity81 , agrees with lifting the restriction and thinks each airline should be allowed to set its own policy
" the public in the @entity86 seems to be strongly against cell phones on airplanes , but let the airlines make the decision on whether or not they want to move forward and allow it , " said @entity79
keeping the peace cell phones could cause friction between passengers who want to talk and passengers who would prefer peace and quiet
they would introduce yet another behavior flight attendants would have to police
" we 're trained to de-escalate
why would you put something in the environment that can escalate ? " said @entity102 , the international president of the @entity65
@entity102 has worked as a flight attendant for the past 22 years
" the idea potentially introduces yet another stress factor into an already stressful environment , " said airline pilot @entity107 of @entity108
the stress is made worse by tight quarters
when taking a phone call in public , it 's good etiquette to keep 10 feet away from other people , protocol expert @entity114 told @entity121
it 's not even possible to get 10 inches of space on an airplane , where economy class seats are typically 17 to 18 inches wide and each seat is butted up against the one next to it
one option is for the @entity13 and airlines to allow cell phone use and hope that passengers act responsibly and only make calls when necessary and speak in a quiet voice
unfortunately , the firsthand experience of flight attendants , frequently fliers and people who take other forms of mass transit cast doubt on that dream scenario
" the real problem with travel , especially air travel , is not baggage fees , it 's not long lines ... the real problem with travel is other travelers , " said @entity58
the " quiet car " option this is not the first time the issue has come up
terrestrial mass transit systems , including subways , buses and trains , have already struggled with the invasion of cell phones and loud talkers
some trains have addressed the problem of disruptive passengers on cellphones by adding quiet cars during certain hours
the @entity167 has separate cars during rush hour where noise , loud chatting , and phone calls are prohibited
some @entity174 trains also offer quiet cars , which forbid phone calls and any noise technology , and feature dimmed , soothing lighting
greyhound bus lines does n't have an official policy , but individual bus drivers have been known to crack down on loud talkers
unfortunately , quiet sections are n't a practical solution for airplanes ( though they would add yet another " premium " seating feature for which airlines could charge extra )
" on an airplane , there 's no such thing as a quiet car , " said @entity102
" in my opinion it 's not that different from having a smoking section on a 747 , it 's absurd
" smoking sections , which separated smokers and nonsmokers with a row of seats , were banned in the @entity86 along with smoking on airplanes in 1988
before 1973 , smokers could light up in any seat they liked
" theoretically , you could have a talking section and a nontalking section , but you 'd have to put up some serious plexiglass , " said @entity58
discount @entity210 airline @entity209 introduced a quiet zone in early 2013
sandwiched between first class and economy , the zone is an adult - only section intended to give travelers a respite from screeching children
like smoke from cigarettes and the sound of a crying baby , a loud phone conversation would likely ignore any invisible barriers and carry through an entire plane
call waiting the @entity13 will present its proposal in december , but even if it passes , it will be a while before in - flight cell phone calls are a reality
cell phone towers are on the ground and airplanes will need special equipment before passengers can dial out
" as it stands , cellular phones simply will not work at higher altitudes in an airplane cabin
changing this will require investment in on - board technology , " said @entity107
individual airlines will have to decide if allowing calls is something they want to allow
a more business - oriented airline might jump at the opportunity to lure working travelers
others might side with the majority of passengers and flight attendants and stick with a policy of " silence is golden
" " there 's so much hustle and bustle out there already , " said @entity102
" can people just have some peace and quiet for a few hours ? it 's not that retro of an idea
