@entity0 -- after turning a traditional @entity4 drink into a hit @entity6 product , @entity2 is now trying re-brand @entity7 itself
@entity4 entrepreneur @entity2 is the creator of multi-million dollar @entity6 company @entity9 , which makes drinks based on traditional recipes from around the world
she came up with the idea in 2004 , after she returned home to @entity4 and found soda drinks were replacing the country 's traditional hibiscus drink , known as bissap
she arrived back in the @entity6 determined to share healthy traditional recipes with the rest of the world
@entity9 's products now include organic coffees and exotic fruit drinks and are sold all over the @entity6
" my biggest pride was to know that it was possible , that the vision i had was possible and my vision was that the world is hungry for well - executed @entity7 brands , " @entity26 said
" we saw it at the investor level and we saw it at the buyer 's level and we saw it at the consumer 's level
everyone wanted to be part of that adventure and it was just amazing
" scramble for ' dot africa ' internet domain name now @entity2 is now building a new company , @entity48 , in @entity0
it 's a high - end skin care line based on traditional @entity4 recipes , using natural ingredients indigenous to @entity7
" what we are doing now is a concept phase where we make sure a product is right , the packaging is right , the branding is right , the marketing is right , " she said
" we are in the process of making sure that people will buy into it
in our first three weeks of existence we landed a pretty cool account already , so we 're getting there
" her goal is to inspire others , so that in the next 10 years there is an @entity7 company among the top 100 global brands
@entity26 says that when it comes to marketing an @entity7 product it 's not just about selling units , it 's about selling a different image of @entity7 to consumers
she argues that most people see @entity7 in terms @entity80 Â© s , such as safaris , tribal designs or people needing charity
her goal is to change the perception that both @entity7 and @entity86 have of her home continent
" i think a lot of @entity7 , unfortunately , the overwhelming majority , does still not yet feel comfortable about themselves
there is this complex of inferiority that is pervasive in the culture
" a lot of it has to do with history ... yes we have @entity99 in office today but it does n't change a lot
and i 'm not even talking about racism , that 's not what i 'm talking about
what i am talking about is just groups of people not feeling good enough about themselves ; if you do n't have the right type of self esteem you go nowhere in this world
" but self - esteem will also come if enough of us today that are in the age of working , if enough of us can really get together and try and build a different brand for @entity7 , a brand that all of a sudden means ' contributors to the world , ' rather than a subset of a population that 's always sucking energy out of others
" @entity7 can teach the world to innovate while her products are currently made in the @entity6 , the plan is to move production to @entity4 once @entity130 has generated enough profit
@entity26 says the company plans to donate 10 % of profits to a foundation supporting the next generation of @entity4 leaders
" if i have to share with people my deepest dream , that 's the level at which i want to play -- not just do well for myself and even for my employees but i really want to make sure that the next generation is well prepared , " she said
" or at least we have a cluster of people that are going to go and really accomplish things that we can all be proud of
