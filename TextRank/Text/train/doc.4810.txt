-- @entity1 , @entity2 , is pretty much how it sounds
@entity4 -- home to fewer than 2,500 people -- rural , and it has more churches than libraries , schools and liquor stores
about 20 minutes north is a similar town by the name of @entity14
this is where @entity16 was born
and just on the edge of @entity19 -- between @entity20 and @entity21 -- is a small cemetery by the name of @entity24
this is where he is buried
he tripped and fell off of a roof while working
he was 29 years old
in my 20 - plus years as a journalist , i 've written a lot about death
thankfully , it has n't gotten easier
the stories still touch me , although some more than others
bridegroom 's passing would be one of those
" it was n't easy going back there because it was the most difficult time in my life , " @entity40 , @entity16 's partner , told me on the phone
" but it helped me draw out the positives of who i am
finally , for once , i am not afraid to stand up for what i believe in and i 'm proud , not ashamed , of being gay
" hearing from people , thanking me for sharing our story , thanking me for reminding them how important marriage equality is ... it makes me feel like i 've done the right thing by making the film
" the film he 's referring to is aptly called " bridegroom " and it chronicles the couple 's relationship as well as the legal fallout stemming from their inability to get married
fallout such as the hospital not giving @entity40 any details regarding the cause of death
and being barred from the funeral
" they told me that if i showed up @entity72 's father and uncle planned to attack me and knowing how his dad reacted when ( @entity72 ) came out , i had real concern for my safety , " @entity40 said
how did @entity72 's father react ? well , according to @entity40 , he pointed a shotgun at his son before beating him up -- one of the more jaunting details revealed in the documentary
@entity16 's parents have yet to publicly comment on the film and declined to participate in its making
" a year later , i snuck into town by myself , " @entity40 said
" i knew it was going to be very difficult and i just wanted to be alone and feel whatever it is i had to feel without someone else being there
i spent an hour there , crying , talking to @entity72 ... the hardest part was driving away ... in that moment it finally hit me that he was gone ... that all of this was real
" when i spoke with @entity40 , he mentioned he was nervous about sounding stupid in the interview
little did he know it was i who was fighting back tears with each detail of their story that he shared
in the end , the only thing that sounded stupid was the notion that the love he and @entity16 shared was inferior to anyone else 's
" sadly , what happened to @entity40 after @entity72 's tragic death is not uncommon for couples without the protections that marriage equality brings to their relationships , " said @entity111 , executive director of @entity112
" it is unconscionable that anyone already suffering the loss of someone they love , should be forced to go through this horror
this is just one reason why this fight must continue until every @entity128 couple can live in safety and equality
" a fight in which @entity133 's @entity132 governor , @entity131 , finally admitted defeat
a fight @entity139 's @entity132 governor , @entity138 , tries hard to avoid talking about , even as marriage equality heads to his state 's court
a fight that even spilled into the supposed gay - friendly streets of @entity145 , @entity146 where @entity147 -- not @entity132 -- are in power and yet afraid to vote on a bill that would legalize same - sex marriages
i joined the thousands who recently came to the state capital to offer encouragement / pressure via a rally and march
all of which reminds us that homophobia and cowardice are not exclusive to a particular party
bridegroom and @entity40 , who grew up in a town in @entity163 similar to @entity1 and @entity14 , met at a bowling alley in @entity165 back in 2005
at the time , they were both closeted though they would later learn that their meeting was not by chance -- a mutual friend set it up
what no one could predict was how quickly they would fall in love or how that love prompted them to come out to their families a short time later
@entity40 's embraced him when he told them
@entity16 's clearly had the opposite reaction
" he was so heartbroken about the whole thing because he always wanted me to see where he grew up , " @entity40 said
despite this , the two would go on to buy a home together , start a business , build a life
one day in may 2011 , bridegroom -- a budding photographer -- was on the roof of a friend 's building taking photos when he tripped and fell several floors down
on the one - year anniversary of his death , @entity40 uploaded a tribute to @entity16 on @entity197 , detailing their story
@entity40 's tribute went viral , capturing the attention of @entity201 , creator of " designing women
" she convinced him to turn the clip -- and his pain -- into a documentary
he agreed , and it debuted at @entity208 on april 23 , one day after what would have been @entity16 's 31st birthday
@entity211 , who helped @entity40 produce the @entity197 tribute , was in attendance
as was president @entity214 who introduced the film , saying , " it 's a story about our nation 's struggle to make one more step in forming a more perfect union , for which marriage is both the symbol and substance
" it was a bittersweet moment for @entity40 , who moved to @entity165 hoping to work in the entertainment industry
equally as bittersweet was being in @entity229 when @entity230 -- the law that prevented @entity40 and bridegroom from marrying in @entity232 -- was overturned this summer
" i was outside the @entity233 and it was a very emotional moment for me , " he said
" it was wonderful because i knew my friends could finally get married
but i was also sad because i knew that @entity72 and i could finally get married now ... if he were here
" months before @entity16 's passing , he had given @entity238 a ring
if you 're one of those individuals still undecided on the whole same - sex marriage issue -- like some state legislators in @entity146 i know -- i encourage you to watch the film
it 's available starting sunday , october 27 , on @entity247 and it will air that day on @entity250 's own
it puts a face , and heart , on a conversation that far too often gets muddied by politics and irrational fear
two things that have nothing to do with love
" i have n't dated anyone since @entity72 passed away , " @entity40 said
" it 's not that i 'm against the idea of it , it 's just right now i 'm still focused on the film and the story and just trying to heal
" if there 's any good that can come out of this , it 's by using our story to educate people
... maybe in some ways this was all meant to be
... i used to think @entity72 just had a weird last name but now ... " but now i will never see the word " bridegroom " in the same light again
and hopefully , neither will you
