it might be hard to believe that two of the handsome boxers in the photos above were once shelter or rescue dogs with severe cases of mange and little hope of finding their forever homes
but @entity10 , left , and @entity11 beat the odds , which is remarkable considering that according to the @entity13 , 6 million to 8 million pets enter shelters each year , and half of those animals are euthanized
@entity11 's path to his family began when @entity23 and @entity24 toyed with the idea of adding a third dog to their family
but plans took a back seat when @entity31 , their 8 - year - old boxer , developed cancer and began a slow decline
coping with the loss of a pet proved difficult for the couple
their boxer @entity37 had an even tougher time adjusting to life without her constant companion
once again , they considered adoption and contacted @entity44 about a dog named @entity11 that had been featured on the group 's website for more than a year
" we were kind of called to @entity11 , " says @entity24 of @entity48 , @entity49
" he was 22 months old and @entity37 was about 7
that 's quite an age gap , so we were anxious to see how that would work
" a rough @entity56 age gap paled in comparison to other challenges @entity11 already had overcome
he was deaf , and when @entity11 arrived at an @entity62 animal shelter , the large white puppy was malnourished and struggled with severe mange , a treatable skin condition that causes hair loss and itchy sores
animal control called @entity44 after another rescue group gave up on the dog
leg fractures led to $ 3,000 in veterinary bills that the nonprofit covered through donations and fund - raisers
@entity75 : how to help pets without taking in another animal " there was so much stuff going on , and he was such a young dog when we got him , " says @entity78 , president of @entity44
" we did n't know his bones were that bad
we just looked at the mange and said , ' it 's treatable ; this is a young dog that will grow up to live a happy life
' " the home @entity92 's foster family had taught him about a dozen hand signals for basic commands , and the @entity97 were ready to give @entity11 his happy ending â€” as long as timid @entity37 could handle an energetic , 75 - pound male companion
his next big hurdle would be a home visit
on february 11 , @entity11 joined his forever family
" the best way to honor @entity31 's legacy was to give another dog a wonderful home and lots of love , " @entity24 notes on her blog
" there are a bunch of hidden treasures in rescues and i wish more would look at this as an option , " she said recently

@entity11 's muscular build , square head and fine , white coat with dappled spots attract plenty of attention
people walk a wide path or approach to ask questions about the striking boxer
regarded as loyal and protective , this popular breed also is known to interact well with children
later this year , @entity11 and @entity37 will help celebrate another human addition to their pack when the @entity141 welcome their first child
" while he would never take the place of @entity31 , it really helped heal our hearts a little bit , " @entity24 says
" and he brought out such a playful side in @entity37
" @entity10 finds a @entity150 also chose to honor the life of her boxer , @entity152 , by fostering another dog
she was all set to care for a female puppy when @entity44 posted photos of a male named @entity10
at only 4 months old , his body was covered with sores caused by severe mange and @entity10 required daily medicated baths
" it just broke my heart , " @entity161 says
" he was so sickly and so bad off and i knew he was going to need a lot of care
at that time , i could n't say no. i reached out and said , ' somebody else take this female who is healthy and will probably get adopted pretty quickly
' " @entity75 : 7 incredibly loyal dogs meeting her new @entity170 the day after @entity172 , @entity161 met @entity10 and worked on his recovery
doubts began to creep in when she gave @entity10 his first medicated bath , treating wounds that spread from his muzzle to his paws
but @entity161 pushed those thoughts aside and focused on caring for the pup , administering pills and hand - feeding @entity183 until he gained strength
" i honestly did n't know if he was gong to make it or not , " she says
" he was on pain meds and did n't come out of his crate for the first week
" healing brings a new @entity190 two months of treatment and a little coaching from @entity193 , @entity161 ' @entity195 bulldog , @entity10 finally was on the mend
@entity189 brought a new challenge
@entity44 had spread the word about @entity183 and adoption requests began to pour in for the boxer
@entity161 also had shared his story , driving people to the @entity44 site to raise money and awareness for rescued boxers
" it was a double - edged sword , " she says
" i was happy that people were interested , but i had gotten attached and knew it would be hard to let him go
" @entity75 : why do pet rescuers ask such nosy questions ? @entity215 mom gets second @entity217 groups help relieve overcrowding in animal shelters by giving pets a better chance at finding forever homes through adoption fairs , foster care and aggressive social media campaigns
once prospective families are identified , reputable rescue organizations rely on a detailed application process to pair pets and people
many find a love connection
occasionally , things do n't work out and the pet returns to a rescue organization
@entity10 fell into the latter category
fortunately , @entity161 had fallen for the rambunctious pup and wanted to keep him
in addition to the occasional foster dog , her pack now includes @entity193 , @entity10 and a young boxer named @entity243 who was turned in to animal control shortly after having a litter of puppies
to keep her pack occupied , @entity161 relies on frequent walks , obedience classes and interactive puzzle toys
" i 've worked hard to get them on the same page , " she says
" we do a lot of team - building exercises
" help pets find a forever homeif your team is ready to foster a pet , @entity161 recommends researching local rescues and talking to other foster families about the experience
of course , there 's always the chance that your foster will turn into a permanent resident
that 's not such a bad thing , according to @entity161 and @entity24
" you can get a phenomenal dog from a rescue , " @entity24 says
" we have had three phenomenal experiences
dogs from rescues show their gratitude every day
something in them knows you kind of saved them and they pay that back lovingly
