@entity0 -- when an old widower from the central @entity5 city of @entity6 went into hospital last summer because of a persistent high fever , he was diagnosed with the @entity10 virus -- and made national news
the man , in his late 70s , had frequently hired prostitutes after his wife died , and doctors believe he contracted the hiv virus -- which can eventually develop into full - blown @entity10 -- through unprotected sex , the official @entity13 news agency reported
with the population rapidly aging , more than 10 % of @entity5 's 1.3 billion people are now over the age of 60 , census figures show
improving living standards mean many @entity5 are living and remaining sexually active for longer
but now the threat of @entity10 looms large over a segment of @entity5 society not previously known for a high prevalence of cases : senior citizens
what is @entity10 ? among new hiv - positive cases nationwide , those over the age of 50 accounted for almost 15 % at the end of 2009 -- a sharp rise from less than 8 % just four years earlier , according to a recent report by the @entity38
the center said most patients were male and contracted the virus through unprotected sex
the @entity43 has estimated 780,000 people will be living with the @entity10 virus in @entity5 by the end of this year and more than half of them are unaware of their condition
@entity5 officials acknowledge the real figure may be higher , particularly among the elderly
@entity52 must not give up on @entity10 fight " it 's very hard for us to obtain an exact number due to our limited ability to monitor and report the epidemic situation in this age group , " @entity54 , deputy director of the @entity56 's disease control bureau , told a health seminar in @entity0 last year
" older people are more prone to having medical conditions that require surgeries and hospitals are stricter on pre-operative checks -- that 's how many of them are notified of their @entity71 status for the first time
" researchers say the lure of easy sex with prostitutes -- the average price paid a relatively modest $ 5.5 -- and the lack of safe sex knowledge among their generation have exposed an increasing number of @entity5 senior citizens to the danger of hiv / aids
another 30 years of @entity10 ? @entity54 said his ministry had already started including the elderly in its @entity10 awareness and prevention campaigns , which previously targeted only younger people and high - risk groups like migrant laborers and sex workers
but many activists view the government effort as inadequate in dealing with a burgeoning problem , especially as senior citizens diagnosed with the @entity10 virus tend to face far greater difficulties and discrimination in @entity5 than their younger counterparts
" traditionally the elderly are the respected members of family and society , but once infected with @entity71 , they become a disgrace and face harsh moral judgments , " said @entity101 , whose non-governmental organization @entity102 in @entity5 has counseled elderly patients in southwestern @entity5 for five years
" people of their age are usually pillars of their households , taking care of both their parents and children , " he added
" but instead , these patients now have to rely on their families to support them financially and psychologically
" others echo @entity101 's sentiment , adding that elderly patients remain neglected in state - sponsored @entity10 treatment and prevention programs
" currently @entity10 patients are required to provide proof of residence and employment to receive basic care at public hospitals , " said @entity123 , a volunteer with @entity125 - based @entity124
" but many elderly patients are either unemployed or unable to work due to their medical conditions -- making them ineligible for subsidized antiviral treatment
" activists have called on the government to overhaul its @entity10 policy and allow ngos to receive more international funding and cooperation
" we are willing to work with other experts to reach out to the elderly and teach them the concept of safe sex , " said @entity123
" there 's so much room for improvement in this area
