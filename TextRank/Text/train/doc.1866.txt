-- @entity2 champions @entity1 recorded their fifth straight win under new coach @entity4 , defeating @entity5 3 - 2 at the @entity6 despite the visitors coming back from 2 - 0 down
@entity9 gave the home side a 14th - minute lead when firing in his 24th goal of the season
and , within a minute , @entity1 had doubled their advantage when @entity15 set up @entity16 to tap home from just six yards out
but @entity5 refused to lie down and scored twice within six minutes in a frantic opening 45 minutes
first , @entity19 was given far too much space to turn and shoot home low into the corner of the net in the 23rd minute
then , just six minutes later , @entity5 remarkably drew level when former @entity1 midfielder @entity25 played the ball over the home defence for @entity28 to volley home
but the first - half scoring was still not over -- and @entity32 defender @entity31 put the home side ahead once again on the stroke of half time when he burst into the box to head home @entity39 's cross
that was the end of the scoring , but not the chances , and @entity9 should have added his second of the game after the break but somehow managed to hit the crossbar from just eight yards out
and any chance @entity5 had of getting back into the game was finally extinguished when @entity28 was sent off for a second bookable offence
the result moves @entity1 up to fourth place in the @entity51 table , six points behind leaders and rivals @entity54 but with a game in hand
meanwhile , @entity57 are through to the quarterfinals of the @entity59 after beating rivals @entity54 2 - 1 in a match marred by crowd trouble
@entity57 took the lead eight minutes after the break when @entity63 scored from the penalty spot after @entity66 's handball in the area
@entity54 levelled just four minutes later when @entity68 also scored from the spot after @entity70 had been fouled in the area
however , @entity72 scored the winning goal 13 minutes from the end , firing home with a well - struck right - foot shot
police made four arrests before and after the match after trouble between rival fans which resulted in a teenage @entity54 fan being taken to hospital with a knife wound to his leg
@entity87 have also reached the quarterfinals after defeating @entity89 on penalties following a 2 - 2 draw after extra time
the @entity94 - based side scored all their five spot - kicks while @entity97 striker @entity96 missed his penalty as @entity89 went out 5 - 4 .
