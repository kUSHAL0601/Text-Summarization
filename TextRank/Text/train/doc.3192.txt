@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 consume more than 19 million barrels of oil a day as well as tons of coal and natural gas , raising questions about the future availability of those resources and the environmental impact of their development and use
president @entity16 has heavily pushed an alternative energy agenda , his administration pouring billions of taxpayer resources into solar , wind and battery initiatives aimed at cutting dependence on foreign oil and changing how @entity3 view and use energy
in a new policy paper , his @entity34 rival for the @entity36 , @entity37 , says , " president @entity16 has intentionally sought to shut down oil , gas , and coal production in pursuit of his own alternative energy agenda
" @entity37 wants more oil exploration , faster permitting , and state control of exploration on federal lands
it all adds up to the @entity34 refrain : " drill , baby , drill
" fact check : @entity16 education ad misleading " i will set a national goal of @entity3 and @entity50 energy independence by 2020 , " @entity37 pledges
but @entity16 says not so fast " under my administration , @entity50 is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years -- at any time , " @entity16 says
so who is telling the truth ? despite a moratorium on offshore drilling prompted by the @entity59 spill in the @entity60 two years ago , domestic oil production has surged
oil shale and natural gas production are also up sharply
however , much of this was set in motion years before @entity16 took office
while @entity16 has taken some steps to encourage production , he can not claim as much credit as he would like
@entity16 has , for sure , angered some oil and coal producers by steering federal money to alternative energy sources
but there is no evidence that he is trying to " shut down " traditional energy industries
it is also not clear that @entity37 's plans would bring energy independence that much quicker , especially without a simultaneous focus on reducing consumption
so on both sides , the arguments run out of gas
@entity37 's claim that @entity16 is trying to kill off old energy is false
and @entity16 's claims of what he has accomplished are muddled
we rate them both misleading
fact check : @entity37 's welfare claims wrong
