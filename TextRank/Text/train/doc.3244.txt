@entity0 , @entity1 -- the painting is called " @entity4
" it depicts an unconscious patient being slowly pulled into the mouth of a macabre death mask
the death 's head resembles the opening of a @entity13 scan machine , a symbol of modern medical technology
it is the work of dr. @entity17 , the man who bore the notorious nickname " @entity17
" he was a passionate advocate for allowing certain people to choose the time and manner of their own death
he claimed to have assisted in the suicides for more than 130 patients over a period of nearly 20 years
@entity17 's career ended in 1999 with his conviction on charges of second degree murder for administering a lethal injection to a patient who had @entity33 's disease
he spent eight years in prison
most people though do n't realize that @entity17 was also a longtime painter
eleven of his works of art are on display this month in a trendy @entity0 art gallery
" he was a talented amateur , " curator @entity41 told @entity2
" he painted throughout much of his life
" all 11 paintings are available for purchase
the asking price is as much as $ 45,000 per canvas , @entity41 said
proceeds go to the estate and the gallery , and the paintings that do n't sell are headed to the @entity51 , @entity41 said
the exhibition also includes the assisted suicide machine that @entity17 designed and built , the " @entity54
" the contraption helped inject a series of drugs into terminal and incapacitated patients who wished to end their lives
it too is for sale to the highest bidder , at a starting price of $ 25,000
despite the attention surrounding the macabre suicide machine , the paintings comprise the heart of the show
" paralysis " is typical of the series of paintings that depict some aspect of disease and human suffering
the painting presents an image of a naked man crouched in a claustrophobic prison
half his body has been turned to stone
his limbs are crumbling and useless
his brain has been removed and shackled , his body unable to respond to its commands
other paintings comment satirically on what @entity17 viewed as the hypocrisy of the medical code of ethics
he once called efforts to prosecute him " a political lynching , engineered by the @entity91
" portraits of @entity17 's parents and one of @entity96 composer @entity95 reflect an homage to those who influenced his life
efforts to sell the paintings following @entity17 's death in 2011 were hampered by a legal dispute over their ownership
for many years , they were housed in the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , near @entity109
after his death , the @entity17 estate claimed the art work was only on loan to the museum
the dispute was resolved with the museum retaining four of his works
@entity17 's niece is now offering the paintings in her possession for sale at @entity122
@entity17 told @entity2 's dr. @entity123 in 2010 that serving eight years in prison had not changed his view of assisted suicide
" it 's a medical service , " @entity17 stated , " it 's not political
" are his paintings great art ? well , that is in the eye of the beholder
but they continue to speak to dr. @entity17 's battle against the medical and legal establishment
a battle that continues , even in death .
