@entity2 -- " @entity1 " @entity1 has sold the movie rights to his life story to @entity6 , a studio spokesman said thursday

as part of a plea deal , @entity1 agreed to give up any profits that may come from book or movie deals on his story
his attorney , @entity22 , has said his client wants any such money to go to the victims
@entity1 is estimated to owe more than $ 1.4 million in restitution
@entity1 led law enforcement on a wild ride across nine states and three countries
he stole , flew and crashed five airplanes
his final journey took him across eight states , leaving behind a trail of home and business break - ins and stolen cars
surveillance video shows him taking off in a stolen plane from @entity40 , @entity41 , heading to the @entity15
@entity1 lasted a few more days before police stopped him by shooting up a stolen boat while @entity1 was stuck on a sand bar
@entity1 's plea deal is expected to result in a 10 - year prison term when he is sentenced in late october
he also faces an assortment of state charges
@entity3 's @entity49 and @entity50 contributed to this report .
