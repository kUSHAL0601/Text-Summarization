-- an @entity2 high court ruled friday that a quadriplegic man has the right to refuse food and water and can be allowed to die , a rare legal finding that some see as a major victory for right - to - die campaigners
an @entity2 high court ruled friday that @entity12 has the right to refuse food and water
the ruling means that the nursing facility in which @entity12 has lived since november 2008 can not be held criminally liable for allowing the patient to die , the @entity14 said
" i 'm happy that i won my right to die , " @entity12 , 49 , said afterward
but he added that he will further consult with a doctor because he may change his mind
a leading @entity2 right - to - die advocate called the ruling a significant victory
" i do n't know that many people will want to die this way
but for people who do , it 's a very important decision , " said dr. @entity25 , founder and director of @entity27 , a leading global voluntary euthanasia and end - of - life advocacy group
@entity25 noted that @entity12 's case is significant because his mind is fully functional
" this is the first time that it 's come up with a person that 's rational and lucid , " @entity25 told @entity0
" chief justice @entity38 noted that distinction in his order , saying , " mr. @entity12 is not a child , nor is he terminally ill , nor dying
he is not in a vegetative state , nor does he lack the capacity to communicate his wishes
there is therefore no question of other persons making decisions on his behalf
" rather , this is a case in which a person with full mental capacity and the ability to communicate his wishes has indicated that he wishes to direct those who have assumed responsibility for his care to discontinue the provision of treatment which maintains his existence
" some family and right - to - life groups opposed @entity12 's request
" really , what we should be doing is looking after each other rather than facilitating an escape , " @entity63 of the @entity64 said in a tv interview
@entity70 , president of @entity72 's @entity71 , said , " the law which is being applied can be a dangerous precedent
" @entity12 has suffered a series of injuries since 1988 that have left him with limited foot movement and the ability to wriggle only one finger
he is fed through a stomach tube
he relies on staff at the @entity84 nursing facility in the city of @entity86 for such routine care as regular turning , cleaning , assistance with bowel movements , physical and occupational therapy and speech pathology
@entity2 law gives patients the right to refuse life - saving treatment , but helping someone commit suicide is a crime that can carry a life prison sentence
the @entity103 nursing facility sought the ruling to make sure it would not be held liable if it complied with @entity12 's request to stop all nutrition and hydration , except to be given enough liquid to make it possible to take pain medication
@entity12 attended the hearing in a wheelchair , breathing through a tracheotomy tube in his throat
he told the judge he wants to die
it 's a point he has been making publicly
" i ca n't move , " @entity12 said in a televised interview this week
" i ca n't even wipe the tears from my eyes
and i 'd like to die
i 'm imprisoned in my own body
i have no fear of death
" @entity12 pointed out in a recent interview with the @entity128 news outlet that he once led an active life
" this is living hell , " he is quoted as saying
" i used to be a cyclist , i used to be a keen walker
i bushwalked around the world
... i 've rock climbed in @entity135 in @entity136 up very steep cliffs
i 've got a degree in economics and now i ca n't even read a newspaper , i ca n't turn the pages
" @entity12 joined the @entity27 right - to - death organization about three months ago , said @entity25 , who talked with him before the hearing
@entity25 said @entity12 appeared " very happy " afterward
a @entity103 executive said the company appreciates that the court 's ruling has relieved the nursing facility of any liability
" the whole organization has been most concerned for mr. @entity12 but also concerned for our own legal standing and this has clarified things greatly , " said @entity150 , the company 's chief executive
while hailing the victory , @entity25 decried the fact that @entity12 will have to undergo a slow and painful death through starvation , rather than having a quicker and painless way to end his life
because he can not use his hands , @entity12 must rely on others to withhold treatment rather than being able to take his own life
@entity166 has an assisted suicide law , and @entity12 has considered going there
" it 's a bit sad that the best that @entity72 can come up with , " @entity25 said , " is that we can let a person like that starve to death
