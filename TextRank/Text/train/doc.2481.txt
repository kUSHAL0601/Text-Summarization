@entity0 -- negative attacks are as @entity3 as apple pie
since the early days of the republic , candidates attacked with a vigor that contemporary strategists would admire
in the 1800 presidential election , for example , @entity9 and @entity10 criticized one another with a stunning ferocity on everything from foreign and domestic policy to private character and personal behavior
later campaigns were n't much better
critics of @entity21 in 1836 accused him of murdering @entity22
in 1884 , @entity23 was ridiculed for fathering an illegitimate child
@entity25 was characterized as a dangerous radical in 1896 who would ruin the economy
despite these historical precedents , the 2008 campaign has reached all - time lows in the use of misleading and inaccurate political appeals
even @entity33 , the architect of negative ads in previous campaigns , has complained about the tenor of this year 's campaign
@entity38 broadcast an ad taking @entity41 's words out of context and suggesting @entity43 were trying to compare @entity45 vice presidential nominee @entity44 to a pig
the @entity38 campaign ran another spot erroneously claiming @entity41 favored comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners
@entity43 have not been above reproach either
after @entity38 secured the @entity45 nomination this spring , outside groups falsely claimed the @entity45 supported a 1,000 - year war in @entity55 and therefore was not worthy of the presidency
these misleading appeals suggest voters must remain vigilant about candidate , party , and group claims
generally , the most misleading commercials have come from independent groups uncoordinated with the candidates
these organizations feel free to run emotional and inaccurate content designed to play on voter 's fears and anxieties
some of the worst ads in recent memory , such as the @entity73 ad in 1988 , have been broadcast by these kinds of groups
in past years , the only upside of attack ads was that they generally contained more issue content than other types of ads. since reporters police campaign appeals , the ads generally stick to the issues and rely on factually - accurate information
ad sponsors and candidates realize they will be held accountable for unfair ad content
however , commercials run this year represent a break with this general pattern
attack ads broadcast in recent months have twisted the truth , lied about personal background , taken statements out of context , and clearly sought to manipulate voter sentiments
most worrisome from a factual standpoint is @entity38 's claim that @entity41 will raise taxes on the middle class
although @entity41 has pledged to increase income taxes on those earning more than $ 250,000 , he has been careful not to make proposals that would raise taxes on the middle class for fear of being labeled a tax - and - spend liberal
@entity38 's tax claims have been condemned by leading editorial boards and surely will attract considerable attention in upcoming debates
with all the factual inaccuracies that have taken place , voters need to protect themselves from efforts at political manipulation
non-partisan web sites such as www.factcheck.org represent one source of unbiased information
they analyze ads and compile factual information in support of or in opposition to ad claims
other trustworthy fact - checkers include ad watches and reality checks run by leading news organizations
these features dissect candidate claims in regard to accuracy , strategy , and impact
but the best thing for voters to do is to watch the candidate debates and judge for themselves
study the statements and the factual bases of policy claims
pay attention to how the candidates speak and what they say
find out what non-partisan groups think and see what they have to say regarding the major issues
by the time the campaign is over , the presidential candidates are expected to have spent 55 percent of their overall budget on ads. strategists put together spots very carefully and pre-test major messages on small groups of voters
most of this money will be devoted to television spots
but increasingly amounts are being targeted on radio , direct mail , and internet appeals
in the end , voters are going to have to decipher competing charges and counter-charges amid considerable noise from all sides
the 2008 election is unusual in having so many big issues on the agenda : the economy , the @entity55 and @entity176 wars , health care , taxes , immigration , education and climate change
it is an election that truly matters because of the stark differences between the parties and the closeness of the campaign
voters need to pay serious attention to the facts in order to make a wise choice
