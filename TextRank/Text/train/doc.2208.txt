@entity0 -- @entity3 's alleged lie to a police officer investigating a car crash last june could send the actress back to jail next month
but confusion surrounds the question of who will defend @entity3 , 26 , when she goes on trial february 27 after her longtime lawyer received a letter saying she was fired
" do you still represent ms. @entity3 ? " @entity15 commissioner @entity14 asked attorney @entity16 in a hearing tuesday
" yes , at this point , yes , " said @entity18 , who has guided @entity3 through dozens of court appearances over the last several years
" we 've got to get the representation issue nailed down , " @entity21 said
" the representation issue will be nailed down , " @entity18 affirmed
celebrity news website @entity25 reported the letter to @entity18 came from an attorney in @entity30
@entity3 , who was not required to attend tuesday 's arraignment , must be in court january 30 when the judge and lawyers prepare for next month 's trial
she faces four misdemeanor charges relating to the traffic accident , but the most serious threat to @entity3 's freedom is the probation revocation that the arrest triggered
she could be sent to jail for up to 245 days for violating her probation for a shoplifting conviction
@entity18 entered a " not guilty " plea on @entity3 's behalf
the actress was put on probation after she was convicted in 2011 on charges related to the theft of a necklace
@entity3 : the reality show we do n't want to watch but then last summer , she crashed her car in @entity55
authorities said not only was she driving recklessly , she also gave false information to a police officer and then resisted a police officer
the @entity55 city attorney filed four misdemeanor charges against her , prompting a @entity15 commissioner to revoke @entity3 's probation last month
the case is just one in a long list of legal trouble for the actress , whose struggle with drugs and alcohol has seen her bounce in and out of court 19 times and to five rehabilitation facilities since 2007
in november , she was charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly punching a woman at a @entity79 nightclub
in the @entity55 case , @entity3 is accused of telling police her assistant was driving the @entity83 , while witnesses told investigators they saw @entity3 behind the wheel
the crash took place while @entity3 was on her way to the set for the filming of " @entity92
" her performance in the made - for - tv movie about the tumultuous relationship between @entity96 and @entity97 was universally panned
critics called it a different kind of wreck .
