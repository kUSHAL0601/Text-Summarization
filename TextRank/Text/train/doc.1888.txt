-- congratulations : if you 're reading this , you have electricity
unfortunately , more than 3 million @entity5 this weekend could n't join you
the sweltering heat wave that roasted the eastern @entity5 was accompanied by terrible storms that have knocked out power lines up and down the seaboard
while you enjoy your air conditioning , you might want to take a minute to consider : why do @entity5 tolerate such outages ? outages are not inevitable
the @entity14 power grid has outages at an average rate of 21 minutes per year
millions still without power amid record heat wave the winds may howl
but in @entity14 , the lights stay on
there 's no teutonic engineering magic to this impressive record
it 's achieved by a very simple decision : @entity14 buries almost all of its low - voltage and medium - voltage power lines , the lines that serve individual homes and apartments
americans could do the same
they have chosen not to
the choice has been made for reasons of cost
the industry rule of thumb is that it costs about 10 times as much to bury wire as to string wire overhead : up to $ 1 million per mile , industry representatives claim
since @entity5 cities are much less dense than @entity44 ones , there would be a lot more wire to string to serve a @entity5 population than a @entity44 one
but now reflect : 1
there 's reason to think that industry estimates of the cost of burying wires are inflated
while the @entity5 industry guesstimates costs , a large - scale study of the problem conducted recently in the @entity57 estimated the cost premium at 4.5 to 5.5 times the cost of overhead wire , not 10
@entity5 cost figures are a moving target
@entity5 cities are becoming denser as the baby boomers age and opt for central - city living , as i discussed in a previous column
denser cities require fewer miles of wire to serve their populations
costs can only be understood in relation to benefits
as the climate warms , storms and power outages are becoming more common
and as the population ages , power failures become more dangerous
in @entity83 , where air conditioning is uncommon , a 2003 heat wave left 10,000 people dead , almost all of them elderly
if burying power lines prevented power outages during the hotter summers ahead , the decision could save many lives

as you may have heard , we 're suffering very severe unemployment just at present
joblessness is acute among less educated workers , many of whom used to work in the now severely depressed construction industry
burying power lines is a project that could put many hundreds of thousands of the unemployed to work at tasks that make use of their skills and experience
meanwhile , the federal government is able to borrow vast sums of money at the lowest interest rates since the @entity112
the @entity114 stimulus has to date failed to produce many projects of lasting benefit to the country
but here 's one that our children and grandchildren would appreciate -- and that might save our parents ' lives
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .
