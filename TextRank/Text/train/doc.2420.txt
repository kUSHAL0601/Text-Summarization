vice president @entity1 has apologized to president @entity2 for putting him in a tough position that led to @entity2 's announcement that he now supports same - sex marriage , senior administration officials said thursday
@entity2 said in an interview that aired thursday on @entity7 that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after @entity1 's weekend remark that he was " absolutely comfortable " with letting gays and lesbians marry
two senior administration officials said @entity1 and @entity2 met wednesday morning , and @entity1 apologized for putting @entity2 in a tough spot
@entity2 responded by saying that he knew @entity1 was speaking from the heart , said the officials , who did n't want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president
@entity1 's remarks on @entity21 's " @entity20 " on sunday launched a controversy that led to @entity2 announcing that his position on same - sex marriage , which he had previously called " evolving , " had shifted to support
when @entity2 's full interview aired thursday , he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of @entity1 's comments
" i had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention , " @entity2 said on @entity7 's " @entity34
" @entity1 " probably got out a little bit over his skis , but out of generosity of spirit , " he said
he added that he would have " preferred to have done this in my own way , on my own terms , " but " all 's well that ends well
" separately , @entity1 spokeswoman @entity44 said @entity2 " has been the leader on this issue from day one , and the vice president never intended to distract from that
" once @entity1 's comments drew attention to the issue , @entity2 made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the @entity7 talk show " @entity57 , " a senior administration official said thursday
the president and his advisers knew @entity2 would be asked about the issue in the wake of @entity1 's @entity21 interview , said the official , who did n't want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions
ultimately , they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the @entity7 interview at the @entity68 , the official said
and a top @entity69 told @entity70 that @entity2 knew the issue would come up at the convention , partly because of a push for support for same - sex marriage to be included in the @entity77 platform , and in debates
multiple top @entity77 told @entity70 the president 's senior aides are annoyed with @entity1 for forcing the conversation on same - sex marriage now
one source said @entity1 has , in the past , counseled the president against coming out for same - sex marriage , making this move that much more frustrating
but the sources said they do n't believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders
@entity1 is known to go off - script , something @entity2 knew when he selected his vice president
in explaining to @entity7 how his position has evolved , @entity2 noted that his daughters @entity95 and @entity97 have " friends whose parents are same - sex couples
it would n't dawn on them that somehow their friends ' parents would be treated differently
and frankly that 's the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective , not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law
" asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year , @entity2 said it would " be hard to argue that somehow this is something that i 'd be doing for political advantage
because frankly , you know , the politics -- it 's not clear how they cut
" the interview aired the same day @entity2 attended a fundraiser in @entity128 , where support for same - sex marriage is strong
movie star @entity131 hosted the event , which is raking in $ 15 million , according to a top @entity77 source
and on monday , openly gay singer @entity134 is hosting a fundraising event for @entity2 in @entity136
but some in the @entity140 - @entity139 community have expressed strong disapproval of @entity2 's endorsement of same - sex marriage
a @entity77 official said the @entity68 has been actively reaching out to @entity139 community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president 's decision , but the official noted that even the president 's base wo n't always agree with him on everything
" there are going to be issues you do n't agree on , " the official said
and @entity2 told @entity7 he wo n't spend much time talking about the issue , because he 's focused on the economy
the announcement puts @entity2 squarely at odds with presumptive @entity163 presidential nominee @entity162 , who has since reiterated his opposition to same - sex marriage
" and i do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name , " @entity162 said during a wednesday visit to @entity167 , @entity168
" my view is the domestic partnership benefits , hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate , but that the others are not
" the issue is a divisive one in @entity139 politics , but it 's uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth
a @entity182 released tuesday indicated 50 % of @entity183 believe same - sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid , with 48 % saying such marriages should not be legal -- a dramatic shift from a few years ago
a @entity182 poll in 2009 found 40 % supported same - sex marriage and 57 % were opposed
but a @entity70 / @entity191 poll , taken in late march , indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people 's opinions of the most - important issues facing the country
@entity2 said he supports states deciding the issue on their own , but added that he was " disappointed " by tuesday 's vote on the issue in @entity204 , where a ban on same - sex marriage was added to the constitution
@entity2 called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians , a spokesman said earlier wednesday
six states -- @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity136 -- and the @entity218 issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples , while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union
in february , @entity227 gov. @entity226 signed a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage beginning in june , but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue
@entity236 gov. @entity235 signed into law a bill that permits the state 's same - sex couples to wed as of january 1 , and state residents may vote to affirm such a law
@entity243 will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in @entity204 , while @entity245 will have a referendum on allowing same - sex marriage
meanwhile , two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice , one from @entity251 and another from @entity212 , could be headed to the @entity183 @entity252 in coming months .
