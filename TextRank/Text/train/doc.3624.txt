the @entity10 , a winner of the @entity13 event in 2008 , became the first woman to not concede a single game in her first two matches at a grand slam since 1985
@entity1 lost to world no. 1 @entity19 in last year 's final , but she already looks well placed to go one better in 2013 ahead of a fourth round encounter with @entity22 's @entity21
former world no. 1 @entity5 has endured a tough time since winning her most recent grand slam title in 2008
she was forced to withdraw from the 2011 @entity26 having been diagnosed with the auto immune disorder @entity29 's syndrome
" i was a really determined player out there because i knew the tennis she 's capable of producing and playing , " @entity1 told reporters
" despite what she 's ranked or seeded , it does n't matter when you go out on the court
" she 's experienced enough to know no matter if you 're playing the third round , the quarters or the final , you have to be ready
since the draw came out , i was really looking forward to that match - up
" it was a good day for the top seeds in the women 's draw , with @entity52 no. 6 seed @entity50 easing past @entity54 no. 27 @entity55 6 - 4 6 - 1
@entity50 , who became @entity57 's first grand slam singles champion when she triumphed at the @entity59 , remains on course for a semifinal meeting with @entity1 , provided she can progress from her round four match with 18th seed @entity63
fourth seed @entity66 was rarely troubled as she beat @entity67 no. 1 @entity68 6 - 3 6 - 1
the 2012 @entity71 runner - up will now play former world no. 1 @entity72 , who advanced from an all - @entity74 encounter with @entity75
@entity77 @entity76 ended @entity80 rookie @entity79 ' run at her first grand slam
the fifth seed progressed courtesy of a 6 - 2 7 - 5 success
in the men 's draw , top seed @entity85 was made to work on his way to a 6 - 4 6 - 3 7 - 5 win against @entity91 @entity90
next up for the defending champion is @entity94 @entity93 after the no. 15 got the better of @entity80 @entity95
" i was n't expecting an easy match coming into the third round and playing a seeded player , " @entity85 told a post-match press conference , on the same day he also condemned former seven - time @entity98 winner @entity97
" ( @entity90 ) loves the big stage
you saw how much fun he had
i also had a lot of fun playing
it was a very entertaining match
" @entity85 's fellow @entity74 @entity108 was made to work for his spot in round four
the world no. 8 came from two sets to one down to win 3 - 6 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 3 in a match which lasted three - and - a - half - hours
fourth seed @entity115 and @entity117 both continued their strong starts to the tournament
