-- political groups and campaigns hoping to sway voters on the health care issue have spent about $ 70 million on health - themed tv ads since january 2011 , according to a @entity0 analysis of ad spending data
what the health care ruling means to you the @entity13 @entity12 is expected to rule thursday on the constitutionality of president @entity16 's signature legislation , the @entity15
according to the data , which is tracked by @entity18 , one of the groups that spent the most is @entity21 , which funneled about $ 10.3 million into ads in favor of the law
@entity25 , director of health and family advocacy at @entity21 , says the group remains supportive of the legislation -- which was signed into law in march 2010 -- because it is hugely beneficial to his organization 's members
timeline of the health care law " we lobbied for its passage and we continue to comment on the regulations and implementation , " @entity25 said
" the law does outstanding things for seniors and for our younger members
we are excited about the closure of the @entity46 doughnut hole coverage gap with medications
we are excited about free preventive services and wellness benefits and the provision that eliminates the pre-existing conditions barrier and high premiums , and it has ended a good deal of fraud that had happened within the system
" but @entity21 's pro-reform ads were largely an exception , the data shows
most groups ' health care ads were soundly opposed to the law
@entity64 's conservative @entity63 spent the most among all groups and campaigns -- $ 14.98 million -- on ads that ran 22,004 times
the @entity13 @entity68 bought the second highest number of spots , spending more than $ 8.3 million to run ads against the legislation more than 13,000 times
the @entity74 , which characterizes itself as the conservative alternative to @entity21 , spent $ 1.6 million on 2,861 spots
@entity77 , spokesman for @entity78 , said their ads are designed told hold candidates who supported the law " accountable for their vote
" " our goal with the ads is to create an environment where repealing the legislation or replacing it with more free - market principals is possible , " he said
basics : health care reform issues " and frankly the president has a huge soapbox by which he can promote what he says are the benefits of this legislation , and the only way the opposition can push back is through ads. " @entity102 , senior director of communications for the @entity13 chamber , says her organization 's effort is focused on electing a pro-business @entity107
" we 've engaged earlier and more aggressively than ever in our 100 - year history , " she told @entity0 in an e-mail
@entity102 characterized the ads as part of the chamber 's " unprecedented voter education efforts to highlight candidates ' positions on issues critical to the @entity13 recovery , " including the health care law and other " job - killing regulations
" " this is a multi-dimensional process that is not focused on @entity124 vs. @entity125 , but lawmakers who support free enterprise vs. those who instead choose big government , " she said
among the candidates , @entity16 's campaign spent $ 3.46 million on 8,211 spots , and presumptive @entity124 nominee @entity133 spent $ 3.8 million on 7,181 spots
@entity135 , the independent super pac supporting @entity16 's reelection bid , spent $ 2.57 million on 5,193 spots
restore our @entity138 , the independent super pac supporting @entity133 , spent $ 1.36 million on 3,589 spots
@entity142 ) among @entity149 and @entity150 candidates , @entity143 -- the conservative @entity124 who hopes to fill the seat being vacated by retiring @entity147 @entity125 sen. @entity146 -- spent about $ 500,000 on some 2,200 health care - themed spots
his ad asks , " why am i leading the fight to stop president @entity16 's health care law ? just look at the unconstitutional power grab of a federal mandate that forces you to buy certain kinds of insurance
" @entity146 's was the 60th and final vote needed to block a @entity124 filibuster against the health care bill , which passed in the @entity149 largely along party lines in december 2009
@entity166 , an @entity167 psychology professor who wrote " the political brain , " said the ad debate is about much more than health care
" if i were a @entity124 candidate i would fill the airwaves with attack ads against @entity15 , just like they are doing , because this is one of the weakest links for this administration , " @entity166 said
" this was probably one of the most poorly managed messaging campaigns from a president in @entity13 history , " he said
" here was his signature issue in the first term that was supposed to be his strength , but his administration did a bad job selling it , and even those who benefit from the legislation do n't realize they do because the @entity16 administration never explained it well
" @entity166 says much of the problem was the way the @entity15 was constructed
the provision that would matter most to people , he says , wo n't kick in until 2014 -- when 30 million people would be able to get health care without being denied insurance due to pre-existing conditions
the delay in implementing that provision , @entity166 says , let conservative groups run ads against the law before @entity13 experienced its benefits
" the @entity16 administration had this extremely naÃ ¯ ve idea that a good idea would sell itself , and that it was a waste of time to talk to the @entity13 people , " @entity166 said
" instead , they let the right dominate the airwaves about this debate
when the administration finally started to fight back right before the midterm elections in 2010 , it was too late
it just looked like sour grapes
" no matter what decision the @entity13 @entity12 reaches on the legislation , he says , expect to see more ads on health care in the future
by the numbers : health insurance
