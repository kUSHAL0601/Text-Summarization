the discovery of three young women missing for a decade in @entity2 immediately raised the hopes of the family of a fourth missing woman
after all , @entity6 was just like two of the three discovered women : @entity2 teenagers who all disappeared within five blocks of each other over a four - year span
the anticipation for @entity6 ' family was heightened momentarily when authorities said they had yet to identify one of the three discovered women
was it @entity6 ? could it be @entity6 , who went missing almost six years ago at age 14 ? " at first , when they said the third girl was n't identified , i was hoping one would be @entity6 , " said her aunt , @entity20
@entity6 ' mother expressed similar emotions
" she said , ' oh , my @entity27 ' -- just hoping it was @entity6 , " @entity20 , 30 , said of her sister @entity25 , 33 , who was n't immediately available for interviews tuesday
but the third woman held in captivity for a decade was someone else , not @entity6 , authorities announced
" i was upset , but i was happy at the same time that they found the third girl , " @entity20 said
now the @entity6 family is hoping that the investigation into the three women 's decade - long captivity will yield information about @entity6 , who disappeared on july 6 , 2007
" we 're hoping that it 's connected , and they knew where she was , " @entity6 said of the investigation
" we 're hoping for a miracle
" investigators questioned three brothers about @entity6 , but police said wednesday they had no new leads
only one brother , @entity50 , will be charged in the kidnappings , police said
" there is no new information that 's come to light about her : @entity6 is an active , open investigation , " @entity56 deputy chief @entity55 told reporters wednesday
" i can assure you that her disappearance was part of our questioning of the three subjects that we brought in
" investigators will speak to the three discovered women to see if they know anything about @entity6 ' disappearance , said special agent @entity71 , of the @entity73 @entity72
the discovery of the three women might prompt someone who has information -- but never said anything -- to call authorities , she said
" we 're really very dependent on the public 's assistance on things such as this , for them to be aware of people around them , to report things that are suspicious , to take a look at the pictures of these individuals who are missing and see if they recognize them , " @entity79 said
since @entity6 disappeared , " there 's been no legitimate sightings , no accessing social media , anything , " @entity79 said
former @entity73 agent @entity97 said authorities have long believed in a link in the disappearances of @entity6 and two of the women discovered this week -- @entity50 and @entity50
@entity97 is now a case manager at the @entity103 , which in 2008 held a comprehensive review of the cases with the @entity73 and @entity2 police
" we did in fact believe there was an association between the @entity112 case and the @entity114 case as well as the @entity6 case , " @entity97 said
in 2009 , @entity116 reported how the @entity73 was investigating connections between the three missing @entity2 teens
" we kind of put all three of these cases together to work them to see if there 's any connection , " @entity73 special agent @entity120 , in the agency 's @entity72 , said then
at the time , authorities said @entity6 was initially reported as a runaway after a family argument
problem was , she never contacted her family again , authorities said
" she 's considered an endangered juvenile who may have been a runaway and possibly abducted , " @entity79 said
the @entity6 family is also renewing their efforts to publicize @entity6 's disappearance
the @entity73 's missing person website says @entity6 has a tattoo of " @entity139 " enclosed in a heart on her upper arm , and her birthday is june 16 , 1993 , making her 19 years old
@entity25 , a restaurant cook , has seven other children , whose ages range from 2 to 16 , and @entity6 is her oldest , said @entity20 , a shipping clerk who lives in @entity145 , @entity146
@entity20 last saw her niece two weeks before she disappeared
" she just hanged around the house and talked about her boyfriend and the usual stuff , " @entity20 said
" she actually wanted to move in with me , and i said yeah , but she never came
" @entity6 left her mother 's home , where four younger siblings were then also living , and instead moved to her great - uncle 's residence , so she could be closer to friends , @entity20 said
