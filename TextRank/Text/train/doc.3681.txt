-- " let @entity0 sort it out
" that is @entity5 's succinct argument against @entity7 intervention into @entity8
and i have to be honest : i 'm impressed with @entity5 on this one
not with her horribly callous recommendation , made via @entity12 late last week , but because she appears to speak some @entity13
i 'm not saying @entity5 is fluent in the language , but she did use the @entity13 word " @entity0
" she could 've simply used the word " @entity18 " instead of @entity0 since it has the identical meaning
( @entity19 use the word @entity0 when speaking of @entity18 in @entity13
) i think deep down she wanted to show off her language skills
could @entity5 know even more arabic ? she did go on to say that both sides fighting in @entity8 are , " shouting ' @entity23 ' at each other
" she could 've easily translated " @entity23 " into @entity26 , noting that the combatants were screaming , " @entity18 is great
" or as sen. @entity27 remarked tuesday on @entity28 , " @entity23 " is no different than an @entity29 saying , " thank @entity18
" opinion : @entity31 should n't bail out @entity33 's floundering foreign policy but @entity5 went with the @entity13
why ? because i think deep down she loves the language
and i bet @entity5 knows even more @entity13 words such as humus , falafel and possibly babaganoush
so , let 's get back to her statement , " let @entity0 sort them out
" now , there is a possibility that @entity5 believes that @entity44 worship a different @entity18 than @entity45 and @entity46
if she does , is she 's actually saying that we should sit back and revel in watching @entity44 slaughter each other ? could that be her barbaric message ? possibly
but my cynical side tells me that @entity5 was just trying to use inflammatory language to get attention
( i know what you 're saying : " no , our @entity5 would never do that
" ) but let 's not forget what @entity5 said about president @entity33 's comments on @entity60 : " @entity33 's shuck and jive shtick with these @entity64 lies must end
" @entity5 was roundly criticized for using " shuck and jive , " which is a term dating back to 1870s and was originally a " @entity68 ' expression for clowning , lying , pretense
" @entity5 denied she was being racially insensitive in using that phrase
was it just an inadvertent slip or a ploy to draw media coverage ? so what 's the genesis of @entity5 's statement , " let @entity0 sort it out " ? the big debate : should @entity7 strike @entity8 ? well , it appears to be based on the infamous phrase : " kill them all , let @entity18 sort them out
" this term reportedly comes from the time of the @entity88
you know , those " holy wars " waged by @entity45 that @entity5 might refer to in her @entity13 as a " jihad
" however , this expression was not coined in a battle between @entity44 and @entity45
rather , legend has it that it was uttered by a @entity97 monk in the 13th century as @entity98 were about to lay siege to the @entity101 city of @entity102 , a town filled with @entity104 , who were considered heretics to the @entity107
when the monk in charge of the assault , @entity112 , was asked by the military commander how to distinguish between heretics and @entity45 , the monk responded : " kill them all , @entity18 will know his own
" consequently , 20,000 people were slaughtered , including women and children
it 's unclear if @entity5 comprehends the origins of the phrase she used , but what 's abundantly clear is that she believes that the @entity7 should do nothing while people are being slaughtered in @entity8
i 'm not sure to what @entity18 she prays , but i can assure her that the @entity18 of @entity45 , jews and @entity44 demands more than silence in the face of mass killings -- some 100,000 people , including scores of women and children
many of us would prefer a political solution that ends this conflict
opinion : do n't use @entity8 to pump up @entity140 spending former president @entity141 has called for a peace summit to try and end the bloodshed while we await a vote by @entity146 ' on military action in @entity8
regardless of how we end the violence , silence is not a morally acceptable option
in the future , if @entity5 is going to show off her @entity13 vocabulary , it 's my hope that she does n't use it to encourage the world to turn a blind eye as innocent people are butchered
instead , she might use an @entity13 word such as " salaam , " which means " peace , " and encourages people to support a policy that brings an end to the fighting
after all , peace means the same thing in every language
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .
