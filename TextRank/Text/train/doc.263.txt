" all @ jessetyler did was pass wind
" the actors tweeted a photo of themselves in the elevator , and @entity9 also posted a short video at the 35 - minute mark of the whole elevator shouting " get us out ! " @entity13 firemen eventually came to the rescue and got everyone out with a ladder around 10 p.m. friday , @entity17 reported
" finally made it out of the stuck elevator at the one hour mark
at least the firemen in @entity13 are cute , " tweeted @entity9
