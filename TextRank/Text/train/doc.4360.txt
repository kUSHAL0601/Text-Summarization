on tuesday , @entity1 's affiliate in @entity2 announced that it had merged with the @entity4 opposition group @entity3 to form the " @entity5
" the announcement came in the form of an audio message from the leader of @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity10 , that was distributed to key jihadist websites
the merger was first reported by @entity13 , a @entity14 - based group that tracks jihadist material online
the authors were able to confirm the announcement by monitoring the jihadist site , @entity19 , which frequently posts material from @entity1 , including tuesday 's news of the merger of the @entity4 and @entity2 wings of @entity1
complicating matters , on wednesday @entity3 claimed it was n't merging with @entity1 's affiliate in @entity2 , but instead was pledging its allegiance to @entity1 's overall leadership
the news that there is some kind of connection between @entity1 in @entity2 and the @entity4 @entity3 ( in @entity33 " the @entity32 " ) is not entirely surprising
@entity35 officials have long suspected that @entity3 was really , in part , a front for @entity2 jihadists who had crossed the @entity4 border to join the fight against @entity4 president @entity41
the @entity42 added @entity3 to its list of designated foreign terrorist organizations in december
the fact that @entity3 has publicly aligned itself with central @entity1 is worrisome
a long - term safe haven for this group in @entity4 could be the prelude for the formation of an organization with the wherewithal to attack the @entity52 , just as @entity1 's sojourn in @entity54 when it was controlled by the @entity55 prepared the group for the 9/11 attacks
second , @entity3 is widely regarded as the most effective fighting force in @entity4 , and its thousands of fighters are the most disciplined of the forces opposing @entity41
@entity3 is also the first @entity1 affiliate to take a page out of @entity63 's book and operate not only as an effective fighting force but also as a large - scale provider of services , for instance , distributing enormous quantities of desperately needed bread in the areas of @entity4 that the group controls
finally , @entity3 is the first jihadist group for many years that has chosen to merge with @entity1 at a time when it is having significant success on the battlefield
@entity1 's @entity77 franchise , @entity76 , as well as the @entity79 - based @entity78 , both announced their affiliation with @entity1 only when they were struggling for resources and exposure
while @entity3 is enjoying real battlefield success in @entity4 , it is formally allying itself to @entity78 at a time of great weakness for the global terrorist organization
the announcement of the merger with @entity3 provides @entity1 's leaders , now headed by the @entity91 dr. @entity90 , the chance to prove they are still relevant
@entity1 has received severe blows in recent years : a contingent of @entity96 killed the group 's leader , @entity97 , two years ago , while @entity100 drone strikes have decimated @entity1 's ranks in @entity103 's tribal regions , and the group has n't pulled off an attack in the @entity106 since the suicide bombings on the @entity109 transportation system in 2005
@entity110 , the leader of @entity1 in @entity2 , said that he had delayed the announcement of the formal merger with @entity3 because he wanted to allow @entity4 time to get to know @entity3 on its own terms , without the inherent negative bias that would be caused by an early announcement of its ties to @entity1
had @entity3 voiced its links to @entity1 during the rebellion 's nascent stages , @entity41 would have had an easier time blaming the uprising on " terrorists " as he has done since violence first broke out in @entity4 in march 2011
@entity4 is in its third year of a bitter civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 70,000 people , and wide swaths of the population support the opposition
in these circumstances , if @entity3 continues to fight effectively against @entity41 , @entity4 are not , at least for the moment , likely to care too much about what the group 's broader ideological leanings are
for @entity3 the gains of a public announcement of its alliance with @entity1 are far from clear
in fact , it is likely to be quite counterproductive
according to @entity144 , a @entity145 who meets regularly with the @entity4 opposition and is the head of the @entity150 @entity149 at the @entity151 , the merger announcement may " confirm the suspicions of much of the @entity4 public that @entity3 is not fighting for a free @entity4 , but for the establishment of an ultra-fundamentalist state
" that might explain why the head of @entity3 , @entity155 , claimed in an audio message released on wednesday that he was n't " consulted " on the announcement of the merger of the @entity4 and @entity2 wings of @entity1
@entity155 then stepped on his effort at damage control by announcing his pledge of allegiance to @entity90 , who is , of course , the overall head of @entity1 worldwide
for @entity1 , the advantages of commanding an effective , large - scale fighting force in @entity4 , which is in the heart of the @entity171 world and borders on @entity173 , are all too obvious
the people of @entity4 , however , should have good reason to worry about this ominous development
finally , the announcement that @entity3 has pledged allegiance to @entity1 underlines that the @entity181 administration 's seeming dithering about how exactly to aid the @entity4 opposition makes more sense than it has done hitherto
there clearly are unintended consequences and risks in supporting the @entity4 opposition , which is fractured into hundreds of local groups , some elements of which are hardly supportive of the @entity35
the @entity181 administration decision , reported by @entity192 tuesday , to sign off on a new tranche of nonlethal aid to the rebels in @entity4 is best understood as an effort to bolster the @entity4 opposition groups that are separate from @entity3 and to give them a better fighting chance in what everyone agrees is likely a long @entity4 war in which @entity41 is eventually removed from power -- but only then , unfortunately , does the real fighting for lasting power begin .
