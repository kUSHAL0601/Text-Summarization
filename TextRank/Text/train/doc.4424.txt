two fraternities at the @entity2 say they wo n't sign an agreement dictating new safety procedures after a student 's claim of being gang raped
the policy calls for fraternities to have security at doors , guard their stairs , have keys to each room , sober brothers at parties and to eliminate pre-mixed drinks
in november , the university suspended all fraternities and associated parties until this month after a @entity22 article about the student 's claims
despite scrutiny of the article 's depiction of the alleged rape of a then - @entity2 freshman , identified in the article as @entity32 , the university stuck to its promise to review how sexual assault is handled and to make @entity36 life safer
@entity2 gave its fraternity members until friday to sign the agreement if they wanted to have the suspension lifted
but @entity40 and @entity41 released statements on their national fraternity letterhead saying they would not do so
they said the university unfairly punished members of @entity36 life when it uniformly suspended social activities two days after the @entity22 article was published , and said they are concerned the demands will create new liability and " set a dangerous precedent of an erosion of student and organizational rights
" instead , both fraternities plan to ignore the new rules set by @entity2 and resume activities
the university said the rules were developed by student groups and said it wo n't comment until after the friday deadline for fraternities to sign the agreement has passed
a source familiar with the thinking of the national fraternities said this could result in litigation if @entity2 tries to limit the fraternities that wo n't sign the new agreement
the @entity69 reports that @entity70 is one of the fraternities that signed the agreement and remains committed to improving safety during events
@entity32 told @entity22 that she was assaulted by seven men at a @entity70 party
in the weeks that followed the article , the @entity69 and other news organizations began scrutinizing the details of @entity32 's story
@entity1 spoke to @entity32 's friends , who told a different version of events from that night , and @entity70 produced records that seemed to dispute what she said happened
@entity90 @entity89 investigated after the story was printed , and said earlier this week that police found no " substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the @entity22 article occurred at @entity70
" police have not said whether they believe @entity32 was raped
@entity22 apologized and launched an investigation of its own
the magazine editor acknowledged that the writer never contacted some of the witnesses or any of the accused .
