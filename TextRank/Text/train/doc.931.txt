-- the fight boxing fans have long been clamoring for has moved a step closer , with undefeated @entity3 challenging @entity4 to a showdown on may 5 -- but will it happen ? hopes of the much - anticipated bout dimmed in december when @entity3 , the @entity9 welterweight champion , was sentenced to a 90 - day prison term after being found guilty of domestic violence
however , a @entity13 judge ruled last week that the @entity14 , who has won all 42 of his professional fights ( 26 by knockout ) , could delay reporting to jail until june because he had already lined up a fight in may
and now the 34 - year - old has revealed he wants his opponent to be the @entity23 ' @entity22 champion -- his longtime rival for the title of best pound - for - pound boxer , and a man he failed to agree a deal with in 2010 after insisting on @entity30 - style pre-bout blood testing
@entity3 chose micro-blogging website @entity32 to issue his challenge
" @entity4 i 'm calling you out let 's fight may 5th and give the world what they want to see , " he wrote on tuesday
" my jail sentence was pushed back because the date was locked in
" however , @entity4 -- who retained his @entity22 title in his third meeting with @entity44 in november -- issued a statement via his website saying he does not want to fight on that date
" @entity4 wants to make it clear the fight can happen at the end of may -- @entity4 wants @entity3 to release his grip on may 5th , so the fight can happen for the fans , " wednesday 's statement read
@entity4 has an impressive record , with 54 wins from 59 bouts -- 38 by knockout -- plus three losses and two draws
he is the first man in the sport 's history to have won world titles in eight weight divisions
the 33 - year - old is rated by @entity64 as the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world , with @entity3 second on the 10 - man list following september 's knockout win over compatriot @entity70 in @entity71
@entity4 has also launched a successful political career and was elected into the @entity73 in june 2010 .
