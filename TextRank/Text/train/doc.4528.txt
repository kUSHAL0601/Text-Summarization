@entity0 -- the shocking murder last weekend of 16 @entity4 civilians -- 9 of them children -- by a @entity7 soldier is raising many questions about the war
coming right after the accidental burning of several qurans at a @entity7 base last month , which sparked mass protests across the country , it seems reasonable to ask : what is coming next ? the sad answer is that there probably wo n't be a huge public reaction to the killings
the burning of the @entity12 -- which the @entity7 claims was accidental -- was a fresh outrage to many @entity4
while the @entity24 often claims the @entity7 disrespects @entity25 and wants to destroy it , few @entity4 had any real reason to believe that in their daily lives
the @entity29 burning shocked the @entity4 public enough for some political opportunists to whip up protests in response
in contrast , sunday 's mass murder is not a new outrage for @entity4
while the deliberate killing of civilians is ( thankfully ) rare , many @entity4 do not distinguish between accidental and deliberate civilian death
last may , @entity7 helicopters in @entity41 came under rocket fire from insurgents ; in responding they accidentally fired back at what turned out to be children gathering firewood , killing 9
@entity47 was quick to apologize for the incident , but nevertheless the reaction in @entity50 was angry and resentful : many simply could not believe that children could be accidentally mistaken for insurgents
sunday 's mass killing is still shocking and upsetting -- but it is no longer surprising
sunday 's mass murder , in other words , is not a game - changing event
the game has already changed , and many @entity4 are not surprised when the @entity7 kills a bunch of civilians
@entity61 interviewed some of the survivors and uncovered a darker angle as well : one reason the victims did not resist is that they were used to the so - called " night raids " -- nighttime special operations raids on housing compounds
they were so used to @entity7 kicking in the doors to their homes and even shooting their guns that at first the rampage did n't seem strange
so where does the war go from here ? a huge challenge facing president @entity78 is that the @entity7 is fighting one war while the insurgency is fighting a very different one
the @entity7 war is obsessed with the traditional metrics of warfare : holding territory , killing or capturing bad guys , exacting details of building roads , schools , and hospitals
the insurgency , on the other hand , is obsessed with influence , undermining confidence in the government , and creating the perception that the @entity7 is at war with @entity25
put simply , the @entity7 never put in place the strategic and political framework to make much headway in @entity4
despite the renewed push for negotiations with the @entity24 , there is no political strategy for the country
there is no end state for the war , either -- right now , the plan is to drawdown to about 20,000 troops or so -- similar to troop levels in 2008 -- and stay that way for the indefinite future
that 's not a strategy , and it 's not a plan
because there is no political strategy for the war -- nothing that takes @entity4 and @entity24 politics into consideration -- the @entity7 has no concept of how to manage or react to the political consequences of incidents like sunday 's rampage
that 's why the military was clueless in responding to last month 's @entity29 burnings , or to january 's @entity132 urination scandal , or to the " kill team " in @entity134 last year
at this point , there is little the @entity7 can do to salvage the situation in @entity4
sunday 's mass killing is tragic but it is not a game - changing event
focusing on a long - term commitment to working through @entity4 politics is a good start -- de-emphasizing the military 's role in the conflict and shifting to a politically and socially engaged role would actually address some of these shortcomings
but shifting @entity4 from a military engagement to a political one would , by design , extend @entity7 operations there
an @entity156 - @entity155 poll released monday shows 60 % of @entity7 no longer think the war is worth the costs
from the public 's perspective , the house of cards is falling and the @entity7 would do best to just pull out and cut their losses
ultimately , @entity4 will suffer the consequences -- of sunday 's raid , of the war , of @entity7 's withdrawal from the region
abandoning @entity4 will impose huge costs in @entity4 but the last ten years of directionless fighting has left @entity7 tired and frustrated with a war that seems to go nowhere but down
there needs to be a long - term strategy for the country but , especially now , it probably wo n't happen
