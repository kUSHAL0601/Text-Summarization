the @entity2 diplomat whose arrest sparked a diplomatic row with @entity2 has again been indicted by the federal government and faces arrest if she returns to the @entity7 , federal prosecutors said friday
@entity8 faces one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements for allegedly lying on a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper , according to the indictment filed in a @entity18 federal court friday
an arrest warrant also was issued , said @entity20 , spokeswoman for the @entity7 attorney 's office for the @entity22
the fresh indictment comes just days after the original indictment against @entity8 was dismissed by a federal judge who agreed with her lawyers ' assertion that she was protected under diplomatic immunity at the time of the first indictment
federal prosecutors signaled monday that a new indictment was likely
@entity8 , who left the @entity7 in january , now works for the @entity33 in @entity34
her attorney , @entity35 , declined comment friday
" the government of @entity2 will respond in due course , " he said in a statement
she was originally arrested and strip - searched by federal agents in @entity42 in december 2013
on january 9 , a federal grand jury indicted her on one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements , the same charges she now faces
@entity8 filed a motion to dismiss the charges , claiming she was " cloaked in diplomatic immunity at the time of her arrest , " according to court documents
a federal judge agreed on monday , ruling that @entity8 was " appointed a counselor to the @entity58 of @entity2 to the @entity59 , a position that cloaked her with full diplomatic immunity , " according to court documents
she was appointed to that position on january 8 , one day before her first indictment
" even if @entity8 had no immunity at the time of her arrest and has none now , her acquisition of immunity during the pendency of proceedings mandates dismissal , " @entity7 district judge @entity63 wrote
" the government may not proceed on an indictment obtained when @entity8 was immune from the jurisdiction of the court , " @entity63 ruled
@entity35 on monday said @entity8 was pleased " the rule of law has prevailed
" @entity2 's external affairs spokesman , @entity76 , issued a statement then welcoming the ruling
@entity8 's case drew international attention , with @entity2 officials demanding apologies from @entity83 , and the @entity7 announcing it would withdraw one official from its embassy in @entity34 .
