-- attackers shot a mayor - elect at least five times at a veterinary clinic in a @entity7 border state friday night , officials said
@entity8 was in critical condition at a local hospital after one of the bullets hit him in the head , said @entity14 , a spokesman for the attorney general 's office in @entity16
@entity17 , the mayor - elect of the town of @entity19 , was scheduled to take office october 9
the shooting was the latest in a string of attacks against elected officials in @entity7 , where at least four mayors have been killed in the past two months
a leading gubernatorial candidate also was killed in late june
on thursday , authorities said gunmen killed @entity29 , the mayor of doctor @entity30 , a small town in the border state of @entity33
political parties in @entity7 were quick to condemn the violence
" both events , the latest in a chain of episodes of violence that threaten to destabilize the rule of law in many cities of the country , can not go unpunished and demand an immediate response , " said @entity36 , general secretary of the left - wing @entity37
@entity36 said in a statement that the attacks were " cases that exemplify that the @entity7 political class has once again become cannon fodder due to the inability of the federal government to contain the violence that prevails in our country
" president @entity57 condemned the @entity33 attack
and his @entity59 also issued a statement asking state authorities to investigate and punish those responsible
authorities have said drug cartels were suspected in earlier deaths of the politicians , a relatively recent development in the government 's bloody war on organized crime that has seen more than 28,000 people killed in less than four years
but @entity33 state attorney general @entity72 told reporters friday that the death of @entity75 , who was killed on his ranch thursday , might not be connected with organized crime , state - run news agency @entity71 reported
" the form of operating is not directly how organized crime does it , so we could be dealing with another type of event , " he said .
