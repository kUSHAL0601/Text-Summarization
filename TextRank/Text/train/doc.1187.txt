-- @entity1 is perhaps best known for portraying @entity2 on " @entity3 , 90210 " as well as her former reputation as a @entity6 bad girl
the actress , 39 , has written her first book , " badass : a hard - earned guide to @entity11 with style and ( the @entity14 ) attitude
" " badass " is a self - help tome of sorts with tips on style and a memoir weaved in , but certainly not the tell - all kind
@entity1 owns up to her past mistakes and admits that her " bad girl " reputation was deserved , but she also insists she 's evolved into a badass -- a woman of integrity who is strong , confident , self - aware and compassionate
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 about the book , the importance of maintaining one 's own integrity and , of course , " 90210
" @entity0 : in the book , you talk about how a lot of women act like victims
in what ways do women act like victims when they may not even realize it ? @entity1 : constantly complaining about it being a man 's world is a really good example
if you want to complain about it being a man 's world , then do n't rely on a man to take care of you
if you 're a full - time mom , then that is your job
and that 's a big , big , big job
it 's difficult , and kudos to those who do it because all i can say is ' wow ! ' i have a lot of friends who are full - time moms , and they all work a hell of a lot harder than i do
but it 's the women who are supposedly working out there who complain that it is a man 's world
they get married for a couple of years , then they get divorced , and all of a sudden they 're suing their husbands for a ton of money
its like , are you kidding ? support yourself
women talk about being victims for all sorts of reasons , and we 're only victims of ourselves
that was a lesson i had to learn
i thought that being a woman and being young , in order to be heard i had to be very strong and overbearing and loud and get my point across , and if somebody did n't agree with me , it just meant i had to get harder with it
now i do the opposite
i erase the fact that i 'm a woman , and i 'm not a victim anymore because i 'm happy being a woman , and i think it 's actually going to get me further
if i can turn on some @entity94 charm [ @entity1 is a @entity95 native ] in corporate america -- where , granted , there are a lot of men -- that 's fantastic ! i 'm going to stand out from the 50 other men that work in the office because i 'm different
@entity0 : in light of all the news stories about bullying out there , do you have any advice for maintaining our integrity in the face of bullies and so - called mean girls , be it in the schoolyard , workplace or social situations ? @entity1 : mean girls usually grow up being not so great
... what they 're doing has nothing to do with you , and it has everything to do with them
maybe they 're insecure because you 're breaking new ground , because you 're taking risks in your life and you do n't care what people say , or at least that 's what comes across
it frightens that person , and sometimes , when people are frightened , they react in angry , hostile ways
in order to keep your integrity , you must stay true to yourself and not let bullies get you down
@entity0 : you 're a big proponent of deciding what you stand for and sticking with it
is that harder than it sounds ? @entity1 : not at all
you should know what you believe in and what your convictions are
it 's why i was in training for so long
i was never really wishy - washy , but i 'm very firm in who i am now and firm with being able to be flexible , but my beliefs are my beliefs and there 's definitely nothing wishy - washy about it
@entity0 : you say that being an authentic badass means being a work in progress
how are you a work in progress ? @entity1 : i 'm still a work in progress because i 'm still making mistakes
@entity166 will always make mistakes
it 's just not repeating those mistakes , and hopefully they 're not as horrifying and shameful as some of the earlier mistakes of my youth
to be a true badass , you 're going to make mistakes because you 're constantly evolving , constantly growing and constantly learning new things
@entity0 : do you keep in touch with any of your " @entity3 , 90210 " co-stars ? @entity1 : i do ! @entity180 [ @entity181 , who played @entity182 , ] and i worked together on the new " 90210 , " and we really connected as women now that we 're older
we 've both grown up , and we realized that we like each other
we found a great new relationship within each other
and i just adore , adore , adore , adore and love @entity188 , [ who played @entity190 ]
@entity0 : what was your favorite " @entity3 , 90210 " episode ? @entity1 : playing @entity195 [ season one , episode 15 , " fame is where you find it " ] was so much fun with that heavy , heavy accent that i used -- and the singing ! that was pretty exciting
the breast cancer scare [ season one , episode 157 , " it 's only a test " ] was really meaningful
i loved doing heavy drama , and i still do
it 's my forte , and i love it
@entity0 : is there anything else you 'd like to say about " badass " that we have n't covered ? @entity1 : i think it 's important to get across that the book has a lot of poignant , honest moments
i tell stories about myself that nobody ever heard
but the book is also fun ! for example , there 's a whole section on stalking
[ she means the drive - by kind , nothing unlawful
