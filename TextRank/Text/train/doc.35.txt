-- six months into his presidency , @entity1 has at times taken investors on a rollercoaster ride of uncertainty
events of the past week are an accurate reflection of the ups and downs that investors have been experiencing
@entity1 was front and center of the ceasefire agreement between @entity15 and @entity16 while holding court in @entity18 with the prime minister of turkey , the secretary general of the @entity21 and the @entity23 secretary of state

during the same week , after months of on again - off again negotiations , the @entity33 signed a preliminary agreement to lend $ 4.8 billion to the cash - strapped country
but @entity1 capped the week by making a power play to wrestle control of the constitutional drafting process by issuing a decree giving him unchecked powers
more from @entity44 : why @entity45 is caught in currency crisis @entity47 , professor of economics at the @entity49 , says the president " tried to seize the moment and move ahead in capturing more power
what @entity26 needs to focus on now is institution building rather than a power grab
" investors feel the same way , getting their first chance to respond sunday with the largest sell - off since january 2011 , when the protests to oust @entity61 began
more than $ 5 billion of market capitalization was wiped out during the session

this move comes only ten days after the @entity74 stepped up to assist @entity26 with a pledge to offer $ 6.4 billion in loans and grants to the @entity79 's most populous country
@entity1 has met a full range of challenges since taking office and has responded with decisiveness
case in point : the outbreak of violence in the @entity88 was met with a sweeping out of the top military brass in @entity26 including field marshal @entity90
but his biggest challenge , strategists suggest , is trying to appease members of his own @entity95 and the ultra conservative @entity98 wing
at the same time , those who pushed for the removal of former president @entity61 believe their revolution has been hijacked
@entity1 's gesture to meet with the @entity102 calmed the markets , but he has to manage the " man on the street " as large scale protests unfold tuesday
as this clash of opposing views takes place , the tough work of building a solid economic foundation gets delayed
" @entity116 reforms that need to be enacted have been at a standstill for the last few years , " says @entity112 , co-founder and managing director of @entity114
at the top of his list is cutting down the cost of fuel and food subsidies which took the budget deficit to over 10 % of @entity124 in the last fiscal year
" you have a budget deficit that is ballooning , a current account deficit deteriorating and you have investments both local and international at a standstill , you know taking a wait and see approach , " says @entity112
@entity114 raised $ 3.7 billion to fund a refinery operation after the uprising
the private equity group says another $ 4 billion is sitting on the sidelines waiting to see how @entity1 will play his cards this week and beyond
during the uprising , growth plummeted from over 5 % down in 2010 to 1.8 % last year and only climbed slightly to 2.6 % in the latest quarter ending in september
this means making solid calculations for 2013 will prove to be difficult for everything from @entity146 receipts to tourism visitors
" we are back to ground zero when it comes to the uncertainty , " said @entity47 of @entity49 .
