-- less than three months after receiving a synthetic windpipe made from her own stem cells , 2 - year - old @entity1 has passed away
@entity4 died saturday at @entity5 of @entity6 , according to a statement from the hospital
she was the youngest patient to undergo the experimental windpipe procedure and the first patient to receive it in the @entity13
she would have been 3 years old in august
" our hearts are broken , " her family wrote on their blog
" we will forever miss her infectious personality and miraculous strength and spirit
... she is a pioneer in stem - cell technology and her impact will reach all corners of our beautiful @entity27
" the @entity30 - @entity29 toddler was born without a trachea -- a condition that 's fatal in 99 % of cases
she spent every day of her life leading up to the transplant surgery in intensive care , kept alive by a tube that connected her mouth to her lungs
dr. @entity40 , director of the @entity41 at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , performed @entity4 's operation on april 9
her new windpipe that was created using stem cells from the toddler 's bone marrow and plastic fibers shaped into a tube
stem cells are able to develop into different types of body cells and are great at adapting to a new environment
because of this , the body is less likely to reject organs made from these cells , especially if they come from the patient
children make ideal patients for regenerative procedures , since they are naturally better than adults at healing and growing new tissue
in the months after surgery , @entity4 's new trachea was doing well , the family wrote , but her lungs continued to deteriorate
dr. @entity71 , a pediatric surgeon at the hospital , told the @entity73 that the trachea operation also involved surgery on the toddler 's esophagus , which never healed properly
@entity40 has performed six of these transplants worldwide
four of the patients are doing well
the fifth was a cancer patient from @entity83 named @entity84 ; he died four months after receiving the synthetic trachea in @entity44 , according to the @entity86 @entity40 told the @entity73 sunday that he plans to continue with similar operations , including one he is performing this week in @entity43
" although regenerative medicine remains in the early stages for pediatric patients , progress is being made , " @entity5 of @entity6 said in their statement
" even at this time of loss and grief , we , and @entity1 's family , take comfort in the knowledge that the efforts of her physicians and the care team working with them will benefit and serve other children and adults in the years to come
