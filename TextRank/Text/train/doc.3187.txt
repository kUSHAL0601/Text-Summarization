-- @entity2 's economic problems were expected to dominate wednesday 's regular meeting of @entity6 economic and finance ministers in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity2 leaders have said their treasury is funded through the first half of 2011 , but there are still fears its financial sector could collapse under the weight of its massive debt
" we are now engaged in short - term and effective consultations with the @entity2 government , together with the @entity22 and the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) in order to assess the real situation of the banking sector and the needs of reorganization and potential consequences of that , " said @entity17 , the @entity6 economic and monetary commissioner , as he arrived for wednesday 's meeting
that @entity2 shares the euro with 15 other @entity33 nations has raised concerns its financial problems could affect the common currency and the wider @entity6
external support to bail out @entity2 is one option being considered , but the country must make a request for that to happen -- and @entity2 prime minister @entity42 said so far , he has n't done so
the @entity6 and @entity23 were forced to bail out @entity43 in may , coming up with a three - year , 110 - billion - euro ( currently $ 150 billion ) loan to save @entity43 from defaulting on debt
@entity8 finance minister @entity46 said wednesday the ministers were " ready to do something which is necessary " to help @entity2
" we start the negotiation with @entity2 , with the @entity23 , with the @entity52 , with the @entity22 and , if necessary , we are ready to act , " he said as he entered the meeting
at the request of @entity2 authorities , a meeting was scheduled for thursday with the @entity23 , @entity22 , and @entity52 to determine the best way for them to provide support
@entity59 is one of the most exposed @entity33 countries to the @entity2 financial problems , with " very strong interconnection in the banking sector and financial system between the two countries , " @entity17 said wednesday
@entity59 's finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer @entity67 , said wednesday the the country will do what is in its own national interests as regards @entity2
" @entity2 is our closest neighbor , and it 's in @entity59 's national interest that the @entity2 economy is successful and we have a stable banking system , " he said in a statement
" so @entity59 stands ready to support @entity2 in the steps that it needs to take to bring about that stability
" @entity42 said he remains committed to reducing the country 's deficit to below 3 percent of gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of a nation 's economy -- by the end of 2014
@entity2 is forecast to run a deficit of 11.9 percent of its gdp in 2010 , and overall , the country is grappling with a running tab of debt that will total 98.5 percent of its entire economy this year , @entity42 said
since 2008 , @entity2 has enacted strict budget - cutting measures slashing about $ 20 billion off the country 's budget
@entity42 now plans to cut an additional $ 20 billion over the next few years
" our revenues and our spending are out of line to the tune of 19 billion ( euros , or roughly $ 26 billion ) and this is a gap that is presently being filled by borrowing , " he said
" this can not continue
we must continue along the road of budgetary consolidation which we first embarked upon in 2008
