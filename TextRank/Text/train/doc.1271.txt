-- reclusive author @entity1 has emerged , at least in the pages of court documents , to try to stop a novel that presents @entity5 , the disaffected teen hero of his classic " @entity10 , " as an old man
@entity1 has stayed out of the public eye for most of the past half century
lawyers for @entity1 filed suit in federal court this week to stop the publication , sale and advertisement of " 60 years later : coming through the @entity26 , " a novel written by an author calling himself @entity20 and published by a @entity22 company that advertises joke books and a " sexual dictionary " on its web site
" the sequel infringes @entity1 's copyright rights in both his novel and the character @entity5 , who is the narrator and essence of that novel , " said the suit , filed monday in @entity28 in @entity29
published in 1951 , " @entity10 " is an iconic take on teen alienation that is consistently listed among the greatest @entity40 - language novels ever written
@entity1 , 90 , who has famously lived the life of a recluse in @entity43 for most of the past half - century , last published in 1965
with the exception of a 1949 movie based on one of his early short stories , he has never authorized adaptations of any of his work , even turning down an overture from director @entity52 to make " catcher " into a movie
" there 's no more to @entity5
it 's all there , " the court filing quotes @entity1 as saying in 1980
" @entity5 is only a frozen moment in time
" the filing refers to the new book 's author as " @entity63 , " saying that the name @entity65 probably is made up
the first - time novelist 's biography on @entity68 says @entity20 is the son of a @entity22 mother and @entity72 father who was named after the state where he was born
it claims he is a former gravedigger and triathlete who found a copy of @entity1 's novel " in an abandoned cabin in rural @entity80 " and that it helped him survive " the most maniacal of tropical fevers and chronic isolation
" the web site 's description of the book is written in the same choppy , first - person stream of consciousness that @entity1 employs as @entity5 wanders the streets of @entity29
it describes a character , " mr. c , " who flees his nursing home and " embarks on a curious journey through the streets of @entity29
" the lawsuit names @entity22 publisher @entity97 ; its offshoot , @entity99 ; and @entity20 - based @entity100 as defendants
the web site for @entity97 advertises such books as " the @entity104 " and " @entity105 , " which it describes as an erotic " flick book
" @entity107 , @entity1 's @entity29 - based attorney , declined to speak on the record , citing her client 's private nature
e-mail messages to @entity97 were not returned wednesday
@entity112 , president of @entity100 , said the people behind the new book plan to defend it against the lawsuit
" we believe we have the right to distribute this book and the publishers believe they have the right to publish it , " he said
@entity112 , whose company distributes books by about 150 publishers , called " 60 years later " a work of " social science fiction , " saying that @entity20 does n't plagiarize , but sets a well - known character in an alternate place and time -- as literature has done for centuries
" it 's amazing , " he said of the book
" if it was something else , or it felt like a knock - off or whatever , i would have told the publisher we would n't do it
but it 's really just amazing
" despite his cloistered lifestyle , @entity1 nods to the contemporary marketplace in the lawsuit , noting that , as of last week , " ' @entity10 ' currently sells more copies on @entity68 than ' @entity142 , ' ' @entity143 , ' ' @entity144 ' or ' @entity145
' " a hearing in the case is expected monday
@entity1 's lawyers will ask a judge to freeze publication of the book until a final ruling is made
the book is already available in @entity154 and the @entity155 , and is scheduled to be released in the @entity72 in september
the lawsuit asks that sales be halted and that books already distributed be recalled and destroyed
the argument is reminiscent of the legal tussle over the 2001 novel " @entity161 , " a parody of @entity163 's " @entity166 " told from the perspective of a slave
@entity163 's estate argued that the book , by novelist @entity168 , infringed upon her copyright
but the 11th @entity171 ruled in @entity173 's favor , saying the book was protected as a parody of a well - known work
@entity1 's lawyers say " 60 years later " deserves no such protection
" the sequel is not a parody and it does not comment upon or criticize the original , " the lawsuit argues
" it is a rip - off pure and simple
