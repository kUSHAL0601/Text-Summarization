-- a large , hanging and then collapsing chunk of ice is likely the reason why two @entity7 climbers died in @entity8 , an investigator said monday
the bodies of @entity10 and @entity11 were found two days earlier , a heartbreaking end to a high - tech search
the men disappeared while attempting to scale the south face of @entity16 , a 6,110 - meter ( 20,000 - foot ) tall mountain located in @entity18 , a region popular with climbers
@entity20 , who coordinated an investigation and effort to find the men , said @entity10 and @entity11 made it to the summit and ran into trouble on their way down
evidence suggests that one of the men likely went to look over a serac -- a large block of ice -- to see if they could descend
something gave out , causing the climber to fall some 65 feet , said @entity20
but because the men would have been tethered together , that first fall likely pulled the other man off the edge , which sent them both spiraling off a large cliff
" their equipment was strewn over the glacier
there was sign of great impact
( it ) would lead us to believe that they did fall
my guess , looking at the photos and from talking to our guys out there that it was probably about a 1,000 - foot fall , " @entity20 said
@entity11 , 29 , was the founder of @entity55 , a company consisting of professional guides , logistical experts and photographers
he posted june 11 on his @entity60 page that he was leaving @entity61 , @entity62 , for @entity8 " for another season in the @entity64
" on july 10 , @entity10 , 32 , posted pictures and a chronicle of experiences in @entity8 on the climbing blog @entity69
" the @entity70 is world renowned for its high altitude mountaineering , " he wrote
" but almost as awesome as the mountains themselves is the motley crew of international climbers who come to try their hand at getting high , on big peaks , cheap and fast
" @entity78 , who heads the technology company @entity79 that uses satellite imagery , said he enlisted the help of climbers and technology experts to find the pair using an application he built , with hundreds of people at one point poring through satellite images looking for signs of an avalanche
that information was then sent to search and rescue crews on the ground in @entity8
@entity10 and @entity11 were extremely fit and experienced climbers , having practiced the sport for more than a decade , according to @entity78
@entity11 had been to @entity8 several times before , though this was @entity10 's first such visit
" @entity11 had the most optimistic view on practically everything , " @entity11 's sister @entity98 told @entity0
" i think it 's really important to understand that you have to make the most of what you 've got , and you 've got to be grateful for everyone in your life
" 9 dead in @entity109 avalanche , police say is @entity110 like ' a morgue ' ?
