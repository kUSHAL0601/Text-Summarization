-- he racked up two within the space of a month in 2008 , but six years on @entity3 will once again find himself watching a major from afar
the two - time @entity6 winner 's frustrating 2014 continued monday after he failed to qualify for the @entity7 for the first time in 15 years
@entity3 was unable to advance from the 36 - hole qualifying event at @entity11 's @entity10 , falling six strokes short after recording rounds of 75 and 71
the disappointment follows on from the 42 - year - old 's failure to qualify for the masters for the first time in 14 years last month , with his five - year qualifying exemption from his 2008 @entity19 win having expired
" the damage was done in the morning with that 75 , " @entity3 told the @entity21 's official website
@entity3 felt his unfamiliarity with the @entity24 played a part in his downfall
" [ @entity27 ] just made a few mistakes in not knowing the golf course and i was never comfortable with the pace of the greens , as there was a number of three - putts thrown in there , " he added
@entity3 's recent setbacks are all the more remarkable given that in 2008 he secured his second @entity37 @entity7 title , before adding a maiden @entity39 just a month later
the @entity41 's form has suffered a dramatic decline in recent years and he is still searching for a first win on the @entity44 or @entity21 since claiming the @entity19
@entity3 , who revealed that he had undergone skin cancer treatment in february , has slipped to 214th in the world rankings
the six - time @entity48 player is now set to take a week 's break before returning to the @entity21 for the @entity50 in @entity51 , which takes place from june 5 - 8
@entity3 's compatriot @entity56 , meanwhile , built on his second - placed finish at the @entity55 pga championship sunday to finish top at @entity11
@entity56 , who missed out to @entity58 by a shot at @entity60 , carded rounds of 69 and 67 to secure his spot at the @entity7
it is the second time in five attempts that the 26 - year - old has been successful at @entity11 in qualifying for the tournament
" it was really tough out there
i played okay and putted really , really well
i holed a lot of six to eight footers for par and carried a lot of momentum in from yesterday to get the job done , " he told the @entity44 's official website
" i was three under this morning and this afternoon chipped in for eagle to get to five , so that got me going
" i just tried to play steady from there and not lose my head
it was tough last week and then 36 holes in this weather was very tough
i 'm looking forward to my bed tonight
" meanwhile , two - time major winner @entity86 missed out on qualification after finishing alongside @entity3 at two over
the 114th @entity7 takes place from june 12 - 15 at @entity89 and @entity90 .
