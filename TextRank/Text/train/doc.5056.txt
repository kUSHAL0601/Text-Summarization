-- join me in a thought experiment
take two individuals , @entity3 and @entity4 is a naturally gifted professional immersed in a hyper - competitive field where performance is publicly scrutinized and frequently re-evaluated
continuous pressure makes a seek any advantage to excel
he takes medications to gain a physical advantage over competitors while risking chronic health problems
@entity16 is a talented and motivated employee who has made innumerable sacrifices to get ahead at work
she is stressed by the knowledge that her productivity is always being analyzed and feels pressured to use any possible advantage to be the best
she takes a medication that makes her mentally sharper but could endanger her health
@entity3 is maligned baseball star @entity26
@entity16 is your co-worker with the newly acquired job title who seems to work 90 hours per week , escaping fatigue by inexplicable means
opinion : how @entity26 let us down is there really a significant difference between a and @entity16 , other than how much a has been publicly criticized ? not really
their actions stem from the same premise : in competitive professional environments , winners do whatever is necessary to triumph
your new vp may lack @entity26 's bulk and salary , but they share a common style
@entity26 was recently suspended for 211 games for an alleged connection to a @entity52 clinic that has been accused of supplying professional athletes with performance - enhancing drugs
even casual fans realize this action is the equivalent of a guilty verdict for doping
your enthusiastically efficient , work - obsessed colleague with the new job title and beautifully renovated office down the hall shares a similar philosophy as athletes accused of doping : take advantage of any available mechanism to succeed
consequently , @entity16 pursues the controversial advantage conferred by " neuroenhancement " medications
in theory , these act as steroids for the mind
they include mixed amphetamine salts and other medications approved to treat attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder , or @entity78
whether or not the medications objectively enhance cognitive performance is still under investigation
there are theorized risks of increased rates of hypertension , heart failure and psychosis with their use , but there is no definitive evidence that the use of neuroenhancement medications imposes these risks
nonetheless , some researchers are documenting that @entity96 college students and professionals are increasingly using neuroenhancement medications for " nonprescription use , " which may include the use of the medication in healthy adults seeking a cognitive advantage
as contentious as the research on neuroenhancement may be , there is even less controlled research looking at the objective results and adverse effects of performance - enhancing drugs in athletics
regardless of the outcomes that these medications achieve , the motivations of their consumers are the same
whether doping for physical or cognitive enhancement , both parties are using medications with indeterminate efficacy and risk to obtain an advantage
the only difference is the level of regulation and scrutiny of the abusers and who is more likely to be punished for the abuse
fear of public shaming and prosecution should not drive decision - making when it comes to the illegal use of performance - enhancing drugs
@entity26 has a large number of critics ; at least one of them must have tried neuroenhancement to dominate in the office
this person may label @entity26 as a " doper " and question the validity of his achievements without acknowledging that his or her motivations may stem from similar desires
fans who are critical of athletes need to apply the same standards to themselves and to the people in their lives
a pharmacologically derived professional advantage in the office should not be seen as more appropriate than a similar advantage gained in a stadium
@entity26 could potentially sit for hundreds of games as a consequence of the accusations against him
maybe your new vp should forfeit that fancy new office for 211 days to maintain a moral norm
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .
