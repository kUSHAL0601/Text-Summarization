@entity0 , @entity1 -- the finance minister of @entity1 has resigned after police arrested his wife
authorities said they found a stash of money totaling more than $ 57,000 in her car
after resigning wednesday , former finance minister @entity11 told @entity2 affiliate @entity12 that the money was obtained as part of a loan
but authorities said they were investigating whether his wife , @entity17 , was laundering money
" here in this country , it 's not that it 's prohibited to carry money
but what is prohibited is not having proof of where the money came from
i ca n't say whether they are money laundering
the law is clear and is being applied , " said @entity30 , the nation 's police chief
in @entity1 , the law requires anyone transporting the equivalent of more than $ 10,000 to declare it before authorities and establish where it came from
@entity11 's wife was transporting 1.12 million lempiras , worth more than $ 57,000
a special prosecutor for organized crime is handling the case
" what the prosecutors ... will look for objectively is whether the money was acquired in a legal manner , " said @entity44 , a spokesman for the office
police say the former finance minister 's wife could not prove where the money came from when she was stopped by police tuesday
@entity11 resigned the next day , but he told @entity2 affiliate @entity12 that no one in his family had committed a crime
the money was a financier 's loan that was intended to be used to buy dollars and pay a supplier in @entity64 who provides products for a bed store the former finance minister owns , he said
" my wife and my son did not know they were carrying the money until they were stopped by the police
only the driver was aware of the situation because it was a last - minute thing , " @entity11 said
" it will be the courts that determine this situation , " he added , " and in order to protect my family and my honor i have taken the decision to resign from my post in order to face life , as i always have done , honestly and fully
" if the family can not clarify where the money came from , they could be charged with laundering money and face up to 20 years in prison .
