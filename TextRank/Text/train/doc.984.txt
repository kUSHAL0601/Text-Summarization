-- over the years @entity2 's supporters have suffered anti-semitic abuse and until recently visiting supporters would hiss , in an effort to mimic the sound of the gas chambers that sent six million @entity8 to their deaths during the @entity10
so just how offensive is the use of the word " @entity13 " at football matches ? @entity16 prime minister @entity15 has been told that his view on @entity2 fans being able to use the " @entity13 " word at football matches is " ludicrous " by an anti-racism group
last week , the @entity21 told fans they could face prosecution if they used the word , a term which at different times throughout history has been used by @entity8 and also to abuse them
a north @entity29 - based club , @entity2 are known for having a large number of @entity8 supporters , with a section of @entity2 fans having attempted to reclaim the " @entity24 " by referring to themselves as the " @entity34 " and chanting it at matches
" there 's a difference between @entity2 fans self - describing themselves as @entity13 and someone calling someone a @entity13 as an insult , " @entity15 told the @entity16 - based @entity38 newspaper
" you have to be motivated by hate
hate speech should be prosecuted -- but only when it 's motivated by hate
" but @entity15 's views have been dismissed as ' ludicrous ' by @entity48 , a group which prides itself on " promoting fairness , justice and equality within all sports
" @entity53 , a spokesperson for the group and a member of the @entity55 , says the attempt by @entity2 fans to suggest they have reclaimed the word " is an insult to anybody 's intelligence
" he added : " @entity2 fans can be excused for attempting to deflect the abuse they received as neither the football club nor the @entity21 previously took any action against the anti-semitism voiced by other @entity29 clubs
" once anti-semitism is being highlighted and prosecuted that is not longer a defense , if it ever was
@entity2 fans have neither the right nor the moral authority to do so
" @entity15 has also come in for criticism from @entity74 , a leading lawyer and chairman of the @entity55 , who says the prime minister 's comments " actually condone anti-semitism or racism
" " football is a part of society and not separate from it , so the prime minister has to really think what he is saying because he legitimizes anti-semitism and that is a sad thing for any parliamentarian to do , " @entity74 told @entity80
" you can not have people breaking the criminal law on saturday afternoon and saying it is ok because we have a badge of honor
" @entity16 comedian @entity95 , a leading campaigner against racial hatred towards the @entity8 community , also believes the word should not be used by @entity2 fans
@entity95 , a @entity8 @entity99 supporter , attacked @entity15 's position on the matter in his blog on the @entity105 newspaper 's website
" the fact is that whatever its origins , their continuing use of the y - word legitimizes and sustains the racist abuse aimed at @entity2 by other fans , " he writes
" it 's a call and response dynamic , like many at football matches
" only in a small boxed off section in the @entity118 does @entity15 receive any real support
writing in the tabloid , @entity120 , joint chairman of the @entity2 @entity121 , hailed @entity15 as " the first person to speak with any common sense on this matter
" @entity120 added : " it is nice to see somebody who understands that word can have two meanings to two different sets of people
" but @entity15 is not alone in receiving criticism with the @entity21 also coming in for blame with several commentators claiming the organization is going after the wrong people
writing in the @entity139 newspaper , @entity138 , @entity137 argues more should be done to punish those club 's whose fans persist in anti-semitic chanting , rather than @entity2 fans who he believes do not use the term in an offensive manner
" how difficult is it to understand that when a team with a wide @entity8 fan base and prominent @entity8 businesspeople among its executives proudly call themselves ' @entity13 ' , there is nothing anti-semitic about it , " he asks
" it would be even complimentary to @entity8 if it was a half decent club
but when supporters of rival @entity99 or @entity157 sing the " the @entity13 are going to @entity158 , " accompanied by the hissing sounds of gas , that is rank racism
" @entity163 , a columnist for @entity164 also agrees that the @entity21 ' s position on the issue is skewed
" the problem with the y - word is not @entity2 fans ' use of it , but other clubs ' supporters ' racism , " he told the newspaper
" it seems bizarre to me that the focus of the action by the @entity21 should be the people who are not the problem
