-- on monday night , @entity1 was sworn in as @entity3 's foreign minister after an absence of almost a year , amid a crescendo of opposition protests in the @entity7
a comfortable majority vote -- 62 members voting for , 17 against and one abstention -- paved his way back into office
but his hard - line attitude on @entity3 - @entity15 peace talks may put him in the diplomatic deep end with those trying to advance the process
@entity20 leader @entity19 said reappointing @entity1 was a mistake
" in light of the attempts to reignite the negotiations with the @entity15 and delicate relations with the @entity27 and especially the complex diplomacy involved in the @entity30 situation , a foreign minister like @entity1 will deepen the rifts and pour fuel on fires rather than putting them out , " she said
" this is not good for @entity3
" @entity1 views @entity37 president @entity36 as an obstacle to peace
his @entity41 party is also supportive of @entity43 jewish settlements , whose presence is reviled by @entity15 and many @entity3 , who consider them obstacles to a peace agreement

@entity1 was acquitted last week on charges of breach of trust and fraud
@entity51 had held the @entity58 position for almost a year after @entity1 resigned to face the charges , and welcomed him back into the government
the trial centered on claims @entity1 had pushed to get the @entity3 ambassador to @entity64 transferred after the diplomat allegedly handed over confidential information that included details of a secret police inquiry regarding @entity1
@entity1 denied violating any laws
@entity1 has faced international criticism for his hard - line stance on @entity3 's @entity73 minorities
his ultranationalist party is especially popular with immigrants from the @entity76 , where he was born and raised .
