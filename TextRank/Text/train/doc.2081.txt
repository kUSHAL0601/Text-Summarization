@entity0 -- nearly two years into the recession , opinion about which political party is responsible for the severe economic downturn is shifting , according to a new national poll
a @entity8 survey released friday morning indicates that 38 percent of the public blames republicans for the country 's current economic problems
in may , 53 percent blamed the @entity13
according to the poll , 27 percent now blame the @entity15 for the recession , up 6 points from may , and 27 percent now say both parties are responsible
" the bad news for the @entity15 is that the number of @entity22 who hold the @entity13 exclusively responsible for the recession has been steadily falling by about two to three points per month , " said @entity19 , @entity1 polling director
" at that rate , only a handful of voters will blame the economy on the @entity13 by the time next year 's midterm elections roll around
. " thirty - six percent of people questioned said that president @entity34 's policies have improved economic conditions , with 28 percent feeling that the president 's programs have made things worse , and 35 percent saying what he 's done has had no effect on the economy
one reason for that , @entity19 said , may be the growing federal budget deficit : two - thirds say that the government should balance the budget even in a time of war and recession
the survey indicates that only 18 percent said the economic conditions in the country today are good , down 3 points from august
eighty - two percent said economic conditions are poor
" some economic indicators may suggest that the economy has turned the corner -- but try telling that to the @entity22 people , " @entity19 said
the number of @entity22 who said the economy is in good shape -- a number that grew steadily through the spring and summer -- has now stalled , with fewer than one in five expressing a positive view of current conditions
more than eight in 10 say that economic conditions are in poor shape , with 43 percent calling them very poor
the @entity8 poll was conducted november 13 - 15 , with 1,014 adult @entity22 questioned by telephone
the survey sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points
