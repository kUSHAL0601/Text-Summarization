-- the stunning news has been spreading through the city of @entity3 , @entity4 , shaking residents in a way they had n't felt in recent memory
two families -- including five children -- were killed sunday in a plane crash while vacationing together in @entity11 , @entity12 , about 65 miles southwest of @entity13
they were all passengers in a small , single - engine plane that crashed on takeoff into the runway at the town 's airport , officials said
while much of the country focuses on the intensely covered plane crash in @entity22 , many of @entity3 's approximately 60,000 residents have been thinking about @entity11
the @entity12 town sits thousands of miles away , but this crash feels much closer to home
" without a doubt , it 's the most devastating tragedy i think we 've had to experience since i 've been here , " said @entity29 , a 21 - year @entity3 resident
" losing two entire families -- it just does n't happen
" @entity3 was mourning dr. @entity36 ; his wife , @entity37 ; and their children , @entity40 and @entity41 , said @entity42 , a spokesman for the @entity43
@entity37 was a radiologist who practiced at a local hospital
also killed aboard the plane were the @entity47 family : @entity47 ; his wife , @entity49 ; and their children @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , @entity42 said
all the children ranged in age from grade school to high school , said @entity29
@entity59 worked in medical equipment sales while @entity49 served as a president of a parent / teacher group , according to the @entity63
" you name it , if you needed somebody to volunteer , you called @entity68 and she was there , " state rep. @entity64 told the newspaper
@entity64 , who lives just down the street from the @entity47 home , told @entity0 he and @entity59 had become good friends
@entity59 was @entity47 ' traditional family @entity74 name
" he was ' @entity76 ' to his friends and ' @entity78 ' to his business associates , " @entity64 said
the @entity64 family 's son was a classmate of 12 - year - old @entity53
now @entity64 tells his children the @entity47 family " got to go to heaven together
" in light of the @entity22 plane crash , @entity64 said that sometimes it 's hard to really appreciate the significance tragedies have when they take place far away
" you hear about a plane crash in @entity92 and you 're in @entity3 , @entity4 , and you think , ' that 's a terrible tragedy
' and now you hear about a plane crash and you think about the @entity94 and how those families connected to the crash out there in @entity92 are feeling
you really recognize how huge these tragedies are
" both families were " very involved in their community , very involved in their church and their schools , " said @entity29 , who is president of a swimming pool where some of the children went
" very few people here have not been touched by this tragedy
" @entity110 , where the families worshipped , has been especially striken by the news
sunday school teacher @entity114 , who taught the children of both families as toddlers , told the @entity63 she felt " like there 's a big black cloud over @entity110 right now
" @entity37 had been named among the nation 's best physicians in 2011 , according to his hospital website
he had a sibling who is employed by @entity127 , the parent company of @entity0
" @entity36 was one of our lead interventional radiologists , who brought a number of new and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic tools to the community , " @entity37 ' colleague , dr. c. @entity128 , told the @entity63
" he was an extraordinary physician but also an extraordinary human being who was known to be both compassionate and conscientious
" the @entity94 and @entity138 were bound for @entity139 off @entity12 's @entity140 , about 80 miles southwest of @entity11 , the lodge 's co-owner , @entity136 , told @entity0 on monday
in addition to the families , the pilot of the plane also died in the crash , authorities said , putting the death toll at 10
the @entity151 " struck the runway and burned , " the @entity148 said , citing local law enforcement officials
by the time firefighters and medics arrived , the aircraft was engulfed , @entity11 police said
the plane was operated by @entity157 , according to the @entity148
the @entity158 has sent a team to the crash site tuesday and were investigating
this is n't the first @entity158 case for @entity163
in august 2011 , a @entity164 got stuck in sand after a sightseeing excursion , the @entity158 said , damaging its propeller
the @entity158 lists a 2004 incident when a pilot taxiing a @entity170 at an airport in @entity172 hit a 55 - gallon drum of soap , bending the plane 's propeller
no one was reported hurt in either incident
in @entity3 , the children 's classmates were mourning their loss
students from @entity184 -- where @entity185 was about to start her junior year -- had flowers delivered to the family 's home , @entity182 reported
classmates also left a guest book for mourners to sign , according to the paper
@entity54 's involvement in the school stretched from the school varsity basketball team , to student government
her classmates had just elected her the student body secretary
that 's five children lost -- whose hopeful promise of a fruitful and productive life will go unfulfilled
" it 's just a loss for the school and for the whole community , " @entity203 , the school 's principal , told @entity182
" they were just good people
they thought of others before they thought of themselves
to lose the whole family , it 's just really shocking
" for the city as a whole , @entity64 said church members , friends and neighbors of the two families will be gathering for prayer and memorials during the coming days
but the mourning seems more difficult somehow
" this is especially hard because it 's a whole family , " he said
" there 's this void
there 's nobody to console , because there 's nobody at the @entity47 house
there 's nobody to take a casserole to
everybody wants to do something , but there 's nobody to do anything for
" there 's little else to do , @entity64 said , except to lean on each other
this unforgettable tragedy , he said , " has almost brought us closer together
" @entity0 's @entity250 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .
