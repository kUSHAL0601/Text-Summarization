@entity0 -- @entity3 activists are denouncing the @entity5 government in the wake of the @entity3 regime 's announcement that it has a deserted army officer in custody
lt. col. @entity11 defected months ago and began broadcasting video statements denouncing the @entity3 government , before eventually fleeing to neighboring @entity5
news of his detention by @entity3 comes amid persistent international consternation with that country 's regime for its fierce crackdown on anti-government protesters , a six - month outpouring that has resulted in more than 2,600 deaths
" enough is enough , " @entity24 secretary - general @entity23 said thursday , urging " some coherent measures " against president @entity27 's regime
@entity28 , a prominent @entity3 opposition activist who is now in exile in @entity5 applying for refugee status , said the @entity5 handed @entity11 over to the @entity3 secret police
" the @entity5 government is directly responsible for @entity11 's destiny , because @entity11 was a refugee on their territory
they have to be honest about him
... under international rules , any country that receives him has to protect him , " @entity28 said
@entity38 had called on all @entity3 soldiers to defect and mobilize against @entity27
eventually he fled @entity3 to @entity5
two weeks ago , @entity28 called @entity1 in a panic , saying @entity11 had gone missing from the refugee camp in @entity5 where he 'd been living
at the time , he suspected @entity3 security agents had kidnapped the defecting officer
" i talked to him on the morning of august 29th , " @entity28 said
" he said ' i have a meeting with a @entity5 security man
when i finish i will call you
' i waited for three days and did n't hear from him
then after that we discovered that the security man took him and did n't send him back to the camp
they sent him to @entity3 directly
the @entity5 made a trick with @entity11
they caught him in @entity5 and sent him to @entity3
" the @entity57 said @entity3 tv broadcast an interview or what it called a " confession from @entity62 " on thursday night
@entity38 said he defected because of bloody incidents , but he was not ordered to open fire on civilians
he said opposition members , including members of the @entity68 , contacted him while he was in @entity5
he discussed talk of weapons and money
he said he did n't get the kind of support he was promised
the interview did n't indicate how he returned to @entity3
another @entity3 activist , @entity75 of the @entity76 , said that from what @entity3 tv is showing , there are signs that @entity11 has been tortured
@entity1 has previously asked the @entity79 about @entity11 , but @entity5 diplomats said they were not familiar with his case
@entity5 @entity83 officials were accompanying @entity5 prime minister @entity84 on a tour of @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88
one official who requested anonymity told @entity1 the government " on principle " never hands over people who came to @entity5 on humanitarian grounds
there are more than 7,600 @entity3 refugees in six @entity5 refugee camps and there is daily traffic back and forth across the borders
in @entity86 , the first stop on the @entity5 delegation 's trip , @entity3 activists tried to confront @entity105 about @entity11
when @entity84 emerged from the headquarters of the @entity109 in @entity110 on tuesday , a crowd of angry @entity3 activists stood outside the gates chanting " @entity84 coward " and " @entity84 , where is @entity11 ? " @entity84 waved to the crowd , apparently not understanding the question
but one @entity3 activist cornered a senior @entity5 official next to the government motorcade and demanded to know @entity11 's whereabouts
the @entity5 official had no idea what he was talking about
@entity5 is critical to the @entity3 opposition movement
dissidents have fled to @entity5 to escape the ongoing government crackdown in @entity3 and have been holding opposition meetings in @entity5 cities
on thursday , a @entity3 opposition council is announcing its creation in @entity0 , the latest in a number of groups claiming to represent the opposition in @entity3 and abroad
but now , with @entity3 announcing it has @entity11 in custody , opposition activists said they feel betrayed by the @entity5 government
" i ca n't trust the @entity5 any more
they are hypocrites , " said @entity28
" there are a lot of questions that the @entity3 government and the @entity5 government should answer , " said @entity75 , who is based in @entity136 , @entity137
the importance of @entity11 to the @entity3 regime became evident september 8 , when opposition activists and residents inside @entity3 called @entity1 to report @entity3 security forces had attacked the village of @entity148 , where @entity11 's brother @entity149 lived
according to the @entity151 - based @entity150 , a number of @entity3 army defectors had taken shelter in @entity148 while awaiting the chance to smuggle themselves across the nearby border to @entity5
@entity158 filmed of the aftermath of the @entity3 government raid showed blood - spattered houses , burned - out cars and trucks , and a ransacked home
at least five people were killed in the raid , including @entity11 's brother
his corpse was shown in another video released by opposition activists
thousands of people attended his funeral
@entity3 's state news agency claimed responsibility for the raid on @entity176 , saying @entity3 security forces had killed a number of " armed terrorists " who had been residing there
the @entity150 said security forces killed one person and wounded five others in the @entity184 countryside
a volunteer @entity187 medic who was wounded in the western city of @entity190 last week has died of his injuries at a @entity137 hospital , the group said
last month , @entity27 told the @entity24 secretary general that military operations in the country had been halted
the regime has indicated that it wanted to end the fighting and foster stability
" these promises have been broken promises , " @entity23 said said thursday
@entity1 's @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report
