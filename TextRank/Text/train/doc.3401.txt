@entity0 -- the portrait of @entity3 in the last week of his life , painted by people close to him , is a disturbing picture of an emaciated man , unable to sleep or eat , and unlikely to be ready for his comeback concerts just days away
" oh , my @entity13 , @entity14 , i can see @entity3 's heart beat through the skin in his chest , " stylist @entity10 said after a costume fitting six days before his death on june 19 , 2009
@entity14 is the nickname of makeup artist @entity19 , who testified thursday and friday in @entity3 's wrongful death trial
her testimony has been the most dramatic so far
proceedings continue monday with choreographer @entity23 on the witness stand
" get him a bucket of chicken , " manager @entity25 said in reply to concerns about @entity3 's weight loss , @entity19 testified
" it was such a cold response , it broke my heart , " @entity19 said through tears
witness : @entity3 was paranoid , talking to himself in last days @entity3 's mother and three children contend concert promoter @entity38 is liable in @entity3 's death because its executives ignored his health problem and pressured him to prepare for his " @entity44 " shows set to debut in @entity43 in july 2009
@entity38 negligently hired , retained and supervised dr. @entity45 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon 's death , according to the @entity3 's lawsuit
the coroner blamed @entity3 's june 25 , 2009 death on an overdose of propofol , combined with sedatives , given to him by dr. @entity45 as a treatment for insomnia
@entity38 lawyers contend that it was @entity3 , and not @entity38 , who hired and supervised dr. @entity45 , and that he was responsible for his own decisions
they said these were influenced by a drug addiction its executives did not and could not be expected to know about
witness : " everybody was lying after he died " the @entity3 the public saw in the documentary " @entity44 " -- produced months after his death with 80 hours of video shot during his last rehearsals -- is not reality , @entity19 said
she was asked to help retouch the video to make @entity3 look healthier on the big screen , she testified
" it was a lie
i did n't want to lie , " @entity19 said
" everybody was lying after he died , saying that @entity3 was well , and everybody knew he was n't
i felt that retouching @entity3 was just a part of that lie
" before @entity19 testified , jurors heard a similarly disturbing description of @entity3 in his final days from " @entity44 " associate producer @entity79
@entity3 " was not speaking normally " at the june 19 costume fitting , @entity79 said
she and producer @entity81 cried after he left because of his appearance and what he said
" @entity13 keeps talking to me , " @entity3 told @entity81 , @entity79 testified
@entity19 said @entity3 seemed " frightened , " and he was talking to himself , repeating " the same thing over and over again
" " he kept repeating , ' why ca n't i choose ? ' " she said
@entity3 was shivering from chills , and it was " like i was touching ice " when she put on his makeup , @entity19 testified
@entity19 said she raised her concerns with @entity38 ceo @entity38
he told her , " yeah , this is bad
it 's not so good
i had to scrape @entity3 off the floor in @entity43 ... because he was so drunk , " she said
the @entity95 's legal representation contends @entity38 should have gotten @entity3 medical care from someone other than @entity45
@entity79 , who knew @entity3 since she first danced with him in 1987 , said she screamed at @entity81 in a phone call after the june 19 rehearsal , begging that he get help for @entity3
" i kept saying that ' @entity3 is dying , he 's dying , he 's leaving us , he needs to be put in a hospital , ' " @entity79 said
" ' please do something
' i kept saying that
i asked him why no one had seen what i had seen
he said he did n't know
" @entity3 defender files sex abuse claim @entity111 was " in love with @entity3 " the trial , which enters its third week monday , could offer more previously unpublicized insights into @entity3 's life and death
along with his oldest children @entity117 and @entity118 , his ex-wife and their mother , @entity111 , is scheduled to testify
@entity19 's testimony on friday offered a glimpse at @entity3 's relationship with @entity111 , suggesting there was romance involved , or at least jealously
@entity19 said that after she was fired from her job during @entity3 's " history " tour in 1997 , she learned it was because @entity111 felt threatened by her relationship with @entity3
" she was obviously in love with @entity3 , " @entity19 said
" she had told me for many years that it was her desire to be with him
" @entity111 later apologized to her for asking @entity3 's manager to let her go , she testified
" she told me she was jealous of me , " @entity19 said
" she thought that @entity3 liked me better
