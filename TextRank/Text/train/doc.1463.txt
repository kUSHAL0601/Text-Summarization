-- from the @entity3 to the @entity4 , the world 's leading museums house treasured artifacts and storied works of art. they may protect centuries of culture , but they do n't want to be perceived as dusty relics themselves
in response to growing numbers of visitors and , in some instances , creaky infrastructure , these and other iconic museums are undergoing unprecedented expansions
from @entity22 's @entity21 to the @entity4 in @entity23 , museums are adding extensions , constructing new branches , and erecting gleaming new exhibition spaces , often with the help of the world 's leading design firms
the @entity21 , the world 's most popular @entity30 , receives around five million visitors a year
that is twice the number that @entity35 had in mind when they opened the museum in 2000
so , as part of a £ 215m ( $ 357m ) expansion plan , the museum commissioned @entity41 to convert underground oil tanks into subterranean galleries , which opened in the summer of 2012
museums of wonder when the final expansion is complete at the end of 2016 , the museum will have expanded its area by 60 % , adding 20,670 square meters of space
the additional space is equivalent to nearly four american football fields
@entity52 , the museum 's director , sees the expansion as essential to accommodate the museum 's expanding collection and programs
" it is about transforming the museum into an even more open , engaging place for increasingly diverse audiences , " he says
" our audiences want us to offer many different activities - to be a place for acquiring knowledge , meeting people , discussing ideas , being entertained - and they want to be participants in their own right
the new @entity21 will be a place to enjoy art from all over the world in all its variety , and will provide artists and visitors with the different kinds of spaces they need to do so
" nearby , the @entity3 has sunk £ 135 million ( $ 224 million ) into its @entity79 , which opened in march
designed by @entity80 , it stretches out over nine floors and will include 1,100 square meters of gallery space devoted to temporary exhibitions
growing audience in 2013 , more than 470,000 visitors filed through the museum 's blockbuster show " life and death in @entity90 and @entity91
" as with many of its other shows , the museum had to stage the exhibition in its former @entity96
" this has limited what we can achieve in terms of exhibition narrative and the display of loan objects , " says @entity97 , the museum 's head of press and marketing
" the new dedicated space means we can encourage the widest possible audience to come and experience our exhibitions
" expansion does n't always involve the original building
in recent years the number of museums opening satellite branches has increased dramatically , and looks set to increase in the coming years
@entity22 's @entity117 , the world 's largest museum of decorative arts and design , will open the @entity121 in @entity122 in 2017
it marks the first time that a design museum will be built in the @entity125 outside of @entity22
the @entity126 opens in 2015 with a price tag of $ 650 million
designed by @entity129 , it will sit on @entity130 and touches both sand and sea
it 's meant to look like as if it is floating from a distance
about two - thirds of the structure will be covered by a white dome , with a diameter of 600 feet
@entity141 openings in the roof will create a " rain of light " meant to invoke light entering a souk curators go to @entity148 university museums see expansion and renovation as key to their mission , too
in november , @entity148 's three art museums -- the @entity155 , the @entity156 and the @entity157 -- will re-open under one roof
@entity160 @entity159 has consolidated the @entity161 under a single glazed rooftop structure , while restoring and upgrading the 1920s georgian revival architecture
like museum officials elsewhere , @entity148 's administration believes the museums ' facelift will help them inspire the students and community they serve
as @entity148 president @entity171 says : " @entity159 has designed a building that is as beautiful as the works of art it will house and as thoughtful as the people who will work and learn within it
