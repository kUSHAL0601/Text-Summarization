-- just days before he was sworn in , president @entity1 was giving his daughters a tour of the @entity4 when one of them pointed to a copy of @entity8 's second inaugural address carved into the wall
president @entity1 strides into history as the nation 's first black president
@entity1 's 7 - year - old daughter , @entity13 , told her father that @entity8 's speech was really long
would he have to give a speech as long ? @entity1 's answer was completed by his older daughter , 10 - year - old @entity18
" i said , ' actually , that one is pretty short
mine may even be a little longer , ' " @entity1 told @entity0 recently
" at which point , @entity18 turns to me and says , ' @entity22 president , better be good
' " the story is light - hearted , but it touches on a delicate question : will people hold @entity1 to a different standard because he is the first @entity30 - @entity29 president ? @entity29 appear split by race on that answer
according to a @entity35 poll , 53 percent of blacks say the @entity29 public will hold @entity1 to a higher standard than past presidents because he is black
most whites -- 61 percent -- say @entity1 's race will not matter in how he will be judged
the question divided several people who were racial pioneers themselves
@entity44 was one of the first blacks allowed to become a fighter pilot
he was a member of the @entity47 , a group of black pilots who escorted bombers in @entity51 " we had to be twice as good to be average , " he says
@entity1 wo n't face the same pressures he did because his presidential predecessor was so inept , @entity44 says
" no , the world is ready for him , " he says
" the [ @entity57 ] @entity57 debacle was so depressing
" @entity44 was shot down by ground fire on his 19th mission and spent a year in @entity61 prison camps
he wrote about his pow experiences in " @entity63 captured , @entity64 : memoirs of a @entity47 and @entity66
" @entity44 says he dealt with the pressures of being a racial pioneer by drawing on the strength of black leaders who opened doors for him
" i sit on the backs of everyone who came before me , " says @entity44 , who attended @entity1 's inauguration with other @entity47
@entity44 says he would have emotionally imploded if he 'd thought too much about the pressures of representing all blacks and dealing with the racism he encountered when he returned home to a segregated @entity29 after the war
" i did what i had to do so i did n't go stark - raving mad , " he says
" there was n't all this self - analysis and back and forth
i was too damn busy with a wife , a child and a mortgage
" @entity90 could n't avoid a bout of constant self - analysis
she was one of the first @entity30 - @entity29 students admitted to a doctorate program in history at the @entity96 at @entity97
" i know @entity1 is going to be held to a different standard , " says @entity90 , author of " @entity98 " and books such as " @entity100 , " which celebrate black faith and culture
@entity90 says she faced relentless scrutiny , and so will @entity1
" you know that it was hard for you to get in it , and you know they 're watching you , " @entity90 says
" and you know that they 're judging you by a critical standard that 's sometimes not fair
" @entity90 says a white classmate , her partner in dissertation , once confided to her that he received the same grades as she did , even though he knew his work was inferior
" it toughened me up , " @entity90 says
" it can give you headaches and stomachaches
i learned you have to be thankful that @entity120 blessed you with that opportunity
at some point , you stop worrying , and you trust @entity120
" ' would @entity57 have been president if he were black ? ' perhaps @entity1 will avoid those stomachaches because of the massive good will his election has generated
but that could change quickly if @entity1 makes a controversial decision or a mistake , says @entity128 , co-author of " @entity129 in the @entity130 : @entity131 in @entity29
" @entity128 says people who say @entity1 is n't going to be held to a different standard because of his skin color did n't pay attention to his campaign
he says @entity1 had to deal with challenges that other candidates did n't have to face
@entity1 's run for office was almost ended by his association with his minister , the rev. @entity142 , whose incendiary sermons shocked many
but @entity146 presidential nominee @entity145 's relationship with the rev. @entity147 , who was accused of @entity148 , never threatened to end his campaign , @entity128 says
" @entity1 was held responsible for what his minister said , and @entity145 was associated with @entity147 , but somehow that did n't stick , " says @entity128 , a communication professor at the @entity149
even people who regard themselves as the most progressive , open - minded supporters may subconsciously hold @entity1 to a different standard , @entity128 says
he says several academic studies show that it often takes people longer to associate good qualities to blacks when different faces are flashed across a screen
" they have these stereotypes buried in their subconscious , " he says
" that 's why people cross the street when they see a young black man
they 'd rather not take a chance
" @entity1 virtually had to be perfect to overcome those stereotypes , @entity128 says
he was the first black editor of the @entity170 , he has an @entity172 - educated wife and adorable daughters , and he ran a great campaign
" he 's the perfect symbol of achievement , " @entity128 says
white candidates for office do n't have to have an uninterrupted life of achievement to be considered for the @entity181 , @entity128 says
" if @entity57 were black , do you think he would be president ? " @entity128 says
@entity44 , the @entity47 , says @entity1 should have at least one consolation
the problems he confronts now are so immense that anyone , even someone who was considered by many to be perfect , would not be able to escape withering judgment
" if the president was @entity190 , '' @entity44 says , " they would still debate if he 's qualified
