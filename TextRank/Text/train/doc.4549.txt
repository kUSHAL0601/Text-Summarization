-- fans of @entity2 have a lot to talk about this morning
after months of updates to trailers , a stream of released stills and interviews with @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , fans across the country have finally seen @entity14
review : latest ' @entity2 ' shows age as they shake off the effects of a late night at the theater , the euphoria of the line parties subsides and the inevitable struggle settles in : did " @entity2 and the @entity28 " do justice to @entity26 's final installation of the series ? " i hope they do a good job on @entity35 's death scene , " said @entity29 , 34 , before the midnight showing in @entity30 , @entity31 , on thursday
" it really moved me in the book
" @entity29 , founder of a @entity2 fan group in @entity30 , was also worried about how the film would portray @entity41 's torture scene at @entity42
" i just want it to be done how i imagined it , and correctly , " she said
" it was gut - wrenching when i read it , and i want it to be gut - wrenching on the screen
" fans of the seven - book series chronicling a young wizard 's coming - of - age in a fantastic and dangerous , magical world have a lot of emotion invested in the franchise
in many cases , they grew up reading the books , and for the past 10 years they 've watched the actors portraying @entity2 and his friends grow up themselves in seven big screen adaptations from @entity62
@entity62 , like @entity0 , is owned by @entity63
but also , for the last decade , @entity2 fans have been disappointed by what plot points were left out of the movies and the inexplicable additions or director choices made when bringing the books to cinematic life
" i think most people are pretty happy with the way [ the movies ] turned out , but all fans that i have talked to have problems with the movies , " @entity29 said
" @entity2 's eyes in the movie are blue and ... in the books they 're green , " she said
" this is a huge thing to a lot of the fans because they 're just so invested
" spoiler alert : " @entity2 and the @entity87 , @entity88 1 " has an already well - publicized additional scene , featuring @entity2 and @entity41 slow - dancing -- a nod to fans who have long wondered if the two should be more than friends
the answer , decidedly played in the film , is " no. " @entity97 ' @entity2 ' movie clip leaked other plot points fans are concerned about being translated " correctly " include the emotional death scenes of @entity100 and @entity101 , @entity2 's beloved owl , as well as the professor @entity104 backstory
" when you get to ' the @entity87 , ' you 've really kind of shot yourself in the foot if you do n't have enough of that , because it 's a major plot [ development ] , " said @entity106 , a blogger and author of " movies in @entity109
" @entity2 fans are not alone in their angst
other fantasy book series have become popular movie series , including " @entity118 , " " @entity119 , " and " @entity120
" fans of those movies and books wrestle with the same kinds of frustrations
" when ' @entity131 ' came out , some fans were horrified by the changes , " said @entity126 , a senior staff member of @entity127 , a @entity129 fan forum
" one of the things they did with ' @entity118 , ' and i 've heard they do this with ' @entity2 , ' too : [ filmmakers ] think that there needs to be humor that was n't there in the book , " @entity126 said
" they also will emphasize romance that maybe was n't there in the book , " like with @entity144 and @entity145 , she said
" @entity129 pretty much left that out of the book completely
" " but as the next two movies came out , there were even more changes , so people [ ended up ] looking back fondly on ' @entity131 ' as one of their favorites of the three movies because it was so true to the book , " @entity126 said
she said the @entity2 movie franchise started to fall short of fan expectations with the third movie , " @entity158
" @entity159 : your reviews of " @entity2 " because of a new director and such prolific source material , she felt it was not only difficult in this case to be as true to the book , but " it was untrue to the book in a lot of ways that fans were horrified by
" adding to the fan frustration is the fact that the @entity2 movies are almost over
the latest @entity2 movie represents half of @entity26 's 759 - page series finale
the last movie adaptation -- " @entity2 and the @entity180 " -- will be in theaters next summer
knowing that the magical world they 've enjoyed for well over a decade will be taking a bow from the big screen can be stressful and sad for fans
" @entity119 " fans are at a turning point in that franchise 's movie arc , too , @entity106 said
" they have a very specific kind of anxiety , " @entity106 said
that 's because there 's a key scene in " @entity198 , " the fourth novel in @entity201 's series , that fans hope will not be taken the wrong way by mainstream audiences
the complicated scene involves the character @entity207 -- the werewolf -- falling in love with @entity211 and @entity212 's halfling vampire baby
@entity106 says the leaked scripts seem to indicate the scene is true to the book
so , what can fans do when their favorite fantasy franchise movies conclude ? " look forward to all the extras on the extended editions , " said @entity126 , who has experienced a similar grieving process with the " @entity118 " movies
" just really enjoy the last couple of movies
just sit there and really get into them and enjoy the fandom and everything that comes from that
" even with tribulations over plot changes and character portrayals , most fans of these fantasy franchises still feel compelled to see the movies and share in the excitement over any new release
" it 's seeing @entity2 come to life , " @entity29 said
" even if there are parts that are n't perfect or are n't exactly what you want , there are so many things that are right
