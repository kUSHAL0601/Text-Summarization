@entity0 -- the head of a group that promotes @entity4 said friday that he will lobby the new mayor to regulate dozens of costumed characters who inhabit the popular tourist destination after the arrest on sex abuse charges of a man dressed as @entity11 from " @entity12
" a 44 - year - old man was charged thursday with three counts of forcible touching and three counts of third - degree sex abuse , said detective @entity18 , a police spokeswoman
the victims were two females , ages 21 and 22
the alleged abuse occurred around 8 p.m. thursday at @entity23 and @entity24 46th street in the glowing @entity4 district popularly known as the crossroads of the world
" this is the latest in a long series of disturbing incidents that reinforce our belief that these costume characters must be licensed and regulated , " said @entity28 , president of the @entity29 , a nonprofit that promotes business development in the area
" we are looking forward to working with the new administration and @entity40 to come up with an equitable and effective regulatory solution
" dozens of costumed cartoon characters and performers in @entity4 have long solicited tips from tourists who have their pictures taken with them
city officials have struggled to regulate the characters without treading on their first amendment rights
the characters and performers range from the @entity53 to the scantily - clad , guitar - playing naked cowboy
" quirky is fine , " @entity28 said
" @entity28 told @entity1 that his organization had recently been in touch with the administration of former mayor @entity60 about taking steps to reign in the costumed characters but the ex-mayor 's term ended before any action could be taken
he said he has made preliminary contact with office of mayor @entity68 about the issue
@entity71 's office did not return calls seeking comment
" the solution is to regulate and license these guys like any other business and then there 's no first amendment issue , " said @entity28 , referring to complaints that an all - out ban would violate freedom of expression
a spokeswoman for @entity28 ' organization said the characters and performers are " not officially endorsed by the intellectual property holders nor the @entity29
" @entity4 , once a seedy neighborhood overrun with crime and porn theaters , has undergone a major facelift in recent decade , profiting from the draw of @entity23 shows and its bright lights
a @entity29 survey estimates that during high tourist summer months between 60 and 70 people gather around @entity4 dressed in costumes or performing
thursday night 's sex abuse arrest was the latest bad news involving the popular @entity4 characters
in april , a man dressed as the tv character @entity102 allegedly shoved a 2 - year - old in @entity4 after the child 's parents refused the man 's demand for $ 2 for posing for a photo , police said
the child was not physically injured
a 33 - year - old man was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and acting in a manner injurious to a minor
in addition , the alliance said , a @entity114 character was arrested for punching a woman in february 2013 , and a man dressed as @entity119 groped a woman in 2012
both incidents occurred in @entity4 .
