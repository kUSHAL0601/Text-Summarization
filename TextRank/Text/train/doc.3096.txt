she may be a disembodied robot , but @entity1 -- unmasked friday by @entity2 -- has a sense of humor
since the introduction of the @entity8 's personal " assistant " on october 4 , 2011 , people have used it as much to provoke witticisms as they have to find out the population of @entity12 or the location of the nearest @entity12 restaurant
in other words , @entity1 may not always be all that helpful
but she 's been an amusing party trick
some of the most common inquiries are based on classic science - fiction movie lines -- " 2001 : a @entity22 's " " @entity23 , open the pod bay doors " is a favorite -- while others rely on ancient philosophical queries
the @entity26 being what it is , an entire cottage industry has sprung up around @entity1 's responses
there 's a @entity30 called " @entity31 " and a collection of @entity1 posts called sirifunny.com
@entity1 does n't always understand , of course
like @entity34 or @entity35 , she 's sometimes at a loss when the question has nuance
on the other hand , you may not want to dig too deeply
when asked if she 's affiliated with @entity41 -- the people - killing , world - dominating network at the heart of the " terminator " movies -- @entity1 suddenly clams up
" i ca n't answer that , " she says
watch out , world .
