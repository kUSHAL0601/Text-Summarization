@entity0 -- buildings were burning at a prison in southern @entity4 on saturday , more than 12 hours after prisoners started a riot by smashing windows and setting fires
fires were burning in at least two buildings at @entity11 , an open prison with numerous one - story residence halls on a grassy campus
at least one of the buildings was destroyed , according to aerial footage of the scene
two fire engines escorted by specialist prison officers in riot gear went onto prison grounds saturday afternoon as fires engulfed large parts of two more buildings , sending thick black smoke into the air
the @entity27 said there were no reports of injuries to either prisoners or staff
the incident began around midnight ( 7 p.m. et friday ) and forced prison staff to retreat
police , firefighters and specialist teams of prison officers had to be called in
an additional 140 prison service staff arrived at @entity11 around midday saturday to help bring the prison under full control , the @entity27 said , emphasizing it was not an indication the situation was escalating
@entity11 is in a former @entity46 station in @entity47 , near the coast about two hours south of @entity0
it was converted to a prison in 1960 and houses offenders who have fewer than two years left to serve on their sentences
prisoners there are convicted of a variety of offenses , though the prison does not accept those convicted of arson , some sexual offenses and harassment .
