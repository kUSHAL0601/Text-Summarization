-- supporters of the rulers of @entity4 threatened about 5,000 university students protesting against the government at @entity7 sunday , eyewitnesses said
the government denied that unjustified force was used
elsewhere in the strategically important kingdom , riot police fired tear gas at protesters to break up the blockade of a highway , the government said
a video posted by an opposition party showed police appearing to fire two tear gas canisters at a man standing only a few feet from them
he doubles over after the first shot , and drops to the ground after the second , which appears to hit him in the face
the man is not obviously threatening the police in the video , which was posted sunday by @entity31
the opposition party told @entity0 it was filmed sunday near @entity33 , the center of month - old protests in the kingdom
about 150 supporters of the royal family tried to get onto @entity7 campus during the protest there , but only some managed to get in
an unknown number of people were injured , but it 's not clear how many or how badly
security forces tried to prevent the regime supporters from entering the campus , and allowed people to leave the grounds but not to enter
according to the state - run @entity48 , security forces intervened for the safety of students after clashes broke out
" some of the university 's facilities have been vandalized by the demonstrators in breach of the allegedly claimed peaceful nature of the protests , " the news agency reported
the tense standoff was one of at least three protests sunday against the rulers of the small @entity64 kingdom triggered by popular demonstrations that brought down the long - time presidents of @entity67 and @entity68 earlier this year
the latest protests came a day after @entity71 's defense secretary said he 's " convinced " that @entity4 's royal leaders are " serious about real reform and moving forward , " but emphasized that they must move quickly
defense secretary @entity74 was visiting the restive island kingdom , where he huddled with @entity76 and @entity77 and talked about the importance of engaging with opposition forces
" i think that the concern now is that it 's important that they have somebody to talk to and that the opposition be willing to sit down with the government and carry this process forward , " he said
sunday , the @entity71 again called the government to pursue talks with the opposition and to refrain from using force
" in particular , we urge our @entity94 ( @entity94 ) partners to show restraint and respect the rights of the people of @entity4 , and to act in a way that supports dialogue instead of undermining it , " said @entity92 press secretary @entity91
the crown prince similarly renewed his call for dialogue sunday , calling on the opposition to negotiate
he said talks could include discussion of parliament and corruption and that any decision reached could be put to a vote in a special referendum
the crown prince also stressed , however , the significance of @entity4 's security
" @entity4 's security and the safety of its people have never been , and will never be , negotiable , " he said in a statement
also sunday , some 250 young people organized a protest in front of @entity122 in the capital @entity124 , witnesses said
text messages exchanged between them and others in the area warned of regime supporters approaching from @entity130 , another island , but it 's not clear whether the warnings were accurate
police and anti-riot squads stationed near the harbor fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters , leaving 20 injured , according to @entity140
@entity144 cameraman @entity143 was among the seriously injured , his editor said
the government says protest camp tents were " removed , " but did not say how
many protesters mobilized to block off @entity149 highway to prevent the pro-regime groups from entering @entity4 's main island
the government and eyewitnesses disagree about how the blockade ended
eyewitnesses and journalists say security officers asked them to disband and open the highway , and they complied
the government said attempts by uniformed police officers to persuade the protesters to re-open the road reached an impasse and that a group of protesters attacked unarmed police officers , resulting in one police officer being stabbed and another sustaining a serious head injury
police then sought to disperse approximately 350 protesters by using tear gas in order to clear the road , the government statement said
" the @entity176 is currently undergoing operations to reopen the @entity178 and advised all protesters to return to the @entity33 for their own safety , " the government statement said
the roundabout has been the center of protests in the kingdom for a month
@entity4 , which sits in the @entity64 and is the base of the @entity186 , has been wracked by anti-government protests since mid-february
@entity188 -- a minority in the kingdom -- dominate the government of @entity4
the @entity193 majority has staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination , unemployment and corruption , issues they say the country 's @entity188 rulers have done little to address
many of them are in the anti-government coalition that has been demanding reform as part of the eruption of discontent sweeping across the @entity209 world for the past several months
they have staged dramatic protests and camped out in the capital 's @entity33 initially , protesters took to the streets of @entity124 to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy
but some are now calling for the removal of the royal family that has led the @entity64 state since the 18th century
@entity4 is in the shadow of @entity222 , a predominantly @entity193 country and antagonist of @entity4 's close ally , the @entity71
but @entity74 told reporters saturday he " expressed the view that we had no evidence that suggested that @entity222 started any of these popular revolutions or demonstrations across the region
" however , he said , there 's evidence that @entity222 " are looking for ways to exploit " the protracted processes unfolding in the region , " particularly in @entity4
" three hard - line groups in the @entity64 kingdom -- the @entity239 -- have united and called for the ruling family to step aside
the new coalition is calling for a democratic republic with no ruling family -- a step further than other opposition groups , which are calling for a constitutional monarchy
it appeared the hard - line groups represented a minority of the protesters at the roundabout
in response to the protests , the government has promised to build 50,000 new housing units and hire an additional 20,000 police officers , roughly doubling the size of the force
members of @entity4 's majority @entity260 are not allowed to join the force
@entity4 's king reshuffled his cabinet last month as protesters continued to call for reforms
he has also touted a " national dialogue " and urged @entity4 " to engage in this new process " and " move away from polarization
" journalist @entity268 and @entity0 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .
