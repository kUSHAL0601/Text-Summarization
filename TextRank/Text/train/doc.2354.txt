@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 football 's governing body opened disciplinary proceedings saturday against @entity7 over what it said was racist behavior by its supporters during a @entity12 match against @entity13
@entity14 said it was acting over " the setting - off and throwing of fireworks , and the improper conduct of supporters , " including racist chants and the displaying of racist symbols
the @entity21 and @entity22 will deal with the case on tuesday , it said
@entity7 drew 1 - 1 in the match against @entity13 in @entity25 on thursday , with @entity26 scoring for the @entity27 and @entity28 claiming a goal for @entity13
@entity14 president @entity30 urged fans who are attending decisive matches on saturday night to " conduct themselves with dignity and respect
" @entity36 plays @entity37 in @entity0 , while the @entity38 plays @entity1 in @entity39
" of course , there is rivalry and passion , and all teams want to win -- but we must remember that the results on the pitch are what really matter , " @entity30 said in a statement
" @entity12 is a celebration of football and i invite the fans , the vast majority of whom have conducted themselves in an exemplary manner so far , to continue to do so for the remainder of the tournament
" the issue of racism has threatened to mar the soccer tournament , which is being co-hosted by @entity1 and @entity59
members of the @entity62 squad claimed to hear monkey noises during an open training session in @entity65 , @entity1 , before the tournament started , though the @entity62 @entity67 opted not to lodge an official complaint with @entity14
in addition , family members of two black @entity71 players chose not to travel to the competition for fear of being subjected to racism
@entity14 has already taken the step of writing a letter to the mayors of each host city asking for a zero - tolerance approach to racist abuse
@entity14 's disciplinary body has also been busy since the tournament started just over a week ago
@entity36 has already been fined and handed a suspended points deduction for improper conduct against the @entity38 , while also still awaiting the verdict of a @entity14 investigation into alleged racist chanting during the match
the @entity90 was fined $ 12,500 after its fans threw paper onto the pitch during a meeting with @entity95 , with the @entity97 team also ordered to pay $ 6,250 for delaying the start of the second half
a @entity101 player , @entity100 , may also face sanctions next week after lowering his shorts during a game wednesday to reveal that he was wearing underwear displaying the name of an @entity108 bookmaker named @entity109
under the laws of the games as outlined by @entity113 , the global body which governs soccer , undershorts must be the same color as the shorts worn by the player
his shorts were red but the @entity109 undershirts were green
@entity2 's @entity120 and @entity121 contributed to this report .
