@entity1 is changing the drugs used in lethal injections , a move that will delay at least one execution scheduled for next month , the @entity0 said thursday
the state will stop using the two - drug regimen of midazolam and hydromorphone , the department said in a press release
the drug combination was last used in january 2014 on convicted murderer @entity14
witnesses said he convulsed and gasped about 10 minutes before he died
the @entity17 execution was closely watched because midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller , had never been used in a @entity23 execution
@entity1 , like many states , was forced to find new execution drugs after @entity27 - based manufacturers banned @entity23 prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them , @entity33 - based @entity32 , which manufactures pentobarbital
@entity1 will add thiopental sodium , a drug the state used for lethal injections from 1999 - 2011 , the department said
thiopental sodium and pentobarbital will be the only drugs used
@entity42 , spokesman for the corrections department , confirmed that @entity1 has 40 vials of midazolam set to expire april 1
the release said the the february 11 execution of @entity48 , and possibly others , will be postponed while @entity1 secures a supply of pentobarbital and thiopental sodium
@entity2 is trying to reach @entity1 officials for details about their decision
@entity17 was convicted in 1994 of the rape and murder of 22 - year - old @entity58 , who was seven months pregnant
@entity2 's @entity59 contributed to this report .
