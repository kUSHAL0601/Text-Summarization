-- anyone who has been deceived by a punchbowl at a party , or a diet - busting cake , will recognize the value of knowing exactly what you are eating
a new pocket scanner promises to deliver that power by giving the user an instant breakdown of alcohol , sugar , or calorie content before they consume
the usb - shaped ' @entity17 ' device was launched through a @entity20 campaign earlier in the week and reached its target within 24 hours , with devices available for as little as $ 149
the product of @entity27 start - up @entity25 , it uses spectrometry to read the " molecular fingerprint " of an object , shining near @entity32 light on it which stimulates the molecules and then records their reactions
an accompanying app then displays the nutrient values on a smart phone , measuring fat , protein and carbohydrate levels to the milligram , as well as overall quality
this underlying technology has been industry standard for decades in quality control of oil , sewage or chemicals
but @entity17 is the first portable spectrometer for consumers , and offers far greater versatility of application
the product , developed by engineers from leading institutions such as @entity56 and @entity57 , has been tested in live demonstrations with high accuracy
the final product will be sent to backers this year
" the first application is for consumers interested to know the nutritional value of what they 're eating " , @entity62 , ceo of @entity25 , told @entity0
" i often meet people who do n't know what 's in cheese , fruit and vegetables and have a hard time discerning what they should eat
" i think this can be empowering if people want to change their intake , whether for medical reasons or training , and can be educational in teaching us to make better nutritional choices
" uses do not end with food
apps are available to analyze medicine or the health of houseplants
@entity17 could be a protective tool for clubbers keen to check if their drink has been spiked , or patients to see if their pills are as advertised
the device could be applied to the environment as well as consumed objects -- an athlete could scan their track or field in order to optimize its playability
@entity100 acknowledges the device has limitations , suggesting it can identify elements between " 0.1 % to 1 % " of the overall chemical makeup , and that it would need to be more robust to be an effective guide for allergy sufferers
the sensor can also be disrupted by interference such as packaging
yet hand held spectrometry still represents a long sought - after breakthrough for the industry
" the challenge has always been calibration that works for different materials " , says dr @entity114 , molecular scientist and head of technology at spectrometry firm @entity118
" what they 've done is quite an ingenious approach as the device only measures the spectrum , and then applies calibration ( in the algorithm cloud ) and sends results , so the lab system and software have been centralized
" the success of the @entity20 campaign indicates a substantial market , and addresses a genuine need says @entity137 technologist @entity136 : " this is answering a question as food checking has never been automated well , and this offers a less tedious process
" @entity17 will have rivals in this new marketplace
@entity146 company @entity145 will launch their own hand held spectrometer this year , focused on food , while calorie sensing wristbands such as the @entity151 are also close to market
@entity153 foresees further innovation with the technology
" if you could have the same spectrometry analysis through the camera on your phone that would be a popular concept , and i think it 's not far off , perhaps two or three years
" @entity25 are providing a ' maker kit ' for developers to use their technology in any form they wish , and @entity100 hopes they can become as ubiquitous as smart phones with billions in circulation .
