@entity1 's story , which is the focus of the first episode of @entity4 's documentary series , " @entity5 , " shows that the capital punishment system does not always get it right
like @entity1 , i know this first - hand
i was the first person in the @entity8 to be exonerated from death row because of dna testing
in 1984 , i was 23 years old , newly married and living in @entity11 , @entity12
i had just served four years in the @entity13
i had never been arrested
this all changed on august 9 , 1984 , when the police knocked on my door at 3 a.m. and arrested me for the murder of 9 - year - old @entity18
in a matter of days i became the most hated man in @entity12
on july 25 , 1984 , @entity21 was raped and murdered in @entity22
a man approached @entity21 and offered to help her find her friend in their game of hide - and - seek
her body was found in the park later that afternoon
the police were eager to find the girl 's killer and ease the community 's fear
despite the fact that i did not match witnesses ' descriptions of the man who approached @entity21 , an anonymous caller suggested my name to the @entity43
there was no physical evidence against me
during the trial , i was convicted primarily on the testimony of five witnesses who were later shown to be terribly mistaken
it took the jury less than three hours to convict me
when they announced my death sentence , the courtroom erupted in applause
life at the @entity56 can only be described as @entity57
i still have nightmares about it
my cell was directly under the gas chamber
the guards thought it was funny to remind me of that fact
they would describe the entire procedure in detail and laugh at my fate
fortunately , a second trial reduced my punishment to back - to - back life sentences
i fought to stay safe at the penitentiary and spent long days in the prison library
at the time of my first trial , dna testing was not a well - understood concept in criminal law
in 1992 , i came across a book about dna testing used to solve murders in @entity80
my attorney , @entity81 , submitted a request for the evidence in my case to be tested
the prosecutor almost brought my innocence claim to a halt when she sent a letter with a devastating message : the biological material in my case was inadvertently destroyed
miraculously , the judge from my second trial had decided to keep some of the physical evidence and store it in his chambers
one day in 1993 i received a phone call from my attorney
the stain lifted from the victim 's underpants did not match my dna
the dna told the truth : i was not guilty of this crime
unfortunately , it would take 10 more years for @entity21 's true killer to be identified
on june 28 , 1993 , i walked out of the @entity56 a free man
my re-entry into society was not easy
when i returned to @entity11 , i had trouble getting a job
i was harassed by my neighbors
the @entity12 paid me $ 300,000 for lost income during the time i was wrongfully imprisoned , but i lost so much more than money in those eight years
during my 21 years of freedom , i have become one of many exonerees who , with the help of advocacy organizations like @entity120 , travel around the world to share our cautionary tales
even people acting in good faith can make serious mistakes
witness misidentification is one of the leading causes of wrongful convictions in the @entity8
since 1989 , dna evidence has been used to exonerate more than 300 individuals in capital and non-capital cases
approximately 75 % of these cases involved inaccurate or faulty witness identification
i am living proof that @entity8 's system of capital punishment is broken beyond repair
more and more people are realizing this
in a 2013 @entity145 poll , support for the death penalty dropped to 60 % , the lowest level in 40 years
@entity12 abolished the death penalty in 2013 , the sixth state in six years to do so
concerns about innocence , unfairness and other issues have led to a dramatic decline in death sentences and executions since the 1990s , according to the @entity156
the death penalty is fading away , but in my view , the end of capital punishment in the @entity8 can not come quickly enough
i am not here because the system worked
i am here -- like @entity1 is still here -- because of a series of miracles
not every person wrongfully convicted of a capital crime is as lucky .
