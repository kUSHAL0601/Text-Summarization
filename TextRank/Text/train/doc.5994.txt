@entity0 said tuesday that it had promoted a little - known general to a key military rank , a day after it announced that it had relieved its army chief of all his government posts
the secretive state 's top two military commissions have decided to give the title of vice marshal to @entity9 , according to a report by the state - run @entity11 ( @entity11 )
the @entity11 report did not say whether @entity9 will replace @entity13 , the departed army chief
@entity13 held the title of vice marshal along with other military and party posts before his removal
@entity0 said monday that it was relieving @entity13 from all his posts due to an unspecified illness
the news prompted speculation among analysts that there might be a power struggle between @entity0 's powerful military and civilian elite
@entity26 became " supreme leader " of @entity0 after the death of his father , @entity28 , in december
@entity13 -- who was appointed army chief in february 2009 , according to @entity11 -- was considered one of @entity26 's closest aides during and after his rise to power
there are several other vice marshals in @entity0 at the moment
those holding the title are considered to be eligible for key posts in the upper echelons of the ruling @entity42
not much is known about @entity9 , but his promotion is probably the work of @entity26 's uncle , @entity46 , an influential figure behind @entity26 's rise , according to @entity49 , a former commander of the @entity50
" he was promoted in 2010 to the rank equivalent to that of four - star general together with @entity26 , " @entity49 said of @entity9
" but being promoted to vice marshal means he will now show off his power at the political stage , " @entity49 , a retired @entity55 major general , added
@entity59 , a professor at @entity60 in @entity55 , agreed with @entity62 's assessment
" this follows a pattern we have seen since at least last march , " @entity59 said
" people who can be described as the @entity46 group are taking the upper hand
it seems @entity46 may be removing people who might constitute a threat to him
" if so , this may be the the first purge under the leadership of @entity26 , @entity59 said
" not necessarily a bloody one but the first case of a person of great political significance being removed , " @entity59 said
@entity0 observers may soon find out what 's happening inside the secretive nation , said @entity49 , a professor of international affairs at the @entity81 and director of the school 's @entity83
" if it is a power struggle of that nature , we will see some ensuing changes in top personnel , " he said
" unless we see that , ( @entity13 's stepping down ) is really for personal reasons , such as illness
" @entity49 said he saw @entity13 in april at a banquet in @entity94 celebrating the 100th anniversary of the birth of the nation 's founder , @entity97
" he did n't appear to be a very healthy person , " @entity49 said
" his kind of color is a little dark , and it did n't appear to be very healthy
" still , he said , he was " shocked " when he heard the news that @entity13 had been removed from his posts
" he 's a very formidable person there , " @entity49 said .
