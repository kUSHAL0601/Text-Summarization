@entity0 , @entity1 -- the police photograph is chilling
in grainy black and white tones , it shows 13 - year - old @entity7 sitting in a makeshift box , his leg chained
the look in his eyes is one of fear , fatigue and disbelief
he had just been rescued from a nightmare
" i was abducted by a sexually violent predator by the name of @entity20 , who had been twice convicted for sexually assaulting young boys , and he had taken me for eight days , " @entity7 recalled of his ordeal 37 years ago this month
" i was left to die
" as a survivor of a sex crime , @entity7 is one face of an issue the @entity26 will revisit tuesday : civil commitment , which allows the government to keep sex offenders in custody even after they have served their sentences
twenty states have such laws , including @entity1 , where @entity7 was held captive and repeatedly assaulted
@entity2 normally does n't name victims of sex crimes , but @entity7 , now a victims ' advocate , agreed to tell his story
on the other side of the debate is the first sex offender released from @entity1 's civil commitment program , and one of just a handful nationwide
" i served my time for what i did , and i did n't feel like i should be incarcerated again , " said this man , who asked that his identity not be revealed for fear of retribution
" it was a scary thing to know that you could be committed to a mental institution for the rest of your life
" the man said mandatory therapy helped him , but he thinks that could have been initiated while he was in prison
there is widespread disagreement on whether civil commitment is a @entity60
in discussions of the effects of sex crimes , nothing is simple or dispassionate
the practice of confinement in mental hospitals or treatment centers for those with severe mental illness has been around the @entity71 since its founding
around the turn of the 20th century , many laws dealing with sexual psychopaths were passed
over the decades , the laws were repealed or rarely applied
then , in 1990 , @entity77 became the first to pass an innovative civil commitment law specifically for violent sex offenders
@entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , among others , later followed
such " predator laws " focused on risk assessment and prevention of re-offending
it is a concept that the general public may not be aware exists
the @entity26 has upheld the use of such laws when the individual goal is rehabilitation , not further " punishment
" but it has another , broader purpose
" the primary goal is incapacitation , that is , protecting society from people who are predicted to be dangerous in the future , " said @entity97 , author of " failure to protect " and dean at @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102
" the second goal is to provide treatment to these individuals
" critics of these programs say behavioral rehabilitation centers amount to prisons , are often overcrowded and understaffed , and rarely meet the stated goal of treating the " worst of the worst " offenders to the point they can rejoin society
" the evidence is showing that it 's only becoming a detainment center for people they do not went on the streets , " said @entity120 , a sex offender who was released and now advocates for offender rights through his web site , oncefallen.com
" they have no hope of getting out , and the odds are stacked against you
" according to @entity134 statistics , 20 states use civil confinement , involving about 4,000 rapists , pedophiles and other sex offenders nationwide
estimates are that these programs cost taxpayers more than $ 700 million a year , almost $ 150,000 per individual
that is about four times more than confining them in prison
@entity1 passed its civil commitment law in 1999 but had never fully funded it
@entity7 found out from a reporter in 2002 that his attacker was just weeks away from being released after 29 years behind bars
once a victim , now an empowered advocate , @entity7 realized he had to act
" i did n't know about other sex offenders
i did n't know about the extent of the problem
i only knew one , but i knew that one needed to be dealt with , " @entity7 , 50 , said from his northern @entity1 home , where he works as a program manger for a defense contractor
state officials , he said , " all told me there was nothing to be done ; he was going to be set free ; that was it
" but @entity7 mobilized , lobbying lawmakers to quickly fund the program , despite a budget shortfall
it worked , and the state has become a national model , using a tool called " @entity170 " that assesses which offenders qualify for civil commitment
@entity7 ' attacker remained behind bars but was killed by a fellow inmate before ever going into the treatment program
the catalyst for the state 's change were once - dormant memories for @entity7 , who now knew that he had to tell his story
as a teenager in @entity184 in 1973 , @entity7 was walking to the store in snowy weather when a van pulled up and the man inside asked the boy whether he wanted to earn some extra money moving furniture
@entity7 agreed but instead was taken to a rural area and a metal box dug into the side of a hill
" he looked at me , and he said , ' i 've got bad news for you
you 've just been kidnapped
' " what followed was days of brutal rapes and beatings
@entity20 eventually left , and @entity7 would certainly have died if some rabbit hunters had not stumbled upon him after hearing his screams
@entity7 believes that civil commitment is not the best tool , but for the most dangerous predators , " it is the only tool we have that is 100 percent effective , because they are removed from society
they are removed from their triggers
" the case before the @entity26 on tuesday deals with a federal law that has kept as many as 77 inmates held in federal prison in @entity219 under indefinite commitment
the justices will decide whether the program enacted under the @entity223 is constitutional by infringing on a traditional state function
the law was named after the son of " @entity228 " host @entity227
the justices said in 2007 that a @entity231 law was neither double jeopardy ( second criminal punishment for the same crime ) nor " ex post facto " ( new punishment for a previous crime )
" we have never held that the @entity240 prevents a state from civilly detaining those for whom no treatment is available but who nevertheless pose a danger to others , " justice @entity238 said
courts have since been at odds with what kind of treatment must be provided and to what extent , to pass constitutional muster
@entity97 worries about the slippery slope if such laws -- federal or state -- are allowed to continue without strong judicial checks
" the main danger of civil commitment of sex offenders is that it provides a precedent for doing an end run around those governmental protections , and we all may be comfortable right now because we say , ' well , this is those people
it 's not our rights that are at stake , ' " he said
" i think we all ought to be cognizant of the fact that these laws set a precedent that greatly expands the power of government to take away our liberty , not for something we 've done in the past , not after we 've been convicted and punished , but out of fear that we might commit a crime in the future , and this is a very very powerful and dangerous idea , " @entity97 said
the white - haired man sitting with his lawyer outside @entity285 says he is no longer a danger to society
he served nearly eight years in prison for molesting three girls and nearly five years in forced civil commitment
despite that state confinement , including being the first of only about four men to be released from it , he says post-prison treatment helped him
" i think that civil commitment is unfair , " he said
" i 'm not against treatment
i have done everything in my power to help myself " understand the effects of sexual abuse
he said that being told just days before his scheduled 2003 release that he was being civilly committed left him feeling " hopeless
" shortly afterward , the man castrated himself with a razor in his jail cell
after the transfer and years in the rehabilitation unit , he was freed and lives a quiet life -- albeit under constant electronic surveillance -- with no further reported incidents , says his attorney
lawyer @entity310 convinced the @entity311 that his client had a constitutional right to contest his civil commitment
" i have found talking with people they are shocked to hear somebody can be sentenced by a judge , serve out that entire sentence and then say , ' wait a minute , we 're not going to let you go , ' " @entity310 said , calling it a legal " black hole
" " this treatment facility ... is a prison , let 's be honest
it has barbed wire and locked doors
" he said most in the @entity1 facility realistically will never get out
the high court case is @entity333 ( 08 - 1224 ) .
