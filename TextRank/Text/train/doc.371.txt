-- it seems everyone knows a college degree is important but few have a plan to keep it affordable
just this past academic year , tuition went up twice as fast as inflation and the cost of textbooks rose faster than tuition
meanwhile , the @entity10 recently reported that " wages have fallen to a record low as a share of @entity15 's gross domestic product
" Â as a result , the average 2011 graduate left school with $ 26,600 in student loan debt , helping to push the country 's total student loan debt past $ 1 trillion
combine that with an unemployment rate for recent college graduates of 8.9 % , and you see the impetus behind the @entity28 question du jour -- " is college really worth it ? " that 's a question that is easily answered by the 23 % unemployment rate for folks without a bachelor 's
still , the threat of leaving school with crippling loan payments does bring up a more valid question : should students continue to take out huge loans to pursue majors that do n't have a clear path to paying that loan back ? in other words , a job ? in an ironic showing of big government , @entity46 gov. @entity45 and @entity48 gov. @entity47 , both conservatives , decided to introduce plans in which state institutions charge less for @entity54 degrees ( science , technology , engineering and math ) than liberal arts degrees
" we 're spending a lot of money on education , and when you look at the results , it 's not great , " @entity45 told a crowd in @entity61 in 2011
" do you want to use your tax money to educate more people who ca n't get jobs in anthropology ? i do n't
" Â Â that 's a pretty good zinger but it does n't pass the smell test
first of all -- to borrow language from the @entity78 script -- i do n't think the government should be picking winners and losers
and state officials massaging tuition costs to lure students away from fields they do n't approve of does just that
there is a difference between an education and training
just because the vocational outcome between the two might be different does n't mean it 's government 's role to assign its value to society
not to mention the initial outcomes are not always black and white
for example , recent college grads with a degree in architecture have a 13.9 % unemployment rate , while @entity103 literature majors had a 9.2 % rate , according to a study conducted by @entity107 's @entity106
the report also found that communication majors had a lower unemployment rate than mechanical engineers and computer science majors
recent information technology majors had a nearly 12 % rate
instead of coercing students into certain fields by saddling liberal arts with higher costs , @entity45 , @entity47 and others should concentrate on providing families with all the information they need to make informed decisions
during his @entity124 , president @entity123 announced he was launching @entity125 , a website that consolidates costs , student loan debt and other financial variables for each school to help families get " the most bang for your educational buck
" the information is useful but far from complete , according to @entity136 , vice president of @entity137
" they do n't tell you what percentage of the students at the school borrowed , " @entity136 told me
" so you can report a default rate at a particular school , but if you do n't put that rate in context , it can be misleading
" also , the median debt number includes those that graduated and students that dropped out
so schools with high drop out rates and high borrowing rates come out looking far worse than what they actually may be
" still , @entity136 credited the administration for giving parents a tool to help them make better decisions
the next step should be incorporating research on which majors offer the best opportunities for jobs , so if someone 's daughter or son wants a degree that does n't train for a specific job , they can see what they are getting into in the long term
parents can joke about liberal art majors and kids coming back home after college , but it 's an infringement on civil liberties for government to strong arm students into technical degrees by artificially manipulating costs
any official who 's concerned about higher education in this country should address the skyrocketing costs , not demonize degrees they do n't appreciate
that 's for parents like me to do
i was standing in a long @entity196 line recently and decided to strike up a conversation with a college student who said something rather interesting
" what 's your major ? " i asked
" tv , " she said
the student went on to tell me that part of her focus was studying the history of television programming
i kept smiling and nodding at the appropriate time all the while thinking " i sure hope her parents are rich
" normally i do n't believe anybody should be telling folks what to study
but even i must admit the thought of kids borrowing tens of thousands to get a degree in " @entity221 " may require some intervention
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .
