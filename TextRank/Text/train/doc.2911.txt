-- the husband of a pregnant @entity3 woman -- who he says has been brain dead for seven weeks -- asked a court tuesday to force a hospital to take her off a respirator , ventilator and other machines , saying her wishes should n't be disregarded just because she is pregnant
@entity12 filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against @entity15 , both with the same goal : to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial
" @entity24 is legally dead , and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous , " her husband contends in the motion
notably , officials at the @entity30 , @entity3 , hospital where 33 - year - old @entity24 is have not publicly declared her dead ( though they have not disputed her husband 's assertions either )
@entity12 -- like his wife , a paramedic by training -- said the doctors told him @entity39 " had lost all activity in her brain stem , " and an accompanying chart stated she was " brain dead , " according to his lawsuit
the hospital referred requests for comment to the @entity49 district attorney 's office , which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit
it is legal counsel for @entity15 " in a number of civil areas
" noting it first learned of the legal action just before noon tuesday , the office said it " will file a response in due course " but wo n't have any further comment now " because litigation is pending
" the case will be heard by @entity49 17th district court judge @entity63
at this time , no hearing has been scheduled
hospital spokesman @entity65 said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a @entity3 law that states that " you can not withhold or withdraw life - sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient
" and last week , @entity65 told @entity0 that the hospital believed " the courts are the appropriate venue to provide clarity , direction and resolution in this matter
" @entity24 's husband responds by saying that " @entity79 can not possibly be a pregnant patient -- @entity79 is dead
" furthermore , he argued that her wishes -- relayed , he said , in conversations but not in writing that she not be on " life - sustaining " measures when she is brain dead -- should n't be treated differently than a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy
mom of pregnant woman on life support : change the law " @entity79 has a fundamental right to make medical decisions regarding her own body , " her husband contended in the motion
" ... to take those rights away from @entity79 , and force her to be subject to various medical procedures simply because she is pregnant , is a gross violation of her constitutional right
" last month , @entity12 discussed with @entity0 affiliate @entity106 his wife 's wishes and how their shared occupation had helped shape her views
" we 'd seen things out in the field
we both knew that we did n't want to be on life support , " he said
" we reached a point where you wish your wife 's body would just stop
" @entity119 , @entity24 's mother , said tuesday the family is not talking about the case but said she and her husband , @entity122 , agree with @entity12 that their daughter would want to be removed from the machines
as the lawsuit details , the story began at 2 a.m. on november 26 , when @entity12 found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor
at the time , she was 14 weeks ' pregnant with the couple 's second child
soon after that , she was taken to @entity15 , where @entity12 claims he was told his wife " was for all purposes brain dead
" the family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen
in the lawsuit , he claims subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and , in turn , the state law used to justify them -- amount " to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family
" " @entity24 's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance , but by no means should ( the hospital ) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of ' life - sustaining ' treatment , " according to the lawsuit
dr. @entity160 , director of obstetrical clinical research and quality assurance at @entity163 , works on complicated pregnancies and prenatal diagnosis
he says nothing scientifically in @entity24 ' pregnancy is black and white
" a lot depends , first of all , on how long the patient here was deprived of oxygen , or otherwise compromised
we can certainly use tools like ultrasound and @entity175 to sometimes see where there has been injury as a result of low blood pressure or low oxygen
but just seeing that things look well is n't the same as saying that things will be well , " @entity160 told @entity0
" those things ca n't perfectly predict health and outcome
and there are certainly occasions where as we look as best as we can tell , a fetus seems to be developing appropriately and meeting all its milestones , and yet after after birth , after delivery , there is evidence of profound compromise , " @entity160 said
@entity198 , a @entity199 law professor who helped write the applicable @entity3 law , said he believes the hospital is misinterpreting it
" she 's not a patient anymore , " @entity198 said
" and so i do n't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really do n't have a patient
" the @entity3 law states that a " person may not withdraw or withhold life - sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient
" @entity198 said , " the provision they seem to be relying on is called the pregnancy exclusion
more than 30 states have this pregnancy exclusion in their law
... if they 're relying on that provision , i think @entity3 law in that respect does not compel the provision of life - sustaining treatment
" @entity198 believes the lawsuit is a straightforward argument because the law was not written as a vehicle for making " treatment decisions " for patients who are dead and therefore beyond treatment
" if she 's brain - dead , then she 's already dead , so letting her die is n't really the concept
but can he say , ' take her off the ventilator ' ? i believe he can
" but @entity241 , a @entity0 legal analyst , said that she thinks the state statute as written is " ambiguous " and " vague
" " when you have these murky areas , you have to go to court , because courts provide clarity , courts provide direction , " @entity241 said
" and that 's why i think the lawsuit is the right thing ... to jump to the conclusion
" when ' life support ' is really ' death support ' @entity0 's @entity256 and @entity257 contributed to this report .
