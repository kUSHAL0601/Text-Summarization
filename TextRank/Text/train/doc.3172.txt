@entity6 if sen. @entity2 were the director of the @entity3 , whose catchy song blares , " everything is awesome , " the animated film 's title track would have been decidedly less upbeat
for @entity2 , everything in the @entity9 is n't awesome -- far from it , in fact
" i know that people are n't comfortable when i say this , but i worry very , very much of the future of democracy in our country , " said the @entity13 independent , speaking at the @entity14 on monday
@entity2 is known for highlighting what he sees as the ills that plague the @entity9 in speeches and interviews
he regularly decries the amount of money in politics , frets about the growing income inequality gap and attacks the " greed , recklessness and illegal behavior of @entity32
" but monday 's was down even more dour than usual
@entity2 said former president @entity34 's vision of " government of the people , by the people , for the people , " was not only " perishing " but " coming to an end
" instead , @entity2 argued the @entity9 was becoming a country " of the billionaires , by the billionaires , for the billionaires " who are now able to " purchase the candidates of their choice
" " the most serious problem we face is the grotesque and growing level of wealth and income inequality , " @entity2 said
" this is a profound moral issue , this is an economic issue and this is a political issue
" after a 30 - minute prepared speech , one questioner joked that @entity2 was n't laying out a positive agenda like @entity59 's " morning in @entity9
" moderator @entity60 quickly joked it was more like " mourning in @entity9
" " i have been trying to be more cheerful , " he said , adding that his wife jokingly says he should hand out " tranquilizers and anti-suicide kits , " after he speaks
the senator , who is entertaining a 2016 presidential run , was n't without ideas to combat these problems , though
@entity2 urged breaking up big banks , backed a $ 1 trillion investment in infrastructure and proposed making college free to anyone who wants it
he also urged raising taxes on @entity32 -- whose business is based on " fraud and deception " -- and passing " real tax reform " to pay for his plans
he also came out against @entity83 prime minster @entity82 's upcoming speech to @entity84
" i am not going , " he said
the speech has rankled some in the @entity87 because it did not follow traditional protocols for foreign leaders visiting the @entity9
the message , however dour , seemed to connect
after the event , people could be heard asking about the senators presidential aspirations and urging him to run
@entity2 will travel to key presidential states like @entity97 and @entity98 in the coming months where he will take this message on the road
if he runs , @entity2 will likely face @entity100 , the former secretary of state and frontrunner for the @entity103 nomination
@entity104 is " a woman i respect , clearly a very intelligent person who i think is interested in issues , " @entity2 said , adding that if he challenges her , he hopes to have a debate over climate change , the war in @entity112 and other issues
" it is not my style to trash people , " @entity2 said , hinting that he would n't go negative if he runs .
