-- in the wake of another round of national protests against police killings of unarmed black men , many @entity1 seem unable to identify with protesters or give credence to the goals of the # icantbreathe movement
i empathize with the vast majority of cops who keep the peace on our streets and enjoy majority support from their communities across the country
these protests are n't about them
these protests are about citizens ' rattled faith in the fair delivery of justice
in any civil society , there 's a serious problem when confidence in the rule of law is shaken
republicans who are committed to the stability of our society must acknowledge that these protests reflect real doubts in the equity of our criminal justice system
we all have a moral obligation to constantly improve it to the benefit of everyone
whether you agree that the decision not to indict former officer @entity43 in the shooting of @entity45 was correct ( as i do ) , or if you think the slogan " hands up do n't shoot " has been discredited because of witness testimony from the grand jury ( i do ) , @entity1 ought to accept that there 's a broader problem
look at the case of @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , or @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 , and at least a half dozen others
as a reform @entity1 who works for the @entity1 to broaden its base and reach new constituencies , i see no contradiction between supporting law enforcement and the policy solutions highlighted by these protestors
more republicans should champion the implementation of body - worn cameras on police officers , requested by @entity45 's family and supported by @entity1 law enforcement proponent @entity75
according to one study , body - worn cameras yielded a 50 % reduction in use - of - force incidents , and complaints against police officers dropped precipitously
we should be advocating these technologies to help protect the innocent and convict the guilty
consider that if @entity43 had worn a camera , there could be remarkably less dispute over the details of that tragedy
republicans should also champion " community policing " practices such as those employed by @entity93 , @entity94 , police chief @entity95 where creative engagement with community partners has reduced homicides by 50 % and violent crime by 20 %
pragmatic and nonpartisan solutions will increase confidence in law enforcement and support good police while offering more transparency and accountability to citizens who have lost confidence in the justice system
among the 2016 @entity1 presidential hopefuls , sen. @entity110 stands out on the issue of criminal justice reform because he 's consistently reached out beyond the base to communities of color
more republicans should follow his lead on policies ranging from reforming mandatory minimum sentencing and giving felons who have already served time the right to vote
on a recent saturday afternoon , i co-hosted an opinion panel on @entity0 with my friends @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128
while we usually represent contrasting perspectives on the week 's top issues , we strive to disagree agreeably and forge common ground
that was the case this past weekend , when we jointly agreed to end the show with a salute to the ongoing # icantbreathe protests
the photo of us four raising our hands was celebrated on social media by creative icons such as @entity141 , who tweeted , " inspired to see @ @entity0 opinion voices speaking out on left and right , " and @entity144 , " glad to see diverse and bold voices on @ cnn
beautiful statement of support for humanity
" it was also condemned by conservatives who wondered why i , as a @entity1 , was supporting a discredited narrative
first of all , facts matter
i 've made my support for the grand jury 's nonincitement in the @entity157 case clear
but right or wrong , " hands up " has now fused with a larger movement -- bigger than @entity43 and @entity45
i believe we all have an obligation , especially @entity1 , to engage the debate and propose solutions for improving our criminal justice system
@entity0 is and always should be the place that breaks through left / right , black / white divides and forges common ground on contentious debates
that 's what we aspire to in our opinion panel
our common ground broke through the tired divisions that too often dominate cable tv debates -- it sparked attention for the right reasons
it should be the beginning of a refreshing conversation about how we can come together and improve our criminal justice system .
