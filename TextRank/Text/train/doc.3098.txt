-- the @entity2 story may be coming to the big screen
director @entity4 and screenwriter @entity5 are developing a feature film based on the story of @entity2 , the @entity8 sergeant who recently returned to the @entity9 after five years in captivity in @entity11
if the film makes it to the screen , it will be familiar territory for @entity4 and @entity5 , whose movies " the @entity15 " and " @entity17 " looked at @entity9 involvement in the @entity19 and @entity20 through the lenses of a bomb - disposal expert and a @entity24 agent , respectively
@entity25 , @entity5 's press rep , confirmed that the writer 's production company , @entity29 1 , will work on this movie
" the @entity15 " ( 2009 ) won six @entity31 , including best picture , best original screenplay for @entity34 and best director for @entity4
" @entity17 " ( 2012 ) , about the search for @entity37 , was nominated for five @entity31 and won one , but not for either @entity34 or @entity4
a film on @entity2 will likely prove controversial
the soldier went missing in june 2009 in @entity11 's @entity41 province , where he was deployed with the @entity42 , @entity43 , 4th @entity44 , @entity45
he was released on may 31 in exchange for five @entity48 figures held at @entity49 , @entity50
an @entity8 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official briefed on the report
the @entity8 has no definitive finding that @entity2 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity9 military official has told @entity0
army general to start investigating how , why @entity2 left base other movies from the director - writer team also dealt with shades of gray
" the @entity15 's " bomb disposal expert , played by @entity71 , sees horrific events in @entity73 but finds he needs the adrenaline rush of his military work to function
" @entity17 " included a controversial waterboarding scene , which led to a debate over the film 's position on torture
those films were hailed for their gritty , sometimes documentary - like camerawork
as @entity4 told @entity0 in 2009 about " the @entity15 , " " i wanted to create a real you - are - there , boots - on - the - ground feeling
" @entity0 's @entity92 and @entity93 contributed to this report .
