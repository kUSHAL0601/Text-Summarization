-- @entity2 president @entity1 has suggested that some outside governments may urge rebels to attack international inspectors sent into war - fractured country to secure its arsenal of chemical weapons
" there might be countries that might ask the terrorists to attack the inspectors to prevent them from doing their job , and blame the @entity2 government , " he said in an interview aired sunday by @entity12 state broadcaster cctv
" at this point , this remains just a possibility and we can not know until the inspectors arrive in @entity2 , " @entity1 said
@entity2 submitted an initial declaration to the world 's chemical weapons watchdog last week outlining its inventory of the munitions
the move was part of a deal forged earlier this month by the @entity30 and @entity31 to begin @entity2 's chemical disarmament
photos : the omnipresence of @entity1 in @entity2 the plan faces several potential roadblocks
for starters , there is disagreement between @entity40 and @entity41 about how to determine whether @entity2 is failing to meet its disarmament obligations , according to two sources with knowledge of talks at the @entity46
the @entity30 wants the @entity46 's executive council to decide if @entity2 is in breach -- in which case a two - thirds majority of member states can make a decision , one source said
the @entity31 , however , want the determination to be made by the the @entity55 -- where @entity31 has veto power
@entity2 has agreed to a @entity31 - @entity30 timeline for the removal of its chemical weapons , but the plan has to be sanctioned as a @entity55 resolution
diplomats have said the @entity55 ca n't pass a resolution without the @entity46 first agreeing on how it would be implemented
the plan calls for international inspectors in position to secure that arsenal no later than november
veteran weapons inspectors have said securing and destroying the @entity2 stockpile could take huge numbers of people , including hundreds of inspectors and thousands of troops to provide security
@entity74 noted that the plan requires his government to ensure the safety of the inspectors
he said the weapons stockpile is secure , despite the civil war raging in @entity2
" chemical weapons are safely stored to prevent terrorists or groups from other countries from taking them over , " @entity1 told @entity79
one woman 's story : in @entity2 , inmates suffer the most ' large quantities ' asked if it was true that there are more than 1,000 tons of chemical weapons in @entity2 , he said , " @entity2 has been producing these weapons for decades , and it is quite natural that there are large quantities of them
" we are in a state of war , and we have territories that have been occupied for over 40 years , " he continued
" but at any event , the @entity2 army was geared toward fighting with conventional weapons
" the @entity30 and other @entity103 nations blame @entity1 's regime for an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside @entity106 that @entity30 officials estimate killed 1,400 people
@entity31 and @entity2 say they think rebels used the weapons
citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons , @entity30 president @entity112 called for authorization from @entity117 to use military force in @entity2
as the @entity30 threatened force to degrade @entity1 's ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks , a diplomatic opportunity arose between @entity31 and the @entity30 to put @entity2 's stockpile under international control
@entity30 secretary of state @entity125 said he and @entity31 foreign minister @entity126 hammered out the deal in @entity128 , and @entity2 agreed to it
@entity2 chemical weapons list more complete than anticipated @entity0 's @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .
