@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 woman -- who at age 66 gave birth to twins -- has died less than three years later , a local official and a family member told @entity2 thursday
@entity9 gave birth in december 2006 in @entity11 , after receiving in vitro fertilization treatment in @entity13
at the time of the birth , she was believed to have been the world 's oldest new mother
@entity9 died saturday at her home in the southern @entity1 town of @entity20 , said the family member , who identified herself as the wife of @entity23 , whom she said was a nephew of the deceased
i was at the wake in @entity29 , " said the woman , who declined on the phone to give her name
@entity2 reached her at the phone book - listed residence of @entity23 in @entity29 , the nearby city where @entity9 spent most of her life
the death was widely reported in @entity1
the local official told @entity2 that @entity9 was cremated at the @entity36 cemetery sunday morning but that the cemetery did not list that on its web site , which is customary , because the family asked to keep it secret
the local official , who spoke on condition of not being identified , said he talked thursday with the cemetery manager , who confirmed the cremation
she would have been 69 at the time of death
the woman 's twin boys , named @entity49 and @entity50 , will be three - years old in december
they are being cared for by a nephew of the deceased , a family member said
@entity1 news reports said @entity9 had been diagnosed with a tumor around the time of the birth , which occurred about a week before her 67th birthday
@entity60 tabloid @entity59 said @entity9 lied to a @entity13 fertility clinic about her age and said she was 55 , just in case they refused to treat her
in an interview last year , @entity9 told the paper that -- since her mother lived to be 101 -- she figured she would live long enough to raise the children
a retired department store employee who was not married , she reportedly lived most of her life with her mother in @entity29 , and decided to have children after her mother died in 2005 , selling her home to raise cash for the fertility treatment
" @entity74 did n't let her enjoy her children very much
he should have given her more time , " said @entity76 , who runs a fresh produce business in @entity20
" the kids are with a nephew of @entity9 , and his wife
they are being well taken care of , and are in great shape
i see them here often in town , " added @entity76 , whose shop is downstairs from the home of one of @entity9 's brothers
@entity76 said it is the brother 's son , a nephew of the deceased , who is taking care of the children
@entity95 , who lived near @entity9 's home in the same town , told @entity2 affiliate @entity98 , " this woman lived there , ever since those apartments were built
you did n't see her much
she came in and out of her house with her little kids , but not much else
