a short hearing was held wednesday morning before @entity23 judge @entity22 to consider @entity5 's petition
the special administrators of his estate -- in control of the purse strings until the will is probated -- did not object to the @entity16 's request
the cost of the burial is a secret -- kept under court seal by @entity22 's order -- but it is believed to include paying @entity15 police to handle traffic and security around the cemetery
the ceremony , which will be closed to the public and news media , is set for 7 p.m. at the cemetery 's @entity45 in the @entity47 , a family spokesman said
on july 7 , @entity7 's family and friends gathered at @entity20 's @entity51 cemetery for a short service just before a public tribute to the singer in downtown @entity0

the pop star 's siblings and parents have been divided over where to bury him , several family members have said
older brother @entity66 has said he wanted the singer to be buried at his former @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity1 , while others have objected
the burial comes less than a week after the @entity73 coroner made public his conclusion that @entity7 's june 25 death was a homicide
the coroner ruled that the anesthetic drug propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the death
@entity0 police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation into the singer 's death
no one has been charged .
