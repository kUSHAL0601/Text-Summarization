@entity0 of @entity1 is one of the world 's biggest , if not the biggest , stars right now
twelve months on from her marriage to prince @entity5 , she is credited with reinvigorating the @entity7 monarchy and arguably helping secure its future
it may look like @entity10 , or @entity11 as she is popularly known , has breezed through her first year of official engagements , but the apparent ease belies a great deal of hard work and careful planning
when a senior royal source earlier this month told @entity19 that @entity11 had " achieved her objectives , " it was no surprise that he used the language of boardrooms
@entity24 , which looks after after the duke , duchess and @entity27 , has deliberately taken a corporate approach to @entity11 's role
aides equate her to a chief executive and regard themselves as advisers -- she calls the shots but they are there to help
this has been the case since the outset
every element of @entity11 's wedding to prince @entity5 last year -- from the cake to the trees in the church -- were either dreamed up by the couple or approved by them
@entity11 did n't go into this naively
she had been @entity5 's girlfriend for several years before they wed and she had already experienced the dark side of royalty
at one point , she had been forced to move out of @entity52 because of paparazzi aggression
by the time @entity5 and @entity11 announced their engagement , they both felt she was ready for the spotlight
the prince made sure the palace gave @entity11 the support she needed and this year she got her own assistant private secretary , @entity61
the duchess has had the best available training , nearly all of it in - house
palace staff provide day - to - day support but @entity5 has taken the lead , with backup from his father , prince @entity70 , and grandmother , @entity72
the palace did n't know how easily the duchess would take to official duties , but when @entity5 said she was ready , they trusted his judgment
as soon as the couple arrived in @entity79 for their first overseas tour last year , it was clear she had already mastered the walkabout
she has since gone on to complete the full range of public duties expected of a working royal
@entity19 's royal source confirms @entity11 has completed her " induction " as a " fully fledged member of the royal family
" the palace is clearly thrilled
when the source talks about @entity11 's character , it reads like a wish list for a successful ceo : " she is strong - willed
she is confident enough to handle it
" @entity11 's composure is also down to the fact that she feels comfortable with her appearance
she buys most of her outfits herself in regular stores such as @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106
she occasionally visits upscale stores like @entity108 and @entity109 but usually arrives unannounced
often , the first a designer hears that the duchess has bought an outfit is when she appears in public wearing it
surprisingly , her outfits are often from previous seasons and the duchess is n't averse to bringing out old favorites
@entity11 is n't a fashion icon , even if she does have a huge impact on sales , but she does have an uncanny ability to pick something that suits her and the occasion
she knows how to make herself feel comfortable
another element to the duchess 's apparent ease in front of huge crowds of press and public is down to coping mechanisms
gallery : photographer 's year with the duchess once she steps out of the car at a public engagement , @entity11 usually homes in on someone in the welcoming party or crowd
while that person is delighted by being center of her attention , they are also helping her block out the frenzy around her
it 's not just a superficial exercise
the duchess wants to make the most of her visits , learning what she can , and she can only do this by engaging directly with the people involved
royal photographers often complain that @entity11 shies away from their lenses hides or behind her hair
the royal source accepts " she does n't look at the cameras , but it 's not deliberate
she blocks out the media
she forgets they are there
she has commented several times after an event that she forgot the cameras were there
" this may have helped with her first speech last month in the @entity7 town of @entity169 , which was broadcast live globally via @entity19
she had a potential audience of billions , but was n't told until afterwards
@entity171 would have added to the pressure
although @entity5 had been coaching her via phone from the @entity175 , an example of his hands - on role , her inaugural address was delivered in her own style : slow , controlled and measured
on occasion @entity11 has taken matters into her own hands
when a media frenzy erupted around her new puppy , the palace was inundated with queries about its name , but the duchess refused to let her new pet become a public relations issue
instead she wanted the name -- @entity193 -- to come out naturally , which it eventually did during a conversation with students at a school in the city of @entity200
the @entity193 incident illustrates that the duchess clearly sees a line between her public and private lives
according to the palace source , @entity11 treasures the normality of her personal life
" she goes to @entity209 , goes shopping and spends time with her family , " he said
" the palace takes an incredibly hard line on privacy so she can have a private life and go to @entity216 [ a superstore ] and @entity209
the princes get their normality from the [ military ] service
" and her late mother - in - law , princess @entity222 , read what the papers said about her -- as does @entity5 -- @entity11 does not keep a close eye on how the media is covering her , but is mindful of their interest
the royal source says she is aware of her stardom and that it stems partly stems from @entity222 's legacy
she takes the comparison to @entity222 as " a compliment " but is clearly doing things her own way
so we 've had the wedding , the full range of public appearances ... what next ? the source tells @entity19 : " the palace would never discuss , confirm or deny rumors about pregnancy until she is ready to announce it
" the duchess has passed her first year of royalty with flying colors , at least in the palace 's view
@entity5 may not always feel comfortable in the limelight but , according to the source , his wife may have found her niche
" for her , the public engagements are a joy
