-- @entity1 scored a dramatic extra time winner as @entity3 beat @entity4 2 - 1 in @entity5 to win the @entity7 final on wednesday night
it was the second of the match for @entity1 , who had put @entity3 ahead after 32 minutes with @entity10 equalizing for the @entity12 side six minutes later
@entity3 created the better chances in normal and added time with @entity14 a constant threat and it was the @entity17 star who set up the winner for his strike partner with four minutes remaining in the second period of extra time
he found space on the left of the @entity4 defense and his low cross was diverted past @entity27 by @entity1 's clever touch which took a slight deflection off @entity30
@entity4 , who had upset the odds more than once to reach the final , could not force a second equalizer and it was @entity3 , so often in the shadow of their city neighbors real , who were left to celebrate their second major @entity40 club trophy after a gap of 48 years
@entity4 manager @entity42 took a chance on the fitness of star striker @entity45 , who is struggling with an achilles injury that has ended his @entity49 @entity48 hopes
but it was @entity3 who had the best of the early skirmishes and @entity1 saw an effort thud against a post
but he was on target just after the half hour mark as an @entity59 scuffed effort fell into his path and he beat @entity27 to open the scoring
@entity45 was clearly less than fully fit , but his burst caused chaos in the @entity65 defense and when @entity67 crossed from the right a slight deflection saw the ball fall perfectly into the path of @entity10 , who volleyed home
@entity72 star @entity1 pulled a fine save out of @entity73 international @entity27 before halftime but the other side of the break saw @entity10 nearly add to his tally
@entity45 went off to give way to @entity79 and both sides had promising attacking moments as players tired
in extra time , @entity3 again looked the more threatening and when @entity84 cut the ball into the path of @entity14 he looked certain to score but put his effort into the side netting
penalties loomed until @entity14 did superbly to keep control of the ball down the left and his cross found @entity1 the more alert to end @entity4 's dream .
