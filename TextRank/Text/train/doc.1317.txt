a @entity1 sergeant jailed in @entity2 since late march for crossing the border with several guns in his car said friday that he had walked across the border on foot and stayed at a @entity9 hotel earlier on the day of his arrest
sgt. @entity11 , who also said he attempted suicide while being abused by his @entity2 jailers , has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the @entity16 side of the border , his vehicle carrying firearms he said he legally owns but are unlawful to bring into @entity2
" i stayed in a hotel earlier in the day , " @entity11 said friday in an interview with @entity22 's " @entity21
" " i parked my truck at a parking lot on the @entity27 side ... and i walk into @entity2 with a backpack with extra clothes and hygiene supplies , passport , wallet
and i decide to go hang out in @entity2 for some good @entity2 food , inexpensive place to stay and to hang out
" asked about @entity2 media reports that he had crossed the border into @entity2 several times before his march 31 arrest , @entity11 told @entity22 in a telephone interview from @entity41 penitentiary in @entity9 that he had previously traveled there four times " just to hang out
" he denied crossing the border with the intent of trafficking arms
he had an ar - 15 rifle , a .45 - caliber pistol and a 12 - gauge pump shotgun in his truck
" i know what they 're going to say , " @entity11 said of @entity2 authorities
" they 're going to say a whole bunch of lies
they 're already saying a whole bunch of lies
i just know that the truth will set me free
" source : new hearing set for @entity1 held in @entity2 prison an @entity64 war veteran , @entity11 , 25 , had recently moved to @entity16 to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder , according to his family
@entity11 described a suicide attempt with a shattered light bulb after being punched , slapped , cursed at , deprived of water and food , and shackled to a bed with a four - point restraint in a @entity2 prison
" i had one hand above my head , not both , just one , " he told @entity22
" i was laying on a bed
... when i got the opportunity , i decided to stab myself in the neck with a light bulb ... i was paranoid
i was thinking they were going to come and abuse me more and torture me and get information about my family from me
so i said , ' i 'm not going to allow them to do that
' " @entity1 tells of abuse in @entity2 prison , but says he 's still hopeful @entity11 said conditions improved after media coverage of his plight
@entity2 prison authorities have denied the abuse allegations
" i would like everyone to know that i 'm an innocent man and that it was just a big mistake and that i had no intention of bringing weapons into @entity2 or committing any crime at all , " he said
" unfortunately , i was n't treated right at the border and my rights were violated
" his mother , @entity101 , last week said her son 's next court hearing is weeks away
she has said her son immediately disclosed to the border guards that he had weapons and requested that he be allowed to turn around
a 911 tape released by @entity27 rep. @entity108 , @entity109 , appears to support the @entity1 's version of events
in it , the @entity1 is heard saying , " i crossed the border by accident , and i have three guns in my truck , and they 're trying to take my guns from me
" after learning he was in @entity2 , the 911 dispatcher responded : " there 's nothing i can help you with then , sir
you 're not on @entity27 soil anymore
" @entity11 asked whether authorities have a right to take his guns
the dispatcher said he should have seen large warning signs on the freeway saying it 's illegal to enter @entity2 with guns
" there are warning signs that do say that as you 're driving down the freeway , before you enter @entity2 , " she said
" yeah , i was hoping there would be a turnaround point , " he responded , " but there never was
" his mother has said @entity11 was searching for permanent housing and often stayed in @entity145 hotels
@entity27 secretary of state @entity146 told @entity22 last month that he had spoken with @entity2 authorities about the veteran 's case
@entity11 's family and friends also pressed their case in a @entity154 petition that had more than 122,000 signatures -- above the mark needed to garner an official government response
" i do n't know what they 're going to do to help me , " he said
" if they do help me , it 's probably just going to be behind the scenes and the public is n't going to know about it
" @entity165 : should @entity1 be in @entity2 prison ?
