@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 investors want to cash in on the country 's @entity5 fever with a bid to buy a 15 percent stake in the @entity9
@entity1 superstar @entity10 has been linked with a switch to @entity9 if @entity13 's deal goes through
@entity1 - born businessman @entity13 is heading the deal , estimated to be worth more than $ 70 million
@entity13 has masterminded previous sports deals , including introducing @entity17 advertisements in the @entity19 @entity18 , home of @entity19 and @entity1 basketball star @entity10
with his @entity21 - based partner @entity20 , @entity13 founded @entity22 , a company that facilitates sports and sponsorship contracts between the @entity21 and @entity1
@entity20 said that if the deal goes through , it would rank as the largest international sports transaction ever made by @entity1 nationals
" simply having @entity1 ownership will increase significantly the visibility of the team within @entity1 , " @entity20 said
" there will be much more coverage [ of the @entity9 ] on the electronic news as well as the printed news
which means the team gets a much broader brand penetration in @entity1 for themselves , for their sponsors , and for any other business activities that they may want to engage in
" the news has already sparked excitement among @entity1 's massive basketball fan base
" it makes me proud that the @entity1 will be working with my favorite team , " said a 14 - year - old boy at @entity0 's @entity45
" it 's an honor
" at the training camp , players practice in the shadow of a giant statue of four - time @entity5 champion @entity53 , who last month moved to losing @entity55 finalist @entity9 from @entity56
" they 're crazy for basketball , " said the camp 's founder and former @entity1 national basketball player @entity57
" basketball has probably become the number one most popular sport in @entity1
" @entity57 says @entity1 's fascination with shooting hoops stems partially from @entity5 efforts to promote the league in the world 's most populous nation
a minority ownership of an @entity5 team will take @entity1 and the @entity5 's love - love relationship to the next level
" it is a natural extension of what the @entity5 's efforts have been in @entity1 , " @entity20 said in an interview , " for @entity1 investors to look not just at sponsoring the @entity5 , not just getting athletes as endorsers of their products , but also for them to now move into ownership of @entity5 franchises , " the move is also expected to bolster the @entity9 ' marketing opportunities in @entity1 , where the franchise 's merchandise is already a top seller
some say that deal may even entice @entity91 , who has claimed he wants to be the first billion - dollar athlete , to re-sign with his hometown team next summer
@entity91 , or " @entity95 " as the @entity1 call him , is hugely popular in @entity1
it seems the feeling 's mutual
playing for a team with links to @entity1 , " should be fun , " @entity91 told @entity9 newspaper , @entity98
" it 's a big market ; they love the game of basketball
i 've been over there the last four or five summers , and i know how much they are inspired about the game
" there 's also speculation that if the deal is finalized , the @entity1 presence at @entity9 's @entity112 may increase by one
a move by @entity10 to the @entity9 has been at the center of discussion in the @entity1 bloggosphere
a @entity1 forum post reads : " i think there is around a 60 percent chance that @entity10 will go to the @entity9 because now the team is part - owned by @entity1 investors and they will want to sign him
" " this is all an unknown , " said @entity10 in the interview with his hometown @entity126 tv station
although @entity10 's recent injury may keep him off the court , it wo n't keep @entity1 fans from watching the @entity5 -- despite speculation that his broken foot could end his career or , at the very least , keep him out of the next season
" despite @entity10 's injury , many people in @entity1 will still be interested in basketball , " says @entity137 , the manager of one of @entity0 's @entity139
" @entity10 's our favorite , but besides @entity10 there are also other players that we like , like @entity147 and @entity91
" with @entity1 basketball fans in it for the long - run , the future may see more partnerships between the @entity5 and @entity1
" in the next three to five years you will see a lot more sponsorships [ with the @entity5 ] , " @entity57 said
" the @entity13 deal and @entity10 are just a piece driving this market
" some analysts say there 's a possibility the @entity5 and @entity1 may even tie the knot by creating an @entity5 - @entity163 ( @entity163 ) partnership
" at the end of the day , the @entity5 is still a league , so at some point they 'll want to have a league here on the ground , " says @entity164 , managing director of sports giant @entity165
" this is something that i 'm sure [ @entity5 @entity1 ceo ] @entity174 thinks about every day
