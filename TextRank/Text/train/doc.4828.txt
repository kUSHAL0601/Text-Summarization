-- after spending 125 days traveling over 8,000 nautical miles , the @entity1 is preparing to reach @entity2 , its final destination , on sunday
the @entity1 's arrival in @entity2 will not , however , be the 60 - foot catamaran 's first time to reach @entity8 soil
winter storms producing near - hurricane strength winds forced the vessel and its crew to take refuge in @entity14 , @entity15 on monday
originally , the crew had hoped to land in @entity17 , south from @entity14 , before heading to @entity2
after waiting out the bad weather , the @entity1 took off from its unexpected first port - of - call in @entity8 early friday morning with hopes to reach @entity2 in the next two days
brutal winter storms in the @entity22 made the leg from @entity24 the most challenging
one night winds gusting over 60 - knots surprised the crew , leaving them battling to prevent the mast buckling and losing the sail for eight hours
" i 've always been apprehensive of the @entity22 and this was my own worst nightmare come to fruition , " said @entity1 's expedition leader , @entity31
co-skipper of the boat , @entity34 called the waves some of " the biggest you 're likely to see
" once in @entity2 , the @entity1 will be harbored at the @entity39
it will remain on display for a month as crew members hold special events aimed at raising awareness of plastic waste in the ocean
the general public will also have the opportunity to visit the vessel during an open day
made of approximately 12,500 reclaimed plastic bottles and engineered using the most sustainable methods possible , the @entity1 is meant to be used as a platform upon which solutions to the myriad of environmental problems can be found
particularly , the @entity1 is hoping to raise awareness about single - use consumer products that are filling landfills and the sea
the @entity1 has faced several challenges since departing from @entity60 in march
engineering problems unique to a craft made of plastic water bottles forced the catamaran to make unscheduled stops , as has unpredictable weather .
