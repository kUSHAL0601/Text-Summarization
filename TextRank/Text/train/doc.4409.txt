-- a frail , elderly black man holding a thick , leather - bound @entity2 stood on the curb within earshot of @entity6 police
the cloud of tear gas that had recently chased away protesters had all but dissipated , though its effects could still be felt
" we 're supposed to love one another , " he said between coughs
" we 're supposed to love
" not far over his head a string of @entity18 lights with the words " @entity22 " glowed
in a few days the city 's festival of lights is scheduled to take place , complete with a parade
but now , another round of canisters of tear gas shoots out
yelling , screaming and gunshots follow
i doubt the festival happens this year
" burn this bitch down , burn this bitch down " could be heard from the crowd that gathered in front of the city 's police station as it became apparent officer @entity39 would not be indicted
quietly , residents had suspected that would be the outcome
but they still had hope
because another unarmed young man of color has been gun downed by police , and the person responsible for his killing will not be punished for his action
this is n't a tragedy or a mistake or a misunderstanding
this is a problem -- one that continues to plague this country because of the understandable lack of trust between minorities and police combined with the general lack of empathy between blacks and whites when it comes to cases such as these
in a recent @entity0 poll , half of whites who responded answered either " almost none " or " none " of the police in their areas are prejudiced against blacks , while 35 % of nonwhites held that view
a @entity84 study found at least 70 police departments nationwide arrested blacks at a rate 10 times higher than nonblacks
furthermore , " only 173 of the 3,538 police departments @entity84 examined arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups
" this is n't a coincidence or a fluke
this is a problem too many whites do n't see , and too many blacks are besieged by
i have literally lost count the number of times i have been stopped by police , but i remember the first time one drew his gun and pointed it at me
i was 12 , walking home from the store with a gallon of milk
he said i looked like someone they were looking for
i 've looked like that person ever since
the scenes in @entity6 on monday night reminded me of the climactic scene in the 1989 @entity116 film , " @entity117
" after police officers kill an unarmed black man , the main character , in his frustrations , tosses a garbage can through the window of a local business
a riot boils over and the audience is left with a bit of a cinematic @entity129 test -- what triggered the violence , the broken window or the man killed by police ? too many times the criminal justice system tells black people our lives do not matter
that 's why @entity6 was not alone in its demonstrations monday night
we 've seen the not so subtle , dehumanizing reminders play out so many times this year alone -- reminders that the rules do n't apply to people of color and whites in quite the same way
back in august , for example , @entity150 reported 18 - year - old @entity152 walked the streets of @entity154 , @entity155 -- the scene of the horrific 2012 movie theater shootings -- with a loaded shotgun around his shoulder
though @entity155 is an open carry state , the 911 calls poured in
police arrived and calmly asked the teen for his @entity164
he refused , saying he was carrying the gun " for the defense of myself and those around me
" on the video the teen captured during the confrontation , an officer speaks to him with his hands down , tucked in his belt -- and not on his gun
do you honestly believe a black teenager would have the same experience ? especially when you consider that same month , in @entity179 -- also an open carry state -- a 911 call was made about a man with a gun in @entity184
store surveillance video shows @entity186 picking up a pellet gun in the toy department before stopping by the pet supplies aisle
he was on the phone with the mother of his two children
within seconds of police entering the store he was shot , according to news reports
another example -- in march , police in @entity197 said @entity199 , with his hands cuffed behind him , pulled out a gun and shot himself in the back , committing suicide
six months later , the coroner report reportedly states the fatal bullet entered through his chest and that the gunpowder residue found was not consistent with a close - range shooting
and the list could go on
we still have a race problem in this country
and too many of us work harder at denying race has anything to do with the world we live in today than listening and empathizing with those who are hurting
but tell me , at what point will the kinds of killings that we are seeing time after time after time across this country be described as what they are ? racism
not the explicit @entity225 variety captured in sensational footage in documentaries , but the implicit prejudice
the kind that apparently sees a photo of a black police officer greeting his fraternity brother and interpreting their hand gestures as gang signs
a study in the @entity237 found that police officers view black children as less innocent than their white counterparts
that 's not an unfortunate " situation
" that 's a problem
this condition makes it possible for police to approach a 12 - year - old boy sitting on a swing in the park with a bb gun and moments later shoot him twice in the torso -- an incident reported in the @entity254 this week
" the officer had no clue he was a 12 - year - old , " @entity257 's @entity256 president @entity255 reportedly told @entity258
the @entity262 provides $ 400 million in grants to police departments around the country
@entity266 , president of the @entity267 , said she believes this money should come with strings attached such as body cameras , de-escalation tactics and training around explicit and implicit bias
" what we have continued to see linger is the perception of young @entity281 - @entity280 men as dangerous and criminal , " @entity266 told @entity274
" until we begin to reverse this perception , and until all @entity280 -- white @entity280 in particular -- believe in the humanity of black people , we will continue to have these incidents of violence
" but first , we all have to have the courage to admit the country has a problem , not just for minorities , but for all of us
talking about race does not instantly mean someone is a racist or race - baiter
it could mean he or she is aware of the world -- and its problems -- and not afraid to talk about them
what we are talking about are not accidents , or tragedies or misunderstandings , but a problem
that is , of course , unless you believe the tension in @entity6 is an anomaly -- that you can shoot yourself in the chest with your hands cuffed behind your back or that hundreds of armed black men could point guns at police , threaten to kill them and moments later everyone goes their separate way without incident
did n't think so .
