-- the @entity2 president has vowed to " never give up " a disputed oil - rich region that has escalated tensions with @entity2 and sparked fears of the two neighbors ' return to war
clashes between the two nations soared in the past week after @entity2 declared the disputed @entity13 region is under its control
@entity2 also claims ownership and has lodged complaints with the @entity17 and the @entity18 , urging them to pressure @entity2 to withdraw troops from its territory
the @entity21 on thursday called for both sides to stop the hostilities
" we condemn @entity2 's military involvement in the attack on and seizure of @entity13 , an act which goes beyond self - defense and has increased tensions between @entity2 and @entity2 to dangerous levels , " @entity25 spokeswoman @entity24 said
" we also condemn the continued aerial bombardment in @entity2 by the @entity35
" @entity17 @entity36 ban ki - moon urged both countries to return to the negotiating table
" the last thing the people of these two countries need is another war -- a war that could claim countless lives , destroy hope and ruin the prospects of peace and stability and prosperity of all @entity2 people , " he said
@entity50 , which has invested heavily @entity2 's oil industry , also argued for calm
" @entity50 again calls for the two countries to immediately stop hostility and respect each other 's sovereignty , " @entity53 , a spokesman for the @entity50 @entity54 , said at a regular news briefing thursday
during a rally broadcast on state media , @entity2 president @entity59 said , " we will never give up an inch of our land
and we have said it before , whoever extends his hand toward @entity2 , we will cut it off
" the international community has urged @entity2 and @entity2 to return to the table amid intensified tensions
@entity2 split from its neighbor in july under the terms of a 2005 peace agreement that ended decades of a civil war
during the defiant speech , the @entity2 leader told citizens that " @entity13 is in @entity78 , " referring to a border state owned by the nation
" we will punish them ... and it will be the last lesson for them , " he said
" if they do not understand , we will make them get it by force
we extended our hand before for peace and unity
" @entity2 did not immediately respond to the latest speech , but a military official vowed to retain a grip on the region a day earlier
" we will hold this position , " said maj. gen. @entity97 , a deputy commander for the @entity2 military
@entity100 , the @entity21 special envoy for @entity2 and @entity2 , has been in both countries recently , holding meetings with government officials
there is " an enormous amount of very emotional , very powerful rhetoric coming from here in @entity108 raising the stakes in many ways and that 's worrisome in and of itself , " he said on a conference call from @entity108 on thursday
but he said that based on the discussions he 'd had in both @entity108 and @entity122 , " i can say with confidence that virtually everyone i have talked to has said , ' look , we do n't want to go to all out war with the other , we need to find a way out
' " tensions run deep between the two nations , which have outstanding issues despite their divorce last year
unresolved issues include status of citizens , how much the landlocked @entity2 should pay to transport its oil through @entity2 and the division of national debt , among others
the fate of disputed border areas is also a point of contention
as long - simmering tensions soar , rights group are warning of deteriorating humanitarian conditions
" the deteriorating situation right now is making the overall humanitarian issues very challenging , " said @entity141 , secretary - general of @entity142
@entity141 , who is in the @entity2 capital of @entity122 , said supply lines at refugee camps have been cut off and failure to get key supplies before the rains will lead to a humanitarian crisis
in addition , there are reports of human rights violations
" the refugees coming in across the border have consistent stories of aerial bombardments and ground attacks " from @entity2 soldiers , he said
@entity0 's @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report .
