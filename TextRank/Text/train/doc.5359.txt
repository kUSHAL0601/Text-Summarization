-- @entity1 gave @entity2 a @entity4 boost by again ruling out a move to @entity7 giants @entity6
@entity1 's goals fired @entity2 's brilliant 2008 - 09 campaign
the @entity10 has been constantly linked with a transfer to the @entity12 , speculation which increased following recent claims that @entity6 had reached an agreement with @entity2 over his eventual sale
" there 's always speculation , not just about me , but about the future of players all around the world , " @entity1 told the club 's official television station @entity18
" people were speaking about me this summer but that was normal because of what i did during the season
" what people are saying now is not true
who says that is a liar because i am happy at the club , i want to stay here
i feel at home here
i feel very happy here
" @entity1 was widely quoted during a turbulent summer that he was keen to play for @entity6 and it appeared only a matter of time before the move became a reality , but now the 23 - year - old is pledging loyalty to the @entity42 faithful
" i love the fans because they have been brilliant with me , not just this season but every season
like i said before , i feel at home in @entity47 , " he added
@entity1 scored 42 goals in @entity2 's @entity50 and @entity51 double last season and after coming back from ankle surgery has netted 11 times this campaign
@entity2 go into 2009 handily - placed to retain the @entity55 title , in the knockout stages of the @entity51 and semifinals of the @entity58
@entity1 is crucial to their continued success and he used the interview to pay tribute to the role manager @entity63 has played in his development into a world class player
' i want to be part of this club with you
i want to win trophies with you
' he 's very important in my career , @entity63 , " he added .
