-- @entity2 herbal blends marketed as " legal highs " have become increasingly popular and as easy to buy as cigarettes
the blends of exotic herbs and other plants have been sprayed or coated with one or more chemicals that , when smoked , produce euphoria
they are commonly labeled as herbal incense to mask their intended purpose
these contain drugs that are dangerous and should be illegal
" @entity18 " is a brand name for a dried herbal blend that can be smoked
it produces a high similar to that of marijuana but does n't contain tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity23 ) , the psychoactive chemical in marijuana
instead , @entity18 contains synthetic chemicals , known as @entity27 and @entity28 , that mimic @entity23 by acting on the cannabinoid receptors in the brain
for another opinion , click here @entity27 and @entity28 are produced in @entity33 and unregulated in the @entity34
similar products have been produced and marketed under names such as @entity18 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity18
since 2009 , the @entity40 has been receiving reports of the abuse of these herbal products
@entity18 's key ingredients were invented by dr. @entity45 at @entity46 in 1995 during medical research on the effects of cannabinoids on the brain
he found no medical benefits -- only negative side effects
unfortunately , marijuana users reproduced the recipe , creating a legal alternative to marijuana
although the company manufacturing @entity18 is unknown , it is legally available for purchase in the @entity34 by anyone , including minors
in late 2008 , herbal incense - type products that were being shipped from @entity63 to the @entity34 were found to contain traces of another potent psychoactive chemical known as @entity66
it is classified as a schedule i controlled substance because it is a derivative of @entity23 with a similar chemical structure and pharmacological activity
@entity66 was also developed for experimental purposes and can be from 100 to 800 times as potent as @entity23
in 2009 , @entity76 banned the sale of @entity18 because tests revealed that it contained @entity27 and yet another potent chemical , @entity80 - 47 497 , developed by a drug company in the 1980s for research purposes
it produces effects similar to @entity23 and is three to 28 times more potent
spice is banned by some @entity34 military commands , where the potential for its abuse has been recognized
research has linked naturally produced marijuana to health issues , including schizophrenia
with synthetic marijuana being even more potent , it is frightening to consider its potential damage
@entity18 can cause increased heart rate , loss of consciousness , paranoia , hallucinations and psychotic episodes
users report that smoking small amounts results in intense highs comparable to smoking large amounts of marijuana
studies in 2008 revealed that users developed chemical dependencies , withdrawal and addictive behaviors
increasing numbers of children are purchasing synthetic marijuana products because they are legal and easier to obtain than cigarettes
because of the various chemicals being used , these substances are difficult to regulate
but the @entity40 is determining whether some or all of these products need to be controlled
more research is definitely needed
with young people using @entity18 more , some states are not waiting for the @entity40 and are moving to ban it
let 's face it : anytime you consume an uncontrolled or unregulated drug or a drug with unknown effects , you are taking a risk
products like @entity18 are not made in a controlled environment , and those who use it are playing @entity138 roulette
schedule i drugs are defined as substances that have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use
at this time , the evidence suggests that these synthetic marijuana substances should be controlled and perhaps classified as @entity147 drugs
making these drugs illegal makes it more difficult for dealers to push them to our children
it limits availability and sends a message that the drug is dangerous -- an extremely important message since history has shown that when youngsters perceive drugs to be harmful , they are less likely to use them
@entity18 serves no apparent useful purpose , and we do not need more addicted family members , drug - impaired drivers or drug - related deaths
the sale of synthetic marijuana is banned in @entity167 , @entity76 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity138
the @entity34 should move urgently to protect the public from yet another dangerous and potentially deadly class of drugs
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .
