-- @entity1 held her 77 - year - old father , who had collapsed outside in a @entity4 street
a passerby rushed across the street to bang on the door of a fire station , knowing that firefighters are trained to provide emergency medical help
but they would n't leave the station
the same thing happened when two more people tried to summon the firefighters for assistance , @entity1 says
" we looked across the street at the fire station
there was a firefighter that was actually standing against the fire apparatus , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity21
" everybody started trying to wave him over
" but the firefighter said he had to be dispatched first
" i even ran to the curb and said , ' are you going to help me or let my dad die ? ' " said @entity1
later , after an ambulance finally arrived , @entity31 died at a hospital
he had suffered an apparent heart attack
an investigation is under way and , so far , no officials are publicly challenging @entity1 ' version of events
" it 's an outrage , " @entity4 mayor @entity40 said at a news conference
" i was absolutely furious
" he said he apologized to @entity1 for " what appeared to be dereliction , " @entity4 news station @entity44 reported
" those who failed to respond as they should -- they will be held accountable , period , " @entity40 vowed
in comments thursday to @entity0 , @entity40 said he has " taken a lot of time with it
" the investigation is " being done as rapidly as we possibly can , " he added
the @entity57 and @entity58 told @entity0 it is investigating the incident , which took place along the 1300 block of @entity62 on saturday
" our duty is to respond to all requests for emergency assistance
if it is determined that proper protocols were not followed at the conclusion of our investigation , then appropriate action will be taken , " spokesman @entity66 said
the protocol is in question because , according to the @entity1 family , those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911
calls to 911 were placed , but a mix - up with the address delayed an ambulance , said @entity84 member @entity83
" two things happened , " he said
" one was that no one came out of the fire house to help this gentleman
the other is the ambulance that was dispatched was dispatched to the wrong place
this was a number of fiascos
" @entity95 , deputy mayor for public safety , said a " very new , probationary employee " was at the facility
the employee 's first response should be " to ask a senior person , and we believe that was done , " he said , according to @entity44
" the question now is what did that senior person say ? what did that person do ? did they follow protocols and procedures ? " there are no protocols that would prevent fire personnel from helping those in need , @entity95 told @entity0 thursday
" these are people who run into burning buildings
they work in the most hazardous conditions imaginable
" they cross the streets , they cross highways to get to people
this is why it is so troubling that we did not take the appropriate action in this case
it 's right across the street
" " it 's hard to get your arms around " the idea that this took place , he added
lt. @entity139 was the officer in charge of the station at the time of the incident , @entity44 reports
@entity139 did not respond immediately to an e-mail thursday from @entity0 , and a call to a phone number listed for her was not answered
also thursday , a spokesman said that two employees of the @entity57 and @entity58 have been suspended with pay in the wake of the incident
" i can not say who they were because it is a personnel matter and an ongoing investigation , but i can tell you that neither of them was the probationary firefighter involved in the incident , " said @entity153 , with the office of the deputy mayor for public safety
the employees were working at the station , he said
@entity31 , a lifelong @entity4 resident , worked for the @entity167
his daughter , in mourning , had kind words for the mayor 's handling of the matter
" i appreciate how seriously he is taking this because it never should have happened , " she told @entity44
@entity1 was n't immediately available thursday when contacted by @entity0
the firefighters ' union said the incident simply should never have happened
" we need to find out why it did occur and make sure it never happens again , " said @entity179 , president of the @entity180 , in a statement reported by @entity44
he added that on the union 's behalf , " i offer mr. @entity31 ' family a sincere apology
" @entity0 's @entity188 and @entity189 contributed to this report from @entity4 .
