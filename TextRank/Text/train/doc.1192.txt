the leadership of @entity1 must think they have hit the jackpot
the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in northeast @entity6 has been denounced by @entity8 president @entity7 and @entity10 prime minister @entity9
that has given them all the publicity they crave
their movement is now the top item on all global news channels
if , as i suspect , @entity1 sees itself as a suicide mission to inspire all muslims to follow them and wage war on the @entity24 , they must feel their hour has come
the final battle is about to begin
bornu state @entity6 is one of the poorest , most neglected parts of the planet
until recently i would have said the only surplus in that part of @entity6 was its long - suffering @entity33 resignation
now that has turned to anger
and this remote , dry , dusty corner of @entity6 , a place you would only visit on your way to the @entity41 , has become the new battleground between @entity43 and the western world
how ? the answer lies in a very telling comment from @entity47 , the @entity8 secretary of state
the @entity8 had , he said repeatedly offered help to @entity6 but it was ignored
that is exactly what the @entity6 government 's attitude has been to the northeast for decades -- and to the @entity1 terrorists until they hit @entity58 , the capital
then there was an attempt to clamp down but the security extended there never reached @entity63 , the capital of @entity65 state in the northeast and some 500 miles away from @entity58 , the capital , and another 320 miles from @entity67 , the commercial megacity of @entity69
so it does n't matter
just as the kidnapping of more than 200 girls did not elicit any statement from president @entity74 until more than two weeks after it happened
nor do the levels of poverty , unemployment , lack of education and health services and a fast - growing population in the northeast matter to the government of @entity6
its income derives from @entity86 oil companies so the government has little democratic relationship with the people of @entity6
sixty per cent live in poverty
@entity1 began as a fundamentalist but not particularly violent movement in 2002
the killing of its leader , @entity94 , while in police custody inspired its members to take up arms against the state
@entity6 police said @entity94 had been shot while trying to escape , but other reports said he had been summarily executed
the police force , which in normal times just collects " personal fines " from motorists and others for minor transgressions , is too corrupt to protect anyone
meanwhile the army , trained to fight a conventional war , went in heavily and terrified rather than protected the population
on this day last year @entity1 attacked a barracks , a prison and a police post in the town of @entity115
the military said the group killed 55 people and freed 105 prisoners
@entity6 is used to uprisings
a few years ago the @entity121 which produces @entity6 's immense oil wealth , was in flames
gangs of youths with heavy machine guns killed their rivals and kidnapped oil workers for cash
they too played on the neglect of the local population which could see billions of dollars - worth of oil being sucked out from under their feet while not a single road was being built
the government of @entity74 -- himself from the @entity138 -- now administers an amnesty program under which former militants receive payments to give up their arms
many of the militants were given jobs in the government and swapped their tee - shirts and bandanas for sharp suits and ties
but there is no such incentive to develop @entity65 state
it produces nothing and will not vote for president @entity74
unless there is a major political upset , he will serve another four - year term after elections in february next year
the big challenge in @entity6 for the @entity8 military and intelligence services is this : if they limit their intervention purely to tracking down and releasing the girls and killing or capturing their @entity1 kidnappers , they will have a brief success followed by long term failure
no movement like @entity1 can exist for long without some , at least tacit , support of the local people
and the local people have little to thank the government for
i was on the beach at @entity177 in 1992 when the @entity178 stormed ashore followed by waves of @entity180
for a few weeks @entity181 was quite peaceful , mission accomplished was the message
we wrote positive stories about the restoration of @entity181
the war has continued to this day
two years later i followed the @entity180 into @entity188 and then into @entity189 in the first @entity190
problem solved , it seemed
and i worked in @entity193 in the early 1970s where the @entity10 army was always claiming to be on the brink of defeating the @entity197
that very attitude simply strengthened them
have the lessons from @entity189 , @entity201 , @entity193 been learned ? military intervention is tough but easy compared with the long haul of development which must accompany it
the @entity207 people of northeast @entity6 need robust protection , peace and security in the short term but they also need education , health services and livelihoods in the long term
they need to know that the @entity6 government and its @entity8 supporters are on their side
can @entity8 provide that ? or will we see a magnificent charge , lots of shoot - outs and arrests followed by a declaration of peace , the departure of the army and then an even worse uprising two years hence ? the biggest challenge facing @entity7 and the @entity8 is the failure of president @entity74 to focus on the problems of northeast @entity6
together they need to make a long term plan to bring investment to the area , provide health and education services and build institutions
above all make the people there feel they are part of this booming new @entity6 economy which recently became the biggest in @entity69
