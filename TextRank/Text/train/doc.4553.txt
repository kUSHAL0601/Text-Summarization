a bipartisan congressional report has found a widespread problem with counterfeit electronic parts installed or purchased for use in @entity5 military systems around the world
two @entity5 senators said most of the bogus parts originate in @entity9 , according to an investigation by their staff
" there 's a flood of counterfeit parts entering the defense supply chain , " sen. @entity12 , @entity13 , told reporters at a news conference monday , " it is endangering our troops and it is costing us a fortune
" @entity23 @entity22 sen. @entity22 said the investigation documents the alarming " threat counterfeit parts pose to the safety of our men and women in uniform , to national security and to our economy
" " we ca n't tolerate the risk of a ballistic missile interceptor failing to hit its target , a helicopter pilot unable to fire his missiles , or any other mission failure because of a counterfeit part , " @entity22 said
a study by congressional staff found and examined about 1800 cases of suspected counterfeit electronic parts dating from 2009 to last year , totaling about a million individual components
tracing the supply chain , 70 % of the components came through @entity9 , where a variety of methods were used to misrepresent the parts as new and genuine
@entity12 , chairman of the @entity49 , tuesday holds a hearing on the matter and says he will propose holding contractors accountable for the cost of flushing out bogus components
both senators said the problem is partly the result of efforts in recent years to increase competition and lower the cost of supplying the military with spare parts to keep systems running
" we have found in the past the $ 500 toilet seat , all of these things , when you rely on sole contractors
but they said leaders in @entity9 are another part of the problem
@entity9 blocked @entity49 investigators from a proposed trip to explore the production and sale of electronics coming from @entity9 , saying it was a sensitive matter that could hurt relations with the @entity5 , the lawmakers told reporters
" they have it backwards , " @entity12 said
" they have the ability to stop this counterfeiting
it is being done in the open
we 'll show pictures tomorrow of where it 's being done
" " they 're gon na have to stop it , or they 're gon na pay a heavy price if we start inspecting all of their parts that are coming into this country
" the two men cited several examples where taxpayers had to cover the cost of replacing questionable parts with genuine components
@entity12 said the military should make sure its suppliers would have to pay , instead
in one instance , counterfeit transistors were found in a @entity113 night vision system used on an anti-submarine helicopter , the failure of which could block the crew from seeing a target and aiming a missile
it would not affect flight capability
a more serious risk to flight involves the @entity123 @entity122 , which has a cockpit video display from the contractor l - 3
the company found suspected bogus memory chips , traced to @entity9 that could cause the display to fail and cause erroneous instrument readings
@entity130 was the third company cited by the senators in the report they discussed ahead of tuesday 's hearing
the contractor said its @entity135 , a military version of a 737 , was found to have counterfeit ice detectors
one of them fell out and was rattling around inside the module on the airplane , according to documents from 2009
@entity12 said " if you put the onus on all of our contractors , which we should do , to make sure that the parts that are being supplied are legitimate parts , they will get that message back to their suppliers as well
" in addition to ranking executives from at least three @entity5 defense contractors who will testify about the problem of bogus components installed in their systems , tuesday 's hearing will include first - hand witness accounts of production , processing and packaging in @entity9 of questionable and counterfeit parts .
