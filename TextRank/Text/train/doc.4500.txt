-- @entity2 lawmakers are calling on @entity4 district judge @entity3 to resign over allegations that he hit his wife " several times with a closed fist " in an @entity10 hotel room in august
@entity4 sens. @entity11 and @entity12 of @entity2 released separate statements thursday calling for @entity3 's resignation
@entity12 said @entity3 has " lost the confidence of his colleagues and the people of the state of @entity2
" sessions said @entity3 's " unacceptable personal conduct violates the trust that has been placed in him
" according to a police report obtained by @entity0 , @entity3 's wife , @entity23 , suffered " lacerations to her mouth and forehead " in the august 9 incident at the downtown @entity26
he also grabbed his wife " by her hair , pulling it out , " the report says , leading her to suffer " bruises on her ankle , thigh and knee from being dragged
" @entity3 's wife was " treated on scene by ( paramedics ) but refused to be transported to the hospital , " according to news release from the @entity45
@entity3 spent the night an @entity10 jail after being charged with misdemeanor battery in the alleged domestic violence incident
earlier this month , he accepted a pretrial diversion without having to admit guilt
the program , typical for first - time domestic dispute offenders , involves a substance abuse assessment and counseling
@entity3 's wife was heard on 911 calls telling dispatchers , " help me , please
he 's beating on me
" she agreed to the terms of the pretrial diversion
following his acceptance into the pretrial diversion program , @entity3 said in a statement to @entity0 , " i deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve this issue with my family , where they should be resolved
i look forward to completing the family counseling that i voluntarily began several weeks ago and to successfully completing the requirements of the diversion
" @entity70 : wife - beating is not a private matter @entity4 rep. @entity73 , @entity2 , compared @entity3 's infractions to recent incidents in the @entity76
" if an @entity76 player can lose his job because of domestic violence then a federal judge should definitely not be allowed to keep his life - time appointment to the federal bench , " she said in a statement
@entity73 said she would support moving forward on an impeachment if @entity3 does n't resign
@entity3 's attorney said calls for his client 's resignation are " unwarranted " and said drawing conclusions between @entity3 and the " @entity91 case ... represents a failure of critical thinking
" immediately following @entity3 's arrest , all of his cases were reassigned to other judges , his attorney @entity94 told @entity0 , and " no cases are coming to him
" his return to the bench is " all dependent on when the 11th circuit court investigation is done , " @entity94 said
@entity3 was confirmed to the @entity105 in 2002
@entity106 : @entity108 , you can impeach @entity3
