is now hoping that @entity11 can join that illustrious list
for the hope for the city 's new franchise , whose working title is simply @entity11 @entity18 , is that it can have an intense rivalry with four - time champions @entity11
the first derby is scheduled to take place in 2017 , when the club is set to enter the league
and it should be a high profile event if any of the illustrious co-owners , @entity29 legend @entity28 , @entity32 football great @entity30 and her husband , @entity35 star , @entity36 , attend
" we feel strongly that this city can not only support but will really thrive with two teams -- rivals on and off the field , " said @entity37 , the @entity10 ' long - standing commissioner
@entity37 's enthusiasm for the new franchise -- which also numbers motivational speaker @entity45 and controversial @entity47 owner @entity46 among its diverse 22 - person ownership group -- is seemingly limitless
" this visionary ownership group will chart a course that will further elevate the sport in this great city and , combined with a new state - of - the - art stadium , accelerate us down the path toward becoming one of the top leagues in the world , " he added
yet the @entity10 is well aware of the need for caution given that @entity11 fc 's creation comes just three days after the city 's former second club , @entity62 , ceased operations following 10 years of existence
set up in 2005 by @entity66 , the owner of @entity68 side @entity62 , and @entity70 businessman @entity69 , the @entity32 @entity62 failed in its aim of tapping into the interest of @entity11 's sizeable @entity74 community
the fact that the club ground - shared with @entity11 may have hindered its ability to establish its own identity , which might explain why a new stadium for @entity11 fc is a leading priority
" we believe this team can become one of the most outstanding clubs in the @entity10 and a globally - recognized brand , " said the ownership group 's leader , @entity81 , in a statement
" today is day one and time for us to focus on developing a world - class stadium for the club to play in and for fans to enjoy
" @entity10 commissioner @entity37 wholeheartedly agrees
" there are four key elements to success in @entity10 soccer , " he said
" you need a community that loves the game , owners that are passionate about the league , and you need to have them be local - it 's important for them to come from the community yet support that effort with resources from international investors , which is very much the case here
" lastly , we need to have a plan for a stadium , whether that is a large stadium downtown or a soccer stadium that we start from scratch
" " we have all of those elements here
" in addition to uncertainty about the team 's official name , prospective fans must also wait for confirmation of who will form the front office , coaching and administrative staff
what is known is that @entity124 , who owns @entity126 's @entity125 and co-owns @entity35 's @entity127 , will serve as executive chairman
@entity11 fc 's presence will make the @entity10 a 22 - team league in 2017 with @entity18 , which is co-owned by @entity132 side @entity131 and baseball side @entity133 , and @entity134 joining next season
starting with ten teams in 1996 , the @entity10 will thus double in size to 20 teams as it enter its 20th year .
