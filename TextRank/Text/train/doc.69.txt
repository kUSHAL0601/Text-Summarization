@entity0 , @entity1 -- pointing to a graphic of a spider 's silk - spinning organ projected on a giant screen , scientist @entity3 said , " that 's the business end of a spider , " drawing laughs from hundreds in the @entity12 conference audience
" hey do n't laugh , that 's my life
" @entity3 held the audience 's attention with a passionate talk about her fascination with spiders even though they " jostle with rats and snakes for the title of the most despised animal
" there are 40,000 described species of spiders and @entity3 is endlessly absorbed with them , particularly with the fact that they generate an amazing variety of silk which can be used for many of their purposes -- and ours
spider silk , she said , could potentially be used for medicine in the form of artificial tendons , guides for regrowing nerves and scaffold for tissue growth and even body armor that could be more lightweight and flexible than any in use now
when she decodes new information about spiders in her lab at the @entity48 , she said , " it 's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me
that 's why i 'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spiders
" @entity3 is n't alone
@entity12 , which stands for @entity53 , is a nonprofit dedicated to " ideas worth spreading
" @entity12 has featured speaker after speaker for whom their subject matter is their life 's work
and not just on stage -- audience members are taking turns giving their own five minute talks on subjects that obsess them and volunteering their thoughts on a wide range of issues in casual conversations in the conference 's elaborately fashioned social spaces , where espresso bars and racks of organic snacks co-exist with promotional messages for the corporate sponsors
check out @entity2 's tech blog for @entity12 updates to the strains of @entity82 's recording of " @entity85 , " the conference theme , the presentations began wednesday before an audience of 1,500 and hundreds of others watching via simulcast from @entity89 , @entity1
prominent names from @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93 were represented
in a surprise appearance , @entity95 leader @entity94 , who 's the odds - on favorite to become prime minister if his party holds its lead in this spring 's election , sketched a plan for improving government without spending more money by increasing transparency , choice and accountability
and @entity109 , the former @entity110 agent whose identity was leaked , presented the case for controlling nuclear weapons before terrorists are able to explode a device in one of the world 's cities
here are 10 big ideas from @entity12 , which concludes saturday : $ 60k a year can make you happy psychologist and @entity123 laureate @entity122 says millions of dollars wo n't buy you happiness , but a job that pays $ 60,000 a year might help
happiness levels increase up to the $ 60k mark , but " above that it 's a flat line , " he said
" money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery , " he said
but the real trick , @entity122 said , is to spend time with people you like
save the world through games @entity140 , a game designer , says playing online video games gives people " superpowers " that help them improve the real world
we currently spend a collective 3 billion hours a week playing online games , she said , but we need to spend seven times that much time doing so to make sure we 're up to real - world challenges
" my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games , " she said
to do so , she develops social games that merge the real - world challenges with online gaming
anonymity promotes honesty @entity160 runs one of the seedier corners of the @entity163
his site , called 4chan , is known as a den of porn , hacking and anonymous rants
but @entity160 , a 22 - year - old college student , says 4chan also protects its users privacy and promotes honest discourse
without names in the way , people can focus on ideas , he said
" it 's anonymous and it has no memory
there is no registration , " he said of the site
" that 's led to this discussion that 's completely raw , completely unfiltered
" we can end slavery @entity192 , founder of a group called @entity194 , said he was surprised to learn slavery still existed when he read a pamphlet saying just that
now he 's on a crusade to end modern slavery , which he says is every bit as bad as the type of slavery that preceded the @entity200
some 27 million people are enslaved today ; and a person in some parts of @entity204 can be sold into slavery for about $ 5 , he said
but awareness and action could abolish slavery for good in 25 years , he says
moral ideas are right or wrong , not both writer @entity209 -- who is perhaps best known as a stern critic of organized religion -- says we use science to prove or disprove hypotheses , and we should similarly use evidence to say some activities are moral and others are not
" why does every opinion have to count ? why does every culture have a point of view worth considering ? does the @entity221 have a point of view on physics worth considering : no. " ' what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day ' @entity229 , president and medical director of @entity231 , which focuses on the connection between blood vessel growth and aggressive cancers
there are 11 @entity237 - approved drugs that inhibit growth of blood vessels that sustain cancers , but @entity229 pointed out that there are a number of foods and beverages that could offer substances that accomplish the same thing -- and could help prevent cancer
" men who consume two to three servings of cooked tomatoes per week have a 40 to 50 percent reduction in risk for prostate cancer , " he said
red grapes , strawberries , soybeans , dark chocolate , oranges , and green tea are among the foods with the ability to prevent blood vessel growth
the ukulele can stop war ukulele virtuoso @entity264 says his traditional , @entity266 instrument , which he learned to play at age 4 , can make the world a less violent place
" i 've always believed it 's the instrument of peace , " he said , " because if everyone played the ukulele , this would be a much more peaceful place
" @entity264 says people ca n't help but smile when they hear the two - octave , stringed instrument
he likened its tone to the sound of children laughing
$ 28 billion mostly wasted on placebos holding up bottles of herbal supplements , writer @entity284 spoke out against what he sees as a growing rejection of science
he says it 's resulted in parents refusing to vaccinate their children due to an unfounded connection to autism and people shunning genetically modified foods that have the potential of helping the world fight increasing hunger
the herbs , he said accomplish one thing : " they darken your urine
you want to pay $ 28 billion for dark urine ? that 's ok
" ' stop politicians doing stupid things that spread @entity309 ' @entity310 , epidemiologist who has studied drug abusers and sex workers who are involved in the spread of @entity314 , said nations that have followed former @entity318 prime minister @entity317 's example by creating programs to provide sterile needles to drug abusers are much more successful in curbing the spread of the disease
@entity324 such as the @entity325 that have resisted such programs have seen higher spread of the disease among drug users who share needles
every eight days , the toll of a @entity331 quake @entity332 , a professor in @entity334 's economics department , said , that every day , 25,000 children die of preventable causes , adding up every eight days to the approximate death toll of the @entity331 earthquake
though $ 2 billion has been pledged for the @entity331 earthquake , @entity332 asks why we do n't make the same level of commitment to prevent the daily death toll of children
amid the conference 's many ideas , one thing is clear -- the joy speakers experienced in having a receptive audience to share their deepest thoughts and feelings
@entity94 noted that politics has been called " show business for ugly people
" @entity12 , in some ways , is summer camp for brainy ones
