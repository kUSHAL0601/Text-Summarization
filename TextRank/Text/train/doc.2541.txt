-- @entity2 intelligence officials have detained the sister of @entity5 laureate @entity4 , the @entity2 lawyer and human rights activist said
@entity4 said monday that three men and a woman arrived at the @entity11 home she shared with her sister , searched the house and seized @entity4 , 47 , and her computer
" they have detained her so i stop my work , " @entity4 , 62 , told @entity0 's @entity15 in a phone call from @entity17
" she has done nothing wrong
she 's not involved in human rights work , and she 's never participated in any of the protests
" @entity4 's arrest came in the middle of a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests that has left at least eight dead , according to the @entity28 , although the @entity2 government denies its forces have killed anyone
@entity4 , who won the @entity32 in 2003 for her human rights work , left @entity2 for a conference in @entity35 the day before june presidential elections that sparked an earlier round of violent protests
friends , she said , warned her not to return to @entity11
the @entity5 laureate said she spoke with her sister monday , a few hours before the 9 p.m. visit by ministry officials while @entity4 was at home with her husband and two sons
@entity48 officials contacted @entity4 several times previously , her sister said , telling her to leave their apartment and warning her not to contact her sister
both women thought those demands were absurd
" not only does my sister not do any human rights work , she does n't do any cultural work either , " @entity4 said
" they only took her because of me
" @entity48 officials contacted @entity4 on wednesday and told her to tell her sister to stop her work and stop saying the things she says , according to her sister
@entity4 responded , @entity4 said , that her sister was 15 years older and would not listen
@entity4 's law firm represents seven members of @entity2 's @entity64 who have been charged with espionage
she said she is certain @entity2 officials are trying to intimidate her by harassing her sister , but , she said , she will not back down
" they want to intimidate me , " she said
" the only thing they want is for me to change my work
" " i am worried
i 'm worried because she [ @entity4 ] was detained because of the work i do , " she said , adding it was that work that made @entity4 a target
" she 's not interested in this kind of work
she 's not involved in this kind of work
" @entity4 said she advised her sister to contact an attorney when @entity48 officials first began approaching her and that she did so
@entity4 and her husband are professors of dentistry at @entity83 in @entity11 , @entity4 said , and @entity4 's husband also has a private dental practice .
