-- if this yacht could talk , one can only imagine the stories it would tell about one of the most high - profile romances of the 20th century
the stately superyacht @entity7 is n't just a gorgeous 99 - meter vessel
it 's the palatial setting where billionaire shipping tycoon @entity10 married @entity11 , the former wife of @entity13 president @entity12
now the luxury liner which played host to the @entity16 of 1950s high society -- including @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 -- has gone on sale for a whopping $ 32 million
known for its lavish parties , the elegant ship may well be called the " @entity28 , " for its notorious on board romances -- and even a royal wedding
in 1956 @entity29 of @entity30 and @entity13 screen siren @entity31 held their wedding reception on the boat , which accommodates 36 guests in 18 sumptuous staterooms
@entity10 ' own love affair with opera singer @entity39 also played out on board , as they cruised exotic locations across @entity42 in the company of @entity45 stars @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48
however , the affair ended abruptly when the tycoon courted president @entity12 's widow , @entity51 , later marrying on the very same yacht in 1968 , near his private island of @entity55
" @entity10 saw @entity7 as a powerful symbol of his growing business empire , " said @entity56 , chairman of the yacht company @entity57 , which plans to sell the vessel mid-august
" it really was the last word in opulence and many personalities were attracted by its ability to offer them some privacy , not just by its magnificence
" it 's been quite a journey for the boat which began life in 1943 as a @entity73 surplus @entity72 frigate
a decade later , @entity10 bought the boat for just $ 34,000 , gutting the interior and spending $ 4 million -- the equivalent of $ 45 million today -- converting her into one of the luxurious superyachts in the world
in 1975 , @entity10 died and the yacht was left to his daughter , @entity82 , in his will
she in turn bequeathed it to the @entity88 government as a presidential yacht
more than 20 years later , the tired - looking vessel was restored to its former glory , and now boasts an art deco dining room where @entity39 and @entity18 used to perform , an atrium with onyx pillars , and a mosaic pool which converts into a dance floor .
