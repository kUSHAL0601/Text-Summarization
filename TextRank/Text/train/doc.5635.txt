@entity0 -- a member of @entity5 's family walked into a @entity7 , @entity8 , police station in the 1980s and reported that @entity5 told relatives and others that he had killed a boy in @entity0 and threw the body near a @entity13 -- but there 's no indication anything came out of that report , the family member told @entity1
" you feel like they did n't believe you
i felt empty and a little bit mad , " the relative said
" i was expecting something else
" now , 33 years after @entity21 disappeared , @entity5 stands accused of choking to death the 6 - year - old youngster after luring him to the basement of a corner grocery store in @entity0 , and of throwing away his body inside a trash bag
the family member , who @entity1 has agreed to not identify , said there was no receipt of paperwork to document the information provided -- nor was the relative ever contacted again about the report
" @entity36 asked whether i was mad " at @entity5 or had an ulterior motive , the source added
@entity5 allegedly confided the information to a @entity8 church prayer group that included some members of his family and his then - spiritual adviser , the source told @entity1
@entity44 , a leader of the prayer group , declined comment monday on @entity5 or the prayer group , citing authorities who told him not to talk to the media
pastor : wife of suspect in @entity21 case ' absolutely shell - shocked ' at 19 , shortly after @entity56 's disappearance on may 25 , 1979 , @entity5 left his job as a stock clerk and returned to his mother 's home in @entity7 , @entity8
the attempt to tell police that @entity5 might have killed a child happened a few years after that
@entity1 has not been able to reach @entity7 police for comment
" when he moved home , he was really nervous and shaking all the time , " the family source said of @entity5
" he constantly had diarrhea , and he spent a lot of time just looking out the window , " the source added , saying the behavior was out of character for @entity5
@entity5 also allegedly told his first wife that he had killed a boy , according to the source
@entity1 has not been able to reach her
the two divorced , and @entity5 has remarried
neighbors say suspect in @entity56 killing lived a quiet life with his family before @entity5 was picked up for questioning last week , the family source was visited by police and asked about any previous confessions from @entity5 about killing someone
surprised to be contacted after so many years had gone by without hearing anything , the family member asked , " what took you so long ? " the family member did n't get an answer and does n't know what prompted police to visit
the relative had no explanation for why no other relative spoke up years ago
" maybe they did n't want to get involved , " the source said
" i was n't going to stay quiet
" the family source said he was surprised on friday , when @entity5 ' defense attorney announced in court that his client has a long psychiatric history , is on medication for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , and suffers from hallucinations
attorney @entity114 said @entity5 -- who was on suicide watch at @entity116 on sunday -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation
@entity0 police say they tracked down @entity5 after a tipster they wo n't identify contacted police last month
the person came forward after seeing publicity surrounding the @entity126 's search of an unrelated basement in @entity130 's @entity129 neighborhood , a half block from @entity21 ' home
@entity0 police have not responded to a request for comment about the latest development
but in a press conference thursday , @entity0 police commissioner @entity136 said no family members or spiritual advisers ever contacted police
it 's not clear whether @entity136 was referring to the @entity142 or any police department
meanwhile , police have asked @entity0 's @entity145 for trash pickup and dumping records dating back to 1979 , said @entity148 , a spokesman for the department
" we said we would search for those handwritten logs , " he said
however , he said , businesses in the area could have hired private companies to haul away their trash , and " we would have no records of their pickup schedules
" the @entity56 case was the first of several high - profile cases that catapulted concern about missing children to the forefront of national consciousness
the relative of @entity5 is concerned about what @entity21 's parents must be going through
" at this moment , they must be hoping this is the right guy , and they do n't go through this again , " the source said
" it 's going to be like a nightmare for them , if it turns out it 's not @entity5
" " they must want to know the truth and get this over with , " the relative added
" at least they will know
