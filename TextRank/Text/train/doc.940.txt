-- @entity1 took his first @entity3 win of the season after teammate @entity5 crashed on the final lap at the @entity7 motogp
defending world champion @entity5 was battling with his @entity9 colleague @entity1 at the @entity10 before sliding off his bike prior to the final few corners
the @entity14 's error handed @entity15 second place and means he now leads the world championship standings by 16 points from @entity1
@entity5 slipped to third and was distraught to have thrown away a winning position
he told the @entity21 : " i 'm pretty disappointed , i had planned to go for my ' win or bin ' effort in the last corner not that one ! " i felt confident but as soon as i tried to turn in a little more , the front went
i was already off the brakes and not in the hard braking area , as soon as i eased of the brakes i guess the weight came off the front and down i went
" i 'm frustrated i was n't allowed to get up and try and score some points , the bike was perfect , but the marshals pushed me away
" if we can continue this momentum for the rest of the season then we should n't be so worried for the championship
" it was @entity1 's third consecutive @entity7 @entity3 victory and he was quickest off the blocks , beating @entity5 , who started on pole , to the first corner from third spot
@entity5 did reclaim the lead by the end of the opening lap and as the race went on , the pair pulled away from @entity15 who was a full eight seconds back
but @entity5 lost his front wheel going into to one of the final turns and ended up unhurt on the gravel , ensuring a smooth last few corners for @entity1
after the race the @entity55 told reporters : " at the start i was n't comfortable because of changes to my bike
as i became used to all the changes i passed @entity5 , and was feeling good
" towards the end i had to fight for the win , on the last lap i was racing at my maximum
" the next race on the @entity3 calendar takes place in @entity67 on july 15
