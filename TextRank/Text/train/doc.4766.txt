former @entity1 sen. @entity0 became the first person from either major party to officially launch a presidential exploratory committee to consider running for president in 2016
@entity0 announced the exploratory committee wednesday in a 14 - minute online video in which he touts his military background and explains his motivations for considering a @entity11 bid
@entity0 , a @entity12 , would seek the @entity14 nomination for president , likely facing off against former secretary of state @entity15 , who is widely expected to announce her candidacy in the coming months
" we desperately need to fix our country and to reinforce the values that have sustained us for more than two centuries , many of which have fallen by the wayside in the nasty debates of the last several years , " @entity0 explains in the video
@entity0 , a @entity26 veteran who fought in @entity27 , served one term as a @entity14 senator from @entity1 , but also served in @entity32 president @entity31 's administration as assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs before becoming secretary of the navy
@entity0 stresses in his announcement that he is " not a career politician " though he has " proudly spent several periods in government
" @entity0 spends much of the video discussing his and his family 's military background
his father served 26 years in the @entity43 and he , his brother and his son all joined the @entity26
" i fought on one of the @entity27 's harshest battlefields , " @entity0 says in the video
@entity0 also taps into the public 's frustration with " divisive , paralyzed nature of our government " and hits on popular @entity14 themes like poverty and income inequality , signaling that the @entity14 needs to head in a new direction to help the poor
" the @entity14 used to be the place where people like these could come not for a handout but for an honest handshake , good full - time jobs , quality education , health care they can afford , and the vital , overriding belief that we 're all in this together and the system is not rigged , " @entity0 says
" we can get there again
" launching an exploratory committee is the first step candidates take before formally announcing their candidacy for president and allows them to begin raising funds for an eventual campaign
@entity0 also seems mindful that he would be an underdog heading into @entity14 primaries -- especially if @entity80 decides to run -- but notes that he won his @entity82 seat in @entity1 despite having " no money and no staff " when he announced his candidacy and being " more than 30 points behind in the polls
