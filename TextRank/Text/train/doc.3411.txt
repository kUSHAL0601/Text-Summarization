@entity0 -- @entity3 earned a @entity4 for his actions during @entity6 but because of what the @entity8 government acknowledges was racism against african - americans who performed heroically in the war , it took more than 50 years for him to get what he had earned
@entity3 , one of only seven african - americans to receive the nation 's highest military honor from @entity6 , died tuesday at his home in @entity18 , according to his hometown police and coroner 's offices
he passed away after a long battle with cancer
his wife and members of his family were by his side
he was 90 years old
@entity3 was orphaned at the age of 4 , and was raised first by his grandparents and later at @entity31 's @entity30 in @entity32
he joined the @entity33 six months before the @entity35 attack and was part of the @entity37 , the first unit of " colored " soldiers to see combat in @entity6 he eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant and was leading a platoon against entrenched @entity44 machine gun nests near @entity45 , @entity46 , on april 5 , 1945
his official @entity4 citation describes what he did : " when his company was stopped by the concentration of fire from several machine gun emplacements , he crawled to one position and destroyed it , killing three @entity44
continuing forward , he attacked and enemy observation post and killed two occupants
with the aid of one of his men , lieutenant @entity3 attacked two more machine gun nests , killing or wounding the four enemy soldiers occupying these positions
he then covered the evacuation of the wounded personnel of his company by occupying an exposed position and drawing the enemy 's fire
" after spending the better part of a day putting his life at risk to lead his unit , @entity3 was back in action the next evening : " on the following night lieutenant @entity3 voluntarily led a battalion advance through enemy mine fields and heavy fire toward the division objective
" @entity3 was originally awarded the @entity33 's @entity76 for his action
but in the early 1990s , a study was done to find why none of the more than 400 @entity81 recipients was black
the study found " a racial disparity in the way @entity4 recipients were selected
" seven @entity87 heroes from @entity6 were chosen to receive the @entity4 from president @entity88
four of them had died in the war , and two others had died in the time since the war
only @entity3 was at the @entity93 to have the iconic star and pale blue ribbon draped around his neck
during an interview with @entity1 before the @entity93 ceremony on january 13 , 1997 , @entity3 spoke about the racism that delayed recognition of him and his fellow @entity4 recipients : " as i look back on it , it really makes me feel sad that we did our job , we fought , but we were n't appreciated " after the @entity93 ceremony , @entity3 told @entity1 , " i still do n't feel like a hero
i just feel i was a soldier and i did my job , and i think i was rewarded for it
" @entity3 is survived by his wife , @entity112 , and five children
he is expected to be buried at @entity114 with full military honors .
