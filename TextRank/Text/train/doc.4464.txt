if confirmed by the @entity13 , she will assume a cabinet - rank position as head of the @entity17 agency that assists the president on budget matters

the stakes are especially high now , with @entity2 engaged in a protracted , heated battle with the @entity39 - led @entity38 about the size and shape of the federal government 's budget

@entity53 ' hopeful ' on preventing government shutdown @entity56 ceo @entity55 congratulated @entity1 on her upcoming nomination , calling her " a strong leader who both masters the details and has a clear vision for making big things happen
" " she cares deeply about people ( and ) she understands business and the role that business , government and civil society must play to build a strong economy that provides opportunities and strengthens communities across the country , " @entity55 said in a statement
beyond her more recent work in corporate philanthropy -- including as the chief operating officer and founding president of the @entity79 at the @entity80 through 2011 -- @entity1 has experience in government
she worked in president @entity84 's administration under then - treasury secretary @entity85 , something that she has in common with @entity32 and @entity87 , another @entity4 chief in the @entity2 administration
for parts of 1997 and 1998 , @entity1 was a deputy chief of staff to @entity84 , according to her profile on @entity92 's website , where she is a member of its board of directors
she served as deputy director of the @entity4 between 1998 and 2001 .
