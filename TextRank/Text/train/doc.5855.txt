president @entity0 gave a historic speech on friday
after months of revelations about the extraordinary surveillance capabilities of the @entity5 government -- and the @entity6 in particular -- the president promised to end the bulk collection of telephone records by the @entity6 and to put in place new safeguards for privacy protection of @entity5 citizens and those outside the country
let 's give @entity0 credit for signaling a new direction in the ongoing discussion over civil liberties and security
it is a good thing , one that should lead to greater freedom and security
@entity0 has stopped treating the @entity27 revelations as a public relations issue and chose instead to pursue the hard work of reform and new protections
as @entity0 acknowledged , intelligence collection is necessary to a nation 's security , and to all countries in identifying threats
but at some point , programs become too vast , concerns about their direction arise , and changes must be made
just because the government can do something with technology does not mean it should
@entity0 also announced the establishment of a public interest advocate at the @entity47 , the body that has authorized the vast surveillance program
the advocate will provide an opportunity for the judges to hear from someone opposed to the surveillance program
only after hearing both sides of the argument will the judges make a decision
in addition , there are plans to improve oversight of @entity62 -- a secretive process for obtaining access to business records about customers
" @entity72 " have become a favorite of the law enforcement community post- 9/11 and have caused real concern among civil libertarians across the political spectrum
@entity0 said notification procedures would be established and there would be more openness
this is not as much as some had hoped , but still it goes further than was expected
finally , @entity0 said he would create a new panel to assess the impact of " @entity81 " on personal privacy
the phrase may be clich√© , but the problem is real
increasingly data -- and also metadata -- reveal an extraordinary amount of personal information
we need a better approach , with technologists and legal scholars , and a deeper engagement from the @entity95 and @entity96 , to make meaningful progress on this critical issue
civil libertarians are welcoming @entity0 's proposals
from the start , we had urged the end of the @entity6 telephone record program
we had also pushed for reforms to the @entity47 , more oversight and accountability for government conduct , and a greater willingness to engage a meaningful debate on the impact that technology is having on privacy and freedom
for those outside the @entity5 , the takeaway will be more mixed
yes , it is good that the @entity5 president has agreed to stop listening in on the calls of foreign allies , narrow the focus of the @entity5 data collection overseas , and extend legal safeguards to non- @entity5 citizens
but still , a larger problem remains for the @entity5
for many years the @entity5 has pushed aggressively against efforts in other countries to update data protection laws and put in place new privacy safeguards
@entity130 spent the last several years assuring @entity131 that its system of " self - regulation " for the private sector coupled with " vigorous oversight " of government surveillance provides meaningful protection
the documents released by @entity27 tell a very different story -- of insufficient oversight , private sector collaboration , and technologies of surveillance gone largely out of control
in some instances it was clear that the @entity6 was actually undermining standards necessary for internet security
several of the recently released court opinions also suggest that the @entity6 itself did not know what data it was collecting
it will not be easy to rein in these powers or to fully understand the consequences of the technologies the @entity5 government has embraced
in other words , @entity0 has not said enough yet to assure those outside the @entity5 that the @entity6 will not continue to monitor their activities
he also did not fully embrace the efforts under way in many countries to strengthen the right to privacy
a relevant historical reference for the president in the surveillance debate is the @entity169 monitoring of the rev. @entity170 and @entity5 opponents of the war in @entity173
today the reality is that the @entity6 gathers vast amounts of data on political leaders , private firms and human rights campaigners outside the @entity5
@entity0 will need to do much more to make clear that intelligence collection is not a blank check to conduct surveillance on other nations
@entity0 has several opportunities coming up to say more about what he will to do to protect privacy , widely viewed around the world as a fundamental human right
this year the @entity189 falls on january 28 , @entity190 , a day that marks the creation of the most well - known international framework for privacy protection
the @entity5 should be the world 's leader on freedom , not surveillance .
