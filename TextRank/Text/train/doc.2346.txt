-- businesses in parts of @entity4 's most populous city shut down thursday , amid uncertainty and tension tied to the recent arrest , by @entity9 police , of the leader of one of the country 's most powerful regional parties
video from @entity0 affiliate @entity15 showed shops that had closed or were in the process of closing in @entity18 , @entity19 and other parts of @entity21
" there are elements that are forcing people to shut down their shops and businesses , " local trade society president @entity22 told reporters
such shutdowns have been connected to the arrest in @entity9 of @entity31 , head of @entity4 's @entity32 , on tuesday morning
@entity33 said they arrested a 60 - year - old man , who they did not name , at a home in northwest @entity9 on suspicion of money laundering
but officials in @entity4 subsequently identified him as @entity31
members of the @entity32 , which is known as @entity39 , have staged protests , including sit - ins , since that arrest
but party officials insist they have nothing to do with shutting down businesses , accusing others of manipulating the situation
" the @entity50 has strongly condemned the miscreant elements who are involved in closing down businesses and aerial firing in some areas of @entity21 and @entity56 , " the party said in a press release
" it seems that some elements want to deteriorate the situation deliberately so that @entity39 can be blamed
" the party appealed for people to go about their business as usual and remain peaceful , with senior leader @entity63 telling reporters that @entity31 himself has related that he does n't want supporters to take the law into their own hands
@entity39 is the fourth - largest party in @entity4 's parliament , holding 25 out of 446 seats , though it is a greater force in @entity72 province , including @entity21
it is led by @entity31 from his base in the @entity76 , where he sought asylum in 1991 because of an attempt on his life , his party has previously said
@entity31 -- who had been ill and was preparing to leave his home to get checked at a hospital when he was arrested , according to @entity39 senior deputy gov. @entity82 -- was still in a hospital thursday under police watch
@entity4 's high commissioner to the @entity76 @entity86 has visited @entity31 at the hospital and given him documentation -- including a @entity4 passport -- so that he and other @entity4 officials could continue to have access to him , said @entity4 information minister @entity91
some protests called by @entity39 after @entity31 's arrest turned violent , something that the party condemned
thursday saw more bloodshed in @entity21
a bomb placed on a motorcycle exploded outside of a mosque , killing one person and injuring five others , according to @entity102 , the chief of the citizen 's police liaison committee told @entity0
there is no indication whether that attack had anything to do with @entity39 or @entity31 's arrest
more arrests made in stoning death of pregnant @entity4 woman @entity0 's @entity112 contributed to this report .
