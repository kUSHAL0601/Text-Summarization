-- the former lead investigator in the @entity3 case says that newly released documents may spark renewed interest , but they have little effect on the cold case investigation
previously sealed court documents released friday show that a @entity10 grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents of the slain 6 - year - old @entity3 on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime
court papers : grand jury in 1999 sought to indict @entity3 's parents the district attorney decided that year , however , not to file charges against @entity23 and @entity24 , saying there was insufficient evidence
in 2008 , a new district attorney said new dna evidence cleared the parents and their son in the death
the case has never been solved , and the released documents have put the killing back in the spotlight
but attention does not necessarily translate into leads in the case , former lead investigator @entity35 told @entity0
" it is unlikely unless there is a confession , or somebody else comes forward that has information that has been shared with them , " he said
read the documents @entity35 wrote a book about @entity3 's killing and said he does not believe that there was an intruder at the @entity50 that night , implying that the @entity55 family -- the @entity55 , her husband @entity23 and their son @entity52 -- know more than they have told
what exactly was it that kept the district attorney from pursuing the charges ? " that 's a very complicated question
i think there are a lot of things that could be considered missing from the @entity67 's perspective to be able to bring them to a threshold of prosecuting beyond a reasonable doubt , " @entity35 said
still , the documents released friday are an important part of the history of the case
a @entity10 court ordered the release of the previously sealed court documents about the unsolved 1996 death of the girl who won child beauty pageants and whose murder shocked the nation
the pages were sealed in 1999 , after the grand jury in the case dispersed without charges being filed .
