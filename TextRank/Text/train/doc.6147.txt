these are troubled times for president @entity1
he 's a lame duck president
the latest @entity5 / @entity4 poll has his approval rating at 41 % -- the lowest of his presidency
and the @entity8 , his signature legislation , has been hobbled by the botched and much maligned rollout of the signup website
so , the historic deal that @entity12 reached with six world powers over @entity15 's nuclear program could n't come at a better time
20 questions about the @entity12 nuclear deal " today , diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure , " @entity1 said in a televised address from the @entity20 of the @entity21 , after the deal was announced
" a future in which we can verify that @entity12 's nuclear program is peaceful and that it can not build a nuclear weapon
" but will the agreement be enough to help distract the public from the @entity8 rollout debacle and potentially improve his image ? perhaps
@entity36 ) in a @entity5 / @entity4 poll released thursday , 56 % of @entity37 said they 'd favor the kind of interim deal with @entity12 that was eventually reached
another 39 % said they 'd oppose it
the agreement -- described as an " initial , six - month " deal -- includes " substantial limitations that will help prevent @entity12 from creating a nuclear weapon , " according to the president
" simply put , they cut off @entity12 's most likely paths to a bomb , " he said
but there are drawbacks as well
@entity54 : @entity55 is safe under new deal the deal complicates @entity1 's relationship with @entity55 , a key ally in the region
@entity55 prime minister @entity61 strongly oppose any deal , and the @entity55 government had strong words sunday
" the current deal ... is more likely to bring @entity12 closer to having a bomb , " intelligence minister @entity65 , a close @entity61 associate said
" @entity55 can not participate in the international celebration , which is based on @entity12 deception and the world self - delusion
" a senior administration official told reporters , " you can be sure that president @entity1 will speak to prime minister @entity61 " on sunday
the president also faces skepticism from @entity78 , where there were talks of increased sanctions as recently as this week
@entity61 : @entity12 nuclear deal ' historic mistake ' the deal says that the @entity37 will provide $ 6 to $ 7 billion in sanction relief in exchange
and @entity1 can do so by executive order -- bypassing @entity78 altogether
reactions poured in late saturday night , with republicans slamming the administration for appeasing the @entity12 regime
" this deal appears to provide the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism with billions of dollars in exchange for cosmetic concessions that neither fully freeze nor significantly roll back its nuclear infrastructure , " said sen. @entity92 , @entity93
@entity102 : what critics are getting wrong about the @entity12 deal @entity37 - @entity12 relations have been thawing for months now , since the election of @entity107 as @entity12 's seventh president in june
a senior administration official confirmed saturday that since the election , @entity37 and @entity12 officials have been holding private , previously secret discussions to generate ideas for the wider nuclear negotiations
the d√©tente climaxed in a telephone conversation between @entity1 and @entity107 this fall during the @entity117 -- the highest contact between leaders of the two countries since the @entity122 revolution that led to the @entity12 hostage crisis in 1979
" while today 's announcement is just a first step , it achieves a great deal , " @entity1 said
" for the first time in nearly a decade , we have halted the progress of the @entity12 nuclear program and key parts of the program will be rolled back , " ultimately , however , the outcome -- and part of @entity1 's legacy -- hinges on what happens next : negotiations will continue over the next six months to reach a comprehensive solution to the @entity12 's nuclear program
" the success of interim deals will be measured in months and years , not in minutes , " said @entity141 , a leading researcher on @entity12 for the @entity142
all eyes , of course , will be on the president through then
one agreement , wildly different reactions
