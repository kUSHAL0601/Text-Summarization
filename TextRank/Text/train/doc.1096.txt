to friends and relatives of the suspect in the tuesday killing of a high school math teacher in @entity5 , @entity6 , the arrest of the teen they know is as shocking as the crime itself
before he moved to @entity6 last spring , @entity12 had impressed the people he knew in @entity14 , @entity15 , where he graduated last spring from @entity16
" great soccer player -- probably the main reason we won the league championship last year , " @entity17 told @entity20 affiliate @entity18 about @entity12 , whom he coached in soccer for two seasons
" i 'm sure any of his teammates would say the same thing : that he was just the nicest kid on the team , probably
... it 's completely out of character ; it 's not something that i would ever imagine @entity12 ever , you know , doing or anything like that ... always the most respectful kid that i 've , you know , had around -- ' yes sir , no sir
' " after graduating from middle school , @entity12 moved from @entity15 to @entity5 , where he appeared to provoke little concern among his classmates or others in the town of 26,000 people in a suburb north of @entity46
@entity47 said she never heard her classmate in history class at @entity50 discuss their math teacher , 24 - year - old @entity51
" he never talked about her , " she said
so it came to a shock to all of us , i think
" @entity47 said she saw nothing out of place during her collaboration with @entity12 on a history assignment
" he was always a really , really quiet kid , but he was nice , " she told @entity20
" i saw no problems at all
" " he 's quiet , just kept to himself -- probably because he 's new to the society but , i mean , he 's a good kid , " said @entity64 , a junior at the school
a member of @entity70 's @entity69 class , @entity71 , said @entity12 had friends , but chose them carefully
" he was n't , like , too friendly though , " she said
" he , like , only had certain friends
he was n't , like , outgoing to everyone ... in classes he would only talk to , like , a select few people
and he was new too , so , like , he did n't have , like , the , like , amount of friends as everyone else
" still , she said , he " seemed quiet and reserved , but he just seemed normal
" @entity12 did n't drink or do drugs , and he came from a good family , one of his friends said
he described @entity85 as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people , adding that he had n't been acting strangely lately
teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens this friend and others got their first hint that something had gone awry on tuesday , when @entity12 did n't show up for soccer practice
the team searched for him after seeing texts that he was missing
" we did n't know whether he was like kidnapped or if he was hurt somewhere , so we went around looking for him because we cared about him , " said a teammate
" obviously , he was on the team and we liked him
" as they and police were looking for him -- and after @entity51 was killed -- @entity12 went to the movies , a source with knowledge of the investigation said
a few hours later , the lanky young man with closely cut hair was charged with murder
@entity12 's uncle , who still lives in @entity14 , told @entity20 affiliate @entity112 in @entity113 that something may have provoked his nephew
" might could have been upset , " @entity116 said wednesday
" you know -- teenagers go through that
he 's 14 , he 's growing up still
that 's the only thing that i can imagine
i ca n't imagine anything else because he 's like a storybook kid -- a perfect family
" in a telephone interview with @entity20 , @entity116 said the boy 's parents are separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in @entity132
asked if the suspect had had behavioral issues , he said , " no , i do n't believe so
" " i think it 's insane , " classmate @entity135 told @entity20 affiliate @entity136 in @entity46
" i 'm completely shocked
i do n't think @entity12 would be the type of person to do this
" @entity141 said she was searching for answers
" i just want to know why anyone would do that -- especially to someone who 's such a nice and kind and good - hearted person , " she told @entity20
" it does n't make any sense
just why ? " @entity17 said he was reserving judgment about the former player on his soccer team
" i want to see what else there is , you know , " he said
" i want the whole story to kind of come out before people really cast a lot of judgment on the kid
