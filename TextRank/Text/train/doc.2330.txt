-- a @entity4 court sentenced prominent activist @entity5 to three years in prison " for participating in illegal rallies and gatherings , " a government spokesman said thursday
" you can jail me for three years or 30 years , but i will not back down or retreat , " @entity5 said after his sentence was read in a court , according to the @entity11
@entity5 is that group 's president
the sentence raised concerns from @entity18 and @entity19 officials who called for @entity4 to reconsider its length
@entity5 already was serving a three - month sentence for posting a @entity23 message critical of @entity4 's prime minister last month , his lawyer , @entity24 , said
" @entity5 's participation in these marches and provocation of his supporters have led to severe acts of violence ; including fueled rioting , road blocking , arson , acts of sabotage targeting public and private properties , the use of petrol bombs and @entity42 , amongst others , " said a statement from the president 's office of the @entity4
" the @entity44 announced such acts have caused injuries to over 700 security force members
" @entity5 's lawyer told @entity0 he would file an appeal of the sentence after the end of @entity53 holiday next week
" the only reason for targeting @entity5 is to prevent him from continuing his legitimate and peaceful human rights work , " the @entity11 said in a statement thursday
the country is ruled by the @entity59 family , which has been in power since the 18th century
many protesters are calling for the removal of the royal family , whom they blame for the country 's high unemployment rate and for running a corrupt government that relies on torture and other harsh measures to clamp down on dissent
on march 20 , about 25 people in about a dozen cars pulled up to @entity5 's house and took him to the offices of the @entity76 's investigative department
there , according to @entity5 , he was beaten , blindfolded and interrogated about an armed suspect they believed he knew
@entity4 , where the @entity80 anchors its @entity81 , is a small , predominantly @entity82 country governed by a @entity84 royal family
@entity87 's deputy @entity85 and @entity89 program director @entity88 called the sentencing " a dark day for justice in @entity4 that further questions the independence of the judiciary
" " like many others in @entity4 , @entity5 is a prisoner of conscience , jailed solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression and assembly , " @entity88 said
" he should be released immediately and his convictions and sentences quashed
the authorities must also act to ensure that all human rights defenders are able to carry out their work without fear of reprisal
" " if anything , this latest verdict marks the end of the facade of reform in @entity4
the international community can no longer be under the illusion that @entity4 is on the path of reform when confronted with such blatant ruthless tactics of suppressing dissenting voices
@entity4 's international partners need to make this loud and clear to the @entity4 authorities " @entity87 also released a comment from @entity5 's wife , @entity122 , who was with him at the reading of the verdict
" the sentence , although harsh and unfair , comes as no surprise to @entity5 and i , " she said
" it shows how biased and corrupt the judiciary in @entity4 is
there are no human rights in @entity4
as the defense team said , this sentence is the biggest scandal in the history of @entity4 judiciary
" the @entity137 raised concern about the length of the prison sentence and urged the @entity4 government " to act proportionately in all cases
" " the right of individuals to peaceful protest and freedom of expression is a fundamental part of any modern democracy and must be respected , " the @entity18 statement said
" but we expect opposition activists to ensure their words and actions do not incite violence or other illegal acts
" the @entity19 's @entity156 said @entity5 's sentence should " be reconsidered in the appeal process and that the same treatment will be given to all @entity4 citizens who are being tried for charges relating to the exercise of their fundamental freedoms
" " fair and impartial justice is a key requirement to overcome the current challenges in @entity4 , " @entity165 said
@entity0 's @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report .
