-- when @entity2 went to bed saturday , he did n't envision the round of his life the next day at @entity6
he had a lot on his mind
but that 's exactly what he did at the @entity12 event , shooting a career - low 61 -- including a hole - in - one on the 8th hole
with the sensational final day of the tournament at @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity2 finished second to @entity18 and qualified for golf 's next major , @entity19 later this month in @entity21 , @entity22
a memorable outing for sure
but it 's not the full story
the @entity12 had tweeted sunday that @entity2 was " dealing with family health issues this week
" that was in reference to his older sister , @entity29 , 46 , who was dying from breast cancer , according to @entity32 of the @entity33
@entity2 had already announced that he had withdrawn from the @entity34 , which starts thursday , to be with his family
@entity29 died just 20 minutes before @entity2 's tee time , and he got the news after he finished his round
afterward , he emotionally alluded to " things going on elsewhere " and got choked up when interviewed by @entity41 analyst @entity40
" i know it 's really difficult , and i will not press the issue with you , but sometimes perspective comes in different forms , does n't it ? " @entity40 asked
" it does , " @entity2 answered
" yeah , you go out and , you know , golf does n't really mean a whole lot , so it 's hard
i played good today , and i 'm glad to finish , and it was a nice middle part of the round
so like i said , golf does n't mean a whole lot sometimes
