@entity0 -- few @entity2 have any real idea how the @entity4 operates , since cameras are barred , and the case arguments and opinions are often dry and confusing for nonlawyers
that 's too bad because the high court 's impact on @entity2 is incalculable
when disputes arise , the nine justices serve as the final word for a nation built on the rule of law
they interpret the @entity18 and all that it brings with it : how we conduct ourselves in society , boundaries for individuals and the government , questions literally of life and death
as the late justice @entity33 once wrote , " the law is not an end in itself , nor does it provide ends
it is preeminently a means to serve what we think is right
" and whether right or wrong , when it came to deciding who won the 2000 presidential election , it was the court 's conclusions that ultimately ended the issue , but not the controversy
preview : ' the implications ... are impossible to overstate ' a similarly epic constitutional showdown is now before the court over challenges to the health care reform law promoted by congressional @entity51 and president @entity52 -- and opposed by a coalition of 26 states
@entity58 of the @entity18 says , " the judicial power of the @entity2 , shall be vested in one supreme court ... the judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts , shall hold their offices during good behavior
" read a transcript of monday 's court arguments on health care here 's a look at the history of the court , how it works and how you , the citizen , can interact with it : @entity4 goes back the late 1700s the @entity4 first met in 1790 , as the ultimate part of the judicial branch of government
there are nine justices , led by the chief justice of the @entity2 ( that 's the official title )
all justices -- and all federal judges -- are first nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the @entity84
they serve for as long as they choose
the court has occupied its current building in @entity0 only since 1935
previously , it borrowed space in @entity84 chambers in the @entity92
the @entity18 's framers envisioned the judiciary as the " weakest , " " least dangerous " branch of government
and while the court has often been accused over the years of being too timid in asserting its power , there is little doubt when the justices choose to flex their judicial muscle , the results can be far - reaching
just look at how cases such as @entity106 ( 1954 -- integrating public schools ) , @entity108 ( 1973 -- legalizing abortion ) and even @entity110 ( 2000 ) have affected the lives of @entity2
blockbuster decisions by the high court over the years traditionally , each term begins the first monday in october , and final opinions are issued usually by late june
justices divide their time between " sittings , " where they hear cases and issue decisions , and " recesses , " where they meet in private to write their decisions and consider other business before the court
court arguments are open to the public in the main courtroom , and visitors have the option of watching all the arguments or only a small portion
you will notice the justices wearing black robes , and quill pins still adorn the desks , as they have for more than two centuries
where to sit ? seniority counts the justices are seated by seniority , with the chief justice in the middle
the two junior justices ( currently @entity145 and @entity146 ) occupy the opposite ends of the bench
before public arguments and private conferences , where decisions are discussed , the nine members all shake hands as a show of harmony of purpose
in the past , all lawyers appearing before the court wore formal " morning clothes , " but today only federal government lawyers carry on the tradition
the solicitor general is the federal government 's principal lawyer before the federal bench
as the gavel sounds and justices are seated , the marshal shouts the traditional welcome , which reads : " oyez ! oyez ! oyez ! all persons having business before the honorable , the @entity4 , are admonished to draw near and give their attention , for the court is now sitting
@entity174 save the @entity2 and this @entity175
" @entity176 asked questions about the court and the case arguments usually begin at 10 a.m. and since most cases involve appellate review of decisions by other courts , there are no juries or witnesses , just lawyers from both sides addressing the bench
the cases usually last about an hour , and lawyers from both sides very often have their prepared oral briefs interrupted by pointed questions from a justice
this give - and - take , question - and - answer repartee can be entertaining , and it requires lawyers to think concisely and logically on their feet
and by the tone of their questioning , it often gives insight into a justice 's thinking , a barometer of his / her decision - making
you can listen if you like no cameras are allowed , but the public sessions are audio recorded , and are available for listening , usually several days later
the health care arguments -- for this week -- will be available only shortly after each of the four separate arguments end , at the court 's website
after the arguments , conferences are scheduled , where justices discuss and vote on the cases
in these closed - door sessions , the nine members are alone
no clerks or staff are allowed
no transcripts of their remarks are kept , and it is the role of the junior justice ( @entity146 for the past two years ) to take notes and answer any inquiries from the outside
justices spend much of their time reviewing the cases and writing opinions
and they must decide which cases they will actually hear in open court
when asked just before her 2006 retirement what the jurists do most of the time , @entity241 said bluntly , " we read
we read on average 1,500 pages a day
" added justice @entity247 : " we try to squeeze in a little time for thinking
" want your case heard ? do n't get your hopes up each week , the court receives more than 150 petitions for review , decisions by lower courts appealed to the high court
relatively few are granted full review
about 8,000 to 10,000 such petitions go on the court 's docket each term
only 75 to 85 cases -- about 1 % -- are accepted
oral arguments will then be scheduled , but final opinions may not be written in all such appeals
in addition , some 1,200 legal applications of various types are filed each year that can be acted on by a single justice
those include stays of executions
the rulings are handed out in both written and electronic form , but the justice writing the majority opinion will usually deliver an oral summary at the beginning of a public session
in extraordinary occasions , the lead dissenting justice can demand equal time with an oral rebuttal
the court 's opinions are final
the only exception is the court itself , which can over time overturn its own precedent , as it did with racial segregation
but most justices rely on the principle of " stare decisis , " @entity295 for " to stand by a decision , " where a current court should be bound by previous rulings
case arguments and the opinions are posted on the @entity2 @entity4 's web site : @entity302 .
