@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's legal battle for some control of her son 's estate returns to court monday in front of the same judge who is expected to award her permanent guardianship of @entity12 's children
@entity4 has accused the executors of her son 's estate of " keeping her in the dark
" dozens of lawyers are expected to pack a @entity0 courtroom where a judge will consider the @entity24 matriarch 's challenge of the lawyer and former music executive who were named as executors in @entity12 's will
@entity4 's lawyers filed a petition last week accusing the men who now control the estate of being " intent on keeping her in the dark " about deals they 've made or are negotiating
@entity38 , @entity12 's lead attorney , raised questions about " a suspicious circle of relationships " involving @entity42 , the singer 's longtime personal attorney , and @entity45 , a music industry executive and longtime friend
@entity48 judge @entity47 gave @entity42 and @entity45 temporary control of the estate until monday 's hearing
@entity4 is asking the judge to order @entity42 , @entity45 and others to answer questions under oath about their business agreements to determine if they are " fit and able " to administer the estate
the men also were served with a 19 - page demand for documents
@entity42 has refused to let @entity4 see @entity12 's contracts with @entity63 -- the company that was organizing and promoting his planned concerts -- unless she agrees to keep them confidential
@entity42 's lawyer argued in a court filing that he has no choice , since the contracts have a provision requiring confidentiality
@entity42 's lawyers also argued that @entity12 's demand for documents was too broad and burdensome
" such measures will not be necessary if mrs. @entity4 is appointed a co-executor of the estate , " @entity38 said
@entity38 , in an interview with @entity80 thursday , estimated the @entity12 estate was worth $ 2 billion , while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $ 500 million
the will written in 2002 places all of @entity12 's assets into a family trust benefiting his mother , his three children and unnamed charities
judge @entity47 will consider at monday 's hearing who will have permanent control of the estate
the judge is also expected monday to finalize @entity4 's guardianship of her son 's three children
an agreement between @entity12 and @entity101 , the mother of the two oldest children , cleared the way for an uncontested custody hearing
@entity101 , who was briefly married to @entity12 , agreed not to fight for custody in exchange for visits with the children as recommended by a psychologist
the agreement does not involve any financial payments to @entity101 " apart from the continuation of spousal support payments " that @entity12 personally agreed to make to @entity101 after their divorce , their lawyers said in a joint statement
@entity12 's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her @entity120 , @entity1 , home since their father 's death
the oldest child -- @entity125 -- was born in february 1997
a daughter -- @entity128 - @entity127 -- was born the next year
details of how the children were conceived -- and who was the biological father -- have been closely guarded amid much public speculation
the couple divorced in 1999 with @entity101 giving @entity12 full custody while she got an $ 8.5 million settlement , according to court documents
@entity12 later agreed to additional support
@entity101 gave up parental rights to @entity12 in 2001 , but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children
a @entity1 appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated , opening the door to a possible custody battle
while the coroner 's report on what killed @entity12 has been delayed indefinitely , new evidence emerged that the singer shopped for a doctor who would give him the drug investigators suspect led to his death
dr. @entity154 , whose name appeared on a search warrant served this week , refused @entity12 's request in april for the anesthetic propofol -- commonly known by the brand name @entity160 -- @entity154 's attorney said
investigators suspect another physician , dr. @entity163 , gave the drug to @entity12 in the 24 hours before he died , according to a source , who asked not to be named because the individual was not authorized to speak to the news media
@entity154 , who practices in @entity169 , @entity1 , told @entity12 during a visit to his @entity172 home that the drug was " dangerous and potentially life - threatening and could not be used outside of a hospital , " attorney @entity168 said
@entity154 's medical records for @entity12 , whom he treated until 2003 , have been given to the coroner , @entity168 said
he said @entity154 prescribed drugs for @entity12 under the alias @entity179 and @entity12 , which was not illegal since he used both names together
the doctor did that because he thought it was " his duty to protect the privacy " of his patient , @entity168 said
@entity179 is one of 19 aliases listed in the warrant used by @entity0 police and federal drug agents tuesday to search the @entity192 office and home of @entity163 , a @entity194 - based cardiologist
the warrant also mentioned @entity195 , a nurse practitioner who treated @entity12 earlier this year
@entity196 told @entity197 begged her for the propofol to help him get a good night 's sleep
she said she refused , telling the pop star that if he took the medicine , he might never wake up
the same warrant , signed by a @entity192 judge , implied that investigators suspected @entity12 was a drug addict
dr. @entity205 told @entity2 in a recent interview that when @entity12 asked him for a narcotic , he told him absolutely no. " i said to him , ' @entity12 , you 're going to die one day from this , ' " @entity205 said
during a world tour in the mid- ' 90s , sources close to @entity12 told @entity2 , the pop star suffered from insomnia and traveled with an anesthesiologist who would " take him down " at night and then " bring him back up
" according to a report on a 2004 @entity222 police investigation , security guards in @entity12 's inner circle said he traveled the country getting prescriptions from doctors
the @entity227 coroner , who must rule on the cause of @entity12 's june 25 death , met thursday with the @entity0 district attorney , who must decide if anyone will be prosecuted for his death
during the meeting , it was decided that an announcement of the coroner 's findings would be delayed indefinitely , according to a source close to the investigation
an official in the coroner 's office had previously indicated to reporters that the findings would be made public within days
@entity2 's @entity245 contributed to this report .
