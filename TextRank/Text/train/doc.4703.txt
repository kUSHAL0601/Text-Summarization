-- officially billed as @entity1 , @entity2 , the festival that came to be known , simply , as @entity2 is the stuff of legend
friday marks the 45th anniversary of @entity2 , which took place from august 15 - 18 , 1969
@entity2 did n't take place in @entity2 , @entity9 , but in @entity10 , about 60 miles away
" it was really called @entity2 because ( festival co-creator ) @entity12 thought it had the right vibe , " @entity15 , journalist and author of " @entity17 in @entity18 : the creation of the @entity2 , 1969 " told @entity0
" @entity2 was where @entity20 lived , " said @entity15 , " it 's where @entity23 hung out and he just liked the whole feel of the word
no matter where they were gon na have it , it was always going to be the @entity2
everything about @entity2 has to do with the vibe
" 2009 : folk singer @entity33 remembers @entity2 @entity34 provided @entity2 's venue by leasing out his 600 - acre dairy farm near the hamlet of @entity38 in the @entity40 community of @entity10 , @entity9 , 100 miles north of @entity41
the posters promised " @entity43 , " but the festival 's initial concept " depends on who you talk to , " said @entity15
@entity12 and festival promoter @entity48 wanted to have a blowout that was " the biggest party the counterculture had ever seen , " said @entity15
" if you talk to their partners , @entity57 and @entity58 , who were the money guys , it was to make a lot of money
" for the crowd of 350,000 to 450,000 young people in attendance , @entity2 was all about peace and love , and that 's no myth
" the entire woodstock festival was peaceful and the kids were respectful because of one word : marijuana , " said @entity15
if it had been other drugs it would 've been chaos
but because of dope and @entity78 , everything was peaceful there for those three days
" @entity81 organizers who had been expecting a crowd of 80,000 to 100,000 people were blindsided when quadruple the crowd showed up
no one was prepared for a surplus of 300,000 people
with no system in place to charge them , @entity2 became a free event
cars within a five - mile radius were at a standstill
@entity9 gov. @entity95 declared a state of emergency in @entity38
by @entity2 's second day , authorities publicly pleaded for anyone who might be on their way to the festival to turn around and go home
eventually no one could get out or in unless they needed to be airlifted
festival managers scrambled to fly in 30 extra physicians from @entity106
@entity108 vocalist @entity107 spoke to @entity0 while promoting the blu - ray release of the director 's cut of the 1970 @entity112 - winning documentary " @entity113
" @entity107 recalled arriving with the other members of @entity108 via helicopter
" we flew in because everybody parked on the highway , " said @entity107
" it was kinda like ' @entity121 ' or ' @entity122 , ' you know ? ' if you build it , they will come
' the highways were closed
@entity127 was like a parking lot
so we had to fly in on helicopters
" @entity108 's appearance is considered one of the festival highlights
the band played early on , before the first of two downpours that reduced @entity34 's alfalfa field to a sloppy , slippery slew of mud puddles
all of @entity108 's music was new at the time and the band was virtually unknown
they had not yet released their first album
@entity2 is credited for jumpstarting @entity108 's career
" if you played at @entity2 , you had a career , " said @entity107 , who had no idea that the festival 's legacy would resonate so powerfully 45 years later
@entity2 's lineup also included @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 ; @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity23 , among others
by the time he began his monday morning set , which included his celebrated rendition of " @entity163 , " the crowd had thinned out to 200,000
many had to get to work , school , wanted to get a jump on the traffic or simply could not endure the close quarters any longer
even so , @entity158 had never performed in front of such a big group before and nearly bailed
although @entity2 has been lifted onto a pedestal in certain ways , by all accounts the festival lived up to the fable
the fairy tale , though largely drug - laden , was a reality for those in attendance
@entity181 : hazy memories of @entity2 it can be difficult to connect the storybook reality with @entity2 's harsher realities like overflowed toilets , lack of food and water , and a makeshift , 20 - bed hospital tent to accommodate roughly 3,000 medical emergencies
a tractor crushed a teenage boy in a sleeping bag , fatally wounding him
one young man died of a heroin overdose , another died of a burst appendix
a young woman broke her back falling off of stage scaffolding
in addition , there were about 400 bad acid trips , sprained ankles from sliding in the mud , and many a gashed foot as a result of stepping barefoot on broken glass
two babies were born , too
one child arrived in traffic en route to the festival , and the other was delivered in a hospital after the mother was airlifted out of the field
a lot of sex was going on at @entity2 and , according to @entity15 , a lot of women forgot to pack their birth control so supplies of birth control pills were flown in
for an event where facilities were strained far past capacity , not a single fight or incident of violence erupted among the crowd , which endured near - unbearable conditions
town elders , residents , shopkeepers and local police could n't get over how courteous and considerate the kids were -- all 450,000 or so of them
@entity2 's financial backers were not so lucky
they took a bath -- and not a mud one -- to the tune of $ 1.3 million
@entity15 called @entity258 of the ' 60s " because it , along with the moon landing , represented a bright period after the deaths of @entity250 , @entity251 , the rev. @entity252 and @entity253 , and before the breakup of the @entity255 and the deaths of @entity153 , @entity158 and @entity257
@entity2 is legendary for many reasons , but what made it magical was the value people placed on one another
" if these are the kids that are going to inherit the world , " @entity34 said at the time , " i do n't fear for it
