attention all snowbirds : if you 're looking for the best retreat this season , go @entity4 , you travelers , go @entity4
the western half of the @entity7 is forecast to have a warmer - than - average winter
meanwhile , @entity8 below its panhandle is expected to be colder than usual from december to february
that prognostication comes from the @entity12 's @entity11
but there 's a catch this year
how to pay for your vacation the @entity19 weather system known as @entity20 is n't behaving as expected , forecasters say
in fact , it has n't even fully developed yet
@entity20 indicates warmer ocean water in the equatorial @entity19 , and that influences the jet stream and gives forecasters confidence in their work
" this is one of the most challenging outlooks we 've produced in recent years because @entity20 decided not to show up as expected , " @entity29 , center deputy director , said in a statement
" in fact , it stalled out last month , leaving neutral conditions in place in the tropical @entity19
" forecasters are keeping an eye out for @entity20
the official 2012 @entity41 winter outlook favors warmer - than - average temperatures in much of @entity43 ; the @entity45 and @entity46 ; the @entity47 ; the @entity48 ; eastern @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 ; and the northern two - thirds of @entity53 , the center said
@entity54 , however , is expected to have cooler temperatures
conditions will be drier than typical in the @entity62 , @entity54 , northern @entity51 , @entity63 , western @entity64 , most of @entity57 and portions of @entity59 and @entity60 , the center said
hit the trail : 7 gorgeous fall hikes it will also be drier in the upper @entity68 ( including @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and northern @entity72 ) ; eastern parts of @entity74 ; @entity75 ; @entity77 ; and western @entity78 , the center said
this winter should be wetter than usual across the @entity82 states from the northern half of @entity8 to eastern @entity43 , the center said
it 's a crap shoot for the rest of the country
they are given an " equal chance " for one of three winters : above , near or below normal , the center said
the center 's outlook does n't predict snowstorms , however
