-- @entity1 sacked manager @entity2 sunday , citing poor results which threaten their participation in next season 's @entity5
his final match proved to be saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity9 which left the @entity10 languishing in fifth place in the @entity12
assistant coach and former @entity1 midfielder @entity14 will take temporary charge until the end of the season
a statement on the west @entity21 club 's official website confirmed the departure of @entity2 , less than a year after taking over from @entity23
blog : @entity25 was right sack @entity2 the 34 - year - old @entity26 is the sixth manager to be sacked by @entity1 's @entity28 billionaire owner @entity25
since he took control only @entity31 , who was an interim appointment , left of his own volition
blog : can @entity36 clubs catch their @entity38 rivals ? " @entity2 has parted company with @entity1 today , " the statement read
" the board would like to record our gratitude for his work and express our disappointment that the relationship has ended so early
" unfortunately the results and performances of the team have not been good enough and were showing no signs of improving at a key time in the season
" the club is still competing in the latter stages of the @entity5 and the @entity56 , as well as challenging for a top - four spot in the @entity12 , and we aim to remain as competitive as possible on all fronts
" with that in mind we felt our only option was to make a change at this time
" with immediate effect @entity14 has been appointed first team coach on an interim basis until the end of the season
" the decision to install @entity14 ends speculation that former @entity70 manager @entity69 was to be given the job on a temporary basis
@entity14 faces a testing few weeks , with @entity1 hoping to overhaul a 3 - 1 first leg deficit to @entity74 in their last 16 @entity5 tie , an away trip to @entity77 in an @entity56 replay , while trying to improve their league position
@entity2 came to @entity1 with a big reputation after guiding @entity81 to the @entity83 title and comparisons were made between him and compatriot @entity85 , who enjoyed such success at the club
but results have been indifferent and his relationship with senior players such as @entity91 has come under the spotlight .
