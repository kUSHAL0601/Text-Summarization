@entity0 , @entity1 -- this area of eastern @entity1 is known for lush , green hillsides and white picket fences
it is a place where bluegrass music may be heard trailing off when a car passes by , where " downtown " is a two - block stretch of quaint shops
life here may seem simple , but a darkness has been quietly nestling itself into the community
" @entity0 is averaging one drug - related death per week , " said @entity17 , an anti-drug activist and educator
" when your county is a little over 16,000 people and you 're losing a person a week ... you 're losing a whole generation
" the generation being lost , @entity26 said , is parents
an inordinate number of children in @entity0 -- and in neighboring areas in eastern @entity1 -- are living without them
according to 2010 census data , more than 86,000 children in @entity1 are being raised by someone who is not their biological parent -- mostly grandparents -- and many here blame those fractured families on prescription drugs
" i know a little girl who found her father dead of a drug overdose , found her uncle dead of a drug overdose , and now she 's living with her aunt , " said @entity40 , executive director of @entity41 , a community coalition devoted to preventing overdose deaths in @entity1
" the kids really are the ones paying the biggest price
" ' you 're always worried ' " it 's a terrible thing , " said @entity53 , 17 , a junior at @entity54
" especially in our community , it 's really bad
" when he was 10 , @entity53 and his family were expecting his mother for dinner , but she never showed up
he and a family friend went looking for her at her home
they walked into her bedroom and saw her face down , motionless
the friend quickly whisked @entity53 out of the room
" i do n't know what was going on , but i knew something was wrong , " said @entity53
his mother was dead after overdosing on @entity73
at the time , @entity53 says that he and his mother had been estranged for years because of her prescription - drug addiction
his father had not been in his life since shortly after his birth
" growing up without parents , without a normal mom and dad , you feel different , " said @entity53
" you go to your friend 's house and they have a happy family ... you 're jealous
" shortly after his mother 's death , @entity53 says his grandmother also became addicted to prescription drugs , and eventually vanished
now he lives with his grandfather
" i 'm grateful that i have my grandfather who stepped in and takes care of me now , " said @entity53
still , he calls growing up without parents " horrible
" @entity95 : let 's end the prescription drug death epidemic it sometimes feels is as if every student at his school has been touched by the epidemic , he said
" the hardest part of growing up without a dad would be not having that model family that you always see , " said @entity103 , 16 , also a student at @entity105
@entity103 's father overdosed on @entity73 when he was 7
his mother , he said , is in and out of his life , so he is being raised by his great - grandparents
@entity103 knows many children at school who are not so lucky
after their parents overdose or abscond because of prescription drugs , the kids go from couch to couch and from home to home -- living in a constant state of transience
for those children whose parents have not overdosed but are deep in their addiction , there is a sense of perpetual wariness about what they might find when they get home from school
" you 're always worried ... if your parents are even going to be there , you know , what 's going on in your house ? " said @entity103
" a lot of kids have to go through that every day and it definitely wears them down , you know
" @entity145 ' day the prescription drug overdose epidemic just recently began appearing on the national radar , so figures concerning the number of children orphaned after a parent overdoses are difficult to assess
what is known is the high number of overdoses , broadly : in the @entity156 , someone dies of a prescription drug - related overdose about every 19 minutes
the epidemic affects every state in the nation , and has hit hardest in places like @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168
@entity1 -- and the @entity170 ridge , generally -- is one of the regions hit hardest
@entity1 is the fourth most medicated state in the nation and it has the sixth highest rate of overdose deaths , according to the state 's attorney general
in @entity178 , adjacent to @entity0 , @entity40 said more than half of the children have lost their parents due to death , abandonment or legal removal
anecdotally , she says , the numbers in other aeas could be even higher
and in nearby @entity188 , so many children have lost parents that school administrators there changed " @entity193 " to " @entity192
" addiction and death are common concerns for families here , according to @entity40 -- too common
her voice wavering , @entity40 recalled the story of a young girl who realized her mother was overdosing on prescription drugs right in front of her
" she wanted to call the police and the other adults in the home were so high they would n't allow her to call , " said @entity40
" so she crawled up into her mother 's arms while her mother died
now she 's just living with a lady she met at the local @entity214
" those are the situations we 're dealing with in eastern @entity1
" prescription drug deaths : two stories " someone has to take care of these kids , and we simply do not have the facilities to do that , " said @entity156 rep. @entity219 , whose district in @entity1 is mired in prescription drug abuse
" so it 's neighbors , it 's churches , other civic groups that are trying to be parents to these kids who are orphaned by drug - abusing parents
" that 's a huge undertaking , because there 's literally tens of thousands of these young children , " he added
@entity219 started the @entity41 drug task force in 2003 as a response to the broader prescription drug abuse epidemic in his state
initially , he thought , " if we could get the pushers off the streets , that the problem would be solved
" but years after he launched the task force , groups of children were showing up at community meetings to speak of their struggles after one parent -- or both -- overdosed
" that hit me like a ton of bricks in the head , " said @entity219
" these are young people who are now thrown into the streets
so there are some real side effects to these parents using drugs
" now , the @entity41 program is channeling energy toward the children floundering socially , emotionally and academically after losing parents
they have programs set up at schools across @entity1
' it 's time for it to stop ' @entity26 , who worked in the local school system for 34 years , started a @entity41 chapter at @entity54
" it really got to the point where we were sick and tired of going to funerals , " @entity26 said
" we were tired of having kids come in and not being able to sit through physics class because they were worried about @entity280 who had overdosed
so we were like , ' what can we do ? how can we help these families ? ' " one way @entity41 helps is by educating and counseling children who are having problems at home related to addiction
the group also empowers children like @entity103 to speak out about their own loss
" i know that a lot of kids deal with drug abuse from their parents , " said @entity103
" i do n't know how many have lost parents , but i know a lot of kids definitely deal with that going home every day
i think right now we 're definitely at a point where everybody needs to know about it and how it affects everybody
" " it 's time for it to stop , " said @entity40
" it 's leaving our communities in shreds and we 're left behind to pick up the pieces from that
" advocates such as @entity26 and @entity40 are desperate for an intervention to reach the thousands of children who are not being helped by programs like @entity41
@entity53 said that the pain of having no parents is something that he will deal with for the rest of his life
" people have to understand that this is a problem , " he said
" it does n't affect just the person that uses , it affects the entire family
