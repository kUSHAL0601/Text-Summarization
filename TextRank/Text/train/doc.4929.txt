when the latest @entity2 newsletter hit my inbox , bearing news that @entity5 is separating from her husband @entity6 , i had a lot of questions
and one of the very first ones to come out of my mouth was " what 's ' @entity15 ' ? " referring to the title of @entity5 's announcement
i assumed it was just a cute little header she made up to soften the blow — something to fit within her fancy lifestyle brand 's aesthetic , sort of like the way that she calls her " best of " lists the " @entity24
" @entity26 : see @entity5 's @entity27 but as i scrolled down , i quickly realized that " conscious uncoupling " is not just a @entity5 - ism or a @entity2 - ism
conscious @entity15 is very much a thing , one that 's been around for years , though under the radar — well , until now
leave it to @entity24 to always be the first to introduce any and every new - age lifestyle tip and trick we never knew we needed , even during what must be a painful and tragic time ( see : oil pulling , macriobiotic diets , countless juice cleanses , the @entity41 method , agave , and soaked almonds )
@entity26 : @entity44 and we need them now below her announcement , @entity5 had doctors dr. @entity48 ( whom she 's tapped for numerous @entity2 newsletters ) and his wife , dr. @entity50 , explain the @entity52 concept at length
at a lot of length
a " conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [ within a marriage ] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing , " they write
" from this perspective , there are no bad guys , just two people , " they say , expanding on the blame - free , " it 's about people as individuals , not just the relationship " theory
@entity26 : in defense of @entity5 and her very public statements that makes sense to me , the mutual responsibility , no - pointing - fingers aspect — though not all of the super-lengthy explanation does
err , far from it
i 've read the thing over half a dozen times , and yet i still ca n't seem to process these parts : " life is a spiritual exercise in evolving from an exoskeleton for support and survival to an endoskeleton
i do n't get it
" there 's a scientific theory by @entity99 esotericist , @entity98 , that the creation of insects was a failed attempt by nature to evolve a higher form of consciousness
" i think we 're getting off topic ? @entity26 : the truth about @entity5 's @entity109 " conscious uncoupling brings wholeness to the spirits of both people who choose to recognize each other as their teacher ... if we can allow ourselves this gift , our exoskeleton of protection and imprisonment will fall away and offer us the opportunity to begin constructing an endoskeleton , an internal cathedral , with spiritual trace minerals like self - love , self - acceptance , and self - forgiveness
" huh ? " the misunderstandings involved in divorce also have much to do with the lack of intercourse between our own internal masculine and feminine energies
" but what about the lack of just ... intercourse ? @entity26 : " @entity135 " so i called up @entity137 , a coach in the @entity52 method , for a little more clarification
apparently the method can be traced back to one woman , @entity141 , who developed it in 2010
( she 's currently writing a book about it , which is certainly good timing for her
) conscious @entity15 , @entity137 tells me , is a five - week course , though it takes some couples and individuals longer to complete it , naturally
( " some couples get stuck on week one for three weeks , " she says , like she 's all too familiar
) the method upholds that there are three " power bases , " which are your relationship with yourself , with others , and with life , and that you need to understand all of them to get to the " deeper truth
" the relationship with yourself is often trickiest for people to pin down , but it 's central to how conscious @entity15 relates to divorces and separations
" it 's not the fault of one person , " says @entity137 , or even as simple as any overt betrayals and injuries from one person to another
@entity26 : why women still fake it instead , in a relationship , " each party has brought to the dynamic a set of patterns that they 've been living inside of for years , " she says , and those things contribute to the downfall whether they realize it at first or not
the @entity52 method , then , involves addressing those things and their impact on a relationship
" like , say , someone had been cheated on
it 's not as simple as black and white
the other party would want to address if they had done anything to contribute to that
if they had been withdrawing , " @entity137 offers
that 's how conscious @entity194 approaches everything , with a " we both did this , we 're both responsible " outlook , which should , in theory , keep things amicable between two parties in a divorce or separation , since they both feel guilty
and how does that relate to @entity5 ? why might she have chosen the method for her own separation ? " well , children really get the benefit from a @entity15 , " @entity137 ventures , vaguely referencing @entity209 and @entity210 , @entity5 's two children with @entity6 , and " @entity15 is really growing amongst parents , " she says
" @entity215 , it 's so exciting how quickly it 's growing everywhere , " she adds
and surely , after all this exposure , this is just the beginning .
