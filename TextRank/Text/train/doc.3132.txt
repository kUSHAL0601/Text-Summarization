-- as @entity4 president @entity3 stood in @entity5 on wednesday to propose deep cuts in @entity4 and @entity8 nuclear weapons arsenals , @entity2 war planners were working to make these weapons more accurate and deadly
the @entity10 told @entity11 this year it plans to put nuclear cruise missiles on board stealthy @entity15 bombers for the first time
currently , only the half - century - old @entity18 bombers carry these weapons
the @entity10 also plans to add a new and improved cruise missile to the mix. nuclear " gravity bombs " -- the ones that are designed to be dropped out of planes -- will be getting some help too
the @entity2 is moving ahead with plans to install sophisticated new tails that will improve their accuracy
can the @entity4 maintain its current level of nuclear security with fewer nuclear weapons -- if the weapons are more accurate ? related : @entity3 says let 's cut some nukes for nuclear weapons analyst @entity38 of the conservative @entity40 think tank , the answer is no. it 's all about targeting , she says
having fewer weapons allows fewer possible targets
according to @entity45 , having fewer weapons to reach the same or increased number of targets is bad
with lower numbers of nukes , the @entity4 wo n't have enough weapons to cover military targets in @entity8 , @entity51 and elsewhere , she says
as an alternative , war planners will be forced to consider shifting targets toward civilian populations
" that is just not a good idea , " she says , adding that it brings new ethical and moral choices into play
nuclear weapons : who has what ? @entity45 says the @entity4 needs to remain at current nuclear weapons levels to keep the playing field even
other nuclear powers , including @entity8 , have been increasing their arsenals , @entity45 says
as for @entity51 , @entity45 says the @entity2 does n't know exactly how many nuclear weapons @entity68 has , because " @entity51 has a very extensive tunnel network where they can build and store nuclear weapons
... we 're talking about thousands of miles of tunnels
" from a moral standpoint , improving nuclear platforms while proposing weapons cuts appears disingenous to some , including nuclear weapons analyst @entity79 of the @entity81
the @entity3 administration is using delivery systems to improve the military capability of the nation 's nuclear arsenal
he says that 's undercutting the spirit of the president 's promise to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in national strategy
as for wednesday 's proposed cuts , @entity79 welcomes @entity3 's proposal , but he says , " offloading 500 warheads from missiles will not destroy a single warhead , nor does it reduce the total arsenals of the @entity4 and @entity8 , who have 4,650 and 4,500 warheads , respectively , in their military stockpiles
" this ai n't your @entity106 strategizing , say experts
preventing the use of nuclear weapons nowadays is much more complicated than it was in the days when @entity112 and @entity113 kept things peaceful thanks to the idea of " mutually assured destruction
" the landscape is different
for example , the prickly relationship between @entity120 and @entity121 has a nuclear component
@entity124 now poses a huge nuclear question mark
one of the biggest fears for many world leaders involves terrorists getting their hands on a nuclear weapon
what has n't changed much is the horrifying damage these things leave behind after the mushroom cloud blows away
" only nuclear weapons produce radioactive fallout that can cause cancers , birth defects , and genetic damage for decades after they are used , " according to the @entity140
with the @entity106 in our rearview mirror , " it 's very unlikely we would get into a shooting war with @entity8 , " @entity79 says
" politically we 're moving away from that situation
but militarily the two countries are still holding on to these arsenals because they can see what the other country has
predominantly the @entity4 and the @entity8 have high numbers of weapons because we have high numbers of weapons
so there 's a sort of self - fulfilling prophesy in that
" so , why put nuclear cruise missiles on the @entity15 bomber ? experts say the @entity15 's radar - evading stealth design would more effectively penetrate hostile airspace than the larger , slower , less agile @entity18
the @entity18 has been toting nukes since the dawn of the @entity106
by the time it 's scheduled to retire in 2040 , its career will have stretched an incredible 80 years
experts fear that b - 52s can more easily be brought down by surface - to - air missiles
" you do n't want to fly @entity176 over anything but tribal militias these days , " @entity172 of the @entity173 told @entity174
" that 's a good way to lose b - 52s
" whatever the case , @entity4 is moving forward with a new generation of nuclear weapons
the current mainstay of @entity4 's nuclear cruise missiles -- the @entity186 -- is getting old
it was deployed in the 1980s
the @entity4 says it has about 1,100 of these atomic hammers
they measure about 20 feet long , weigh 3,100 pounds and boast a range of more than 1,500 miles
and they can blow through the sky at a speed of 550 mph
in 2007 , the @entity4 retired a stealthy @entity194 , as part of a @entity4 - @entity8 weapons reduction agreement , according to the @entity81
now , the @entity10 is developing another stealthy nuke cruiser , which it recently described in its 2014 proposed budget as " capable of surviving and penetrating advanced " air defense
by the mid- 2020s , if all goes according to the @entity10 plan , new generation nuclear cruise missiles will be deployed aboard a new @entity4 aircraft that -- for now -- is generically referred to as the @entity203
big changes are in the works on many levels across the nuclear weapons landscape
regardless of your point of view , it 's in everyone 's interest to pay attention .
