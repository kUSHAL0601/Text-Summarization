@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 are fashioning a scaled - down bill to address the southern border crisis that would provide less than $ 1 billion and include an immigration policy change that most @entity7 strongly oppose
there is increasing concern from members that they can not leave town next week for their august recess without showing they have a solution to the surge of migrant youth from @entity18 overwhelming immigration services
" i 'm not going home -- i do n't have enough guns to protect myself , " @entity22 rep. @entity21 told @entity1 about his determination to get something passed in the @entity3
expressing his anxiety about the need to address the situation in his state , @entity21 said , " it 's that bad in @entity31
" poll : border crisis impacts public opinion but even if the @entity3 does pass a measure , a significant number of @entity7 are pushing for a larger spending bill without any policy change
so , it 's unclear whether legislation would get to president @entity42 's desk in time
earlier this week , @entity3 @entity22 leaders discussed a $ 1.5 billion package -- more than $ 1 billion less than a plan introduced on tuesday by @entity7 and significantly smaller than the $ 3.7 billion proposal the @entity3 sent to @entity47 earlier this month
@entity42 meeting with @entity18 leaders but with solid @entity52 opposition , house speaker @entity49 and his deputies struggled to get enough support from fellow @entity2 to hit the 218 - vote threshold needed for passage
a significant bloc of @entity22 members does n't want to give @entity42 any more money or change a law they do n't believe he 'll enforce anyway
@entity31 rep. @entity61 said after a meeting with all @entity3 @entity2 on friday that the emerging plan will include some key recommendations from a border working group appointed by @entity49 that she headed up
the package will also have a smaller price tag
the chief policy aim is to alter a 2008 law to make it easier to deport children coming to the @entity72 from @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75
currently , they are permitted to stay in the country until they receive a hearing
that can take months or years
those who maintain they face threats of sexual abuse or violence would stay in @entity72 and receive a hearing within seven days
the @entity42 administration has indicated that it is open to making some tweaks to the law , but many congressional democrats oppose changes and reject the @entity22 's move to attach that provision to the border money
@entity97 rep. @entity96 , a member of the @entity22 working group that traveled to @entity18 recently , argued that linking the policy with the money was critical
" you have to deal with the problem
the perception by people in other countries that @entity18 will allow you to come here and make any claim you choose and stay
we need to engage the president , " be said
the @entity3 @entity22 bill also calls for sending @entity113 troops to the border and allowing @entity116 agents to enter federal lands
rep. @entity118 , a @entity119 @entity2 , told @entity1 there was " broad consensus " to vote on the measure next week
@entity3 : @entity47 should n't leave town without acting one conservative @entity22 member , @entity125 rep. @entity124 , questioned whether the situation was really the crisis that many say it is , but said he supported the pledge from leaders to offset the new spending by drawing funds from other programs
" as long as it 's paid for i have no difficulty with moving money within the government
you 're going to have to find a way to care for the people who are here , that 's the reality we face
you 're going to have to find a way to pay for sending people home
that 's just a reality we face , " @entity124 said
acknowledging that the @entity22 bill could fail to attract enough @entity7 and conservatives , @entity150 @entity2 @entity149 said , " if they want to vote no , let them
let them own their votes
" the no. 2 @entity157 in the @entity7 drew a hard line on accepting any immigration policy changes as part of the border bill
" the overwhelming majority of @entity7 think it 's a mistake , " sen. @entity162 told @entity1 on thursday
@entity165 @entity164 , @entity119 , the 2008 law 's original author and now the point person for the @entity3 on finding a way to make changes , told @entity1 she does not think it can happen by the end of next week
" this bill is very complicated and we have to know what we 're doing , " said @entity164
