it 's friday the 13th , and a full moon is in the offing
those might be dandy reasons to explain why a man drove his soft - top @entity6 coupe into @entity7 in downtown @entity8 early friday , but police have a better reason : the driver was allegedly high
there were no injuries , @entity8 police spokesman @entity12 said in an e-mail
the driver , @entity16 , 22 , was traveling near the intersection where @entity20 's world headquarters is located " when he left the roadway and struck the building " at about 4:15 a.m. et , @entity12 said
it 's tough to discern how
there are barricade poles and large , stone planters at the corner of the intersection
@entity30 , which @entity7 faces , is lined with lightposts and shin - high metal barriers protecting the trees and plants along the sidewalk
even if @entity16 had driven down the sidewalk from the opposite side of the building , the sidewalk bottlenecks right before @entity7
it 's about 5Â½ - feet wide at that point , so it 's difficult to imagine how a car could have traversed it
pressed on these details , @entity8 police said it had little information , not even the direction in which the car was traveling
" while i do n't have additional info at the moment i feel it is safe to say that the car was on the road at some point and then left it , " @entity12 wrote in a later e-mail
@entity20 's corporate security office declined to comment , and @entity20 's corporate communications office referred a reporter to @entity8 police , saying it had no information except that the driver traveled down the sidewalk before crashing into the building
corporate security later said it was working on a statement
@entity12 said police noticed the odor of marijuana in the car
@entity16 had marijuana in his possession and told police he had been smoking while driving , @entity12 said
@entity16 also told police he had been driving all night and had fallen asleep at the wheel
photographs from local media outlets showed a woman , described as an occupant of the vehicle , collecting boxes and other items , including a duffel bag , several shoeboxes and a flat - screen television , from the cabin and trunk of the moderately damaged car before it was towed away
the @entity86 has a @entity88 license plate
a reporter for @entity20 affiliate @entity90 in @entity8 asked the woman to provide details , to which she replied , " give me some money , i will , " before insulting the reporter , turning her back to her and saying , " get out of my face
" the driver was taken into custody and is charged with driving under the influence " less safe , " reckless driving and possession of marijuana , @entity12 said
a city jail official said friday morning that @entity16 was being held at the @entity103 detention facility , though @entity12 said in an e-mail both @entity16 and his passenger declined medical treatment
it was not immediately clear if @entity16 had retained a lawyer
by early afternoon , the area was cordoned off with yellow tape
a white wall stood in the gap between two revolving doors , where the roughly 10 - foot - high , plate - glass window had been situated
solar storms ! full moon ! must be friday the 13th
