-- @entity3 finalists @entity1 and @entity4 wowed the audience at the @entity6 at @entity7 wednesday evening with three show - stopping ballads each
after the performances , @entity9 , @entity1 and judge @entity10 came backstage to talk about their night , that coin flip , and singing those soulful songs
" as different as they are , they have a lot of similarities
they have a lot of vulnerability and strength that are both apparent when they perform
they both come from very roots - y , earthy , real families and i think that 's what 's apparent in what they do
there 's no pageantry in either of them , " said first - time judge @entity10
" they sing because they need to sing
not because they want to be famous
" but as to what he thought of their performances , @entity10 said : " i was really taken with the original songs , particularly @entity43 's
@entity43 's to me was the one that just hit me
" @entity1 and @entity9 may not have @entity10 's luxury of distance , but both offered up insights into their performances as well
@entity0 : latest ' @entity3 ' recap on those emotional songs and staying confident onstage @entity1 may own the stage when she 's belting out those ballads now , but she admitted she was n't always so comfortable going to those dark place
" the truth is before i committed to this competition , i was n't so good with emotional songs , " @entity1 said
" i put a wall up because i did n't want to get to that point where i could n't handle the lyrics and could n't get it out
but i found that there 's a happy medium of connecting and really showing your heart through your lyrics
" @entity9 was no different
her swagger , she says , is just an act
" i always feel very unconfident , but i do n't show it onstage , " @entity9 said
and it was her drive to succeed that prevented her from getting lost in the sadness of her song
" i got emotional in the middle of the song but i could n't stop because i did n't want to go off - key , " @entity9 said
on that fateful coin flip reality television devotees may be surprised to learn that as @entity82 was flipping that coin last week that would give the winner the choice to go first or second in wednesdays finals show , @entity43 was whispering to @entity4 to ask which position she preferred
" i was very surprised
she asked me while it was spinning
i said ' i do n't know ? second ? ' and she said ' ok , i 'll go first , ' " said @entity9
she does n't think about herself at all
she puts everyone before herself
" @entity1 said , " i think it comes down to the singing , the connection , the order does n't matter
" though @entity9 was n't in the room to hear her say that , she echoed the sentiment in nearly the same words
@entity0 : should ' @entity3 ' lose the results show ? on what they 're going to do the day after tomorrow @entity9 said that she 's just relieved that they do n't have to go through another round
" we 've just been taking it one day at a time and doing our best , but i have to think about [ plans ] when i go home , " she said
@entity1 , on the other hand , did n't know exactly what she 'd be doing , but knew that she 'd have at least something to celebrate
" my birthday is the day after the finale , " @entity1 said , adding with a laugh : " vote for me for my birthday ! " as many know , @entity9 was an @entity3 contestant before , but despite her success this year , she does n't feel as though she was robbed before
" honestly i do n't think i would have won , " @entity9 said
" i think everything happens for a reason and i do n't think i would have made it as far as i did this year
i was just auditioning because i was a 19 - year - old who happened to know how to sing
and this year i think i 'm more of an artist and i think i know myself a little bit better
" in less than 24 hours the world will know who was voted the @entity130 and who gets to go home in second place
with that kind of pressure , it 's tempting to think that @entity1 and @entity9 are enemies , just playing friendly on stage
but just ask how they spent the night before the big show
" me and @entity43 watched some tv together
she fell asleep on me
i made sure she was sleeping and then i went to my room , " said @entity9
" there are no rivalries here
