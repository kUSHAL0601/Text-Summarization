" summer first rose to fame the mid- ' 70s , thanks to " @entity6
" the song , with @entity2 's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans helped define the mid- ' 70s disco trend and hit no. 2 in 1976
summer followed the song with such hits as " @entity38 , " " @entity39 " and a disco - fied version of the @entity41 hit " @entity42 , " which outdid @entity41 ' version by hitting no. 1 on @entity45 's hot 100 singles chart
it was @entity2 's first of four chart - toppers
fans , friends react to @entity2 's death but with her 1979 album " @entity5 , " @entity2 broke out of the disco mold as the genre , which had become renewed by the success of the " @entity57 " soundtrack , was feeling a backlash
" @entity5 " demonstrated @entity2 's vocal and stylistic range and produced two no. 1 hits , " @entity4 " and " @entity5 , " as well as a @entity62 ballad , " @entity63
" however , @entity2 had some trouble adjusting to the changing times
her next album , " @entity67 , " went for more of a rock feel
it produced a top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially after the success of " bad girls , " a double album that spent five weeks at no. 1

" her talent was a true gift to the music industry , and our thoughts and sympathies are with her family , friends and fans throughout the world during this difficult time
" " i do n't like to be categorized because i think that i am an instrument , and if you play me , i 'll make whatever particular sound is supposed to come out for that color , " @entity2 told @entity0 in a 2008 interview
" and so , in the overall spectrum of things , i 'm just trying to be true to my -- what i feel my mission is
" @entity114 publicist @entity113 said he was hired in 2002 to help @entity84 " rebrand and reinvent her image
" the legacy of @entity2 , @entity117 's disco queen , is lasting " she was a victim of her own success , " @entity113 said
