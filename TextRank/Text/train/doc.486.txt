it was a hot - button trial that drew comparisons to the proceedings against @entity3 in the killing of @entity6 teenager @entity5
the outcome , however , was vastly different
the jury in the case of @entity10 found him guilty saturday night on four charges , including three of attempted second - degree murder , but they could n't reach a verdict on the most significant charge -- first - degree murder in the death of 17 - year - old @entity18
the decision came on the eve of what would have been @entity18 ' 19th birthday
" it was too long before victims ' voices were heard , " @entity6 state attorney @entity23 , who also prosecuted the @entity3 case , said after the verdict
" justice for @entity18 is as important as it is for any of our other victims , " she added , saying that the @entity3 verdict had nothing to do with her pursuit of the @entity10 case
like the @entity10 trial , the earlier case had racial overtones and claims of self - defense , but @entity3 was found not guilty in @entity5 's death on july 13 , 2013
the verdict inflamed passions throughout the nation
@entity3 trial : where are they now ? @entity18 ' shooting also angered many people
it happened on november 23 , 2012 , when @entity10 , who is white , pulled into a gas station in @entity54 , parking next to a red suv full of black teenagers
loud music blared from the car
@entity10 opened fire , killing @entity18
@entity10 said he saw a gun
the teens were unarmed , prosecutors said
moments before the @entity10 verdict , @entity67 , the attorney for the family of @entity5 , appeared on @entity69
he urged viewers to " respect " the jury 's decision
" do not do like the killers of our children , who have taken the law into their own hands , " he said
after the verdict , @entity67 said : " as black males and black people in @entity83 , and other minorities and @entity85 as well , it is somehow , if you kill us , the justice system is n't equal
it is almost as if your life is less valuable ... the rules are different
if it were equal , i believe @entity10 would have been convicted of first - degree murder
" still , @entity18 ' mother , @entity95 , expressed her gratitude to the jury
" we are so grateful for the truth , " she said
" it 's a long , long road , " she said , " and we 're so very happy to have just a little bit of closure
" she added , " it 's sad for mr. @entity10 that he will live the rest of his life with that sense of torment , and i will pray for him , and i 've asked my family to pray for him
" @entity109 , the teen 's father , said he had waited 450 days for this moment
" the whole world is looking at all of us here in @entity54 , " he said
@entity10 's lawyer , @entity114 , talked about an appeal but acknowledged the likelihood that his client , at age 47 , was looking at " basically a life sentence
" the jury convicted @entity10 on three counts of attempted second - degree murder , one for each of the other teens in the suv
@entity10 was also found " guilty of shooting ... as charged in the indictment , " according to the jury 's decision read out in court
as the verdict became clear about 7 p.m. et saturday , @entity10 looked ahead solemnly with a frown but no tears
@entity114 said his client was " in disbelief
" " even as he sat next to me , he asked , ' how is this happening , ' " @entity114 said
" ... it has not set in
i do n't think it will set in anytime soon
" given the attention and emotions tied to the case , a " comprehensive public safety plan " was established ahead of a verdict , according to the @entity143 joint information center handling the @entity10 trial
throughout the deliberations , dozens of protesters gathered , many carrying signs calling for justice for @entity18
after the verdict , there was calm
outside court , bishop @entity152 , senior pastor of @entity153 in @entity54 , had tears in his eyes as he described feeling numb
" not completely satisfied , you know , " he said
" at the end of the day , we walk away saying @entity18 was not vindicated
and i do n't want us to get lost in the guilty verdicts and think that everything is justified
they walked away saying we could not decide that this man killed in cold blood a young man because he did n't like the loudness of his music , and , to us , that 's sad
" bishop @entity169 of @entity170 in @entity54 noted that the verdict came on the eve of the day the victim was born
" how do we celebrate that ? " he asked
" we have to make a decision that we have to really begin to look seriously at our legal system , at the application of the stand your ground law and some of the other dynamics that created the conditions and climate that brought about this
@entity18 will not die in vain
" on @entity186 and @entity187 , observers also voiced opinions
on @entity187 , @entity189 , wrote , " a mistrial : what an incredible demonstration of the legal system protecting and upholding white male rights and interests
" a blogger named @entity196 tweeted : " i just never want to have to hear about anything like this ever again
but i know i will ...
