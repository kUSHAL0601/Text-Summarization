-- for all of the rhetoric about @entity3 being under attack in this country , oftentimes it feels no one does a better job of hurting @entity3 than the people who call themselves @entity3
especially after a national tragedy
for example , after the september 11 terror attacks , @entity10 blamed the @entity13 , as well as feminists , gays and lesbians , for lifting @entity18 's veil of protection
after @entity21 , pastor @entity20 said he believed @entity18 caused the largest natural disaster in @entity24 history to stop a gay pride parade in @entity26
bodies were still being recovered from the 2010 earthquake in @entity29 when @entity30 said the country was struck because it made a " pact to the devil
" and just this weekend , as the nation is trying to heal from the theater shootings in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , a spokesman for the evangelical group @entity40 , took time out of his day to inform mourners that some of their loved ones were going to hell
his comments were made after @entity24 rep. @entity48 , a @entity50 @entity49 , said he believed the shootings happened because @entity3 is under attack
he then wondered why " you know , with all those people in the theater , was there nobody that was carrying ? that could have stopped this guy more quickly ? " carrying a gun , of course
that 's right -- a congressman who sits on the @entity65 is talking about a shootout in a dark room filled with tear gas and panicked , innocent people
and we ask ourselves why @entity71 is so dysfunctional
this past winter , sen. @entity72 , a devout @entity73 who made his faith central to his presidential bid , blamed higher education for the declining number of young people who identify as @entity3
this might have struck young people looking at @entity72 's three degrees as ... curious
dare i say , hypocritical ? hysterical ? dumb ? as in ignoring that @entity29 sits on two seismic fault lines , but choosing to go with the pact - with - the - devil - to - explain - the - earthquake kind of dumb
of course , people of various faiths , agnostics and atheists make questionable statements all the time
the difference is this mantra of an " attack on religious freedom " is most often repeated by politicians and religious leaders of the @entity3 faith , usually when a political discussion about marriage or women 's reproductive health is taking place
i 'm fine with that
but i have a problem when a disaster claims innocent victims or causes a great deal of pain and loss , and instead of showing compassion , these so - called leaders of faith say the gays did it
or that gem @entity10 served up -- the @entity13
that kind of rhetoric not only violates @entity123 's greatest commandment -- to love -- but is completely illogical
as a @entity3 , i understand the importance of faith
but @entity123 did not say you have to be illogical or inhumane to be a person of faith
@entity38 and others like him would remember that , i doubt he would have chosen the day after the @entity36 shooting to tell mourners their loved ones are burning in hell
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity136 .
