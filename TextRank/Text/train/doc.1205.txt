the @entity1 protest may be the answer to a favorite question of social scientists ever since the bank bailouts of 2008 -- where is the social movement ? @entity7 are famously willing to tolerate a relatively large amount of income inequality ( especially compared to our @entity11 counterparts )
@entity7 love meritocracy , and are typically quite happy to see hard work rewarded , even to the tune of millions of dollars , as is often the case on @entity17
but there is a catch — we want the rules of the game to be fair
recent scandals involving @entity17 banks and financial institutions , headed by some of the world 's most well - paid managers , executives and analysts , have many @entity7 asking themselves whether this game is rigged
it is this sense of injustice , coupled with economic insecurity , that animates changes in @entity7 ' attitudes toward @entity17
it 's not just a small number of @entity7 , those who are actually " occupying " @entity17 , who feel such injustice
that 's just the tip of the iceberg
in a paper forthcoming in the journal @entity47 , i examine @entity7 ' attitudes toward banks , financial institutions and @entity17 over the last 40 years and look at historical trends in how @entity7 perceive the honesty and ethical practices of bankers
animosity toward @entity17 is at its highest level in at least 40 years
@entity7 have never exactly loved @entity17 stockbrokers or bankers — but we certainly did n't always hate them
why this increasing hostility ? the answer is a " perfect storm " of financial turmoil and a series of major scandals on @entity17
the public has been down on big @entity17 banks and financial institutions for some time now
the @entity69 , administered by the @entity70 , has asked @entity7 about their confidence in banks and financial institutions since 1973
between march of 2006 and march of 2010 , the percent of @entity7 with a great deal of confidence in banks and financial institutions plummeted 19 percentage points , from 30 percent to an all - time low of 11 percent
according to a similar trend from @entity80 , the percent of @entity7 with a great deal of confidence in the people running @entity17 had already reached an all - time low of just 4 percent by february of 2009
these figures are not just a reflection of @entity7 ' dissatisfaction with the size of their bank accounts — they also reflect the increasing belief that @entity17 is playing a game that only the bankers can win
economic hard times , such as global recessions , do tend to bring about small , but noticeable drops in the public 's confidence in @entity17 , just as we might expect falling confidence in a military that is losing a war
but when economic downturns coincide with major scandals , as in the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s and our current dilemma , the biggest changes in public confidence result — changes that may have contributed to the protests we are seeing on @entity17 today
in other words , @entity7 really begin to get angry when there is evidence of systematic foul play
to be sure , material hardships such as unemployment rates in the 9 percent range and the continuing high levels of foreclosures and bankruptcies undoubtedly set the stage for a public outcry
but this outcry has a distinctly moral tenor
the sentiments of the occupy protestors holding signs reading " blame @entity128 , " " people not profits " and " @entity17 was the @entity130 " certainly echo the wider @entity7 public 's sense of moral indignation
just 26 percent of @entity7 in an april 2011 @entity80 poll thought the people working on @entity17 were " as honest and moral as other people " ( for a point of comparison , the percentage was 51 in 1997 )
in that same poll , 67 percent of @entity7 agreed that " most people on @entity17 would be willing to break the law if they believed they could make a lot of money and get away with it
" ultimately , whether @entity1 is a watershed moment or a momentary disturbance remains to be seen
the key question , however , is whether the bubbling populist outrage evidenced in @entity1 's " we are the 99 % " signs will translate into populist - friendly politics
the @entity156 , calling for millionaires to pay taxes at higher rates than their employees , is one , albeit timid ( as the political scientist @entity157 has recently articulated ) , indication that the new political calculus involves tapping into this brand of populism
@entity164 's @entity163 campaign is another
at minimum , the visibility of the @entity1 's movement should bring renewed attention to a political and economic issue the majority of @entity7 on @entity171 agree upon — something 's not quite right on @entity17 and something has got to be done about it .
