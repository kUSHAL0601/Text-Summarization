president @entity1 's historic move to loosen the @entity3 embargo on @entity4 set off an immediate clash with @entity6 keen to use the dramatic foreign policy shift to further their own @entity9 aspirations
the announcement immediately threw two @entity12 politicians -- sen. @entity13 and former governor @entity14 -- into the spotlight and served as another reminder of the state 's enduring importance in presidential politics
@entity13 , the son of @entity4 immigrants , quickly took a hardline position , vowing to block any nominee the administration might put forward to be an ambassador to @entity4
he called @entity1 's announcement " truly outrageous and counterproductive " because there has been no " democratic opening " in @entity4
" it is a lifeline for the @entity31 regime that will allow them to become more profitable ... and allow them to become a more permanent fixture , " he said on @entity28
" the embargo is leverage , these sanctions are leverage
" @entity13 continued : " we have just lost a significant part of our leverage ... not a single democratic concession
" in a subsequent press conference , @entity13 expanded his critique into a direct attack on @entity1 's foreign policy , previewing the assault @entity6 hawks could adopt in the presidential race
" this president has proven today that his foreign policy is more than just naive , " @entity13 said
" it is willfully ignorant of the way the world truly works
" @entity13 called @entity1 " the single worst negotiator we have had in the @entity9 in my lifetime
" @entity14 , who shocked the political world on tuesday by announcing he would explore a @entity9 bid , welcomed the release of @entity3 contractor @entity61 but said it was too early to transform @entity4 policy
" he should n't have been in prison to start with
he did n't do anything to deserve it
but the fact that he 's coming home is spectacular news for himself and his family â€” on the first day of @entity74 , " @entity14 said when asked about the @entity4 news at a holiday event with @entity12 governor @entity73
in his first major foreign policy comments of the nascent 2016 campaign , @entity14 then warned in a statement that only @entity78 and @entity31 , who between them have ruled @entity4 for over half a century , would benefit from @entity1 's " ill - advised move
" " @entity4 is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record , and now president @entity1 has rewarded those dictators
we should instead be fostering efforts that will truly lead to the fair , legitimate democracy that will ultimately prevail in @entity4 , " @entity14 said in a statement posted on his @entity87 page
@entity14 's consistent hard line towards @entity92 could be appealing to thousands of @entity93 in @entity12
but there 's also the question of whether the issue will be as potent in 2016 as it has been in previous election cycles , as the younger generation of @entity93 , many of them born in the @entity3 , are not as steeped in the @entity102 - era struggle as their parents
@entity14 has been a strong supporter of the trade embargo and believes it should only be lifted once political prisoners are freed , @entity4 fully embraces democracy and a market economy is established
" instead of lifting the embargo , we should consider strengthening it again to put pressure on the @entity4 regime , " @entity14 said at a meeting of the @entity110 earlier this month
meanwhile , @entity118 @entity117 sen. @entity116 , whose father fled @entity4 , expressed " rejoice " that @entity61 is back in the @entity3 but he slammed @entity1 for easing restrictions on @entity4
" make no mistake , although we are glad @entity61 is now free , the agreement the @entity125 has entered into with the @entity31 regime has done nothing to resolve the underlying problem , " he said in a statement
" indeed , it has made it worse
" @entity6 sen. @entity131 , who is also considering a presidential run , tweeted " this is an incredibly bad idea
" the @entity117 positions set up a clear contrast with a possible 2016 @entity137 election rival @entity136 , who expressed support for @entity1 's moves in a statement released wednesday night
" i support president @entity1 's decision to change course on @entity4 policy , while keeping the focus on our principal objective -- supporting the aspirations of the @entity4 people for freedom , " she said
" it is great news that @entity61 is finally home with his family , where he belongs
" the former secretary of state ran for the @entity9 in 2008 opposing calls to lift the embargo , but she has since shifted her stance
in an interview with @entity163 television network earlier this year , @entity160 argued that the embargo had " propped up " the @entity31 regime
" i would like to see us move toward normalizing relations eventually and therefore more @entity3 ( allowed to move ) back and forth , " she said
" that 's something president @entity1 did and i supported in the first term
" @entity160 wrote in her book " @entity172 " that towards the end of her time in the @entity1 administration , she " recommended to president @entity1 that he take another look at our embargo
" " it was n't achieving its goals and it was holding back our broader agenda across @entity182 , " she wrote meanwhile , @entity1 's announcement surprised many on @entity185
outgoing @entity187 chairman @entity186 , who has often crossed swords with @entity1 on @entity189 and @entity4 policy , issued a statement that hinted at the tough fight to come over the embargo in @entity194
watch : @entity31 thanks @entity1 , pope while hailing a " moment of profound relief " for @entity61 , @entity186 blasted @entity1 , who he said had " vindicated the brutal behavior of the @entity4 government
" " trading mr @entity61 for three convicted criminals sets and extremely dangerous precedent , " said @entity186
" it invites dictatorial and rogue regimes to use @entity3 serving overseas as bargaining chips , " he said and argued that the " asymmetrical trade " will invite further belligerence from the government towards the @entity4 opposition
house speaker @entity208 also hammered @entity1 's foreign policy , rebuking the president for " another in a long line of mindless concessions to a dictatorship that brutalizes its people and schemes with our enemies
" @entity117 sen. @entity219 , who will take control of the foreign relations panel next year , said lawmakers " will be closely examining the implications of these major policy changes in the next @entity194
