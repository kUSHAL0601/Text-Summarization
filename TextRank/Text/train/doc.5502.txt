@entity1 , @entity2 it 's on
and it even has its own twitter hashtag , # itson
after a week of torrid speculation about the future of the @entity2 prime minister @entity9 , a member of his ruling @entity10 says he will seek a motion on tuesday to declare the country 's top job vacant
western @entity2 lawmaker @entity15 says @entity2 have stopped listening to @entity9 and if no one 's listening , @entity9 ca n't lead the party
if tuesday 's vote is successful , then a call will be made for nominations for the position of prime minister and deputy leader of the @entity10
the prime minister however is defiant
in a bombshell announcement , @entity9 declared he and foreign minister @entity26 , the deputy leader of @entity9 's party , stand united and will urge the party not to declare their positions vacant
@entity26 has been widely tipped to be a possible aspirant for the top job
" we are not the @entity35 , " @entity9 told a hastily convened media conference , in a reference to the turmoil between 2010 and 2013 when the then ruling @entity35 ousted two leaders amid unseemly leaks and constant threat of leadership change
" we are not going to repeat the chaos and the instability of the @entity35 years , so i have spoken to deputy leader @entity26 and we will stand together in urging the partyroom [ party ] to defeat this particular motion and in so doing , and in defeating this motion , to vote in favor of the stability and the team that the people voted for at the election
" @entity9 's insistence that the people elected him has angered some in his party
under the @entity57 system to which @entity2 adheres , @entity9 holds the prime ministership by the vote of his colleagues
and a growing chorus of them has been rattled by what they see as a series of poor decisions , back flipping on policies , broken promises and the government 's failure to sell an austerity budget widely seen as hitting the poorest harder than the wealthy
the bizarre honoring of the @entity74 's husband , prince @entity73 as a @entity75 of @entity2 on @entity76 , the country 's national celebration of its independent identity , was the tipping point
but cabinet ministers have been lining up to publicly support the prime minister over the past week
those who 've spoken since the leadership challenge was announced , say they will be voting against declaring the top leadership posts vacant
untested and critical will be the views of the government 's backbench where the parliamentary revolt started
the position of deputy party leader and foreign minister @entity26 remains murky
throughout the week , she has declared her support for @entity9
however , she has n't declared whether she would be a contender for his job if the position were to be declared open
indeed , even when declaring she would vote against the leadership challenge , she did so on technical grounds
" i agree with the pm that due to cabinet solidarity and my position as deputy ... there should be support for the current leadership in a spill motion , " she said in a statement
there was speculation during the week that @entity26 would stand on a unity ticket with communications minister and former opposition leader @entity112
a man with enormous ambition , @entity112 was ousted from the party 's leadership in 2009
a climate change believer and supporter of same sex marriage , @entity112 is a hugely popular figure in the so - called " latte sipping " strata of @entity2 society and in particular amongst voters who traditionally vote for the opposition @entity35
whilst @entity112 has said he supports @entity9 , he has not ruled out standing for the position in the event of a leadership challenge
undoubtedly , the phones will be furiously worked over the weekend
both @entity112 and @entity26 will be testing the waters
in the meantime , government members will be weighing whether the effort is worth the risk
ringing in their ears might be the words of the trade minister @entity136
" i think it 's totally unnecessary and it will make us look like a bit of a circus frankly , " he said
since federation , @entity2 has experienced six party room coups that have toppled the prime minister
if @entity9 's head rolls , he will have been in power for the shortest period of them all .
