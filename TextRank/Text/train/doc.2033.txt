eighty years -- that 's about how long it took the state of @entity3 to posthumously pardon the last three of nine men who were falsely accused and wrongly convicted of raping two white women on a train
they infamously were called the @entity8 , because the nine black men were just 12 - to 19 - years - old when they were arrested in 1931
it turned out that the women , @entity12 and @entity13 , had lied to police about the rapes
at one of the trials , @entity16 recanted her testimony , saying she had made it all up
still , the all - white jury convicted the boys , one after another
forty - three years later , a similar story : this time it was @entity26 , who died recently of cancer
@entity26 spent nearly three years in prison in @entity29 after he was convicted in 1974 of a rape and murder that he had nothing to do with , according to the @entity29 @entity33
ancient history , you say ? we 've moved past those shameful days of unequal justice , you insist
in 2012 , according to the @entity38 , nearly 87,000 " forcible rapes " were reported
that 's down 7 % from the number of rapes reported in 2008
law enforcement agencies estimate that the number of false rape accusations ranges from 2 % to 8 % annually , or between 2,000 and 7,000 cases each year
exact numbers are difficult to track because of the lack of in - depth research on false rape cases and because of the varying definitions of what constitutes an " unfounded " rape claim
it can mean the alleged victim did not try to fight off the suspect or suffer injuries , was not threatened with a weapon or the victim and perpetrator had a previous relationship
law enforcement experts agree that rapes are widely underreported , and no one is suggesting that violence against women is n't a serious problem
but experts do not dispute that false rape accusations can and do happen
many of those innocent men end up in prison or with lives shattered
one of the unfortunate statistics in 2002 , @entity74 was one of those unfortunate statistics
he was just 17 when a classmate , @entity75 , 15 , falsely accused him of raping her at school
banks , then a top football talent , spent more than five years in prison and five years on probation for rape and kidnapping
he was exonerated after he got his accuser to admit on tape that she lied about the rape
banks later explained that his attorney had advised him to take a plea bargain and avoid a jury trial because " ... i was a big black teenager , and no jury would believe anything i said
" the @entity91 sued his accuser , and she has been ordered to repay the $ 750,000 she was awarded in a lawsuit against the district
it seems more men who insist they have been falsely accused of rape are trying a new tactic : suing their accusers in civil court , mostly for defamation
they are seeking to repair their ruined lives , save their careers and clear their names
make no mistake , i could never defend men who rape and believe even harsher penalties are needed for rapists
but i can understand why some men are opting to fight back
and i even agree with this strategy in some cases
@entity114 founder @entity113 is fighting back
@entity113 is suing his ex-girlfriend , @entity115 , after she accused him in 2012 on @entity116 and @entity118 posts of physically abusing her and raping one of her friends ( who later denied this )
recently , it sounded as if @entity127 winner and @entity129 quarterback @entity126 , who was accused of raping a fellow student , and his legal team were also considering this strategy
his attorney , @entity133 , said that they have not ruled out a civil suit of their own
" his reputation is important to him , " @entity133 said after his client was cleared when the state attorney said no charges would be filed
" his career is important to him
" the accuser 's attorney has requested a review of the case by the @entity29 attorney general 's office and argues that the @entity148 tried to stymie the rape investigation of the star athlete
throughout the investigation , @entity126 insisted that the sex was consensual
and his unidentified accuser equally insisted she was raped but was heavily intoxicated and had a " broken memory " of events
however , toxicology reports found no drugs in her system and very low alcohol levels
complicating the case further , @entity126 's dna was found on the woman 's underwear and a second dna sample , reportedly from her boyfriend , was found on her shorts
no simple solution to clearing your name admittedly , my initial reaction to hearing no charges would be filed was relief
for me , the case was troubling on both sides
and though i 'm no lawyer , i thought : " @entity126 should sue his accuser
if he 's really innocent , he should prove it and clear his name
" but it may not be that simple
@entity180 , a defense attorney and former assistant district attorney in @entity182 , warns that while initiating these lawsuits against accusers may seem like a good way for men who are wrongly accused to get justice , he 'd be hard - pressed to advise any of his clients to pursue this strategy
" it 's a very sensitive issue , and these suits should be extremely case specific , extremely rare
... you ca n't win these cases , too much backlash , " @entity180 said
his advice to @entity126 : " move on with your life , remain above the scandal , and focus on school and following your dream to play in the @entity199
" i asked @entity180 what about the thousands of men who are wrongly accused -- just ignore them ? " look , i tell my clients innocent before proven guilty is not reality
it 's more of a marketing slogan to promote faith in our justice system ; without that premise , the system would fall apart , " he said
he also said it could " discourage too many from reporting real rapes
" it sounds to me like ancient history repeating itself
it sounds to me like we have a very long way to go before there 's justice for all .
