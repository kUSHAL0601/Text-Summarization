the @entity9 community and others criticized the brand for hosting a party that encouraged guests to " play @entity29 " and misuse symbols of their culture
taking @entity32 ' and headdresses " your event stereotypes and demeans native cultures , collapsing hundreds of distinct tribal and cultural groups into one ' tribal ' mish - mash , thereby erasing our individual identities and contemporary existence , " @entity9 blogger @entity34 said in an open letter to @entity36 and @entity37 on her blog , native appropriations
@entity48 of the @entity50 fashion blog , @entity51 , said her initial reaction was shock and disbelief that this level of ignorance occurred at such a highly publicized event

@entity9 mascots : pride or prejudice ? " this is an opportunity to undo a wrong but also celebrate what we always wanted to celebrate , " @entity66 said
@entity48 and @entity34 connected the brand with four @entity9 artists to help design the limited edition line of clothing and accessories

" @entity116 from the @entity118 tribe will design graphic t - shirts incorporating @entity50 imagery with the iconic @entity15 character , @entity121 the monkey
" point lips , not fingers " will be the theme of his screen print t - shirts , @entity116 said

the native community , led by bloggers @entity48 and @entity34 , " pointed their lips toward @entity15 " and pushed them in the direction toward collaboration , he said
" the ultimate product is that we are n't just pushing the blame , but giving direction in the right way , " he said

" i really do think they are trying to set a good example
