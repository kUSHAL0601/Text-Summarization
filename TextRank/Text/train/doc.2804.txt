@entity6 , @entity2 amid renewed violence in eastern @entity2 , the leaders of @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 planned a face - to - face meeting in @entity9 on wednesday
the gathering of the four presidents , who have been talking for days on the phone or through diplomatic channels , is a significant development , as the heads of state would not want to walk away from such a gathering empty - handed
a spokesman for the @entity3 government told @entity7 that " all sides have agreed " to the meeting
but an attempt to gather these four leaders in january fell through after negotiations failed to reap agreements before the meeting date
@entity1 president @entity26 on sunday , speaking with @entity9 president @entity25 , hinted that wednesday 's announced meeting might not be a done deal
@entity26 confirmed that he spoke with his counterparts in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , but he added that the meeting will happen " if we succeed in settling the various points that we have discussed so intensively over these last days
" so there is uncertainty about this meeting happening , but given the serious worsening of the conflict in eastern @entity2 , the @entity3 feel it is worth a try
the big challenge facing @entity26 , @entity2 president @entity39 , @entity3 chancellor @entity40 and @entity4 president @entity41 is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick
a peace agreement was signed in september -- also in @entity44 , @entity9 -- that envisaged a ceasefire and the creation of a buffer zone between the warring sides , as well as constitutional changes
however , it quickly crumbled amid continued fighting
@entity53 leaders and the @entity2 government accuse @entity1 of providing weapons and training to the @entity57 separatists battling @entity2 forces in the @entity60 and @entity61 regions
they have also accused @entity1 of sending troops to the border to fight
@entity1 has denied the allegations
but some @entity53 leaders continue to strongly hit at @entity26
on sunday , @entity67 foreign secretary @entity66 said @entity26 was acting like a " mid- 20th century tyrant
" speaking to @entity69 , @entity66 said @entity1 's behavior was " outrageous and outdated " and warned that @entity26 will " pay the price for what he is doing in @entity2
" all the while , the conflict -- which actually stemmed from a trade agreement -- has killed more than 5,000 people
over the past day , shelling killed eight civilians in @entity2 's @entity60 region , a rebel official told reporters sunday
at least 17 other civilians were injured in the shelling , said @entity85 , the self - declared deputy defense minister of the rebel group @entity86
civilians increasingly are falling victim to the violence in @entity2 , with at least 224 killed and more than 540 injured in just the final three weeks of january , the @entity87 said
meanwhile , @entity2 forces killed 70 insurgents and a eliminated a number of tanks , artillery and rockets over the past day , a military spokesman said sunday
but 12 @entity2 soldiers were also killed , and another 24 were wounded by @entity57 forces who shelled the town of @entity103 , col. @entity98 said in @entity6
some @entity105 officials are considering sending lethal aid to the @entity2 military
" asserting that there is no military solution -- which is a truism -- should not lead us to believe that there is no military dimension to the problem or that hard power can play no role in a favorable solution , " @entity105 sen. @entity108 said sunday
" @entity26 does not want a diplomatic solution , he wants to dominate @entity2 as well as @entity1 's other neighbors , " @entity108 added , calling @entity1 's military backing of rebels " a harsh reality
" but some @entity123 , such as @entity40 , have concerns about arming @entity2 fighters
" the progress that @entity2 needs can not be achieved with more weapons , " she said
" i have grave doubts about the validity of this point
" @entity40 said she believes that if the @entity53 provides lethal aid to @entity2 , then @entity1 could up the battle -- and possibly introduce its air force into the fight
but on sunday , @entity105 secretary of state @entity136 said the @entity105 and @entity123 are united in their diplomatic efforts
" let me assure everyone there is no division , there is no split , " he said at the @entity139 in @entity3
he reiterated that there is no military solution to the crisis with separatists in eastern @entity2 , and that borders should not be changed by force
" but the longer that it takes , " @entity136 warned , " the more the off - ramps are avoided , ( and ) the more we will be forced to raise the costs on @entity1 and its proxies
" @entity156 reported from @entity6 ; @entity157 reported and wrote from @entity158 ; and @entity159 reported from @entity60
@entity7 's @entity160 and @entity161 contributed to this report .
