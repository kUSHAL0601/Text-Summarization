-- the mother of a man reportedly killed by pirates on a lake along the @entity7 - @entity6 border pleaded for help in finding her son 's body tuesday
appearing on @entity12 's " today " show , @entity14 's mother , @entity15 , tearfully asked @entity6 authorities and the public to help recover his remains
" please , everybody call your @entity20
call anybody you can to have them get us over there
he has to come home , " she said
" president @entity28 , help us
president of @entity6 , help us , please
" @entity14 's wife @entity30 reported that she and her husband were riding personal watercraft thursday on the @entity6 side of @entity34 when they were attacked by gunmen on three boats
@entity14 was shot and fell into the water , his wife told sheriff 's deputies in @entity42 , @entity43 , but his body has yet to be found
" he was thrown off the @entity50 and i could n't pick him up to get him on mine , " @entity14 told a sheriff 's dispatcher in a 911 call released by the agency
speaking on the @entity54 " @entity53 " on tuesday , @entity52 said she did n't believe @entity6 investigators were looking for her husband 's remains , and suggested that his killers had the body
" we understand the possibility that the people who did this probably have him , and that 's why maybe they ca n't find him , " she said
there was no immediate response from officials in the @entity6 state of @entity71 to her remarks
but @entity42 sheriff @entity73 told @entity0 on monday that his agency has contacted @entity6 authorities " on a daily basis " and was trying to coordinate search efforts by volunteers , but had received no response
@entity7 rep. @entity80 , the area 's congressman , said he has asked federal agencies to press for support for the search from their @entity6 counterparts
" i have contacted the @entity87 and urged them to move the case quickly , " @entity80 said in a statement issued tuesday afternoon
a man @entity52 approached for help told @entity0 's " @entity92 " that a boat was following her before she came ashore , but veered off as she neared land
" she right away told me , gave me instructions as far as to call law enforcement and an ambulance because ' my husband 's been shot , ' " said the man , who spoke on condition of anonymity
he said @entity14 was " frantic -- crying , sobbing
i mean , she looked very , very jittery
" the reservoir is on the @entity101 , about 200 miles south of @entity102 , and straddles the border between @entity43 and @entity71
the @entity6 state has made headlines recently as a hotbed for drug cartel violence , and @entity73 said he believes the attackers were pirates linked to the cartels
" my understanding is they 're 15 , 16 , 17 - year - olds that have been given automatic weapons
they barely know how to use them , " @entity73 told @entity0 on monday
" they do n't even know where the safeties are at
" there have been at least four cases of gunmen in @entity6 waters robbing or threatening boaters since april , according to the @entity124
the department has warned boaters to stay on the @entity7 side of the lake since may
@entity129 , an area fisherman , told @entity0 he was chased by men carrying @entity132 rifles on @entity34 in may
they got to within 15 yards of his boat , which he said was along the international boundary
" fortunately , i had a faster boat than they did , so i outran them , " he said
" they chased me for about a mile , mile and a half , and then they tailed off
" he said local fishermen had heard " that there were some people being robbed " and were advising boaters to avoid the @entity6 side of the lake , " so i was n't on the @entity6 side
i was going down the middle of the lake when they kind of came out of the brush and kind of ambushed me
