-- getting ahead in your career is not just about being successful ; it 's about being noticed
so how do you stand out to be hired by potential employers ? how do you stand out for a promotion to a superior ? how do you stand out as loyal to the people you are leading ? it 's simple : do the things that others are n't willing to do
whether you 're a leader , a team member , or a candidate , success comes from having the discipline to do the things that you know you should be doing , even when you do n't feel like doing them
when you practice this kind of self discipline regularly , you 'll naturally stand out from the pack -- because most people avoid the hard stuff
it 's just easier to put it off
but the truth is that what feels easy now creates problems down the line
and what feels hard now -- doing the stuff you do n't feel like -- makes everything easier in the long - term
self discipline does n't have to be hard -- you just have to change the way you think about it

i 've spent the last 10 years studying and coaching some of the most successful people in business , figuring out what makes them different
they 're not smarter or more talented than the average person -- they just consistently do what others are n't willing to do by keeping three principles in mind : do it scared
fear is one of the biggest saboteurs of our goals , because it inhibits action
the next time you feel yourself putting something off because you 're afraid -- of uncertainty or failure -- just " do it scared
" i once heard a true story of a woman who was trapped in a burning building on the 80th floor
she was terrified of heights and enclosed spaces , and when the fire alarm went off , she refused to follow her colleagues into the stairwell to evacuate to safety
the firemen did a sweep of the building and found her hiding under her desk , waiting to die
she was screaming " i 'm scared , i 'm scared ! " as the firemen insisted she walk down the stairwell
until one fireman said : " that 's ok , just do it scared
" he repeated it all the way down the 80 flights of stairs , until he brought her to safety
we 've all faced these moments in our careers -- when you know what has to be done , but your fear holds you back
in order to stand out , you must develop the habit of acting in the face of fear
it 's fine to be scared -- do it scared
it 's fine to be unsure -- do it unsure
it 's fine to be uncomfortable -- do it uncomfortable
this is the attitude of the most disciplined and successful people on the planet
they might be scared , but they do it anyways
and by just doing something , you create movement and momentum that will lead to progress and results
read more : realize your potential , ' dare to be different ' habits , not results
perfectionism is one of the most common reasons people procrastinate , and we 've all done it at some point
the best way to overcome this impulse is to put your self esteem into stellar work habits instead of results
it can take a while to see the fruits of your labor -- whether you 're spearheading a new initiative , trying to launch a business , or planning a second act career
to keep yourself motivated , take pride in sticking to your work habits , rather than looking for immediate results
in time , success will follow
the pursuit of any goal will inevitably face a number of obstacles
the difference between those who stand out in the careers and those who blend in lies in what you do when you reach these critical turning points
do you hesitate and turn back ? or do you press forward ? when you feel frustrated , depressed , or disappointed , do n't give up -- just get some perspective
i have a mental reminder that helps me push past these hurdles
i hold my pen up to my eye and stare directly down the barrel
then , i pull it away and look at it in its entirety
it 's a quick way to remind myself to look at my life in the same way
stop fixating on the here and now , and think about the big picture
today 's challenges may not make sense , but you must have faith that over the long - term , they will be nothing more than blips on the radar screen
having this perspective and faith will help you press forward at the moments when others turn back
contrary to popular belief , people who have reached the highest levels in their careers are n't necessarily better educated , more talented or better connected
neither are they simply more motivated or harder workers
rather , successful people have realized that getting to the top means that they first have to do the things that they do n't want to do related to their goals
it 's not about enjoying self discipline -- it 's about adopting a few new ways of thinking that simply make discipline easier to endure
and when you develop the habit of doing things that others wo n't do , you 're putting yourself on the fast track to the route to the top
