-- the family of a 2 - year - old boy who was mauled to death after falling into an exhibit of @entity6 painted dogs has reached a settlement in a lawsuit against the @entity9
" details of the settlement will remain confidential , " attorneys for the boy 's parents said in a joint statement released monday with the @entity9
@entity16 slipped over a railing , bounced into a safety net , bounced again , and tumbled into the exhibit in november 2012
" the @entity16 family and the @entity23 request that the privacy of all parties involved be respected , " the statement said
at the time , zoo officials said there was little anyone could do after the boy fell
" there were 11 dogs in the exhibit , " zoo president @entity30 , a veterinarian , said after the tragic death
although there were zoo employees within feet of the exhibit , and others rushed to the scene , it was too late -- it was clear the child was dead , @entity30 said
" there was no reason to send our staff into harm 's way , " she said
the medical examiner found that the little boy did not die from the fall , @entity30 said
railings throughout the zoo are designed to make it difficult to place children on them , @entity30 said
they 're at a 45 - degree angle so that if a child is placed on one and falls , he or she would hopefully fall backward , away from the animal enclosure , she said
@entity9 police said the child was with his 34 - year - old mother when he fell from the top of a platform railing and " was immediately attacked by eleven dogs inside the pen
" zoo spokeswoman @entity71 said they had no comment beyond the brief joint statement
the parents ' attorney , @entity75 , also declined further comment
@entity0 's @entity78 contributed to this report .
