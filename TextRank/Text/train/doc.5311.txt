a common benchmark in the @entity2 for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol - related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive , transportation safety investigators say
the @entity6 recommended on tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood - alcohol content ( @entity9 ) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving
" most @entity2 think that we 've solved the problem of impaired driving , but in fact , it 's still a national epidemic , " @entity6 chairman @entity16 said
the idea for a tighter standard is part of a safety board initiative outlined in a staff report and approved by the panel to eventually eliminate drunk driving , which accounts for about a third of all road deaths in the @entity2
@entity6 looks to technology to end drunken driving in the @entity2 @entity16 said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving , including a range of federal and state policies , tougher law enforcement , and stronger advocacy
but she said too many people are still dying on @entity2 's roads
the board acknowledged that there was " no silver bullet , " but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels
" in the last 30 years , more than 440,000 people have perished in this country due to alcohol - impaired driving
what will be our legacy 30 years from now ? " @entity16 asked
" if we do n't tackle alcohol - impaired driving now , when will we find the will to do so ? " lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually , the safety board said
under current law , a 180 - pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour , according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the @entity62
that same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period , according to the calculator
@entity69 rules against police in drunk driving case many factors besides gender and weight influence a person 's blood alcohol content , and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel
the @entity6 investigates transportation accidents and advocates on safety issues
it can not impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures , including @entity89
but the independent agency is influential on matters of public safety and its decisions can spur action from like - minded legislators and transportation agencies nationwide
states set their own @entity9 standards
the board also recommended on tuesday that states vastly expand laws allowing police to swiftly confiscate licenses from drivers who exceed the blood alcohol limits
and it is pushing for laws requiring all first - time offenders to have ignition locking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed
in the early 1980s , when grass - roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving , many states required a 0.15 @entity9 rate to demonstrated intoxication
but over the next 24 years , @entity118 and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 @entity9 standard , the last state falling in line in 2004
the number of alcohol - related highway fatalities , meanwhile , dropped from 20,000 in 1980 to 9,878 in 2011 , the @entity6 said
drunk - drive blood tests divide @entity69 in recent years , about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment , the @entity6 said
" i think .05 is going to come
how long it takes to get there , we do n't know
but it will happen , " said the @entity6 's @entity133 , who helped guide the staff report
for some , the vote struck close to home
@entity6 board member @entity137 noted that one of his relatives had been killed by a drunk driver and another is serving a 15 - year sentence in a related death
many of the recommendations " are going to be unpopular , " @entity137 said
" but if we keep doing what we 're doing , we 're not going to make any difference
" the @entity6 cited research that showed most drivers experience a decline in both cognitive and visual functions with a bac of 0.05
currently , more than 100 countries on six continents have @entity9 limits set at 0.05 or lower , the safety board said
the @entity6 has asked all 50 states to do the same
@entity157 : teen drinking and driving rates cut in half a restaurant trade association , the @entity161 , attacked the main recommendation , saying the average woman reaches 0.05 percent @entity9 after consuming one drink
the group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the @entity170 ( @entity170 )
but @entity170 told @entity171 on tuesday it no longer uses that chart " as there are many variables " that contribute to an individual 's level of intoxication
a new @entity170 chart shows a person with a 0.05 bac level experiences " reduced coordination , reduced ability to track moving objects , difficulty steering , ( and ) reduced response to emergency driving situations
" a beer industry trade group said it would examine @entity6 's recommendation for lowering the blood - alcohol threshold
" however , we strongly encourage policymakers to direct their efforts where we know we can get results : by focusing on repeat offenders and increasing penalties on those with @entity9 of ( 0.15 ) or more , " said @entity189 , president of the @entity190
the safety board also recommend that @entity170 provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes
@entity170 , which oversees highway safety as a federal regulator and analyzes traffic crash data , said it would work with any state that wants to pursue a lower @entity9 standard to " gather further information on that approach
" at tuesday 's meeting , the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist 's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a @entity9 limit , or refuses to take the @entity9 test
some 40 states already use the administrative tool , which the @entity6 believes is effective because it is swift and immediate
and the board recommended more widespread use of passive alcohol sensors , which police can use to " sniff " the air during a traffic stop to determine the presence of alcohol
the sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints
if the sensor alerts , it is grounds for more thorough testing
the @entity6 recommended last december that states require ignition interlocks for all @entity246 offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance
tuesday 's recommendations were timed to coincide with the deadliest alcohol - related crash in @entity2 history
on may 14 , 1988 , a drunk driver drove his pickup the wrong way on @entity256 near @entity257 , @entity258
the truck hit a school bus , killing 24 children and three adults
more than 30 others were hurt
what sways teens not to drink , drive ? stories , not stats
