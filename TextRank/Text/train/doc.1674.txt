@entity2 's mayor has purportedly been filmed on cellphone video smoking crack cocaine , the @entity0 reported
the footage appears to show @entity11 " sitting in a chair , wearing a white shirt , top buttons open , inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe , " the newspaper says
two of the newspaper 's reporters were shown the footage may 3 by someone who claims to have supplied the crack and shot the video
this person told the @entity0 that they have previously given the mayor crack
the reporters watched the video three times
the newspaper reports that the 90 - second video allegedly shot last winter shows @entity32 " incoherent , trading jibes with an off - camera speaker who goads the clearly impaired mayor by raising topics including @entity31 leader @entity31 and the high school football team @entity32 coaches
" " i 'm f --- ing right wing , " @entity32 seems to mutter , the report says
" everyone expects me to be right wing
i 'm just supposed to be this great ... " the newspaper says that the mayor appears to refer to the players on the football team as " just f --- ing minorities
" @entity45 claims the video ends when the smartphone rings and the mayor says , " that phone better not be on
" read the @entity0 's story about the cellphone video the video is being shopped around by a group of men involved in the drug trade , the @entity0 reported thursday
the newspaper says that it has no way to verify the authenticity of the tape , and reports that its attempts to get comment from the mayor or his staff thursday about the video were unsuccessful
thursday night , @entity32 's chief of staff , @entity64 , would not listen to questions by the @entity0 and hung up on a reporter , the newspaper reports

" @entity67 has calls into the mayor and the mayor 's lawyer , @entity74

the @entity77 reporter did not pay for it and the man with the phone took off
@entity74 called @entity77 's report " false and defamatory , " the @entity0 reported

a reporter asked @entity102 whether he believes the allegations are false
" i hope so , " he replied
the mayor should address the accusations " sooner than later , " he said
" i would advise the mayor to speak to the media but i think he has to do it in a prepared way
" another reporter asked whether the scandal makes it possible @entity32 to continue to govern
@entity102 said he still has confidence in @entity32 , but said that he is willing to step up and replace the mayor if that becomes necessary
regardless , the scandal is hurting the city 's reputation as the @entity0 and @entity77 's coverage is reposted around the world , the deputy mayor said
" whether you can blame the mayor or not blame the mayor depends on whether the story is true , " @entity102 said
" i do n't know that and i do n't know that any of you do
" he added : " certainly we all know that videos can be altered and we certainly know that drug dealers ca n't be trusted
" read the @entity0 's coverage of @entity102 's reaction @entity67 has been trying to interview the mayor for several months regarding the recommendation that @entity2 create supervised injection centers for drug addicts
the mayor has declined all of @entity67 's requests .
