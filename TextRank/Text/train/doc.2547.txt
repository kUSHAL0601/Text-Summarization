-- do i stay or do i go ? almost everyone has already boarded the plane , including dozens of journalists
the airport staff , including lots of security guards , are now glaring at me
this is the flight many people believe will carry @entity10 from @entity11 to @entity12
but there 's no sign of @entity10
my cameraman is already on the plane
he 's supposed to message me if there 's a confirmed sighting
if i get on and @entity10 does n't we 're committing to a @entity12 round trip that will take us a long way from the story
there are too many scenarios and no safe bets
if i do n't see him and do n't board , he could still join the aircraft on the tarmac later
another journalist is already tweeting excitedly about a @entity33 van parked next to the plane
i 'm constantly on the phone with @entity36
the bosses make a decision
there 's only one way to know for sure
read more : @entity10 ' free man ' for a story with so few confirmed facts , sending us on a flight to @entity12 , despite the uncertain outcome , was considered a valuable insurance policy
when i step on board i see a frenzy of men with video cameras and flight attendants trying to stop them
but there 's no @entity10
so we wait , nervously glancing between the door and the tarmac
there is an unusually high number of men in police - like uniforms surrounding the plane
a hungry media pack is desperately looking for any sign of the man as the clock ticks down to our departure time
but hope is not dead
he could still be whisked out to meet the plane
that 's not what happens
minutes later the @entity78 jet is in the air bound for @entity80
the story remains on the ground somewhere in @entity11
after takeoff , we do a row - by - row search
we look in the galleys , the washrooms
i stick my head in the curtained - off rest area for the flight crew
a grey haired @entity93 man stares back with confusion in the dark space
it all confirms what we were already pretty sure of
read more : no - show leaves reporters stuck on plane there 's only one area we ca n't check - the cockpit
it seems unlikely @entity93 authorities or @entity109 would allow @entity10 to travel in the secure pointy end of the aircraft
but the circumstances of this story fit the general rule i 've developed through living in @entity93
anything , no matter how logic defying , is possible
i keep a close eye on the crew coming and going from the cockpit just in case
frustrated journalists huddle around seat 17a
some earlier reports said this was where @entity10 would be sitting
a good part of the flight is spent debating theories on @entity10 's plans for escape and his chances of success
what role @entity93 and @entity139 ? it 's all just speculation with a little logic thrown in
in other words , like so many people around the world right now , we 're all just guessing
but at least we knew he was n't on the aircraft
back on earth , my colleagues at @entity0 had no way of being so certain
moments before takeoff , i 'd communicated by phone there was no sign of @entity10
but that did n't mean he was n't on board somewhere
and as we crossed the globe i had no way of passing on the results of our detailed search
neither @entity109 nor the @entity93 government had confirmed or denied if he was on the flight
so my news organization was still tracking its path across @entity93 , @entity168 , the @entity169 , @entity170 and the eastern states of @entity172
we even flew very close to @entity0 's world headquarters in @entity174
read more : how hunt humiliated @entity172 it was not until the aircraft doors opened at our destination and i first felt the sticky , warm @entity12 air that i was able to call in again and confirm definitively @entity10 had not left @entity93 on that flight
a much dreamed of travel destination for this @entity184 journalist
those dreams would remain unfulfilled
i 'd arrived with no accreditation or visa
i could n't legally enter the country
my @entity80 adventure involved one hour in the transit lounge desperately negotiating with officials to allow me back on the same aircraft for the return flight to @entity11
but during my brief time in the soulless transit area there were still many incredibly warm @entity80 smiles
the return flight was even less eventful
@entity202 was spent writing this account and editing the video story of our travels
in total we endured around 30 hours of pretty darn comfortable business class travel for little journalistic result
it 's not the stuff that inspires enormous work satisfaction in my trade
but after arriving back in @entity11 and while sitting in this city 's horrific traffic , one senior @entity0 editor thanked me for making the journey
he said the time consuming , sleep depriving , costly act necessary to confirm @entity10 was n't on that flight was highly valuable in our coverage of a story where basic questions remain unanswered
what will @entity10 do next ?
