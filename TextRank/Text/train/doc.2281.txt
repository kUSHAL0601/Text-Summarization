-- @entity1 scored twice for @entity2 as the @entity4 champions crushed @entity5 5 - 0 to claim their first @entity6 win in this season 's @entity7
@entity2 opened the scoring in the 19th minute of a wet evening in @entity10 , when @entity11 turned a @entity13 cross from the right into his own net and they doubled their lead three minutes later when @entity18 headed home @entity20 's left - wing center
goalkeeper @entity22 gifted @entity2 their third , dropping @entity18 's cross onto @entity1 's head for the @entity26 's first goal of the night , while @entity1 added his second soon after the interval -- firing home after exchanging passes with @entity13
@entity1 has now scored 14 goals already this season and takes his total number of @entity2 goals to 193 , joint second with @entity36 @entity35 in @entity2 's all - time list of leading scorers
@entity20 added a last - gasp fifth goal for @entity2 , after @entity5 had made a mess of a free - kick , as the @entity43 giants equalled their biggest - ever @entity7 win
@entity2 are level on four points with @entity46 at the top of the group , after the @entity50 champions saw off @entity52 side @entity51 2 - 0 at the @entity53
@entity46 opened the scoring in the 53rd minute when @entity55 marked his return from injury by netting from the penalty spot after @entity59 handled in the area
and @entity55 set up @entity46 's second 13 minutes later , holding off his marker before slipping the ball through for @entity63 to deftly find the net
@entity5 and @entity51 are joint third on one point apiece and already look to have a mountain to climb against the two giants of the group
@entity70 are top of @entity71 with four points from their first two matches , despite conceding a late penalty in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity77 side @entity76
@entity79 midfielder @entity78 , who was restored to the side by manager @entity81 after being left out of their weekend win over @entity84 , opened the scoring in the 56th minute when converting @entity87 's pull - back
but , just three minutes from time , @entity88 levelled from the spot after substitute @entity90 handled a cross in the area
@entity93 are second in the table with three points after a 2 - 0 home victory over @entity98 champions @entity97
@entity99 opened the scoring on the half hour mark , slamming home a shot from a tight angle , and veteran midfielder @entity105 sealed the win in injury time with a superb volley -- his first goal in more than 18 months
@entity76 are third in the table on two points , after drawing their opening two games , with @entity97 propping up the others with just a single point from their two matches
in @entity118 , @entity117 winger @entity116 entered the record books as the @entity121 side beat @entity122 2 - 1 at the @entity123
@entity124 , 18 , opened the scoring with a composed eighth minute finish to become the youngest - ever @entity127 to score in the competition
@entity130 left - back @entity129 scored his first @entity117 goal from a tight angle to double their lead before @entity135 pulled a goal back with an unmarked header from inside the area
@entity117 are second in the table with four points , two behind @entity142 champions @entity141 , who lead the way with a maximum six points after cruising to a 3 - 0 home win over @entity147
@entity148 gave the hosts a 1 - 0 half - time lead when he fired home a low shot from outside the area and they doubled their lead in the 62nd minute when @entity155 blasted home after superbly chesting the ball down
@entity148 added his second , and @entity141 's third , seven minutes later , converting from the penalty spot after @entity155 had been bundled to the ground by @entity147 captain @entity162
the only down side for @entity141 was the late dismissal of @entity165 , who was shown a second yellow card for diving
meanwhile , @entity169 champions @entity168 battled back from going behind to claim a 3 - 1 @entity170 win over 10 - man @entity171
@entity173 winners @entity171 went ahead in the 10th minute when @entity175 @entity174 netted from @entity177 's right - wing cross , but the home side drew level 10 minutes later when @entity180 scored from the edge of the area after goalkeeper @entity183 had deflected a @entity185 cross into his path
@entity171 had defender @entity187 sent off for two yellow cards just before the break -- and @entity168 took control in the second half
@entity180 scored his and @entity168 's second when converting from close range and @entity194 added a third 18 minutes from time when turning home @entity198 's cross
however , surprise leaders of the group after two matches are @entity203 side @entity202 , who drew 1 - 1 at last season 's quarterfinalists @entity207
that result leaves @entity202 on four points , with @entity168 and @entity171 on three apiece and @entity207 trailing on a single point .
