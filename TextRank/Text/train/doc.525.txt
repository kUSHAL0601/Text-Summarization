-- @entity1 most notably played geeky , annoying neighbor @entity2 on the ' 90s sitcom " @entity4 " -- but since then , the actor , who has portrayed @entity6 , @entity7 and a member of the opposite sex , does n't feel recognized for his ability to take on a variety of roles
" i 'm very versatile , but somehow i did n't earn the tag of being called a versatile actor , " @entity1 , 34 , tells people
" i 'm still chasing that one @entity17 tag that says , ' this guy 's a versatile actor
but for me , it 's like what do i have to do to get that [ acknowledgement ] ? " @entity1 , who says he gets " recognized everywhere i go , " is n't big on reminiscing about the days of playing the character who made him a household name
" i do n't [ miss playing @entity2 ] , " he says
" i really do n't
i 'm not trying to get away from it or anything like that , but i do n't miss the role at all -- really
i just want to work
i want my daughter to say , ' i know what @entity31 does , ' not ' what @entity31 did
" @entity1 -- who most recently played an inmate on @entity37 's @entity36 , @entity38 earlier this year -- guest stars as a scheming wealthy director on the season premiere of fellow former child star @entity42 's latest sitcom , @entity34 !
the actor says it 's " cool " sharing a screen with @entity47 , who he has n't filmed with since his small stint on @entity49 many years ago
the episode , which airs monday night at 8 p.m. on @entity51 , is the first of many more roles to come , predicts @entity1
" i just want people to know i have n't gone anywhere , " he says
" the passion was gone for awhile , but i 've got my mojo back
