-- friends , @entity2 and soccer fans lend me your ears -- the shimmy and shake of the caxirola is coming to a football match near you soon
the pear - shaped plastic percussion piece is to be the musical instrument of choice for the @entity15 after it was given the seal of approval by @entity2 's @entity18
about time too some might argue after the raucous cacophony of the vuvuzela -- the long , plastic horn trumpeted on the terraces during the 2010 soccer @entity15 in @entity24
" for many people , the vuvuzela is very noisy , but the truth is that no one forgets , " said the caxirola 's inventor @entity2 composer @entity25 , who was nominated for an @entity28 in 2012
" she foretold that we should continue the pace
as a musician , i could not stop and there arose caxirola , a little less noisy
" if the buzzing vuvuzela , whose raspy monotones drew comparisons to a swarm of angry bees and divided opinion , provided the sound track to the @entity15 three years ago , @entity2 's aural arouser is based on the caxixi , a woven @entity49 instrument filled with dried beans
designed to produce a gentler sound -- similar to maracas or rainsticks -- and dressed in the green and yellow colours of @entity2 's national flag , the caxirola has also been given a ringing endorsement by the country 's president @entity58
" this image of the green and yellow caxirola , it enchants because of the fact that we are talking about a ' green ' plastic in a country that leads in sustainability in the world , " she said at the instrument 's recent launch
" and at the same time it is an object that has the ability to do two things , to combine the image with sound and take us to our goals
" @entity79 whistle vuvuzelas were so popular during the @entity81 that manufacturers such as @entity83 were selling as many as 50,000 of them a month
@entity25 wants his invention to have similar mass appeal when the @entity15 arrives in @entity2 for its fiesta of football
" the caxirola as with the vuvuzela , is the ball of the fans , " explained @entity25
" we want every @entity94 to have a caxirola in their hands
" however , @entity2 might not want their musical invention to follow quite the same path as the vuvuzela
attempts to ban the plastic horn during the @entity15 itself may have failed but it soon found itself on the not - wanted list at global sporting tournaments
@entity108 's governing soccer body @entity108 banned them from all competitions , including the @entity111 , the @entity112 and @entity113 matches
@entity115 and @entity116 were among the first @entity118 clubs to silence the vuvuzela , banning it from their grounds because of concerns over irritation and safety
vuvuzelas got such a bad reputation that they were also barred from the @entity128 tennis championship at the @entity129
traditional football rattles , though they were lessening in popularity , also disappeared from stadiums in the 1970s because of safety concerns
if the caxirola follows the fate of the vuvuzela or rattle , @entity2 has a @entity139 involving the production of a plastic version of the indigenous pedhua whistle , which mimics bird calls
so , whoever wins the @entity15 can blow their own whistle -- or do the caxirola shake .
