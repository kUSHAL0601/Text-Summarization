-- world no. 1 @entity1 set up a semifinal showdown with @entity4 after winning his third successive match at the season - ending @entity6 in @entity7 on friday
the @entity8 overcame sixth seed @entity10 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 6 - 1 to repeat his victory over the @entity12 in the @entity14 final in july
third seed @entity15 will play no. 2 @entity17 in saturday evening 's second semifinal after handing @entity20 @entity19 his third successive defeat in friday 's closing match of the round - robin stage
the 24 - year - old , who needed to win just one set to progress , completed his seventh straight win over @entity10 despite losing his cool with an umpiring call
@entity1 was infuriated when @entity10 was allowed to challenge a decision in the 12th game and was given the point as his backhand was shown to touch the line and not be long
@entity1 calmed himself down after a long , heated exchange with the umpire and held serve before winning the tie - break comfortably and then racing away with the second set to reach the last four of the event for the first time
behind the scenes at the @entity6 " it was a very important victory because every day i 'm playing a little better and today i played a great match
it 's going to be a really , really difficult match against @entity4 , " he told the crowd after ending @entity10 's hopes of progressing
@entity1 has never won an indoor hardcourt tournament , and failed to win a set at the @entity51 last year
he has beaten @entity4 eight times in their 12 meetings , but lost to the @entity56 player on hardcourt in @entity58 in august and retired hurt on the same surface during their @entity62 last - 16 clash in january
@entity1 won their first two hardcourt meetings in 2007 but they went 2 - 2 last year
in friday 's final @entity66 match , @entity15 needed to win only one set to earn a clash with @entity69 winner @entity17
@entity19 , who lost his first two games , needed to win in straight sets to go through as runner - up
he had won his past four encounters with @entity15 , three of them being two - setters
but it was the @entity77 who prevailed with the minimum of fuss , winning 6 - 2 6 - 3 as he suffered none of the contact lens problems that hampered him in his earlier defeat by @entity1
" it 's definitely a great achievement to get to the semifinals
it 's great for the tournament to have the top four guys in the semifinals , " the 23 - year - old , who walked out to the court wearing a joke eye patch , told the crowd afterwards .
