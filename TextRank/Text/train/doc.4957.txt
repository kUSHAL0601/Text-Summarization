-- did you have a @entity3 moment when you first heard about @entity4 crashing in eastern @entity5 ? i am talking about the @entity7 archduke @entity3 , whose assassination 100 years ago sparked @entity9 the reaction from some politicians and hacks suggested they were having such a moment , after the @entity14 crash -- hinting that the world would never be the same
the @entity17 @entity16 , en route from @entity19 to @entity20 , crashed in the @entity22 region of war torn eastern @entity5 , in an area controlled by anti-government forces , known as " pro-russian separatists " in the @entity27
even before any details of the crash were confirmed , @entity28 found itself in the dock , accused of being responsible for the deaths of 298 people on board that plane , including citizens of the @entity36 , @entity4 , @entity37 and the @entity38
the most amazing part of this whole dramatic saga came when @entity28 president @entity41 held a " scheduled , " as we were assured , phone conversation with @entity45 president @entity44 , which , as fate would have it , actually took place when the wreckage of flight @entity14 was still burning on the ground in a field not far from the town of @entity55
talk about coincidences , eh ? according to @entity58 and @entity59 statements on the call , @entity44 and @entity41 discussed the crisis on the ground in @entity5 , sanctions and ways to find a diplomatic solution before @entity41 noted reports that a @entity17 plane had crashed
details of the two leaders ' exchange regarding the crash have not been revealed but it would seem safe to assume that @entity41 would have tried to assure his @entity45 counterpart that @entity28 had nothing to do with the downing of the airliner
@entity44 probably pretended to believe him but kept an open mind about it , especially as his stern - faced national security advisers -- of whom there are plenty these days -- were likely telling him that everything pointed to @entity28 playing some part in this tragedy
naturally , the moment the plane hit the ground , the @entity5 government pointed the finger of blame at @entity92 , accusing it of arming the rebels in the east and providing all sorts of backup
handily , a recording of a supposed phone conversation between two " @entity28 officers , " one in eastern @entity5 and the other in @entity28 , was produced , intended to prove that they were discussing the downing of the plane
but , in all honesty , it would be tough for the @entity5 government and its allies to explain how this rag tag army -- and yes , it is a rag tag army , whatever some people claim -- could have managed to bring down a plane flying at an altitude of 33,000 feet
some talking heads on the box have been saying that as the separatists have already brought down a number of @entity5 aircraft they could have shot down flight @entity14
there 's only one problem though : all the previous aircraft were flying at much lower altitudes , some actually as low as a few hundred yards from the ground , while flight @entity14 was way out of reach of all the shoulder - held antiaircraft missiles that the anti-government forces have in their possession
so to bring down a passenger plane at such altitude a much more sophisticated system would have been needed , not to mention personnel on the ground with the specific training required to operate it
nevertheless , @entity41 will have a very tough time convincing the world that @entity28 had nothing to do with the downing of flight mh17
because on the face of it the circumstantial evidence is against him
you know , @entity146 becoming part of @entity28 and " pro-russian separatists " waging a war with government troops in the east with @entity92 's backing
so in the @entity58 they are obviously getting ready for some serious turbulence , if you pardon the expression , hoping to tough it out -- especially as the situation at the moment remains unclear , with both the @entity28 military and the @entity161 providing conflicting reports of what " might " have happened
mind you , the @entity58 has already come up with one brilliant move , saying last night it would refuse to accept the two black boxes from flight @entity14 that have been recovered by the anti-government fighters at the place of the crash
in theory that denies @entity171 the opportunity to claim that @entity28 is " tampering " with the evidence ... although @entity5 claimed friday that @entity28 held the recording devices nonetheless
the one thing that will most definitely change after the downing of flight @entity14 is that the civil war raging in @entity5 that had somehow been forgotten by the outside world will now -- with the death of nearly 300 foreign citizens -- get an international dimension
and maybe , just maybe , all the key players will now make a serious effort to try to stop the bloodshed there
and the @entity3 moment will just be a moment and nothing else .
