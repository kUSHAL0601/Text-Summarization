@entity0 -- the @entity2 said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to @entity8 attacked @entity2 diplomatic compounds in @entity10 and @entity11 on tuesday , killing an @entity2
in @entity0 , several men scaled the walls of the @entity14 and tore down its @entity2 flag , according to @entity1 producer @entity16 , who was on the scene
in @entity10 , witnesses say members of a radical @entity21 group called @entity22 protested near the @entity2 @entity23 in @entity24 , where @entity26 jets established no - fly zones last year to blunt ground attacks from then @entity10 strongman @entity29
the group then clashed with security forces in the city , blocking roads leading to the consulate , witnesses said
a @entity37 officer was killed in the violence in @entity24 , secretary of state @entity35 said in a statement late tuesday
" we are heartbroken by this terrible loss , " @entity40 said
" our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack
" @entity40 said that she condemned the attack on the @entity2 facilities " in the strongest terms " and that following tuesday 's events , the @entity2 government was " working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel , our missions and @entity2 citizens worldwide
" @entity10 's @entity59 also condemned the attack , saying it " led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals
" lawmakers said in a statement tuesday night that they were investigating
it was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated , @entity1 national security contributor @entity66 said tuesday night
" one such breach of an embassy or consulate 's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news
... the fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where @entity2 are remembering those that we lost , you have to ask yourself , what are @entity2 officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related ? " she asked
in @entity11 , police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the @entity92 in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing , but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the @entity2 compound
the black flag , which hangs in full view from inside the complex , is adorned with white characters that read , " there is no @entity104 but @entity105 and @entity106 is his messenger , " an emblem often used by @entity8 radicals
a volley of warning shots were fired , as a large crowd gathered around the compound , although it is not clear who fired the shots

@entity11 groups point to @entity2 websites , including @entity121 , that have scenes from the film
some anti-muslim blogs also have flagged the movie
in a series of disjointed scenes , the film depicts @entity106 as a child molester , womanizer and ruthless killer
the movie was made by @entity133 , an @entity134 - @entity2 real - estate developer , according to the @entity135
@entity133 -- who wrote , directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of @entity8 as a hateful religion , the @entity135 reported , citing a telephone interview with him
@entity133 , 52 , told the newspaper that to make the film , he had raised $ 5 million from about 100 @entity143 donors , who he declined to identify
he said he made the two - hour movie over a three - month period last year in @entity145 , using about 60 actors and 45 crew members , the @entity135 reported
most of the @entity8 world considers depictions of @entity106 to be blasphemous and deeply offensive
" some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the @entity155 , " @entity40 said
" the @entity2 deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others
our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation
" but she stressed that " there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind
" @entity14 officials issued a warning to @entity2 in @entity11 , telling them to avoid the demonstrations which " may gather in front of the @entity2 embassy , or @entity11 government buildings such as the @entity175 and @entity176
" " it is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets , but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another , " the @entity2 @entity14 said in a statement
" large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and @entity188 should be avoided this afternoon
" frenzied protesters could been seen tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded @entity2 flag to television camera crews while chanting anti- @entity2 slogans
an embassy phone operator told @entity1 that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day ahead of the apparent threat , while @entity11 riot police and the army were called in
" this is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult , " said @entity200 , a spokesman for the @entity201
" but events like this are extremely deplorable
and we have to work to get things under control
" the @entity210 issued a statement tuesday , pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests ' potentially debilitating effects on the @entity11 economy
" there are police forces at the demonstrations , " @entity200 said
" they should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave
" several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations tuesday , including @entity227 leader @entity226 , who is president of @entity11 's conservative @entity229 television channel
@entity230 -- the brother of @entity232 leader @entity231 -- added , " we called for the peaceful protest joined by different @entity8 factions including the @entity235 ( and the ) @entity237 movement
" " we were surprised to see the big numbers show up , including the soccer @entity240 fans , " he said
" i just want to say , how would the @entity2 feel if films insulting leading @entity244 figures like the pope or historical figures like @entity247 were produced ? " he added that " the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner , alluding to topics like sex , which is not acceptable
" the @entity2 @entity14 in @entity0 announced that it had canceled visa services for wednesday
it also said in a statement that it " condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of @entity258 -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions
" " respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of @entity2 democracy , " the statement said
" we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others
" the embassy statement set off a political spat back in the @entity2 after the @entity277 presidential nominee , @entity276 , criticized its message and linked it to his opponent for the @entity280
" it 's disgraceful that the @entity284 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks , " @entity276 said in a statement released late tuesday
he said he was " outraged " by the attacks in @entity10 and @entity11
the @entity291 campaign quickly responded to @entity276 's comments
" we are shocked that , at a time when the @entity2 is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in @entity10 , governor @entity276 would choose to launch a political attack , " @entity293 , an @entity291 campaign spokesman said in an email
demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the @entity11 street , where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former @entity11 president @entity308
this summer , @entity11 's first @entity21 president , @entity309 , was sworn into power at @entity311 , the scene of the nation 's revolution in 2011
though tuesday 's embassy protests are the first that @entity309 has dealt with , @entity11 recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the @entity134 and @entity320 embassies in unrelated episodes
" these protests are a bad image for @entity11 , " said a @entity0 street vendor named @entity323
" of course i 'm against insulting @entity8 , but it 's the undereducated , poor people who are out here causing problems
" " all i want for @entity11 is security and stability , " he said
" and as you can see this is n't it
" the incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the @entity2 in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead
tuesday 's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an @entity351 @entity350 lawmaker to portray @entity8 as a violent religion
@entity354 ' film " @entity355 , " which he released online , featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the @entity359
report : @entity11 's ex-pm @entity361 faces arrest , extradition order @entity11 kills militants , seizes weapons in @entity367 offensive @entity2 companies eye @entity11 for investment @entity1 's @entity371 in @entity0 , @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 and @entity377 contributed to this report
