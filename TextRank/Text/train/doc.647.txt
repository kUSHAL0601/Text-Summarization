-- a controversial car modification pioneered by @entity2 will be banned for the next @entity4 season after the rest of the teams voted against it
the f - duct aerodynamic system , which channels air flow to allow vehicles to go faster on the straights , has also been adapted by @entity13
however , concerns have arisen about how the feature is operated , with @entity13 's version requiring the driver to open and close a hole in the cockpit with his hands -- meaning less control over the steering wheel
@entity2 unsuccessfully tried to convince the other teams at a meeting before sunday 's @entity26 @entity25 , won by @entity28 's @entity27 , that the innovation should not be barred
the @entity30 told @entity0 that the decision was part of a package of measures that will be forwarded to motorsport 's governing body , the @entity35 , for ratification
a @entity30 spokesperson said details of the other recommendations would not be made available at this stage
@entity28 boss @entity42 outlined his opposition to the f - duct system
" it is a clever piece of engineering and hats off to the guys who invented it , but some of the solutions this weekend look a bit marginal when you see drivers driving with finger tips and no hands , " he said in quotes carried by @entity46
" so i think there is a safety issue and a cost issue to take into account
" at the weekend , @entity13 's @entity63 , who finished second in @entity64 , denied claims that he had to drive with his hand off the wheel , saying he has a pad sewn into his left glove to close the air hole
" in the simulator we practiced with this method so that now it is automatic
but in the future we will find a more comfortable solution for the drivers , " he told @entity76 's @entity75
however , @entity81 chief @entity80 also backed the banning of the system , according to @entity84
" i personally think that it is sensible to nip in the bud technologies that , on the face of it , do n't really have a relevance for use outside of @entity4 , " he said
" by the end of the year i know we , and i am sure most of the other teams , will have an f - duct on their car -- and that neutralizes the advantage of having it
" the engineers have already come up with ideas for next year that are zany in the extreme , and it is difficult to see how they would be used elsewhere
plus they would be expensive
" what we should be encouraging is stuff that we can be using elsewhere , and i am personally a big proponent of @entity106 because of that
" @entity106 were used to great effect by @entity2 and @entity13 last year , while @entity109 and @entity110 also used the technology
it was banned for this year , but some teams hope to have it reinstated for 2011
earlier this year , the @entity4 teams voted to ban the double - diffuser system from next season
@entity116 successfully used it at the start of 2009 to gain a big advantage which led to it winning the world constructors ' title and also the drivers ' crown for @entity125 .
