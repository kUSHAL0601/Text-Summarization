-- i would love to say my dog is intellectually qualified to be a service animal
there 's barely enough brainpower there to be a lamp
in fact , @entity10 's only apparent skills appear to be power napping and somehow reaching unspeakable parts of his body with his tongue
which , to be fair , is definitely a skill , though not one that easily lends itself to helping humans
" there 's a little boy stuck in the well ! @entity23 , @entity10 , molest yourself for 20 minutes ! " alas , being a true service animal requires something special
and even some of the very brightest dogs , those with the best training in the world , never quite live up to their potential
and that 's exactly what happened to @entity35 , a golden @entity36 who was supposed to become a guide dog
if it was n't for those damn cats
that was @entity35 's weakness
just could n't lay off the cats
thus , @entity35 never graduated to calmly lead blind people across the street , for fear that he might actually lead blind people across a tree
but it turns out he had another calling
taxi became a seizure alert dog , for 14 - year - old @entity53 of @entity54 , @entity55
when @entity53 was born , she had an abnormality on the right side of her brain that caused epileptic seizures
for the first several years of her life she was mostly nonverbal and could n't eat solid food
when she turned 6 , however , two corrective surgeries greatly reduced the frequency of her seizures and allowed her to start developing new skills
then , four years ago , @entity35 came into her life
ever since , they 've been inseparable ; he even joins her at school
and this year , @entity35 finally got his own picture in the yearbook
that was a big talker all over the @entity72 this week
when @entity53 takes taxi with her to school , he 's there to warn of oncoming seizures and to also assist her in the event of one actually happening
but mostly he just lays around , not participating in anything remotely educational
so , in a lot of ways , his accomplishments in school are slightly more impressive than mine
unless you count occupying space and disrupting others
but there was just something about that photo
when @entity35 's big , serious face appeared in the @entity95 yearbook and hit the @entity72 , people just could n't resist
just to the right of @entity53
and just to the left of : @entity101
( @entity101 , welcome to @entity103 fame by association
now 's a good time to drop your new rap lp
) anyway , it 's a well - deserved addition
@entity53 's mom had joked about @entity35 's exclusion the previous year , so this time they got it right
and , if nothing else , @entity35 's newfound @entity103 fame has added an interesting bit of education about seizure alert dogs
@entity53 's family can share several incidents where , somehow , @entity35 just knew
conversely , sometimes i drop food on the kitchen floor and @entity10 literally has no idea
he 'll be just steps away
" @entity10 , there is literally free food on the floor
it 's bacon , stupid
" taxi would be all over that
now , it 's worth noting that the @entity138 is n't fully convinced that seizure - predicting dogs do exactly as some people believe
they believe the bulk of this evidence is mostly anecdotal
so , they warn people to exercise caution when considering this type of canine service
either way , there 's something special about @entity35
multiple times he 's warned others about oncoming seizures
he 's always right there on @entity53 's left side because that 's the direction she falls
and @entity35 knows to position himself there so he can protect her from slamming into the ground
again , just for comparison , i could be on fire and @entity10 would be completely preoccupied , lording over his @entity164 in the backyard where he 's waged a full - scale yet poorly strategized border war with @entity168 , the wiener dog next door
so , clearly , @entity35 is special and has earned his place in the yearbook
and just left of @entity173 follow @ @entity174 on @entity175
