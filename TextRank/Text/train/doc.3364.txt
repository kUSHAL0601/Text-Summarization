in august , @entity1 's propaganda arm released a video starring the @entity4 rapper @entity3
wearing combat fatigues and standing next to a waterfall in @entity7 , @entity3 raps in @entity4 calling on others to join the jihad and " to make an effort for @entity12
" @entity3 , whose real name is @entity14 , is one of several dozen @entity4 citizens who have fought in @entity7
their move to @entity7 marks an important shift in the focus of global jihadists
videos by @entity4 militants training with groups associated with @entity1 during 2009 and 2010 were invariably taped in the @entity26 - @entity25 border region
that region now is largely shunned by foreign militants partly because of effective @entity30 drones strikes and partly because @entity7 is now the destination choice for jihadists from around the world
@entity3 is one of the many thousands of foreign fighters who have been drawn to the jihad in @entity7 against the regime of @entity38 over the past three years
this group includes an estimated 800 to 900 from @entity40 , mostly from @entity4 , the @entity41 , @entity42 , the @entity43 and @entity44
a handful of @entity46 have also fought in @entity7
the concern , of course , is that these militants will swap business cards and will acquire arms training and bomb - making skills and will return to @entity54 countries and carry out acts of terrorism
this is what happened after the war in @entity26 during the 1980s
@entity61 veterans of those wars formed the heart of @entity1 and affiliated groups
@entity65 fought in the @entity66 against the @entity67 and then founded @entity1 , which subsequently , of course , launched the 9/11 attacks
the failure to pay adequate attention to the so - called " @entity72 " such as @entity65 proved an expensive one for the @entity46 and her allies
could @entity7 be a new @entity26 ? maybe
last month , for instance , @entity41 authorities arrested militants who were allegedly planning a terrorist attack
two @entity41 officials who work on counterterrorism issues told us that that the militants had traveled to @entity7
the 37 - year - old @entity3 was born in @entity83
his mother is @entity4 and his father from the @entity87 nation of @entity88
as a teenager , he became politicized during the first @entity90 , joining anti-american demonstrations in @entity83
" we marched , shouted and burned the @entity46 flag , " @entity14 recalled
@entity14 joined @entity83 street gangs and became a popular artist in the @entity4 gangsta - rap scene , known by his nom de rap " @entity3 " and touring with other rappers such as @entity99
after surviving a car accident , he started questioning his lifestyle and turned to @entity102 for answers
in 2010 , he ended his career as a rapper
@entity3 changed his name again to " @entity107 " and his rap songs became nasheeds , @entity102 devotional songs
@entity14 's nasheeds were posted on jihadist websites and became popular among @entity1 supporters
the ex-rapper went on to become one of the key figures in the militant @entity117 in @entity4
the group was banned by the @entity4 government last year and several of its members , including @entity14 , moved to @entity121 to avoid possible arrest by @entity4 authorities
@entity14 's whereabouts remained unclear for many months until the video was released in august showing him to be in @entity7 and rapping about the duty to " go into battle
" some 6,000 to 10,000 foreign fighters from more than 80 countries are believed to have traveled to @entity7 since the beginning of the conflict to join the rebels who aim to topple @entity38 's regime
close to 800 of those foreigners are from @entity135
@entity136 and @entity137 are the next highest contributors , according to residents and analysts , but @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and the @entity145 have also seen citizens join the rebel forces in @entity7
not all of these fighters have joined @entity1 linked groups in @entity7 , but it is likely that many of them have done so because they are generally @entity153 militants who are drawn to the conflict for religious reasons
@entity157 news reports estimate the number of @entity157 citizens fighting in @entity7 range from a few dozen to as many as 100
an @entity46 filmmaker , @entity162 , who lived with an @entity164 group in @entity7 for a year said he met with 20 to 30 @entity157
experts say the number of @entity46 fighting in @entity7 is likely less than 10
@entity167 , a former @entity46 solider , was charged this year with conspiring to use a rocket - propelled grenade in @entity7 , and he admitted to fighting with the @entity1 affiliate group , @entity169
@entity170 of @entity171 , @entity172 , was killed in may by @entity7 government forces who claimed she was fighting with an @entity1 linked insurgent group
how to prevent the foreign fighters in @entity7 fomenting acts of terrorism around the world ? the @entity46 and its allies should make a careful effort to find out the identities of the foreign fighters who have joined the jihadist groups fighting in @entity7
and the @entity46 should make clear to countries such as @entity135 , which is supplying hundreds of @entity135 fighters in @entity7 , that encouraging this kind of militancy could create a " blowback " problem in the @entity190 in the form of terrorism directed at @entity61 regimes
as for the former @entity3 , in september a jihadi forum released a statement saying that the @entity4 ex-rapper had been wounded by an air strike in @entity7 .
