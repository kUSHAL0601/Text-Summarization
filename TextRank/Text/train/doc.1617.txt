-- prominent human rights activist @entity1 was released from custody monday at the outset of the trial for suspects in the fatal july 2010 bombings in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity8 @entity10 justice @entity9 , who is presiding over the case , released @entity1 , a @entity12 , on grounds that the state had dropped charges against him
he was one of five suspects released monday
originally , 38 suspects were taken into custody , and that number had been trimmed to 19 before monday
the defendants have remained jailed on charges of terrorism , murder , attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder
the twin suicide bombings occurred at a popular rugby club and an @entity30 restaurant in the @entity8 capital where people had gathered to watch the @entity34 soccer finals from @entity35 in july 2010
the explosions , just minutes apart , left 76 dead and scores injured
the terrorist group @entity38 claimed responsibility , saying the attacks were in response to @entity8 's involvement with the @entity43
@entity1 has drawn specific attention to the case , as human rights activists have demanded his release
@entity48 had issued a statement friday demanding the @entity8 government " disclose any evidence it claims to have against the detained @entity12 human rights defender @entity1 or release him
" the @entity12 government also had urged @entity8 to send @entity1 back to @entity12 to be tried
@entity1 's lawyer @entity55 told @entity0 that @entity1 had traveled to @entity8 in his capacity as a human rights activist to " uphold law and justice " but instead had become a victim of injustice on allegations that " could not stand up
" he was arrested on september 15 , 2010 , in @entity8 , where he had traveled to observe court hearings of @entity12 suspects in the @entity7 bombings who had been transferred to @entity8
@entity1 was charged with terrorism under @entity8 's @entity68 , as well as murder and attempted murder , and was held in pre-trial detention for nearly a year
@entity1 's brother @entity72 was overjoyed , @entity55 told @entity0 , and @entity73 felt his brother had been " vindicated
" @entity8 says it is still under threat from extremists
last week , the government released a fresh terror alert and reminded the public to remain vigilant at all times and report anything suspicious to police
