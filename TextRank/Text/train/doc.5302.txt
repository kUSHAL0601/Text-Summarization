another year of @entity3 nominations , another year of " they forgot who ? ! " though the @entity3 are commonly known as the arbiter of excellence in television , with so many good shows on the air right now , they inevitably also become the leader of the snubs
what tv favorites had fans shouting at their screens after being left in the dark ? take a look : @entity17 for the win
it seemed like a no - brainer
last year 's omission of @entity22 , the uber - talented lead actress from @entity24 's sci - fi hit " @entity25 , " left fans in fits of rage
the self - proclaimed @entity17 -- named after the actress ' multiple clone characters -- did everything short of picketing the red carpet
now , that she has been left out a second time , all bets are off
get your pitchforks out now , " one enraged fan tweeted
" at least i have today off work to mourn @entity22 's emmys snub in the privacy of my own home , " another clone - clubber tweeted
fans were so affected by the snub that # @entity47 was a trending topic on @entity49 for much of thursday morning
for those who watch the show , this outrage should n't be too much of a surprise
the actress impressively portrays more than six characters , and sometimes , all of those characters appear in the same scene
sure , stand - ins and special effects offer a bit of assistance , but @entity22 inhabits her characters so fully , it 's easy to forget there are n't different actresses on screen
from reckless @entity68 to neurotic soccer mom @entity69 , all the way to free - spirited scientist @entity71 , @entity22 seamlessly jumps from one to the next
who could forget that incredible dance scene in the season 2 finale featuring four clones ? " how does the academy snub @entity22 for lead actress in a drama ? she plays 6 characters ! " fellow actress @entity80 tweeted
fans should n't get too upset , though ; @entity22 is a back - to - back @entity82 winner for her portrayal of the duplicates
and hey , there 's always season 3 ( thank you , @entity24 , for the much - needed renewal ) ! ' @entity89 ' : alive in the ratings , still dead to the @entity3
in just four seasons , @entity95 's " @entity89 " has gone from " that gory graphic novel show " to the highest - rated cable program in history
but for some reason , this zombie apocalyptic drama is not a hit with the @entity3
it scored no nods in any of the major categories ( though , to be fair , it did get one for editing and another for special effects )
" oh look , @entity89 got snubbed at the @entity3 again ... " one disappointed fan lamented
" yet again @entity89 gets snubbed at the @entity3 despite having some of the best writing and acting i 've seen on tv
lame , " another ranted
and not for nothing , but how could they leave off the magnificent @entity111 in the supporting actress category ? starting as a scared and battered wife and mother , @entity111 has taken the character to one of the toughest women in television
@entity119 steals @entity121 's thunder
@entity119 and @entity121 : two incredible actresses and comedians who have created , written and starred in their own shows , but one has just been snubbed by the @entity3
while writer / actress / director @entity119 is constantly recognized for her gritty and dark @entity127 comedy " girls , " @entity121 's much brighter @entity130 comedy about a single doctor struggling to find love is all but forgotten
even more awkward ? along with @entity133 , @entity121 was announcing the nominations thursday morning ! " endless props to @entity121 , who had to keep reading the teleprompter even after her snub , " vulture wrote on @entity49
" @entity121 robbed again by the @entity3
can we just start our own campaign to award her queen of everything ? " tweeted one @entity140 supporter
so what gives , emmys ? " the @entity147 " is not only funny , @entity121 is irresistibly adorable as the quirky lead
you also ca n't forget actor @entity150 , who has helped mold the cliched love interest into the loveable @entity152 , now everyone 's work crush
' yes , excellent lead actor @entity156 did get a nomination , but the show received no other nods , a serious oversight
in its fourth season , the dark @entity162 comedy was at its absolute best
although the quality of many shows drops as the series progresses , " @entity155 " has only gotten better
the @entity168 are like family at this point , albeit the most dysfunctional one around
and where do we begin with the absence of lead actress @entity174 for her portrayal of the family matriarch who manages to sometimes be a bigger wreck than her much - younger siblings ? how could voters forget her when she has the same name as the awards show ? " ew at that @entity174 snub emmys
i hate you so much right now , " a disgruntled fan tweeted
while @entity195 's " @entity194 " received plenty of love at this year 's nominations , its sophomore drama , " the @entity188 , " was not as lucky
this espionage thriller not only keeps fans constantly guessing at what is coming next , it manages to make us fall in love with @entity203 spies who are out to get @entity188
it is possible that @entity162 's perennial favorite " homeland " stole all the attention from " the @entity188 , " but anyone who has seen both knows they are vastly different
and do n't get fans started on the lack of a @entity211 nomination for lead actress
her performance is enough to make some @entity188 want to turn traitor just to partner up with her
" the emmys are anti-americans , " @entity218 columnist @entity217 cleverly tweeted
@entity221 gets a nom , but her shows find no love
yes , fans can rejoice ; @entity221 nabbed a nomination for lead actress for her portrayal of politician @entity229 on @entity231 's " @entity230
" now , the trick will be for her to win , which has n't happened with her previous nods
unfortunately , her two shows were missing from the comedy series category : " @entity230 " is the most obvious miss , with a crackling cast that matches the chemistry of " @entity239 " mixed with the political satire of @entity127 's " @entity241 " -- both of which have been @entity3 favorites
but the lesser - known snub would be @entity246 's " @entity245 , " of which @entity221 is executive producer
" @entity245 " follows two women in their 20s living in @entity249 , and the rest is just too crazy to even explain
it 's only one season in , and the hilarity that ensues between actresses @entity254 and @entity256 ( who also created the show ) is both bitingly smart and lol - funny
" it 's a joke @entity245 did n't get nominated for an @entity3
funniest show on tv , " a fan tweeted after the announcement
you can root for your favorites that were actually nominated ( or shout at the screen in protest for those who were not ) when the 2014 @entity3 air live on @entity231 at 8 p.m. et august 25
they 're hosted by " @entity272 's " @entity271
see who was nominated tell us : which shows did the @entity3 overlook ?
