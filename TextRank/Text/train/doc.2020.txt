@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few years ago , researchers at @entity4 made a remarkable discovery : when unsuspecting diners were given self - refilling bowls , they consumed almost twice as much soup as those with normal bowls
in other words , it was the quantity in the bowl that determined how much they ate , not their appetite
while researchers are only recently discovering the power of serving sizes , manufacturers have been manipulating consumers in this way for years , from stealthily shrinking the size of yogurt containers to super-sizing sodas
now it 's time for the government to take advantage of the power of portion size to save lives
we already know we should reduce the size of many of our food products -- not to mention our waistlines -- but there 's another item that needs to go on a diet : the pack of cigarettes
it 's time for the 10 - cigarette pack
the government mandates 20 cigarettes per pack
but cigarette packs with fewer cigarettes could bolster willpower and help smokers quit
let 's imagine that you are one of the 70 % of smokers who want to quit or cut back
craving a cigarette , you have no option but to buy the full pack of 20 -- leaving 19 readily available to soon entice you
would changing the pack size really help smokers quit ? many smokers do n't purchase cartons , because they want to limit their smoking
they are willing to pay a higher price per cigarette to limit availability , fearing that easy access would increase their smoking
now is the time to consider this move
@entity66 recently gave the @entity67 the jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products
before this congressional act , the @entity67 could regulate nicotine replacement therapies such as the patch and gum , but not the far more toxic tobacco
now , the @entity67 has comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing , marketing and sales of tobacco products
in fact , the @entity67 is developing new tobacco regulations ; it should consider portion size
most smokers actually want fewer cigarettes
the average number of cigarettes smoked per day declined among daily smokers from almost 19.6 in 1993 to not quite 16.8 in 2004 , according to the @entity88
@entity90 smokers consume even fewer cigarettes per day
a smaller pack can nudge smokers to smoke even less , just as buying only a pint of ice cream is safer for a dieter than buying a gallon
evidence suggests that those who cut back are more likely to quit
think about it : we could change what it means to be a pack - a - day smoker
the reason that we have the 20 - cigarette pack is to prevent youths from smoking by keeping the price high
while preventing teen smoking is critical , according to the @entity111 , only about 14 % of youths who smoke buy their own cigarettes directly from a store
the rest get them from family and friends
moreover , cigarette prices are higher than ever because of increased federal , state and even city excise taxes -- perhaps making friends and family less likely to share and teens even less likely to buy
we have other ways to prevent kids from picking up the habit
for example , under the latest @entity67 regulations , flavored cigarettes that appeal to youths are banned , as is all outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools
and it is still illegal to sell to people younger than 18
now that most smokers are trying to quit or cut back , we should allow or require smaller packs
if the size of the bowl can determine how much soup you eat , imagine what the size of the pack could do in determining how many cigarettes you smoke
it 's time to find out how much size matters
