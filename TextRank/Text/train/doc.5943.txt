-- relatives of 10 - year - old @entity2 and 8 - year - old @entity3 got news monday that no family wants
authorities identified the bodies found by hunters in a wooded area last week as those of the two young @entity12 cousins , missing since july
their bodies were found in the @entity14 in @entity15
chief @entity16 of the @entity17 , @entity12 , @entity18 , confirmed the news and said that the girls ' families had been notified , according to a statement from the @entity23
the cause of the death in both cases is pending
" our hearts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those precious little girls , " said @entity28 county sheriff @entity27
he vowed vigilance in pursuit of those responsible , and said no resource would be spared so that " justice may prevail
" @entity2 and @entity3 were last seen by their grandmother on july 13 when they left for a bike ride
the girls ' bicycles and a purse were found near @entity48 in @entity17 , hours after they were reported missing
a search of the 25 - acre lake turned up nothing , and authorities eventually said they believed that the cousins had been abducted
about a week after the girls disappeared , investigators said they thought @entity2 and @entity3 were alive
@entity57 spokeswoman @entity56 declined then to say exactly what evidence they had to push them toward that conclusion , urging anyone with information to come forward
a $ 50,000 reward was offered for information leading to the successful recovery of the girls and the prosecution of the person , or people , responsible
the girls ' disappearance sparked a massive volunteer search effort in @entity17 , a town of about 4,700 that is about 12 miles southeast of @entity75
last week , when the bodies were found but authorities had not yet identified them as belonging to the girls , residents gathered at @entity48 for a candlelight vigil , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity81
" i guess i 'm not surprised ... because of the length of time that they 've been missing , " @entity82 told the network
@entity87 works at @entity88 , where @entity3 was in fourth grade
she said keeping morale up at the school has been tough
students and staff created a " remembrance chain " that they will give to the girls ' families , along with a memorial made from pink ribbons
the chain is built from rings of colored construction paper
@entity3 's mother , @entity102 , posted a message on @entity104 last week expressing gratitude for the prayers and outpouring of support amid the " gut - wrenching news
" " we know that they are up in heaven with our savior , " she wrote
" lord we know that you have them in your loving arms and we are so blessed
" @entity0 's @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report .
