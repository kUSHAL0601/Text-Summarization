@entity0 -- an oil tanker captain was acquitted wednesday of the central charge in what 's widely considered @entity6 's worst environmental disaster -- a spill that blackened hundreds of miles of coastline
@entity9 , who was captain of the @entity10 during the accident in 2002 , was found not guilty of environmental crime
he was , however , convicted on a lesser charge of disobeying orders from @entity6 officials who tried to save the ship
@entity9 was sentenced to nine months in jail
but @entity6 legal experts said prison time is unlikely for someone sentenced to less than two years who has no prior criminal record
if he had been convicted of environmental crime , he could have faced up to 12 years in prison
another @entity26 officer on the ship , @entity25 , was acquitted altogether
so was @entity28 , former director general of @entity6 's @entity29 , the only @entity6 government official charged in the case
the three were not in court for the verdict
the court ruled that a precise cause for the accident could not be established , so criminal responsibility could not be determined
" no one knows with certainty what could be the cause of what happened , nor what should have been the appropriate response to the emergency situation created by the serious problem of the @entity10 , " the verdict reads
" but no one can deny the structural problem , nor could they show during the trial where that problem occurred exactly or why
" the group @entity54 , whose name means " never again , " said it was studying the 263 - page ruling
the group includes citizens and organizations that helped clean up the spill and served as a kind of class - action plaintiff in the case
@entity63 , attorney for @entity54 , called parts of the ruling " strange
" an appeal to @entity6 's @entity66 is possible
' @entity67 ' the @entity10 issued an alarm on november 13 , 2002 , during a storm with gale - force winds off northwest @entity6 in an area known as the @entity67 , famous for numerous shipwrecks
the ship reported it had a gash in its single hull and some of its cargo of 70,000 tons of fuel oil had started gushing out
@entity6 authorities soon ordered the stricken ship to move farther off the coast
it struggled for days but on november 19 , at 8 in the morning and about 145 nautical miles off the coast , it split in two and sank
oil continued to leak from it , at the bottom of the @entity87 , in the ensuing days
much of this oil , described by some as having the sticky consistency of chewing gum , blackened hundreds of miles of coastline in @entity6 and neighboring @entity93
it was an ecological disaster , with dead and oil - laden birds as a painful reminder
it was also an economic disaster for @entity6 's vital fishing industry , which was brought to a standstill for months over health concerns
in 2003 , the cost was estimated at about $ 5.7 billion
but the court wednesday did not assign damages to be paid because the defendants were acquitted of the principal charge of an environmental crime , which carried the potential for payments of damages , @entity63 said
@entity1 's @entity112 contributed to this report .
