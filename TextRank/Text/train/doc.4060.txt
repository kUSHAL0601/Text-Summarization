-- the @entity1 ran as scheduled sunday despite a jaw - dropping crash a day earlier that flung debris into the stands at the @entity5
at least 28 fans were injured when more than a dozen cars piled up in the final curve of the @entity9 300 in @entity10 , @entity11 , on saturday
some of the debris went over a 22 - foot - high fence that was built in 2010 , and some of it went through holes as the fence shredded when a car slammed into it and bounced back onto the track
" at 8 a.m. , we met with @entity23 , we reviewed all of the repairs that we made last evening , " speedway president @entity20 told reporters sunday morning
" we worked late into the evening and are prepared to go racing today
" some of the fans who were sitting in that area returned for sunday 's race , which began just after 1 p.m. et , @entity20 said
@entity29 won the race , edging out @entity31 and a host of others down the stretch
the wreck occurred when several closely packed cars were jostling for position at top speeds of about 175 mph
they got tangled up , setting off a dangerous chain reaction that ensnared several vehicles
reigning @entity43 champ @entity42 , who later told @entity0 on saturday that he and others were simply " going for the win , " was among those involved , while @entity46 somehow emerged unscathed and won the race
driver @entity50 's vehicle ended up flying into a fence that separates the track from spectators
the car broke into pieces , including tires and a fiery engine
@entity50 walked away from the crash , even after the front part of his no. 32 car was gone
he and the other nine drivers involved told reporters that they were checked at a medical tent on the @entity1 infield and released
some pieces of the shredded debris flew into the barrier , while others got into the stands -- some of it reaching the second level
@entity20 said the fence had been replaced after a similar incident at @entity75 in which a car hit the fence and seven fans were injured
a video posted on @entity80 shows a cloud of debris flying into stands and one man gasping , " oh , my @entity85
" a tire rests on one seat , as a man frantically waves and yells to get the attention of paramedics
afterward , several spectators could be seen lying down after apparently suffering injuries
about 10 ambulances lined up on the track , with some first responders carrying stretchers
fourteen fans were treated at an on - site medical facility , and 14 others were transported to area hospitals , @entity20 told reporters
" i 'm just hoping everyone is ok , " @entity42 said
" as drivers , we assume the risk
" @entity23 president @entity107 earlier told @entity108 , which was broadcasting the race , that some people were taken to @entity111
he said the protective fence did its job in preventing potentially more injuries and possibly deaths
@entity116 , a spokesman for the hospital , told @entity0 that his facility had treated 12 patients
by early sunday evening , seven patients -- each of whom is considered stable -- were still being treated at @entity111 , the hospital said in a statement
staff at @entity127 treated four people , spokeswoman @entity125 said saturday evening
the injured include @entity130 , a 53 - year - old @entity131 , @entity132 , resident who suffered a leg gash when a large piece of metal hit him as he was watching the race , his brother @entity129 told @entity0 affiliate @entity137
he described part of the motor landing in the stands , as well as a wheel , " and everything flying over your head and debris everywhere
" " he 's doing fine , " @entity129 said of his brother , who had surgery at @entity111
" the first thing he said , ' i do n't want to miss that ( @entity1 ) race , but i have to watch on tv
' " accidents are nothing new to @entity23 , where cars often cruise at speeds near 200 mph , nor are they new to the @entity1 track
one of the sport 's most horrific , and well - known , wrecks happened in the 2001 @entity1 , when seven - time @entity23 champion @entity160 was killed -- also on that race 's final lap. still , injuries and fatalities to spectators are much rarer
