-- @entity3 rep. @entity2 failed to report more than $ 1 million in sales and wages at a @entity7 restaurant he once ran , using unreported cash to pay workers " off the books " to " evade taxes and keep more money for himself , " a federal prosecutor said
@entity2 , r - @entity14 , pleaded not guilty on monday in federal court in @entity16 to 20 counts , including mail fraud , wire fraud , filing false tax returns , hiring unauthorized aliens and perjury
a former @entity24 agent who used to investigate fraud , @entity2 wore a dark suit and was not handcuffed during the hearing
he was released on $ 400,000 bond , secured by his home in @entity30
as conditions for his release , @entity2 , 44 , must surrender his guns and passport
he told reporters that he would remain in office while fighting the charges
he 's up for re-election in november
" i 'm going to fight tooth and nail ... until i am fully exonerated , " @entity2 said
one of his lawyers said previously that @entity2 would be vindicated
@entity2 stepped down from his position on the @entity42
in a letter to house speaker @entity44 , @entity2 asked to be removed from the committee until resolution of the unfolding legal matters
@entity44 " believes rep. @entity2 's decision is appropriate under the circumstances , " the speaker 's spokesman , @entity48 , said
indictment unsealed an indictment unsealed on monday after a probe of more than two years alleges @entity2 lied to investigators about his taxes after leaving the @entity59 restaurant to run for @entity60
he " never met a tax he did n't lie to evade , " @entity3 attorney @entity61 said
the charges relate to @entity2 's operation of @entity59 from 2007 to 2010 , following his @entity24 tenure
he was elected to the @entity67 in 2010 , representing @entity30 and parts of @entity16
he was re-elected two years later
@entity2 , as an accountant , attorney , @entity74 and @entity76 agent , " was poised for success as a small business owner , " but " made the choice to go from upholding the law to breaking it , " @entity61 said in a written statement
much of the alleged scheme involved cash customers paid at the register , as opposed to credit or debit payments that created a paper record , @entity61 said
the restaurant , in which @entity2 had a 45 % partnership interest , did n't report some of the cash as income , @entity61 's office said
the restaurant also used cash to pay some workers -- some of whom did n't have legal status -- and then did n't report the payments to tax authorities , @entity61 's office said
" many employees received approximately half of their weekly pay in cash and the other half by check or through direct deposit into a bank account , while others received their entire weekly pay in cash , " the statement said
by under - reporting the restaurant 's earnings and workers ' wages , the business was able to dramatically underpay its sales , income and payroll taxes , @entity61 's office said
@entity2 calls case ' political witch hunt ' @entity2 also is charged with conspiring to commit health care fraud and obstructing an official proceeding
@entity2 said the investigation was " a political witch hunt ... to assassinate my character and remove me from office
" he told reporters that he felt " somewhat relieved " after the investigation because " today at least i get to face my accusers
" the indictment comes months after @entity2 made headlines when he was shown on camera threatening to throw a reporter over a @entity132 balcony after an interview following the @entity135 address
in recent months , public attention also has focused on @entity2 's campaign donations after a friend and donor was charged with funneling illegal contributions to his campaign four years ago
the investigation into campaign finance is still ongoing , @entity3 officials briefed on the matter have said
@entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report
