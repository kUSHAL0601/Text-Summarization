@entity0 -- @entity4 , brother of @entity6 leader @entity5 , will be freed from prison in @entity8 after 13 years , his attorney said monday
he was acquitted by an @entity8 military court and will be released tuesday , said attorney @entity10
@entity4 was imprisoned in 1999 after being detained and extradited from the @entity11 on allegations that he was linked to the 1981 assassination of @entity8 president @entity14
@entity5 was acquitted on the assassination charges but later was accused of conspiring against the @entity8 government
he was sentenced to death , but then appealed the ruling
last year , @entity8 's interim government released him along with scores of other political prisoners after a general pardon was issued by the @entity23 , which ruled the country after the ouster of president @entity26
but @entity5 was arrested again shortly after
@entity27 , nephew of @entity4 , told @entity1 that after the release last year , security forces stormed his uncle 's home , beat him up and rearrested him for no apparent reason
" it was a day after my uncle spoke to a local paper and spoke of the torture he endured inside prison for years , " @entity27 told @entity1
" he paid a high price for being @entity5 's brother and he has denounced any sort of violent ideologies now that his main enemy , the @entity26 regime , has been removed , " the nephew added
" @entity44 has been tortured for years by @entity26 's state security officers because he is the brother of @entity5 , " @entity10 said
@entity4 is a member of the @entity46 , of which his brother was once a leader
the @entity48 describes the group as a terrorist organization that merged with @entity6 in 2001
its " primary goals are to overthrow the @entity8 government and replace it with an @entity55 state and attack @entity48 and @entity57 interest in @entity8 and abroad , " the @entity51 once said
five other @entity55 charged with similar crimes were acquitted along with @entity5 , said @entity10
they are @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , the brother of the executed islamist who killed @entity14 , the attorney said .
