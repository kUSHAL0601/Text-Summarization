-- @entity1 , whose charming grin and @entity4 accent won the hearts of millions of fans on the 1960s television series " @entity8 , " died wednesday , according to the @entity9 , @entity10 , sheriff 's office
a witness told authorities he was with @entity1 in @entity16 , @entity10 , when @entity1 " began to complain of not feeling well and having trouble breathing , " the sheriff 's office said in a statement
@entity1 was transported to a hospital , where he was pronounced dead , authorities said
a @entity9 law enforcement source with knowledge of the case said @entity1 apparently suffered a heart attack
@entity25 , whose company @entity26 ltd often booked @entity1 for @entity28 nostalgia shows , spoke with him two days ago about several new bookings
" he was a vegetarian , and there was not an ounce of fat on the guy , " @entity25 said
" he lived on the beach in @entity10 and ran miles every morning
this is the last person i expected this to happen to
he could n't have been in better shape
" the diminutive vocalist and actor sang lead on the musical group 's hits such as " @entity44 " and " a @entity45
" besides @entity1 , @entity8 included band members @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49
the pop group was created to star in an @entity52 sitcom and capitalize on the @entity54 ' teenybopper popularity
" @entity8 " tv series premiered in the fall of 1966
share your memories of @entity1 on @entity59 in terms of musical popularity , the project succeeded beyond anyone 's expectations , with the group notching a handful of no. 1 songs ( including " i 'm a believer , " @entity70 's top song of 1967 ) and four no. 1 albums
the group , which was dubbed the " prefab four " by critics , rebelled against its management in an effort to take control of its musical career
the move worked to an extent -- band members , who had generally been replaced by session men on @entity8 recordings , were allowed to play their own instruments and contribute songs -- but coincided with a decline in the @entity8 ' popularity
@entity52 canceled the tv series " @entity8 " after just two seasons , and the band lasted for only one more year after that
though the tv show was never a huge ratings hit , its knockabout , @entity92 - style comedy -- inspired , to an extent , by the loopier sequences in the @entity54 ' " @entity95 " -- gained fans and followers , reigniting the band 's popularity when @entity103 reran the show in the mid- ' 80s
demand for @entity1 at nostalgia shows was brisk , @entity25 said
" he 's been really busy , " she said
" he 's toured with his band , singing as well
he loved to pick up these little autograph shows
he loved the fans , he loved spending time with his fans
he often got on stage and performed at these shows
the lines for him were always out the door
" the @entity28 @entity116 said flowers in honor of @entity1 would be placed on @entity8 ' star on the @entity120 on wednesday afternoon
" that @entity123 has stepped beyond my view causes me the sadness that it does many of you , " @entity49 posted on his @entity122 page wednesday
" i will miss him , but i wo n't abandon him to mortality ... @entity123 's spirit and soul live well in my heart , among all the lovely people , who remember with me the good times , and the healing times , that were created for so many , including us
" " his talent will be much missed ; his gifts will be with us always , " said fellow @entity135
" my deepest sympathy to @entity139 and the rest of his family
" beatle @entity143 issued a short statement : " @entity145 bless @entity1
