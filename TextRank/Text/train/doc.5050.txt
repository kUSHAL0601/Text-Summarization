-- after @entity3 's august 9 shooting death , @entity1 could not believe what he was seeing on social media as he scrolled through posts tagged # @entity7 and # @entity8 the hashtags accompanied scenes of the dead teen lying in the street and videos of distressed community members up against police in riot gear
@entity1 was compelled to make the nine - hour drive from @entity18 to @entity19 on august 16
the next evening he was chased and tear gassed by police on @entity21 along with other activists , protesters and concerned citizens , he said
" i thought , ' this is not an @entity28 i know , ' " the 29 - year - old school administrator said in a phone interview
" this is not what @entity28 should be
" since august 9 , @entity7 the place has come to represent what many see as the ugly side of @entity28 racial politics , making @entity7 the hashtag a social media shorthand for racial inequality , police misconduct and " the value of black life , " @entity1 said
people have used the hashtag to call out what they see as instances of police misconduct and racist double standards beyond the context of the day officer @entity47 shot the 18 - year - old to death
these conversations happen every day across @entity28 amid tension between law enforcement and black communities , said @entity54 , executive director of civil rights group @entity55
@entity7 became a national conversation thanks to social media , creating an opening for broader discussions about " inequality in the criminal justice system , " he said
@entity7 has always been about justice for @entity3 first and foremost , @entity54 said
it has also become a signifier of " a bigger problem in our country where for some of us justice does n't seem like it will ever be delivered , " he said
" we 're talking about the larger issue of police misconduct in @entity7 and around the country that happens everyday , " he said
" @entity7 is the flashpoint that amplified the need for greater accountability
" ' righteous rage ' and hope the hashtag also has become a rallying cry for the social justice movement that has grown out of @entity3 's death
between august 9 and august 25 , the hashtag # @entity7 was used on @entity83 11.6 million with retweets and 1.9 million without retweets , according to @entity86
@entity1 was among those boosting the hashtag as he pounded the pavement in @entity7
he tweeted images of protests , news about rallies and demonstrations and tips for out - of - towners looking for food and places to stay
" there was a lot of righteous rage , but also a deep sense of community and joy that outlined that anger , " he said
" it turned me into being a committed protester
" he also began building relationships to form the infrastructure of an organized , peaceful movement
through a newsletter and frequent social media updates , he shares news about campaigns , demonstrations , petitions and updates on @entity47 's court proceedings
he also shares passionate affirmations of the movement 's mission and biting digs toward detractors and @entity47 supporters
but , he is quick to add that he is " just one voice " in a leaderless movement
" on social media we have all been exposed to voices we might not have heard otherwise , " he said
" there are many of us who are voices in this and that is our power
" turning a moment into a movement hashtags like # @entity7 are a means to an end for advocacy groups trying to create movements out of moments like @entity3 's shooting , said @entity54 with @entity55
" our role is to translate what 's happening in @entity7 to everyday people who want to do something on a systemic level that will lead to lasting change , " he said
" what we 're doing is trying to capture that energy and push for national change in terms of policies that incentivize better policing and hold media and @entity157 accountable in terms of the images and implicit biases they put out in the world
" the hashtag creates a space for people to see what 's happening on the ground not only in @entity7 but in places around country , he said
hopefully , what they see engages and catalyzes them into activism in real life
" a hashtag provides a meeting space , a virtual meeting space where you can be virtually tapped into one strand of what 's happening , " he said
" but it 's a mistake to believe you 're fully educated
