-- @entity2 's father , @entity1 , said thursday it was difficult to listen to testimony about his son , particularly the negative comments , during @entity8 's trial
" that was n't the @entity2 that we raised
that was n't the @entity2 that we knew , and that we love , " he said during a thursday night interview on @entity0 's " @entity13 360
" still , @entity2 's mother , @entity15 , said that she felt the need to sit through every day of @entity8 's trial because her son was " not here to say anything for himself
" she said that she wanted to " show a face " for her son
@entity2 's parents spoke out thursday for the first time since @entity8 was acquitted in the death of 17 - year - old @entity2
@entity8 could still be held responsible " it came as a complete shock for me , " @entity26 said about the verdict
" and the reason i say that is because i just look at people as people , and i thought for sure that the jury looked at @entity2 as an average teenager that was minding his own business , that was n't committing any crime
" @entity2 's parents opted not to be in the courtroom when the verdict was read
they thought they would not be able to control their emotions -- whichever way the jury decided
when they heard , they broke down
" when i heard the verdict , i kind of understand the disconnect , " @entity26 said
" maybe they ( jurors ) did n't see @entity2 as their son
they did n't see @entity2 as a teenager
they did n't see @entity2 as just a human being that was minding his own business
" ' does the system work ? it did n't work for us ' @entity57 said he was n't concerned about the racial makeup of the jury before the start of the trial , which has become a forum for debate about gun laws and race in @entity66
but , like @entity26 , he believes jurors never saw the event from the perspective of his son
the jury had six women -- five white and one an unspecified minority
@entity57 said he believes juror @entity75 had her mind made up before the trial began
the juror gave an exclusive interview to @entity0 's @entity13 this week and said the jury felt like it knew @entity8 but did n't know enough about @entity2
@entity2 's dad : my heart is broken , my faith is not @entity2 's mother said that despite that comment , jurors had sufficient information
" they knew he was a teenager
they knew he was on his way home
they knew he ran , " she said
" ... how much do you need to know ? " referring to juror @entity75 's statement that she did not believe race was a factor in the shooting , @entity26 said , " i think that 's a joke
" @entity57 said that his children had grown up in a diverse community , so he had never felt feel a need to have a conversation about how his sons should deal with race
rather , he said he talked with his children about " how we prepare them to become teenagers , to become upstanding citizens , to conduct themselves in public
" but once his unarmed son was shot , he said that changed
" what is it i can tell my child now ? " he asked
in spite of his son 's death , @entity57 said he has faith in the legal system
" the state did all they could with what they had " given the poor quality of the investigation , he said
" does the system work ? it did n't work for us
we remain prayerful that through this injustice , we can close that gap and hopefully the system can start working for everyone equally
" ' hopefully , we can find some positive ' @entity2 's mother said that she hoped that a foundation started in her son 's name would allow for something good to come out of his death
" the change that we hope to affect is with the law , " @entity26 said
" we want to make sure any teenager who is walking down the street wont ' be killed , that they will make it home safe
" " hopefully , we can find some positive , some bright side out of all of this , " she said
the parents did not say whether they may file a civil lawsuit
@entity150 , an attorney for @entity2 's family who also appeared on " @entity13 360 , " said they are hoping for a federal civil rights investigation into the teenager 's death
he said they were pleased by the charges brought against @entity8 because they felt it got to the heart of the allegations
but he said he did not believe the police were aggressive with the shooting investigation , appearing to take @entity8 's word for it
" not only did ( @entity8 ) profile @entity2 , the police profiled @entity2 , " @entity150 said
' @entity167 takes time ' earlier thursday , in interviews on the three network tv morning news programs , @entity2 's parents assailed the verdict and the @entity8 defense team 's argument that the killing was in self - defense during an attack by the unarmed teenager
@entity26 told " @entity179 " she was " in a bit of shock " after the verdict
" i thought surely that he would be found guilty of second - degree murder , " she said
on @entity185 's " today , " @entity26 said the case is " sending a terrible message to other little black and brown boys -- that you ca n't walk fast , you ca n't walk slow
so what do they do ? i mean , how do you get home without people knowing or either assuming that you 're doing something wrong ? @entity2 was n't doing anything wrong
" speaking to @entity197 's " @entity196 , " @entity2 added that he and @entity26 did not find the verdict fair , " and of course it 's devastating
" " today " asked them whether they may forgive @entity8 , the 29 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer
" @entity167 is like a healing process
forgiveness takes time , " @entity2 responded
" the @entity205 says that you have to forgive and forget , but also the healing process is a long process and the forgiving process is a long process
" @entity2 's friend ' upset , angry ' by verdict opinion : voices on the lessons of @entity8 trial juror pushes for new laws following @entity8 trial @entity0 's @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report
