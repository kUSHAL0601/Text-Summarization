-- from the realms of science fiction to science fact , the @entity2 mission reached its climax this week when when the mission 's scientists succeeded in landing a washing machine - sized probe named @entity11 on a moving comet after a 6.4 billion mile journey
it has been a decade - long chase around the solar system for the spacecraft to catch up with its constantly moving target , @entity18 -- better known as @entity19
for many who gaze dreamily at the stars above , this is one of the most exciting thing to happen in recent memory
but why should everyone else care ? to answer this question , @entity0 has brought together five experts in space science to explain why the @entity2 mission is a monumental achievement
@entity29 , @entity30 project scientist : @entity2 is a big deal , enough to be the sexiest mission ever
@entity2 has rendezvoused , orbited and will soon deploy a lander to the comet surface
if that is n't enough firsts , the orbiter will remain alongside the comet for over a year , watching it grow in activity as it approaches the @entity40 , getting to within 180 million km in summer next year , when the comet will be expelling hundreds of kilograms of material every second
it 's got an awesome profile : the adventure of the decade - long journey necessary to capture its prey , flying past the @entity49 , @entity50 and two asteroids on the way
the years of preparation dating back to the days of the @entity55 mission
the challenges of flying over 6 billion km to reach the comet , to bulls eye getting into orbit , even after a 31 - month nap , around a body we knew next to nothing about at launch , other than it was going to constantly push us away more , the closer we got
the passion and dedication of the teams working for so long on @entity2 to make it work , to do what it was designed for -- science
explore : @entity2 interactive @entity2 will show us how a comet works
we have been to comets before with spacecraft , observed them for centuries from the ground , but for the first time with @entity2 , we will " live " alongside a comet for over a year , sniffing and tasting it , scratching it with the lander , seeing how it is made up and how it evolves in time with its interaction with energy of the @entity40 thought to be predominantly made of ice , comets are also considered to have been a possible delivery mechanism for water to the @entity49 , along with organic material that could have provided the building blocks for proteins and possibly life
comets are considered frozen relics of the formation of the solar system and examining comets provides us with an insight into the conditions and composition of that time
we are doing archeology into how our planet was formed and evolved to what we live on today
it 's important to understand where we came from , to get an idea of where we should be going
@entity110 , principal investigator of @entity111 ( @entity112 ) : after a long and tedious voyage , @entity113 must have experienced similar emotions a few hundred years ago when he finally saw land as we did when , after 10 years , the @entity119 cometary mission @entity2 finally got a glimpse of its target -- comet @entity18
although we already had pictures of a few comets , we were very much surprised by its irregular shape and its rich chemical composition
and analysis of the cometary coma by our mass spectrometers @entity111 continues to give almost daily new , amazing insights into the ancient history of the formation of our @entity40 , the planets and the origin of life
to be part of this mission and to see a dream come true is a fantastic experience which makes all the years of hard work well worthwhile
where do we come from and where do we go to ? are we alone in the universe ? these are the questions which are an important part of humanity , the center of most religions , themes for all big philosophers
to be able to answer some aspects of these questions by science is the main driver for cometary missions
@entity2 is the first mission following a comet over a long period ; it 's the first mission close to a comet ( less than 10 km ) and it will be the first mission with a cometary lander
it 's a mission full of discoveries in line with great missions like @entity167 or @entity168
@entity169 , project scientist , @entity172 @entity171 , @entity173 , @entity174 : @entity2 is an attempt to explore not only an object ( comets ) that we do n't yet fully understand , but also reach backwards in time , like a detective , to piece together more about our origins
the mission calls on us to be bold , to take on risk
for an engineer , the challenge is like winning the @entity185 with a home run in the bottom of the ninth in game seven -- something that will call upon all her skill to pull off
i know plenty of people who love a challenge like that
i 've waited 10 years to finally be " here , " waiting for the landing to take place , and for the comet to start revealing its mysteries
it 's a dream come true to get our hands on this substance , metaphorically , and get the physics right , by bringing a laboratory to a comet
exploration of the planets , of our solar system , extends our " vision " as a human race
we need to have such vision to appreciate / nurture @entity49 , and our place in the universe
the rewards are to add to our collective knowledge , improve our understanding of forming solar system ( s ) , and understanding more about how materials come together to create environment ( s ) where life might thrive
@entity224 , science fiction writer , former astrophysicist for the @entity30 : after a 10 - year mission to hook itself into orbit around @entity19 , the flow of science from @entity2 has already commenced
@entity19 is providing surprises , from its double - lobed shape to its varied surface texturing
not content with looking , though , @entity2 will shortly deploy an even smaller spacecraft to land , anchor itself , and perform physical examination of the surface
images from @entity2 , backdropped by the comet , already resemble stills from a science fiction film
it 's a reminder that we can do amazing things , if we dream big
why should we care about a mountain - sized ball of dark , dirty ice , when there are so many other places out there ? comets are windows into the dawn of our solar system , telling us about the chemical ingredients that most likely formed the infant seas of our own @entity49
understand comets , and we have a shot at understanding the genesis of life itself -- and for me there is no bigger or more exciting theme than that
this is science fiction made real in terms of the achievement of the mission itself , but @entity2 is also taking us a step closer to answering science fiction 's grandest question of all : are we alone ? @entity271 , cosmochemist from the @entity273 : there are so many " firsts " with @entity2 that make it an amazing , ambitious , and potentially rewarding mission
as a cosmochemist , i 'm eager for the chemical and isotopic measurements
comets preserve the first solids , including ices , formed in the solar system , so the @entity2 measurements will tell us a whole lot about how the solar system formed
our comet samples from the stardust mission contained abundant high - temperature minerals
how these rocks formed so far from the young @entity40 is a major cosmochemical puzzle
as a human , i want to know the internal structure of comets
the @entity2 radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together
we need to know these things so that we can protect the @entity49 and humanity from comets , which have hit the @entity49 many times in the past
@entity2 is an engineering marvel , as are the @entity306 and @entity307 spacecraft returning important information from @entity309 and the asteroid belt
all these missions enlighten humanity about our cosmic neighborhood
we take ownership , and by making it " our " solar system , we set the stage for humans to venture beyond the @entity319
that is the path to a positive future for our species
