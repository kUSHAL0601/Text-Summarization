@entity0 -- the former @entity3 soldier who posted photos of herself on @entity5 posing in front of blindfolded @entity7 waved off criticism of her actions , arguing that her behavior was no different than that of news outlets
" this was just a military ( service ) experience , " @entity13 said in an interview on tuesday with @entity15
" the media does the same thing
" @entity13 , the former soldier identified online as " @entity22 from @entity23 , " is seen smiling sitting on a blast barrier next to a blindfolded man
in another picture she is sitting in front of three blindfolded @entity7 , one with his hands tied in front of him
" i ask the media -- when you take pictures of handcuffed prisoners for tv , do you ask for their permission ? do these @entity38 men agree to it ? i really do not understand what is wrong
" i have already apologized to the people who were actually hurt by me
this picture was without any political saying , just a thing of military ( service ) experience and no more
" @entity13 was interviewed on @entity50 's @entity49 show
the photos have since been taken down from her @entity5 site , but @entity3 media reports the photos were labeled " @entity55 -- best time of my life
" the photos have been slammed by @entity3 and @entity7
in another interview on @entity59 's show , a @entity61 commentator , @entity62 , expressed anger over @entity13 's attitude
" i deeply regret that she does n't even understand what is wrong with this
i regret that the commanders did not see this ( when it happened )
it is unfitting , wrong and unethical , " @entity62 said
" these photos are disgraceful ; in no way does the @entity55 condone this behavior , " said @entity55 spokesman capt. @entity72 in a written statement
" in matters of information security aside , we are talking about a serious violation of the @entity55 ethical code , and i imagine that if she was on active duty today she would no doubt be court martialed
" @entity72 said @entity13 left the military a year ago , but , " nevertheless her commanders have been informed
" however , because @entity13 has left the @entity55 it is not clear if the military will be able to take any action against her
@entity90 , director of legal affairs for the @entity7 government 's prisoners ministry , told @entity1 , " she did this act while she was in military service , so in retrospect the @entity3 occupation is responsible for her acts
this is a breach of international law , clearly a breach of human rights
" @entity90 said his department will try to take legal action against the former soldier
@entity3 media reported one of the comments posted by a friend of @entity13 said , " that looks really sexy for you
" the photo shows @entity13 smiling in front of blindfolded prisoners
she posted this response : " i wonder if he is on @entity5 too -- i 'll have to tag him in the photo , " an apparent reference to one of the prisoners in the photo .
