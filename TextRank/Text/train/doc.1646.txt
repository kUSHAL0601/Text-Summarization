two @entity1 employees have been fired after getting fresh -- not in the way the restaurant chain intended -- including one who put his genitals on a loaf of bread , took a picture , then shared the image online
the incident came to light over the past few days at a @entity1 franchise abutting a gas station in @entity14 , @entity15
specifically , the uproar centers around two images that were posted to a social networking site and eventually picked up by other sites , including @entity20
one shows a male putting his genitals on what appears to be a loaf of @entity1 bread
in the other , a hand is shown holding what used to be a water bottle that 's half - filled with a cream - colored substance
under it is the caption : " today at work i froze my pee
" using the slogan " @entity38 , " @entity1 boasts being the world 's largest restaurant chain , with about 38,000 locations in 100 countries
the company released a statement tuesday about what it called an " isolated incident ( that ) is not representative of @entity1 sandwich artists , " the latter term being what @entity1 calls those who make sandwiches at its restaurants
" these actions are not tolerated and the franchisee took immediate action to terminate the two employees involved , " @entity1 said
@entity55 , the company that owns and operates the @entity1 franchise in question , did not respond immediately tuesday to @entity59 's request for comment
but its director of operations , @entity61 , did tell @entity59 affiliate @entity62 that the restaurant was closed monday so all its bread could be thrown out and all its surfaces could be sanitized
" we do our best to hire properly , " @entity61 said
" we had a couple of kids who do n't understand the ramifications of what they do and what they post
" according to @entity73 , whose inspectors routinely check on restaurants in the area , the @entity1 franchise did not have any critical violations in its last two inspections that took place this past march and in october 2012
the restaurant did have violations before then , according to information posted online , though all of these were corrected at the time of the inspections
the violations included things like problems with temperatures at which foods were being held , unsafe food not being properly discarded and employees failing to properly wash their hands
prospective customers , meanwhile , expressed disgust after hearing of the employees ' behavior
" i think i want to go home and consider puking , " @entity99 told @entity62
" ... sometimes these things kind of go on in fast - food restaurants , and most of us just really do n't want to know about it
" @entity107 told the same station that he used to go to that @entity1 franchise because his co-workers told him it was " the cleanest one around
" but that 's hard for him to swallow now , nor does he understand why the offending employees did what they did
" i do n't get what the joke is , " @entity107 said
" i do n't get that it 's funny
