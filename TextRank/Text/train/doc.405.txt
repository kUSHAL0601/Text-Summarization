-- across @entity2 , middle - class families are wondering how they 'll send their kids to college , pay their mortgages and still manage to save enough for retirement
women across @entity2 face an uphill climb in the workplace , as they continue to earn less than men
we still sit in traffic on congested roads built decades ago , and then drive on run - down roads and crumbling bridges
these are among the problems our elected leaders are expected to address
these are the issues voters want us to focus on
but those are not the issues that the @entity2 people will remember as the priorities of @entity25 and the 113th @entity26
instead , @entity28 @entity27 have been focused on anything but strengthening the middle class
under @entity25 as speaker , they have hopscotched from issue to issue , not to govern , but in the hopes of finding the silver bullet to motivate their base to elect them -- because they know that they will lose on one crucial issue : the economy
@entity25 and leading @entity27 have said over and over that this election is about : the @entity41 , the @entity42 , @entity43 , immigration -- and the list goes on
the headlines alone tell the story : 11/18/13 : @entity48 ( @entity49 ) 1/31/14 : @entity27 turn up @entity41 rhetoric as elections loom ( @entity52 ) 3/21/14 : republicans @entity53 on @entity48 for 2014 ( @entity55 ) 5/08/14 : @entity28 @entity27 pursue @entity43 inquiry going into midterm campaigns ( @entity58 ) 5/27/14 : @entity59 on @entity60 ( @entity61 ) 8/24/14 : republicans @entity63 ( @entity64 ) 9/23/14 : @entity27 think the @entity65 is their winning issue ( @entity66 ) but there is one constant that the @entity2 will remember about the 113th @entity26 : @entity25 and the tea party shut down our government
that shutdown , a year ago this week , eventually cost our economy $ 24 billion and hurt millions of people across the country
and while @entity2 were sent home from work , were denied health care treatment , and , in the case of veterans , had their benefits delayed , @entity27 members of @entity26 kept getting paid on time and did n't even need to take a break from going to the taxpayer - funded congressional gym
across the country , @entity2 have already started casting votes for the 114th @entity26
those voters now have the chance to decide whether they support candidates who put special interests ahead of working moms
they can decide whether they want leaders who think women should be able to make their own choices about their health care
voters will be casting their ballots knowing which candidate will have their back and which one will have the back of special interests
and they will remember the standout moment from this @entity26 : that @entity104 , who could not work together with other lawmakers on solutions , went for a shutdown instead
in the 114th @entity26 , @entity28 @entity109 will continue our focus on the @entity113 agenda , a plan built on the pillars of investing in infrastructure , making college more affordable and ensuring equal pay for equal work
ask a @entity120 what this election is about
he or she will tell you it 's about strengthening the economy for @entity2 's middle class -- exactly what voters want .
