-- medals and reputations will be won and lost at the @entity3 -- but forget the events , just who will triumph in the fashion stakes at the @entity7 ? it is not just the kit athletes will wear on the track or in the pool which will make a splash , it is also the official uniforms which will be worn for friday 's opening ceremony
as a designer , striking the right style chord can ensure your kit will be immortalized and cherished in the memories of a nation
get it wrong , and the fashionista police will never let you forget it
and with styles under forensic examination -- from journalists and paparazzi alike -- @entity28 associations have left no seam unturned to ensure their athletes scrub up well
it is not surprising given the convergence between sport and fashion
the global sportswear market is estimated to be worth $ 120 billion , which illustrates just how much is at stake for manufacturers to create the perfect impression
@entity40 , who generated sales of $ 16.3 million in 2011 and supply @entity44 's apparel , have their eyes on upping their share of a @entity48 sportswear market worth $ 5.5 billion
the @entity50 company has a long - standing relationship with @entity52 , the daughter of music legend and former @entity55 @entity54 , and she has designed the uniforms for the host @entity44 squad
" this project has really means a lot to me being a @entity48 designer and working with @entity44 at a time like this , when we are hosting the @entity7 in @entity64 for 2012 , " @entity54 told @entity0
" it really goes beyond anything i 've ever done before and it 's just such an incredible honor
" being a designer , a fashion designer this is not the type of opportunity that normally comes your way and i feel really very lucky and privileged
it 's been a really exciting challenge
" @entity54 is facing some top - level competition from the likes of @entity79 fashion house @entity77 as well as @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , who have been brought in by other @entity28 associations to work on their kits and uniforms
" there were a million different things to consider with this role , " explained @entity54
" number one was trying to identify what makes a country , to show the pride of the nation and translate that into clothing , while taking into account the necessary technical achievement
" it also involves looking at the best athletes in the world and how to do them proud and to help enhance and support their performance
" while making sure the kit is fit for purpose , @entity54 was also keen for each kit to safeguard the masculinity and femininity of competitors
" every athlete i talked to have said they perform better when they feel confident about how they look , so i really tried to do that , " said @entity54
" another thing is how to look masculine and feminine with that and still keep the dignity of the athlete
" also , how everything will come across visually on television , when billions of people are watching it , to try and make it different
there are a million things to think of , working with a lot of guidelines
" @entity54 's efforts have received the backing of one of @entity44 's leading lights , the nation 's first @entity132 winner @entity130 -- sort of
@entity134 , who will make his @entity3 bow in the cycling road race on saturday , said on @entity137 : " just arrived at the @entity3 , got all me kit , still think @entity52 was a bit @entity139 in the @entity141 when she knocked this one up , " a reference to one of @entity54 's @entity145 's classic records
" in a good way , certainly gon na ( sic ) stand out , " added @entity134 in a subsequent tweet
the confidence gained from looking slick is something @entity150 , fashion course director at @entity64 's @entity152 , believes could give athletes the edge when it comes to winning medals
" it is important that leading athletes are given the confidence of looking their best at such an important occasion when all the world is observing them , " said @entity150
" this should be provided by the best designers available
a versatile designer can turn their talents to a range of aesthetics within the parameters of sporting attire
" @entity150 also detailed the possible benefits for designers able to attach their name to a successful @entity28 squad , both in terms of reputation and financially
" the coverage of the @entity3 brings the attention of a much wider audience to these designers work
" ( designing sportswear ) can not be easy and would require a lot of research on the part of the designer and their team ; i would think it should be well remunerated
