-- for centuries , @entity1 was a strategic outpost along the ancient silk road trading route
today , the northernmost of the seven emirates that make up the @entity7 is often overlooked alongside its extravagant neighbors of @entity9 and @entity10
all that could be set to change , however , with the ruling @entity13 family set to make a big push in the region 's burgeoning residential and tourism sectors

by the end of 2014 , @entity1 ( or @entity25 as it is often known ) will have some 4,800 hotel rooms , a 60 % expansion from the start of last year
the government says occupancy is currently running at 73 % for beachfront resorts and revenue per room rose a solid 39 % in three years
vice president of operations at @entity19 , @entity37 , believes these rising numbers are only the beginning of what 's possible in @entity25
the hotel giant has been in the emirate for more than a dozen years and opened a branch of the @entity44 there last august

the first results of this strategy can be seen at the @entity78 village where more than 1,000 luxury villas have been already sold to property investors from around the world

these prices equate to a maximum price of $ 3,800 per square meter ( $ 353 per sq ft ) , but general manager of the development , @entity91 , said he is maintaining a sizable discount compared to prices in @entity9
" ( this represents ) 20 - 30 % cheaper rates per square meter for any property you buy whether it 's an apartment or a villa and that is significant value without compromising , " @entity91 said
the early signs are promising , but whether this rising emirate succeeds in its plans will depend on continued growth as new properties and facilities are completed .
