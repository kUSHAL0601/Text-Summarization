-- the @entity1 expects to bring fraud charges next week against a major construction firm -- @entity6 , @entity5 - based @entity4 -- for its work on two of the biggest government construction projects in the @entity11 region , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation
the case involves work on upgrades of @entity11 's subway system and the @entity19
@entity21 is likely to be charged with violations of rules designed to assure minority - and female - owned contractors receive portions of federal contracts , the source said
@entity21 , according to the source , actually received the bulk of such subcontracts for major projects in the @entity11 region and farmed out work to a trucking firm with ties to organized crime
the @entity34 reported that @entity21 is in negotiations to settle the charges by paying more than $ 20 million
the source confirmed the accuracy of that report
