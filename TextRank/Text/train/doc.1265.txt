@entity0 , @entity1 -- some of @entity1 's children are " wasting away " as political turmoil and economic crisis have caused a severe food shortage , according to a report from @entity5
children sleep in rough conditions on the border between @entity1 and @entity12
the number of acute child malnutrition cases has risen by almost two - thirds in the past year , the report from the @entity15 - based agency said in its appeal to world donors for help
" there is no excuse for failing to provide this food , " program director @entity22 said
" the innocent people of @entity1 should not be made to suffer for a political situation that is out of their control
" five million @entity1 -- out of a population of about 12 million -- are in need of food aid now , the report said
the group is appealing for 18,000 tons of food for next month
" we have already been forced to reduce the rations of emergency food we are delivering because there is n't enough to go around , " the report said
" if , as we fear , the food aid pipeline into @entity1 begins to fail in the new year the millions of people who rely on emergency food aid will suffer
" @entity1 is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since its independence from @entity46 28 years ago
there is an acute shortage of all essentials such as cash , fuel , medical drugs , electricity and food
president @entity55 blames the crisis on the sanctions imposed on him and his cronies by the @entity59 for allegedly disregarding human rights
but @entity55 's critics attribute the crisis to his economic policies
as the economy has faltered for almost a decade now , a cholera epidemic is raging , fueled by the collapse of health , sanitation and water services in @entity1
the epidemic has claimed more than 1,100 lives and infected more than 20,000 people since its outbreak in august
health experts have warned that the water - borne disease could infect more than 60,000 unless its spread is halted
the political crisis rose to a boil in this year when the opposition party claimed that it won the presidential election , but @entity55 's government refused to recognize the result
instead , the race was thrown to a runoff , which was boycotted by the opposition
@entity55 signed an agreement with the opposition in september to form a unity government , but a bitter dispute over the division of cabinet seats has prevented its formation
inflation is so severe that the government was forced to print $ 10 billion currency notes last week , with each expected to buy just 20 loaves of bread .
