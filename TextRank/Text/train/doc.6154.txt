@entity0 , @entity1 -- nine years after an @entity5 activist was crushed by an @entity1 army bulldozer , an @entity1 civil court ruled tuesday that @entity8 's death was an accident
@entity8 , 23 , was killed in 2003 while trying to block the bulldozer from razing @entity12 homes
her parents filed suit against @entity1 's @entity15 in a quest for accountability and sought just $ 1 in damages
but judge @entity19 ruled tuesday that the family has no right to damages , backing an earlier @entity1 investigation that cleared any soldier of wrongdoing
" i believe this was a bad day not only for our family , but a bad day for human rights , for humanity , for the rule of law and also for the country of @entity1 , " her mother , @entity26 , said after the verdict
" @entity8 's right to life and dignity were violated by the @entity1 military , " she said , adding that her daughter and her family deserve " accountability
" @entity42 says he did not see @entity5 activist " a civil lawsuit is not a substitute for a credible investigation , which we never had
this lawsuit was our only recourse as a family , " @entity26 explained
but the state prosecutor 's office said the driver of the bulldozer could n't see @entity8
" the death of @entity8 is without a doubt a tragic accident , " the office said in a statement
" as the verdict states -- the driver of the bulldozer and his commander had a very limited field of vision , such that they had no possibility of seeing ms. @entity8 and thus are exonerated of any blame for negligence
" @entity69 , the @entity8 family attorney , regards the decision as a " bad ruling " for the family and all activists
he said the @entity74 intend to appeal to @entity1 's @entity75
@entity1 government spokesman @entity76 countered criticism of the verdict by saying that " the whole idea that this was not a serious procedure is simply non-factual
" " they ( the @entity74 ) have lost a loved one , and we can all empathize with them , " @entity76 said
" but i thik their criticism of the @entity1 judiciary is unfounded
the @entity1 judiciary is known for its independence , which they fiercely guard
" @entity8 was nonviolently protesting the demolition of @entity12 civilian homes in @entity92 , @entity93 , when she died
she was working with the @entity12 - led @entity94 at the time
@entity8 's parents say they have searched for answers in their daughter 's death for years
" the more we found out , the more likely that the killing was intentional , or at least incredibly reckless , " father @entity99 said in 2010
" as a former soldier , i was even in charge of bulldozers in @entity104
... you 're responsible to know what 's in front of that blade , and i believe that they did
" @entity99 said the soldiers , too , are victims
he does not view them with disdain
" so i 'm not full of hatred for this person , but it was a horrendous act to kill my daughter , and i hope he understands that
" in 2010 , the @entity1 soldier who drove the bulldozer testified publicly for the first time -- from behind a partition
the driver 's identity has never been revealed , and he was not charged after a monthlong @entity1 investigation found that no @entity1 soldier was to blame
@entity8 's parents can not take him to court because the @entity1 @entity75 has upheld a decision to shield him
the driver testified repeatedly that he did not see @entity8 before he struck her , saying there was a pile of rubble impeding his vision
@entity134 , a member of the @entity135 and head of the @entity138 @entity137 , also condemned the ruling
she said that the evidence shows @entity8 was " deliberately murdered " and that the @entity1 court has victimized her again
" we must make sure that @entity8 's death is not a senseless incident , " @entity134 said in a statement
" it must be stressed that @entity1 's habit of blaming the victim and exonerating the criminal is not ( only ) applied to @entity12 victims , but also it has extended its reach to international solidarity activists and victims of @entity1 violence
" @entity155 said that the court upheld a " flawed @entity1 military investigation , completed within one month " of @entity8 's death and that the " verdict seems to have ignored substantial evidence presented to the court , including by eyewitnesses
" " @entity8 was clearly identifiable as a civilian , as she was wearing a fluorescent orange vest when she was killed , " said @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity166 advocacy director for @entity167
@entity171 spokeswoman @entity170 said the @entity5 has worked with the @entity74 " all through this process and we will continue to provide consular support
" " we understand the family 's disappointment with the outcome of the trial
under @entity1 law the family has the right to appeal the verdict and we 've seen reports that they are considering doing that
so we will see how this proceeds going forward
" since @entity8 's death , soccer players in @entity93 have honored the activist with an annual memorial tournament
" @entity8 : the @entity191 , " a wall near the makeshift concrete soccer field reads
" there 's never closure , " @entity26 said , " when you have a family member killed in such a way
