-- according to @entity5 's new @entity4 2.0 report released monday , @entity2 's mobile usage is on the rise
in fact , the report revealed that @entity2 users spent more time accessing the social network on smartphones than on computers in march
@entity2 users spent an average of 441 minutes — or 7 hours , 21 minutes — accessing the social network via smartphones during the month
by comparison , users spent 391 minutes — or 6 hours , 31 minutes — checking out @entity2 on @entity16 the @entity5 report also revealed that smartphone users spent more time on @entity2 than on any other social media network , including @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23
in fact , @entity2 is the second largest mobile property behind @entity26
the social network garners more than 78 million unique monthly smartphone visitors , 81 percent of which access @entity2 through its mobile app. besides showing that people spend a good chunk of time on @entity2 , the data underscores the importance of a mobile strategy for the social network 's business success
@entity2 currently makes little revenue from its mobile app — the app does n't include ads , and only started to include " sponsored posts " in users ' news feeds last march
@entity2 admitted its mobile struggles in its recent ipo documents
" if users increasingly access mobile products as a substitute for access through personal computers , and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users , " the company writes in its filing documents , " our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected
" in light of these stats , a @entity2 smartphone makes all the more sense
the company could capitalize on its mobile leadership position
but because @entity2 has not officially made any announcements about its hardware plans , it 's unclear when a @entity2 phone will actually enter the market
in the meantime , we can hope that the company continues to update its mobile apps
