@entity0 , @entity1 -- at first , @entity4 said , she thought it was part of the magic show aboard her @entity9 cruise
during the show , aboard the @entity13 , staffers had been " playing with the lights " and using smoke , " so we really were n't that alarmed " as things began happening on the ship , she said sunday
@entity4 said she and her traveling companion , @entity18 , returned to their cabin after the ship gave a " shudder , " but were reassured by their cabin steward the ship was experiencing a " small technical difficulty
" and as the two got into bed , someone speaking on behalf of the ship 's captain made an announcement saying there was an electrical problem that would be fixed soon
however , it became clear that something was amiss aboard the 1,500 - cabin luxury vessel , after the two heard announcements regarding lifeboats and muster stations
they dressed , grabbed their life jackets and went to investigate , coming upon a chaotic scene
" we peeked around the corner to kind of see what people were doing ... and my gosh , people were actually getting in a lifeboat , " @entity4 said
at least five people died after the @entity52 ran aground on the tiny island of @entity54 friday night
several others remained unaccounted for
survivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats , while the crew appeared helpless and overwhelmed to cope
" there was n't anybody to help you , " @entity4 said
" i mean , the passengers were loading the lifeboats by themselves
" @entity64 , the parent company of @entity65 , said in a statement saturday that it was " working to fully understand the cause of what occurred
the safety of our guests and crew members remains the number - one priority of @entity64 ... and all of our cruise lines
" @entity65 on sunday said crew members on board the @entity52 " acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation
we are very grateful for all they have done
" it said preliminary indications are that there may have been " significant human error " on the part of the ship 's captain
compounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of lifeboats was available as the ship was listing
passenger @entity92 , from @entity93 , @entity94 , said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck , leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming
" it was so crowded , and there was no room for us , " said @entity101 , who was sailing with his siblings
they arrived late , he said sunday , and " it was just bad , like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats
the crew was yelling for people to wait their turn and pretty much it was just a giant every man for himself , to get onto the lifeboat
" he said his family hung back because " we did n't want to make it worse
" his sister , @entity121 , said she thought several times that she might die , as they waited at least an hour and a half for more rescue boats after all the lifeboats departed
as the ship took on water and listed to the side , " we were just holding onto the railing , trying not to fall , " @entity101 said
" i just remember standing on the decks , " @entity121 said
" there were barely any people left
" she said she did n't see any crew members " until the very last minute " and they were given no information about how long they would have to wait or whether any more help was coming
her primary concern , she said , was staying with her brothers
" there was no way that we were going to be separated
" @entity65 said sunday its crew members hold a certificate in basic safety training and are trained to assist in emergency situations
every two weeks , the company said , all crew members perform a ship evacuation simulation
@entity4 said the only help they received from the crew was one young woman who approached her and told her to tighten her life vest
" i was really disappointed and surprised , " she said
" the crew was so young
you would have thought they could have handled it better
" she said she thinks passengers should at least have been told to grab their coats , shoes and warm clothing
@entity18 said she believes the two waited at least 40 minutes to get on a lifeboat
the two had just embarked at the @entity1 port of @entity167 , she said , and had not undergone the mandatory safety drill , scheduled for the next evening
however , she had just taken a cruise and so she knew where the life jackets were stored , she said
" lack of communication was a big thing for me , " she said , " and it was n't the language barrier ... it was n't handled at all like the previous cruise i had been on
" even on shore , she said , people were wandering around aimlessly
she said once she and @entity4 got on board a lifeboat , people were angry with them , as the boat was crowded
she did not clarify whether the crew members or other passengers were angry
passenger @entity185 on saturday recounted making his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife
" it was the @entity190 brothers , watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat , " he said
" i felt like the disaster itself was manageable , but i felt like the crew was going to kill us
" after helping passengers , some said , crew members jumped overboard and swam ashore
@entity185 said even the safety presentation was more of a " sales pitch " for shore excursions
@entity2 's @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and journalist @entity205 contributed to this report .
