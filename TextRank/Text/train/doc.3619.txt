-- earlier this week , @entity1 sat down in a small doctor 's office in @entity3 , @entity4
a technician swabbed his arm and gave him a quick jab with a needle
with that , @entity1 became subject no. 13 in the experiment testing a potential @entity12 vaccine
the trial was launched on an emergency basis earlier this month by the @entity15
it 's the first to test this kind of @entity12 vaccine in humans
" it 's not just for the money , " @entity1 wrote in a @entity20
" i 'm very interested in translational research and experiencing it from the guinea pig side is very rewarding
but yeah , the money helps
this one study will fund most of my grad school application costs , though not in time for application season
" the vaccine does n't use live virus and ca n't infect volunteers with @entity12
instead it uses specific @entity12 proteins to trigger an immune response
they 're delivered through the body on a modified version of an adenovirus , a type of cold virus
in the initial phase , 10 healthy volunteers were given a low dose of vaccine
they were monitored for side effects and tested to see if their bodies are producing antibodies
in the second phase , of which @entity1 is a part , an additional 10 volunteers are being given a higher dose
all participants will be followed for nearly a year and tested at regular intervals
@entity1 , who has volunteered for several prior research studies at @entity57 , spoke with @entity0 about his experience
the following is a condensed version of that conversation : @entity0 : how did you come to join the study ? @entity1 : i actually work at @entity57 ; i 'm a post-doc researcher in a developmental biology lab. most trials i learn about from reading a @entity68 ( email list )
i heard about the vaccine study from going to preliminary meetings for a different study
@entity0 : when was this ? @entity1 : less than a month ago
i had my first appointment on august 26
it was just a sit - down , to talk about the trial , go through paperwork and consent forms , explaining what the trial was for
then they did an initial run - through of my health history
@entity0 : what was next ? @entity1 : the next week i had my second appointment
they did a full physical , blood work , health history , breathing checks
a lot of poking and prodding
my third visit was wednesday
they drew blood , then gave me a shot
now , my next appointment is sunday
@entity0 : what was it like ? you wrote that pulling off the band - aid was the worst of the pain
@entity1 : i 'm supposed to keep a daily diary for the first seven days , logging my temperature and any symptoms
the next morning , i woke up with a slight fever , 100.5
i took some @entity107 and it went away
other than that i feel fine
in fact , i ran a half - mile in a relay race at lunchtime with some people from work
@entity0 : you wrote that for each of these regular visits , you 're paid $ 175
how many times have you been a human guinea pig ? @entity1 : this is my second drug trial
before that , i did mostly mri studies
the first one i did , i was in the mri machine and had three tasks
they gave me two buttons and showed pictures
if it was spiderman , i 'd hit one button ; if it was the @entity130 , i 'd hit the other
so i spent 15 minutes playing @entity132 vs. @entity130
@entity0 : did you have any reservation at all , taking part in this @entity12 vaccine trial ? @entity1 : none at all .
