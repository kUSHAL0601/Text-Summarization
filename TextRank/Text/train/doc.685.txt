to @entity2 , @entity1 sen. @entity0 is the fighter for @entity3 who " refused to let @entity4 turn its back " on the state in the aftermath of @entity8 almost 10 years ago
@entity9 reached back to the months and years after the 2005 hurricane killed more than 1,500 people in @entity3 to praise @entity0 on saturday at a @entity13 rally for the endangered three - term senator
" she was relentless , " @entity9 said , noting that she and @entity0 were in the @entity16 at the time
" you learn a lot about a person and a leader in a moment like that
and i saw @entity0 in action , no cameras , no attention , just focused like a laser to take care of her people
" @entity9 continued : " she never gave up
if you know anything about @entity0 , you know that is an ingrained characteristic , she does n't shy away from a fight
" @entity0 is in a different kind of fight this year -- a fight to keep her @entity16 seat against a stout challenge from @entity41 rep. @entity41
every national poll since the start of september has shown @entity41 besting the incumbent
@entity9 did her part on saturday to knock @entity41 but never actually referred to him by name
" from what i have heard , @entity0 's opponent did n't really lift a finger after @entity51 , " @entity9 said , using a familiar @entity0 campaign attack that cites a 2012 no - vote against legislation that included disaster relief money for the state after @entity51 rocked the state
@entity9 also subtly hit @entity57 's presidency for fumbling the response to @entity8 , blaming the former president for a " paralyzed " response to the tragedy
for her part , @entity0 portrayed herself as the right choice for @entity3 because her support for oil and gas , women and seniors
she also did n't run away from her 18 - years in the @entity16 , despite polls that show a deep - seeded resentment of @entity70 and an anti-incumbent mood throughout the country
" i have now worked with three presidents , four majority leaders and six governors , " @entity0 said within the first few minutes of her speech
" and i know how to get work done for you , no matter what the line up in @entity4 is and no matter how gridlocked it might be
" @entity0 , however , finds herself behind in her fourth race
@entity41 has sought to tie @entity0 to president @entity82 , who in much of @entity3 is markedly unpopular
in nearly every ad , @entity41 mention that " @entity0 supports @entity82 97 percent of the time
" the attacks have worked and some polls show the @entity88 senator might be past the point of @entity9 's saving
@entity0 advisers and spokesmen on saturday told reporters to disregard most of the polling and instead pointed to early voting totals as proof that momentum is swinging their way
in particular , @entity99 , a senior adviser to @entity0 , pointed to the fact that 33 % of early ballots totals have come from black voters , a strong demographic for the @entity104
" sen. @entity0 has had tight races in all of her races , " said @entity105 , the campaign 's spokesman
" if need be , we will be ready [ for a runoff ]
but we are ready to win this on election night
