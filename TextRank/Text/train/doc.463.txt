-- the youngest of @entity3 's main islands -- and it 's still growing , with over 500 acres of new land added over the last 30 years -- the @entity6 of @entity8 overflows with outdoor adventures
here you can hike to the edge of the world 's longest - running volcanic eruption , then climb @entity3 's two tallest peaks
dropping back down to earth , trek into forested valleys harboring ancient heiau ( @entity19 temples ) and wild beaches where you can camp by the surf in the silvery moonlight
@entity3 : the state that does n't vote @entity25 start by going straight to the heart of the @entity6 's live lava action : @entity25
here @entity28 has been spewing lava since 1983
during just the last few years , @entity30 has once again become a roiling lake of fire
traditionally believed to be the home of @entity33 , the @entity19 goddess of fire and volcanoes , @entity30 looks especially hellish after dark
@entity3 : dos and don'ts wait , is n't all this volcanic activity dangerous ? not exactly
@entity19 shield volcanoes rarely erupt with fountains of fire , but instead send out lava flows that ooze above ground or in underground tubes with glowing skylights
when those flows reach the ocean , they send up huge plumes of steam that billow like clouds during the day and glow ghoulishly at night
@entity0 : hiking @entity52 : a walk through @entity3 's history and culture depending on current volcanic activity , you may be able to hike to within view of the lava flow , either inside the park or at county - run @entity63 viewing area ; call +1 ( 808 ) 961 - 8093 for up - to - date information
to luau or not to luau ? your @entity3 tips if you want to set foot on older , more stable but still steaming lava flows , as seen in the alien landscapes of the 2001 @entity71 remake of " @entity72 , " follow the park 's 4 - mile @entity73 , which descends from the volcanic crater rim and traipses over jet - back lava flows , which are slowly being recolonized by native plants , and through birdsong - filled @entity78 ( oases ) spared @entity33 's wrath
@entity81 in a far - flung corner of @entity25 , @entity81 ( " @entity83 " in @entity19 ) , the most massive volcano in @entity3 , stands watch
if you 're a peak - bagger , the 19 - mile trek to its summit is a worthy challenge
intense sun exposure , white - out fog and the risks of hypothermia and altitude sickness do n't deter ambitious , physically fit climbers from this multi-day ascent over a moonscape of volcanic lava flows to @entity100 's otherworldly summit caldera
travel snapshots : natural beauty shines in @entity8 day hikers who want to take the shortcut use the @entity105 , another strenuous and breathtakingly high trail ( 13 miles round - trip ) that starts off @entity108 outside the park
it 's a steep , unearthly beautiful climb through rainbow - colored volcanic cinders to @entity81 's windy , exposed summit
get an early start ( before 8 a.m. ) and check the weather forecast before setting out
the observatory access road is rough and mostly unpaved ; a 4wd vehicle is helpful
note most rental - car companies prohibit driving on unpaved roads , even in @entity119
@entity0 : @entity121 's coast and mountains : a hiker 's dream @entity125 @entity125 is the world 's tallest mountain -- taller even than @entity128
@entity129 -- when measured from its base deep on the ocean floor all the way to its summit at 13,796 feet above sea level
startlingly clear skies have made the summit an ideal place for building high - tech astronomical observatories ; some are open to the public for visits and tours
for ancient @entity143 , @entity125 was a pilgrimage spot for sacred ceremonies including burials , as well as collecting materials to make tools
the snow goddess @entity150 lives here , among the prehistoric lava flows and tiny @entity152
start partway up the mountain at the @entity154 , which offers free star - gazing programs nightly
acclimatize to the heady 9000 - foot elevation while you sip hot chocolate indoors
most rental cars are not allowed to drive up to the summit , but you can still get there the hard way -- on foot
it 's an eerie 6 - mile climb each way , snaking around cinder cones at eye - level with the clouds and within distant view of the ocean , over two dizzying miles down below
not up for such a workout ? catch sunset at the summit on a guided @entity175 instead
@entity176 & @entity177 as thrilling as the @entity6 's volcanoes are , just as impressive are its emerald amphitheater valleys
curving along the coast in the shadow of the @entity184 , most of these enormous valleys are completely inaccessible
but you can still capture panoramas of wildly bucking surf , patchwork fields of green taro plants and lacy waterfalls dropping off the cliffsides from the @entity192
it 's at the end of a paved highway from @entity196 on the northern @entity197
from the lookout , it 's a knee - knockingly steep 1 - mile walk down a @entity175 road to black - sand @entity201 where spinner dolphins cavort offshore
hire a guide if you want to venture further back into @entity192 , because locals are fiercely protective of private property and you 'll need someone who knows the landscape
alternatively , get a permit in advance for a @entity213 backpacking trip to utterly remote @entity214 , abandoned after a tsunami wiped out its village in 1946
the 9 - mile @entity217 from @entity192 into @entity214 is rough , hazardous and extremely steep in spots , so only experienced backcountry hikers should attempt it
@entity0 : @entity3 's @entity6 : how to make the most of a short trip @entity223 a much easier day hike awaits in the @entity226 district , at the end of a paved highway winding past @entity229
@entity230 to ancient @entity143 , the fertile @entity223 thrived with taro fields into the 20th century until the @entity232 diverted water
today you can hike down into this amphitheatre valley on a rocky hiking trail that 's less than a mile long
finish at a black - sand beach where you can sit , contemplate the breaking waves and feel the mana ( spiritual power ) of the @entity6 's valleys and volcanoes
