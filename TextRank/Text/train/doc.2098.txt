-- on the same day terrorists took lives in @entity4 , secretary of state @entity1 talked in @entity5 about another young life extinguished by an explosive device , foreign service officer @entity8
" a 25 - year - old young woman , full of idealism , full of hopes , taking books to children in a school so they can learn , and wiped out by terrorism , by the worst kind of nihilistic nothing -- violence that does n't stand for anything except killing people and stopping the future , " @entity1 said , talking of his decision to pay a condolence visit to her parents and vowing her death would not be in vain
" we 're not going to be deterred
we 're going to be inspired
and we 're going to use @entity8 's idealism as another motivation for the idealism that brings all of you to this effort in the first place
we can make this world better
" only hours later came @entity4 , and more lives blown apart by explosive devices planted to deadly effect on a day that should have been a holiday
bombs hit innocents right in the heart of a street celebration and were timed for the most lethal impact
an 8 - year - old boy , who had held a handmade sign calling for peace , dead
a young @entity4 woman full of promise extinguished before her 30th birthday
a young @entity54 woman who chased her dream of education in @entity4 killed
death clinging to the streets in a city that would have found the idea unthinkable even moments before
@entity62 will be called upon in the coming days to do as so many families have before them : to pull themselves out of the swamp of their heartbreak and to push forward with life
to make certain that those who practice destruction and devastation do not achieve a win
to find the valor amid the annihilation and to force resilience to rise up against grief
as @entity1 said , to be inspired by horror to " make this world better , " as @entity4 's first responders and a slew of marathon volunteers surely were
but it will not be easy
facing down terror and resuming life is tough
rebuilding after loss requires a particular kind of tenacity and a commitment to living that grief wants to smother
many push forward to do honor to the memory of those they have lost
but they must remind themselves each step of the way that though it would be easier to succumb to loss they must instead choose life
because otherwise their loved one 's example would be in vain
as @entity4 struggled to reconcile itself with the re-emergence of terror , a series of bombs exploded across @entity104 leaving death and maiming behind
people simply trying to make a flight at @entity109 's airport died when parked cars became explosives
at least 42 were killed across the country
in @entity114 , a suicide bomber killed nine people who came out for an election rally
more than 50 were wounded
across the world innocents are targeted and terror seizes the spotlight with little effort
all that is left to be done is to bear witness , bring perpetrators to justice and continue living
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity129 .
