@entity0 , @entity1 -- pro-russian activists and @entity5 riot police clashed thursday inside the compound of the prosecutor 's office in the eastern city of @entity0 , as simmering tensions escalated into violence
as a result of the clashes , 26 people sought medical help , four of them for gunshot wounds , the @entity0 regional administration 's health department said
at least one police officer was injured in the clashes , the @entity21 said , adding that shots were fired and small grenades and stones were used in the attack
police fired tear gas and stun grenades in an effort to disperse the activists , who were armed with clubs , batons and shields but did not appear to be carrying firearms
some of the activists smashed windows and broke down doors as they sought to enter the building
" we 're going floor to floor looking for people ... for the people who were here beforehand , " one of the militants said
one woman earlier told a @entity2 team on the ground that she helped a wounded man who she said was shot by someone from inside the building
paramedics were called to help the wounded at the site thursday afternoon
protest march in @entity0 , rally in @entity55 earlier in the day , crowds marched through @entity0 , demanding greater autonomy for the restive eastern region
at the head of the march , which was held to mark @entity60 , was a speaker who accused the authorities in @entity55 of pushing @entity64 supporters to a position where they are demanding a referendum on may 11 and a federal state
many in the region view the interim government in @entity55 as a " junta " that seized power thanks to backing from ultranationalist groups , and they are angered by its actions
@entity1 was a heartland of support for @entity77 president @entity76 , ousted in february after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from @entity80 in favor of @entity82
pro-russian protesters already control a number of key government buildings in @entity0 , after seizing them last month , and have declared it to be the " @entity87
" from the industrial city 's @entity89 , where the march started , masked men could be seen atop a building next to a flag signaling support for the @entity64 camp
the yellow and blue @entity5 flag , which had been flying until a short time before , was thrown off the side of the building , a symbol of the spreading unrest
pro-russian protesters in the city of @entity106 , closer to the @entity103 border , said wednesday that they had seized additional government buildings because they wanted to be sure of holding the planned referendum
the crisis has sparked deep divisions in @entity1
many also want to see the country remain united , but unhappiness about government corruption and ineffectiveness runs deep
in @entity1 's capital , @entity55 , hundreds of people joined a rally thursday for peace and unity , organized by student and trade union groups and left - of - center parties
the protesters called for constitutional reform , decentralization of power and new parliamentary elections
they also called for a national referendum to decide whether @entity1 should become a federal state ; if the @entity103 language should become the official language in some regions ; and whether @entity1 should integrate with the @entity133
$ 17.1 billion bailout approved acting @entity5 president @entity135 acknowledged this week that the central government has effectively lost control of the country 's @entity0 and @entity106 regions to the @entity64 separatists
a controversial referendum in @entity1 's southeastern @entity143 region in march resulted in its annexation by @entity103 , a step widely condemned by the international community
like @entity143 , although not to the same extent , many in eastern @entity1 are @entity103 - speaking and have close cultural ties to @entity103
the interim government , which is struggling with a dire economic situation , has promised constitutional reforms to try to ease tensions ahead of national elections scheduled for may 25
in a key sign of international support , the @entity155 approved a $ 17.1 billion bailout for @entity1 on thursday
" it 's obviously not without risk
but it 's a necessity to respond to a member 's request
and we have tried everything we could to mitigate the implementation risks , " @entity155 chief @entity164 told @entity2 's @entity165
@entity164 also noted that " clearly there have been consequences " for the @entity103 economy as a result of its intervention in @entity1
" if you look at the monetary policy , if you look at the capital flows , if you look at their own forecasts -- there have been consequences on the @entity103 economy as a result of the geopolitical situation , the uncertainty and the sanctions that have been decided , " she said
the @entity133 and @entity185 say @entity82 has not so far acted in support of an april 17 international deal aimed at easing the crisis and this week imposed additional sanctions on @entity103 officials and companies judged to be close to president @entity192
diplomat accused of spying meanwhile , @entity1 has ordered the expulsion of a @entity103 naval diplomat after alleged spying this week , @entity1 's @entity195 said on its @entity199 page thursday
the statement said the attache was detained " while he was committing spying activities on april 30th
" the ministry said the diplomat has to leave @entity1 as soon as possible
@entity1 and @entity206 nations have accused @entity103 , which @entity207 says has tens of thousands of troops massed by @entity1 's border , of supporting and coordinating separatist unrest in its eastern region
but @entity103 denies any direct involvement in the disorder , which has seen @entity64 militia groups seize government and police buildings in more than a dozen towns and cities across the region
separately , a senior military official told @entity2 the @entity185 was awaiting additional recommendations from @entity207 supreme allied commander gen. @entity222 on potentially expanding current military exercises and adding new ones in @entity80
the goal would be to bolster " alliance readiness
" @entity207 allies , particularly those close to @entity1 , have requested a more robust alliance presence , including larger , permanent deployments on their soil
additional troops would come from @entity185 and @entity207 forces already in @entity80
@entity235 also would contribute , the official said
@entity1 military conscription order @entity135 signed a decree to introduce compulsory military service " to increase the defensive powers of the country , " his office said in a statement thursday
men aged 18 to 25 will be subject to the order
the move takes account of the further escalation of the situation in eastern and southern @entity1 , as well as " instances of overt aggression " and the actions of pro-russian militants , the statement said
the aim is to maintain the armed forces and help them " give an adequate response to real and potential threats to @entity1 , " according to the statement
@entity135 said wednesday that the country 's armed forces have been put on full combat readiness because of the threat from @entity103
speaking at a meeting with the heads of regional state administrations , he said authorities ' task was to prevent the spread of the " terrorist threat " from separatists and @entity64 saboteurs to other regions of @entity1
a military " anti-terrorism " operation launched last month has achieved little or nothing
the government in @entity55 has said it wants to show restraint and appears reluctant to embark on military operations against militants who are embedded in residential areas
@entity103 's @entity195 responded to @entity135 's remarks late wednesday by denouncing what it called " these militaristic statements of @entity55 authorities
" meanwhile , militants in the town of @entity289 continue to hold seven military observers from the @entity291 , detained last friday despite their diplomatic status
@entity293 , self - declared chairman of the " @entity87 , " has said the observers are @entity207 spies and that the activists would like to exchange them for people detained by @entity298 authorities
@entity291 spokesman @entity299 told @entity2 thursday that its negotiators were again meeting with the separatists to discuss the release of the @entity206 observer team
they are said to be in good health
