@entity0 , @entity1 -- for five years , the horrible memory has lingered in the minds of @entity0 's commuters , quietly riding their trains into the heart of the city
the pain is easing , but it 's a nagging ache just the same
the rush - hour train bombings killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others
it was march 11 , 2004 , during morning rush hour , that terrorists armed with powerful bombs boarded these same commuter train lines , unleashing an onslaught that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others
the attacks are the deadliest in @entity20 since the rise of @entity22
more than a year later on july 7 , 2005 , terrorists would stage bombings on the @entity25 transit system that killed 52 people and wounded hundreds more
the explosives were left on the @entity1 trains in sports bags and backpacks -- sometimes placed under seats -- court documents say
the terrorists got off at various stations down the line , before cell - phone timers detonated 10 bombs in quick succession on four trains at three stations
police dismantled another bomb that did n't explode
it provided vital clues that led to arrests
eighteen people , mostly @entity46 militants , have been convicted in the attacks
watch more on the anniversary @entity49 , an engineer who took the train later that same day , said he knows a couple whose daughter died in the attacks
" it was very tough , especially knowing it could have been you , " @entity49 said
" now , you remember it , but not the same as when it just happened
" @entity59 , a regular commuter , says she rides cautiously
" every day , when i get on the train , i always ride in the last car , " @entity59 said
" i do n't know why , for safety , " she added , not quite sure of her motives
on one train , the first explosion was in a rear car and , as people ran forward to get away , they were hit by explosions in the middle cars , investigators have said
" people remember the march 11th attacks , " said @entity76 , a deputy editor with @entity78 newspaper , " and while conscious that the threat continues , you have to continue with your life
" memorial observations were scheduled throughout the day , including five minutes of silence for the victims
@entity83 and prime minister @entity84 were not taking part in the public events
a victims group called their non-participation a slight
but on this fifth anniversary , most commuters are just going about their business , with that nagging ache still lingering .
