-- more than two years after releasing its game - changing tablet computer , @entity1 now actually owns the name " @entity5
" a @entity7 court says the company has paid $ 60 million to a @entity10 firm for the rights , nailing down the name as its own in a country that is increasingly becoming a huge market for electronics
@entity15 had trademarked the name " @entity5 " in 2001
@entity1 paid the company about $ 55,000 in 2009
but @entity7 authorities refused to recognize the payment and ruled last year that @entity19 still owned the name in that country
" the @entity5 dispute resolution is ended , " the @entity21 said in a statement acquired by the @entity23
" @entity1 has transferred $ 60 million to the account of the @entity26 as requested in the mediation letter
" @entity1 did not immediately return a message seeking comment monday morning
@entity7 is already @entity1 's second - biggest market behind the @entity31
it only shows signs of growing as more of its roughly 1.3 billion people become more tech - savvy
a lawyer for @entity19 told the @entity23 that the company hoped for more money but settled because it has debts to pay
he said it had wanted as much as $ 400 million , according to the @entity23
@entity19 had argued that @entity1 did n't negotiate in good faith , using a shell company that promised not to make competing products under the @entity5 label
the company alleges the negotiator concealed that he was working for @entity1 , gave a false name and said the company he represented was @entity50 -- or @entity5 , for short
the dispute certainly has n't slowed demand for the tablet and other @entity1 products in @entity7
when the ipad 2 was released last year , a skirmish broke out outside a @entity57 after a man believed to be a scalper was escorted away by security after trying to cut in line
and some @entity7 entrepreneurs do n't even worry so much about the @entity1 products they sell actually being @entity1 products
last year , authorities discovered 22 fake @entity66 in just one city and ordered them to either change their names or shut down
it was unclear at the time whether the gadgets they were selling were actually @entity1 's or fakes .
