@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 said wednesday that efforts to contain and clean up oil gushing from a ruptured pipe in the @entity7 have made a " measurable difference " even as @entity1 's governor announced that thick , heavy oil has begun polluting the state 's wetlands and estuaries
@entity14 , @entity3 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , said at a news conference that the company is " very pleased " with the performance of an insertion tube that was put in place over the weekend to suck crude oil from the well and funnel it to a surface vessel
the flow rate from the tube has reached 3,000 barrels of crude ( 126,000 gallons ) and 14 million cubic feet of gas a day , @entity14 said , adding that crews hope to increase those numbers in coming days
he said favorable weather conditions have also played a major role in cleanup efforts
about 14,000 barrels of oily water was skimmed tuesday , and 50 percent of that mixture was oil , he said , adding that crews continue to deploy boom and conduct controlled burns
but gov. @entity43 of @entity1 says the efforts have n't stopped oil from reaching his state 's coastline
@entity48 , heavier oil than seen in previous days has blanketed some of the state 's precious interior wetlands , he said , and he called for the @entity53 to approve an emergency permit to dredge sand from barrier islands to create sand booms as another line of defense
" these are not tar balls , this is not sheen , this is heavy oil that we are seeing in our wetlands , " @entity43 said
video from @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity1 , showed oil with a syrupy consistency lapping against reeds in a small area of marshland after creeping past booms and barriers
" everything that that blanket of oil has covered today will die , " parish president @entity77 said
" imagine [ this oil ] on top of a turtle or on top of a frog , " he said as he held a stalk of reed that coated his hands in oil
@entity2 ireporter @entity93 , touring the state 's @entity90 by boat on tuesday , described a " foamy sheen on top of the water " left by the oil and dispersants , and she said she counted between 10 and 15 dead @entity97 man - of - wars trapped in debris
" while we were out there , my nose and the back of my throat began to burn as i inhaled the putrid - smelling air , " @entity93 said
@entity43 compared the fight to head off the approaching oil to " knowing your body has cancer
... we 've got to stop this cancer from spreading [ and ] we 'd much rather fight it on these coastal barrier islands than inland
" " we need more than just boom or skimmers , " @entity117 said
" we need multiple lines of defense
" @entity122 : track the spill , or share your story meanwhile , @entity3 said it is continuing to mobilize equipment and perform testing in preparation for the first effort to actually stop the flow of oil
@entity14 said the first attempt at a " top kill " procedure could come as early as sunday
in that procedure , a large amount of heavy " mud " -- a fluid used as a lubricant and counterweight in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore
if that succeeds , the well will be cemented shut , officials have said
@entity14 cautioned , as he has with previous efforts , that the procedure will be performed at a depth of 5,000 feet , " which has never been done before
" " we 're absolutely holding out hope that top kill works , " said @entity148 rear adm. @entity148
" everybody is anxious to see success with this intervention
... let 's keep our fingers crossed [ and ] let 's all say our prayers
" oil has been leaking at an estimated rate of 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) a day for nearly a month after an april 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig the @entity163
the rig burned for two days and then sank , causing the ruptured pipe
also wednesday , the @entity166 said it has been in communication with @entity169 officials over the possibility of oil reaching that country 's shorelines
" the @entity175 in @entity176 today delivered a diplomatic note to the @entity169 @entity178 informing the @entity169 government about the oil spill and what we currently know about its projected movement , " the @entity166 's deputy spokesman , @entity174 , told @entity2
" we have had working level discussions with the @entity169 government to keep them informed of developments
" the communication came after reports of oil possibly reaching the @entity7 's @entity189
the current flows through the @entity191 between @entity169 and @entity7 , and then northward , where it loops and exits the @entity7 just south of the @entity193 and travels to the west side of the western @entity195
the @entity196 issued a statement wednesday saying satellite images show the oil is in the @entity189
" with these images from space , we have visible proof that at least oil from the surface of the water has reached the current , " @entity200 of @entity201 , the @entity202 , said in the statement
@entity209 of the @entity210 said wednesday that amounts of light sheen " are feeling the effects of the @entity189 and that oil is going to move slowly " with the current
" we actually expect that oil to dissipate , " said @entity209 , adding it was " not an immediate threat " to @entity218 or other shorelines .
