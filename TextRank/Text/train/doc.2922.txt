@entity0 , @entity1 -- two rival @entity4 leaders signed an agreement saturday to end months of rancor and fighting between the two powerful movements they command , a representative of one of the men said
@entity13 , left , and @entity14 have agreed to promote peace between their rival movements
@entity13 , the populist @entity4 cleric , and @entity14 , the head of the @entity19 , forged the agreement in the spirit of the current @entity23 holy month of @entity24 , said @entity19 spokesman @entity25
gestures of forgiveness and mercy are often made during @entity24
the deal has three main points : stopping the fighting between @entity1 , urging print and electronic media to engender a spirit of friendship and forgiveness , and establishing commissions in each of @entity1 's 18 provinces to oversee the peace initiative
@entity39 said @entity13 , who recently returned to @entity1 from @entity40 , signed the agreement in @entity42 , the @entity4 holy city in the south , and @entity14 signed it in @entity40
the men head movements that are in the middle of a power struggle in @entity4 regions across @entity1 , particularly in the south
@entity51 's @entity50 and @entity19 's @entity53 militia have squared off in recent months , with @entity55 gunmen many times fighting police who are aligned with the @entity58
clashes between those groups during a recent pilgrimage in the @entity4 holy city of @entity63 sparked all - out fighting in that city , @entity0 and @entity66 province
that fighting , in august , left dozens dead and caused @entity13 to suspend his militia for six months for restructuring
meanwhile on saturday , the @entity71 military countered media reports that civilians were among 25 people killed during fighting near @entity75 early friday
the military , underscoring its earlier account of the incident , said it was targeting a @entity4 militant believed to be associated with members of @entity40 's @entity80 , the entity accused by the @entity71 of providing arms and training to insurgents in @entity1
troops came under heavy fire in a village in @entity88 province , which extends north and east of @entity0 and borders @entity40 , and a battle ensued , the military said
the military said air power was called in to support ground troops and the strike killed 25 people
but , the military says , they were n't civilians
" in this instance , we have confirmed that the 25 criminals who were killed were responsible for the attack on our forces and in fact were members of an extremist group operating in the @entity75 region , " the military said
@entity1 authorities told @entity2 on friday that the airstrike in the village , a @entity4 community , killed and wounded civilians , including women and children
in raids on saturday , coalition forces killed six insurgents and detained 18 , the @entity71 military said
the raids , targeting the @entity116 - dominated @entity115 in @entity1 , were conducted in the @entity0 area , in @entity118 , and near @entity119
" we 're on the offensive against @entity115 in @entity1 and the foreign terrorists who help them , " said maj. @entity120 , @entity121 spokesman
a roadside bomb in southern @entity0 on saturday killed a @entity71 soldier and wounded three others , the @entity71 military said
this brings the number of @entity71 military deaths to seven in october and 3,808 since the beginning of the @entity1 war
seven civilian contractors for the @entity134 also have been killed
