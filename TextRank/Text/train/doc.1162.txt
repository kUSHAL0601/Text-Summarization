-- @entity3 @entity2 driver @entity1 has aimed a verbal attack at his own @entity6 team , saying they are giving more support to teammate @entity9 as the pair both scrap for the 2010 world title
@entity1 has led the world championship for large parts of the season , although he now sits in second and trails leader @entity16 by 11 points with just two races of the season remaining
the 23 - year - old @entity9 is also among a group of five drivers who are still in the race to claim the sport 's biggest prize
the @entity25 is in fourth place , 14 points behind @entity1 and 25 behind @entity16
however , 34 - year - old @entity1 believes his world championship challenge has been " inconvenient " for his team , who are bidding to win both their first constructor 's and driver 's championships
is @entity34 's @entity16 the fastest on the grid ? " i think i was n't supposed to be in the hunt at all , so it 's been maybe quite inconvenient , but i 've enjoyed every minute of it , " @entity1 told a news conference
@entity1 was in a frank mood , and pulled no punches when asked whether he believed his team gave the 23 - year - old more support
" it 's f * * * * * * obvious , is n't it ? of course , " he said
" when young , new charges come on to the block that 's where the emotion is
that 's the way it is
" i have had a great opportunity with a great car to do some great things this year
i 've got favorites in life
favorite people i like to be with
" @entity1 is also not expecting support from his teammate in pursuit of his first driver 's championship
" if it has n't happened by now , it 's never going to happen
nothing has changed between @entity65 over the last five or six races
the only thing different is that @entity16 is leading
" " obviously @entity68 has never led this year and i have
we 'll see on the monday after @entity70 if we have taken the right approach
" the relationship between the pair has been under scrutiny all season , with the issue coming to a head after they crashed when @entity9 tried to pass @entity1 at this season 's @entity79
both will line up on the grid for the @entity83 @entity79 , which takes place on sunday at the @entity86 circuit in @entity87 .
