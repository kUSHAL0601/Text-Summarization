-- at 12 years old , @entity1 was struggling to see the world around him
" he was walking off curbs and falling down staircases because he could n't see that they were there , " said his dad , @entity4
@entity1 had been diagnosed at an early age with neurofibromatosis , a genetic disorder that can cause learning disabilities and in his case an optic nerve tumor
when the tumor threatened to leave him blind , he underwent rounds of chemotherapy and 28 days of radiation
" we talked to @entity1 about it , and we made light of it
we did n't want it to scare him or make him feel threatened , " his dad said
to lift his spirits , he started painting watercolors on note cards
" it was sad to see this 12 - year - old child go through treatment , " said his mom , @entity30
" so one day we just took out the watercolors and note cards and @entity1 started painting ... and that 's when we recognized as parents that @entity1 had a great gift for color
" " it helped me a lot painting during chemotherapy and radiation because it was something to do
it was fun , " @entity1 said
that summer , @entity1 started selling his note cards along with his mom 's baked goods at the foot of their driveway in @entity49 , @entity50
" in the beginning , it was a lemonade stand
and he thought he 'd make a few dollars and have some spending money , " his father said
" but what we quickly realized was that he was making a lot of money
" by the end of the summer , @entity1 had raised $ 15,000 , which he gave to charity
he donated the money to the @entity64 to help research his diagnosis
" it makes me feel really good that i was able to give it away and help others , " he said
for @entity1 , it was just the beginning
he went from painting watercolors on note cards to creating colorful acrylic art on canvases
then he started auctioning his paintings at charity events
" each one of them is a labor of love
each one of them is very special , " said his mom
" nothing about them is mass produced
" in five years , @entity1 has donated more than $ 350,000 from the sale of his paintings to more than 50 charities , most of them devoted to children 's health
at a recent event for the @entity90 , @entity1 sold one of his paintings for $ 15,000 during the live auction
the second bidder offered to pay another $ 15,000 if @entity1 painted a second piece
" in just minutes , @entity1 raised $ 30,000 , " his mom said
" he loves to chuckle and say the only thing that sold for more was a @entity96
" at 17 , the sight - impaired teen does n't plan to slow down any time soon
" my goal for the future is to raise a million dollars for charity , " he said
" he 's a young businessman trying to take his gift and use his paintings to invest in his visually impaired future , " his mom said
" at the same time , the philanthropic side of his business is exploding
" @entity1 's art is on display at the @entity109 in @entity50
even some celebrities like @entity111 and @entity112 own his paintings
" i love the way @entity1 's paintings make me feel and the use of his bold colors and his texture , " said @entity113 , an art collector who owns one of his paintings
" for this young person to be able to do what he has done , it 's an incredible story
his story is the true art. " " everyone who hears his story and who sees his work finds their own hearts changed , " said @entity126 , senior pastor for the @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity50
" i think they find themselves wanting to be more generous
they find themselves wanting to be more positive about life
they find themselves wanting to help other people
that 's the impact @entity1 has on their lives
