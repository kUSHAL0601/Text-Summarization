" it has been a bad tragedy for us and ( we ) never can be able to repair our broken heart , " said @entity11 's father , @entity20 , to @entity0 affiliate @entity21 in @entity22
" we just could n't believe their own peers could do something like that to their own people
" a military investigation report obtained by the @entity32 said @entity11 killed himself with a two - or three - round burst from an @entity34 in the early hours of april 3
according to the @entity32 story on the report , a message found on @entity11 's arm , believed to be a suicide note , said : " may hate me now , but in the long run this was the right choice i 'm sorry my mom deserves the truth
" the incident at @entity46 , in @entity48 district , began with @entity11 failing to respond to radio calls late on the night of april 2 , the report said
a sergeant who found him sleeping told others that " peers should correct peers , " it said , as reported by the @entity32
the report detailed how two lance corporals , whose names were redacted , berated @entity11 and ordered him to do exercises in body armor for four hours , with one of them stomping on @entity11 's legs at times
one @entity1 kicked and punched @entity11 until being stopped by another , the report said
less than an hour later , it said , @entity11 killed himself
" at 0343 on 3 april 2011 , while crouching down in the fighting position he had just dug , @entity69 leaned over his @entity34 as it pointed to the sky , placed the muzzle in his mouth , pulled the trigger , and intentionally killed himself , " the report said , according to the @entity32
the case drew national attention when rep. @entity76 , @entity77 , the aunt of the @entity1 who killed himself , told a congressional committee about it in september
" @entity11 's death was a heartbreaking tragedy that could have been prevented , " @entity81 said in october
" the decision by the @entity85 to bring the three @entity85 before a jury of their peers brings comfort to the family and shows the military justice system at work
" in her september appearance at a @entity96 hearing , @entity81 said her nephew 's sergeant told fellow @entity85 in the unit to " teach " the 21 - year - old newcomer after he was found asleep on his watch
" lance corporal @entity11 was beaten , berated and forced to perform rigorous exercise , " she said then
" he was forced to do push - ups and leg lifts wearing full body armor , and sand was poured in his mouth
he was forced to dig a hole for hours
he was kicked , punched and stomped on
and it did not stop until 3:20 a.m. " in december , eight soldiers were charged in connection with the october death of another soldier in @entity3
army pvt. @entity114 , 19 , was found dead in a guard tower , apparently from a self - inflicted gunshot wound
the eight officers and enlisted servicemen face various charges , including dereliction of duty , making false statements , maltreatment and involuntary manslaughter
the @entity124 did not specify what alleged acts by the soldiers resulted in the charges , but family members said @entity114 had complained in letters of harassment by fellow soldiers before his death
an @entity124 official said the soldiers are essentially charged with hazing and abusing @entity114 in the weeks and days before he apparently killed himself
@entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report .
