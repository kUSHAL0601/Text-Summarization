" i had serious injury in my eye
there 's blood accumulation there and they 're hoping that resolves itself
as long as the blood is in the eye it 's hard to see the eye every place , because all the instruments they use , you ca n't see if there 's blood in the way
" @entity0 said he was following his doctors ' order to rest his eyes
" i 'm more dependent on my staff now , because i 'm not to be reading a bunch of emails and stuff like that , " he said
" because if you have one bad eye and one good eye and you overwork the good eye , it puts too much pressure on the bad eye so , you know , they 've basically told me to be very careful in how i strain my eye
" @entity0 did not return to @entity68 this week for the opening session of the 114th @entity70

@entity0 told the radio station friday that his doctors had told him he should not go to the @entity11 @entity10 retreat in @entity76 next week
