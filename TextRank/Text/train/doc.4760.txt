@entity1 , @entity0 -- suits were swapped for jeans and sneakers throughout @entity1 's financial district today , as bankers heeded warnings to dress down to avoid the potential wrath of @entity11 protestors
bankers in @entity1 head to work in casual attire
many city workers have been urged to dress down to avoid attention from protesters
" only about 20 percent of people probably just refused to dress down
everybody else is in jeans , " said @entity19 , a banker at @entity21 investment bank , @entity20
all week banks and investment firms located in @entity1 's @entity27 neighborhood have been advising employees to not dress in regular business attire
" staff are permitted to wear casual clothing -- jeans / trainers -- commencing march 30
avoid briefcases / branded bags / computer cases : put materials in rucksacks or carrier bags where possible , " @entity38 bank , @entity36 told employees in an email statement last week quoted on city news web site @entity42
employees at @entity48 investment bank in @entity1 were told simply not to bother coming into work at all today
among those who did commute to the office , bystanders said that the bankers are still easy to spot , conspicuously reading @entity55 newspaper @entity54 or dressing in a uniform business casual look
" on the tube this morning i thought it was ridiculous because all these bankers could n't have looked more like bankers trying to dress down , " @entity19 told @entity2
instead of jackets , ties and @entity64 shoes , polo shirts , khakis and loafers now fill the streets around the @entity27 and much of central @entity1
" i saw two bankers wearing matching baby blue sweaters , tight jeans and @entity72 's -- ridiculous , " @entity19 added , referring to the up - scale brand of traditional @entity0 shoes
one web site that covers news and gossip in the @entity27 has been tracking the banker backlash to the warnings
" it 's a mixture : people are falling into two types
the banks and the funds are certainly encouraging the staff to wear casual dress , but some are determined they wo n't cower to protestors and are still showing up in suits , " said @entity83 , publisher of @entity84
on monday , @entity92 quoted one @entity27 professional , @entity93 , 66 , who said : " we 're not pansies ... most of us have played rugby or boxed
" if any of those guys do get violent against us individually because we are wearing a suit , we will take action
" the site also offers humorous advice for bankers to respond to protestors by dumping " large blocks of ice " to " render them harmless , " and encouraging bankers to " find your inner @entity11 [ sic ] spot
" despite the jokes , precautions proved valuable wednesday as thousands of angry anti-capitalist protestors converged on the @entity27 for demonstrations to coincide with the @entity11 summit
by midday protestors had started smashing windows at a branch @entity116
earlier in the day 11 people were arrested after being stopped in an armored personnel carrier
thousands of police are continuing to patrol the streets in anti-riot gear .
