-- the backlash over @entity5 's cover photo of @entity7 bombing suspect @entity6 led to the release of new photos of his capture thursday , images a police photographer said show " the real @entity12 bomber
" in contrast to the tousle - haired , placid - looking 19 - year - old on the front of the magazine , the new pictures show @entity6 emerging from the boat where he was cornered -- his face smeared with blood , his skin ashen in the laser glow from snipers ' gun sights
in one , he pulls up his shirt , apparently showing he has no weapon underneath ; in another , he slumps across the deck of the trailered boat , his bloodied arm hanging down
the pictures were taken by @entity34 sgt. @entity33 and published online by @entity35 on thursday afternoon
@entity36 : fast facts in a statement accompanying the photos , @entity33 called the @entity5 cover " an insult " and " hurtful " to survivors of the april 15 bombings
" this guy is evil , " @entity33 said
" this is the real @entity12 bomber
not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of @entity5 magazine
" @entity49 , @entity35 's editor in chief , said the magazine has hundreds of similar photos and will publish more in its september issue
he said @entity33 was " conflicted on some level " about releasing the photos , but " genuinely worried " about how the @entity5 cover will affect the victims ' families
" i think he was also worried that certain impressionable people might be lured to replicate that by the kind of glamorous - looking photo that is on the @entity5 cover , " @entity49 told @entity0 's " @entity62
" woman gets new leg - and new life - after @entity12 bombings a @entity34 spokesman said that the agency had not authorized the photos ' release
" today 's dissemination to @entity35 of photographs of @entity76 suspect @entity77 and police activity related to his capture was not authorized by the @entity34 , " spokesman @entity71 said in a statement issued thursday night
" the department will not release the photographs to media outlets
the @entity34 will have no further comment on this matter tonight
" @entity71 told @entity0 late thursday night that @entity33 had been relieved of duty for one day and will have a status hearing to determine whether he will be on full duty , restricted duty or suspended during an internal police investigation
the hearing will likely be next week , @entity71 said
@entity33 could not be immediately reached for comment
@entity6 is awaiting trial on federal charges in the @entity7 bombings , which killed three people and wounded more than 260 on april 15
in addition , a @entity97 police officer was shot to death during the dramatic pursuit of @entity6 and his brother , @entity101 , who was killed during a gun battle with police
@entity6 has pleaded not guilty
did missed connections in murder case open door to @entity12 bombings ? @entity5 has defended its decision to profile @entity6 , whom the same cover called a " monster
" the magazine said the story " falls within the traditions of journalism and @entity5 's long - standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day
" but the cover photo has sparked fury on social media and prompted several retail chains to pull the issue from their racks
still , some people seemed eager to sell it
by thursday , the @entity128 auction website listed dozens of copies of the controversial edition of @entity5 for sale
@entity0 's @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .
