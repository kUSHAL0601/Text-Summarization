-- @entity1 may fall later this week , but as far as former @entity4 astronaut @entity3 and other @entity6 enthusiasts are concerned , the real story is happening elsewhere
astronaut @entity3 , shown after his @entity9 mission in 1971 , claims there " is no doubt we are being visited
" @entity3 , who was part of the 1971 @entity15 moon mission , asserted monday that extraterrestrial life exists , and that the truth is being concealed by the @entity18 and other governments
he delivered his remarks during an appearance at the @entity22 following the conclusion of the fifth annual @entity24 , a meeting of @entity6 activists and researchers studying the possibility of alien life forms
@entity30 has long wondered if we 're " alone in the universe
[ but ] only in our period do we really have evidence
no , we 're not alone , " @entity3 said
" our destiny , in my opinion , and we might as well get started with it , is [ to ] become a part of the planetary community
... we should be ready to reach out beyond our planet and beyond our solar system to find out what is really going on out there
" @entity3 grew up in @entity42 , @entity43 , which some @entity6 believers maintain was the site of a @entity6 crash in 1947
he said residents of his hometown " had been hushed and told not to talk about their experience by military authorities
" they had been warned of " dire consequences " if they did so
but , he claimed , they " did n't want to go to the grave with their story
they wanted to tell somebody reliable
and being a local boy and having been to the moon , they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story
" roughly 10 years ago , @entity3 claimed , he was finally given an appointment at @entity67 to discuss what he had been told
an unnamed admiral working for the @entity70 promised to uncover the truth behind the @entity42 story , @entity3 said
the stories of a @entity6 crash " were confirmed , " but the admiral was then denied access when he " tried to get into the inner workings of that process
" the same admiral , @entity3 claimed , now denies the story
" i urge those who are doubtful : read the books , read the lore , start to understand what has really been going on
because there really is no doubt we are being visited , " he said
" the universe that we live in is much more wondrous , exciting , complex and far - reaching than we were ever able to know up to this point in time
" a @entity4 spokesman denied any cover - up
" @entity4 does not track ufos
@entity4 is not involved in any sort of cover - up about alien life on this planet or anywhere else -- period , " @entity94 said monday
debates have continued about what happened at @entity42
the @entity103 said in 1994 that wreckage recovered there in 1947 was most likely from a balloon - launched classified government project
@entity107 , head of the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) , which hosted the @entity110 , said that the truth about extraterrestrial life is being suppressed because it is politically explosive
" there is a third rail [ in @entity18 politics ] , and that is the @entity6 question
it is many magnitudes more radioactive than @entity120 ever dreamed to be , " @entity107 said .
