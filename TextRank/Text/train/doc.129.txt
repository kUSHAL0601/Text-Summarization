@entity0 , @entity1 -- a controversial gun measure wo n't become law in @entity1 after a push to override the governor 's veto fell one vote short of approval in the state 's @entity10 on wednesday
the measure , @entity13 436 , would have essentially nullified federal gun laws in the state
senators voted 22 - 12 in favor of overriding gov. @entity19 's veto , but the vote fell just short of the two thirds majority required to pass
earlier wednesday , the state 's @entity21 voted 109 - 49 in favor of overriding the veto
if it had passed , the law would have technically not only let residents own a machine gun but also arrested federal agents if they tried to take it away
the bill also would have made it illegal for anyone to publish any information about a gun owner
the legislation passed earlier this year in @entity1 's @entity36 - led @entity21 and @entity10 but vetoed by @entity19 , a @entity37
@entity19 argued that the legislation violated a provision in the @entity40 called the @entity41
the @entity41 gives preference to federal laws over state laws
lawmakers had argued that what they were proposing was not only constitutional but essential to protect the rights of gun owners
" there are people saying this is the same as seceding from the @entity53 , " said gun owner @entity49
" @entity1 did not secede from the @entity53 in 1862 , and it does not do so by passing this law
" @entity55 recall a proxy in national gun control debate what the bill said " this bill does n't put one new gun on the street , " said state rep. @entity59 , a @entity36
" it strictly says that @entity1 is going to protect the @entity65 rights of @entity66
" by superseding federal regulations , @entity67 would have made it a criminal offense to enforce background checks or to publish the name and address of a gun owner in the state
it would also have technically allowed citizens to own a machine gun , which is banned under federal regulations , according to the governor 's office
and it would have nullified federal gun laws and allowed citizens to take legal action against officers who try to enforce them
gun permits for the blind ? @entity90 grants them , stirs debate opponents worry @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 have pursued similar bills in recent months in reaction to attempts at federal gun control legislation after the december shootings at @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105
opponents worry such laws could all but end any joint operations between local and federal law enforcement agencies when it comes to taking guns off the streets
@entity114 police chief @entity113 has been one of its most vocal opponents
" ( we are ) basically saying to criminals , ' ok criminals , it 's ok to come to @entity1
we wo n't prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law , ' " he said
@entity2 's @entity124 reported from @entity125 , @entity1 ; @entity126 from @entity127 .
