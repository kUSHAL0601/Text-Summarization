a 34 - year - old man being sought in a woman 's death has been arrested in connection with the killings of two homeless men who were shot three days apart while both were sleeping on sidewalks , @entity1 police said friday
@entity11 was in custody , but police were n't providing further details about his arrest , said sgt. @entity16
@entity11 , of @entity1 , also was wanted by police in @entity18 , @entity19 , in the fatal shooting saturday night of a 44 - year - old woman whose body was found behind an office building , according to police and @entity26 affiliate @entity25
an arrest warrant for @entity11 was issued in the @entity31 case , @entity18 police sgt. @entity27 said friday
" we are actively working with multiple agencies at this time and can not provide any further information that may jeopardize ongoing investigations , " @entity32 said
@entity39 , a hair stylist in @entity40 , was shot shortly after she left a restaurant in downtown @entity18 , the affiliate reported
true salon , where @entity43 worked , said on its @entity45 page friday that " while we are relieved to hear that a suspect is in custody , we are still trying to comprehend this senseless act of violence that took a very special person from our lives
" @entity11 or his attorneys could n't be immediately reached for comment friday
@entity1 police called the shootings of homeless men " sinister " because whoever pulled the trigger was n't expecting to gain from the victims monetarily
" a lot of our shootings involve robbery
a lot of our shootings involve someone making good on an old debt or some kind of revenge factor , " @entity1 police detective @entity62 told reporters earlier this week
" i do n't know why someone would shoot two defenseless men
" the shootings happened during @entity72 week , within three days of each other
three days , 3 miles apart in the homeless men case , the first shooting took place november 23
@entity77 , 42 , was fatally shot five times as he slept , wrapped in a blanket , on a sidewalk in downtown @entity1
less than three days later , @entity81 , 64 , did n't show up as normal at a recycling center where he took cans and other scrap metals to sell
@entity81 , known locally as " @entity86 " was found dead under a bridge where he usually slept
his body , also wrapped in a blanket , had seven gunshot wounds
he was killed less than three miles from @entity77
" they never came out of the sleep they were already in , " @entity62 said
" they were n't fleeing , running
they were asleep when they took these rounds
" telling details police say evidence links the killings of the homeless men
the rounds used in both shootings are fairly distinctive : .45 - caliber bullets that , according to @entity62 , have n't been made since 2010
they were fired from revolvers , either a @entity107 " or a @entity109 " governor
" that reveals another troubling fact
" these guns have a capacity of five or six rounds , " @entity62 said
but @entity81 , the second victim , had been shot seven times
" someone had to reload the gun in order to get seven rounds in him
