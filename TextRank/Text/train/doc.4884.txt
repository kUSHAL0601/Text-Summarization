-- the " mommy war " between stay - at - home and working mothers is in danger of being overshadowed by another maddening contest : the one between mothers in the @entity4 and @entity5
two recent books , @entity10 's " @entity15 " and @entity17 's " @entity16 , " make the case that @entity5 parents raise kids who behave and eat far better than their @entity4 counterparts
this month , the @entity19 debut of the @entity21 bestseller by @entity5 philosopher @entity22 , " the conflict : how modern motherhood undermines the status of women , " is already causing a stir
@entity22 argues that overwhelming numbers of @entity5 mamans manage to work full - time and have several kids because they have n't succumbed to intensive ideals of motherhood , most of all @entity4 - style " natural mothering
" think extended breastfeeding , nonmedicalized birth , co-sleeping , and cloth diapers
commentators are already jumping on @entity22 's polemic as mommy war fodder
does @entity40 oppress women ? is the environmental movement , or feminism , to blame ? it 's been a busy season indeed for chroniclers of the faux mommy wars
but as usual , that war is more farce than reality
the global battle between mamans and mamas , just as the one between stay - at - home and working moms , is largely staged
the sometimes jazzy headlines -- such as " the conflict attacks progressive parenting as anti-feminist " on april 10 in the @entity61 -- do a disservice to the complex lives of women
creating two categories of mothers pits one against the other , and obscures the way traditional mommy - dividing categories often overlap
women frequently opt in and out and back from paid work
conversations about that fabricated domestic war and the latest international one obscure real differences linked to factors such as class and education
and of course , " @entity5 " and " @entity4 " simplify the lives of millions of mothers in both countries
if , instead , we actually read these books , we would realize that these authors are trying to offer solutions to the same problems in different ways
we admit it 's hardly as sexy as the @entity91 - @entity90 showdown , whereby stay - at - home motherhood became partisan fodder after the @entity95 strategist @entity91 criticized @entity96 for turning to his wife , who has " never worked a day in her life , " for counsel on the economic issues working mothers face
but we ought to slow down long enough to hear what these authors say before pulling our guns
there are kernels of wisdom here
@entity22 , for example , wants all women ( and particularly those who are @entity5 ) to resist ideals of mothering that view women as the primary , more " natural " caregiver , which can make it all the more difficult to balance motherhood with work and a full , adult life
we applaud the way she asks us to examine these intensive ideals of motherhood and their reach
no woman should feel shame because she fails to breastfeed or give birth without an epidural
more fundamentally , we agree that care - giving should n't be the province of women alone
we disagree with @entity22 , however , that the obstacles are merely in our heads
we think they 're in political structures , too
despite @entity22 dismissing as irrelevant the @entity5 policies that make health care and day care accessible and affordable , here in the @entity4 , we lack such support for parents , mothers in particular , who work and do the second shift at home
the battle for @entity144 stations and flextime seems a worthier cause than the trumped - up war between those who breastfeed and those who do n't
surely natural mothering practices would not be so oppressive and disadvantageous to women if we set up society to accommodate them
and while we 're on it , the focus on breasts is a diversion
as a mother said in an interview when @entity22 's book came out in @entity5 , the real conflict is not between the mother and the woman , but the woman and the company
when @entity22 rejects breastfeeding so mothers can retain their sexuality , one could argue she is merely replacing the tyranny of " breasts for bébé " for the tyranny of " breasts for men
" still , @entity22 has good points , and we should n't be so offended as to let the criticism of our parenting overshadow the reality that we , in the @entity4 , have a long way to go
perhaps there is something to @entity4 mothers ' nostalgia for the @entity5 way of life , like authors @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity10 , all who have raised children in @entity5
you do n't have to be an anthropologist to know that other cultural perspectives can shed light on how we 've constructed particular ideals of motherhood and family , how our government and workplaces value -- or do n't value -- motherhood
perhaps the @entity5 experience might be a reminder that , with a revolution , structures can , and do , change
the solution to the challenges of @entity4 parenting is hardly as simple as making children eat spinach , or privileging disposable diapers over cloth
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .
