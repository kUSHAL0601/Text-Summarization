-- the @entity1 is available on three major carriers , leaving potential buyers to wonder whether @entity4 , @entity5 or @entity6 is the better network choice
pricing plans aside , carrier quality is a significant factor in anyone 's purchasing decision , and now consumers have hard data to help them choose : a just - released study reports @entity4 is tops for fast data speeds , while @entity5 is the most reliable when it comes to making phone calls
@entity6 's main draw is that it offers unlimited , albeit slow , data
the study was performed by @entity22 , a mobile device performance analytics firm
to test network performance , @entity24 made 6,000 voice calls , conducted 8,000 data download / upload tests ( both moving and stationary ) , and downloaded more than 21,000 web pages
the tests found that @entity5 dropped calls 2.1 percent of the time , while @entity4 dropped 2.8 percent of calls and @entity6 lost 3.7 percent of calls
the average dropped - call rate for the entire mobile industry is 1.4 percent
although @entity6 dropped the most calls , it had the highest call quality on the uplink ( outbound calls ) , while @entity4 had the best downlink call quality ( inbound calls )
with regard to maximum data speeds , @entity4 led the pack at @entity47 , with @entity5 a distant second at @entity49 , and @entity6 crawling in last with only @entity50
it 's unclear , however , exactly where @entity52 tested data bandwidth , and as any @entity1 - toting @entity56 resident will tell you , data quality can be terrible in areas with high concentrations of tech geeks
the original @entity1 launched exclusively with @entity4 , which was the sole carrier of the @entity1 until @entity62 announced that @entity5 would also begin carrying the @entity1 in january 2011
prior to the launch of the @entity1 , rumors swirled that the phone would land on @entity6 , and ultimately proved true
of the three carriers , @entity6 is the only one that provides a true unlimited data plan
@entity52 's results are consistent with what we found back when @entity5 began offering the @entity1 : @entity4 offered better download speeds , while @entity5 had better coverage
another important stat @entity24 found was that the @entity1 performed perfectly across all three networks when it came to data task reliability
in short , 100 percent of the time , the phone was able to complete web - page loads , stationary downloads , and stationary uploads
this contrasts with an earlier @entity52 study from march 2011 that found @entity5 had a higher download success rate when the phone was stationary , and @entity4 had a higher rate while the phone was moving
so what 's the bottom line ? it looks like you 're going to get a relatively positive data - downloading experience no matter which carrier you choose , if only because you will be able to download data
but if you value downloading material quickly , you should go with @entity4
if call reliability is paramount , stick with @entity5 , and if you want to use a lot of data but do n't care about speed , go with @entity6
