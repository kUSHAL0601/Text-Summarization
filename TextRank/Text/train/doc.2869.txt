since 2008 , @entity1 's annual jamboree honoring the world 's best player has been dominated by just two names
@entity6 , @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity8
monday saw @entity9 and @entity10 superstar @entity8 crowned as winner of the @entity12 for a second year in a row
it came as scant surprise , given his club 's phenomenal form in 2014 that saw the return of @entity20 trophy -- and with it the coveted " decima , " or tenth @entity24 triumph -- to the @entity25
" it has been an incredible year , " he said at the awards ceremony
" i would like to continue the work that i have done so far
i want to try to improve , to become better as each day goes by
" i never thought that i would bring this trophy back home on three occasions
i want to become one of the greatest players of all time
" top of their game this seven - year duopoly reflects the importance of these two supreme athletes on the game , and allows us to see how lucky we are to be able to witness the long summers of two of the finest players to ever grace the sport
and part of the fascination lies in how different the two men are
debating the relative merits of @entity8 and his great rival @entity7 , talismans of @entity10 and @entity51 , respectively , has been something of a parlor game in recent years
it 's easy to compare and contrast , at least superficially
on the one hand , the improbable , mercurial talent of the shaggy haired , oddly stooped figure of @entity7 , confusing defenders as much as inspiring his teammates to a higher level
on the other : @entity8
a glistening , taut mass of muscle , neck like a tree trunk , powering forward relentlessly
he looks like he was created in a lab or a high tech factory ; a @entity70 , the ultimate footballer
media matters the two could n't be much more different , in style and , if you are to believe the majority of the media , likability
@entity8 has suffered the slings and arrows of a largely hostile press for much of his career , starting as a foal - limbed teen in @entity84 , where he was often derided as a " show pony , " for elaborate and unnecessary tricks , and -- a sin in the @entity89 game -- diving to win free kicks and penalties
the negativity followed him to @entity10 and a then - record transfer fee
it is largely @entity10 's cheerleading press , @entity97 and @entity98 , that give him a free pass ; the rest of the global sporting media grudgingly accept his gifts , but are quick to level criticism when they feel it due
he 's often seen as a ball - hog , a selfish player who would rather shoot than pass to a teammate
that he has taken at least 10 shots at goal in nine matches does n't exactly banish the perception
that his fellow " galactico " @entity112 would have the temerity to take a shot ( and miss ) in a recent liga game rather than pass to @entity6 , as the virtuoso has styled himself , earned him a withering look from the @entity9 master , and the opprobrium of fans
off the field , his reticence to engage the media -- a symptom , it is said , of his shyness -- has been interpreted as haughty and arrogant
@entity7 , on the other hand , who also eschews media coverage has typically been viewed as humble and self - effacing -- although recent tax and locker room scandals threaten to change that
phenomenal 2014 but the stats do n't lie , and with the phenomenal return of 61 goals from 60 appearances ( 42 in 30 @entity141 games alone ) during 2014 , it 's hard not to give credit to this year 's winner
he reached the 400 - goal milestone for club and country ( in 653 appearances ) in january , he is a footballing genius , and had he stood alone -- his yin unopposed by @entity7 's yang -- he would no doubt be already talked of as one of the all - time greats
as it stands , he 's talking about that honor in aspirational terms , as a goal ; he 's spent most of his career battling comparisons
he 's also developed in leaps and bounds since his 2008 @entity12 trophy , refined his unquestionable talent since he first grinned on that @entity1 stage
he 's far more mature ; gone are the unnecessary stepovers and ( almost ) the petulance
to complement this , he long ago inherited an undimmable desire to win from his old mentor , @entity169 , and he burns with passion and a need to score
that 's only become more evident as he grows into the complete player he has developed into over the past couple of years
and along with his natural ability , he 's long been an indefatigable , consummate professional who gives everything he has until the final whistle , and that 's what has fueled his work - and goal - rate in 2014
he still takes a lot of shots , sure , but when " @entity8 does n't score , " on the rare occasions that he walks away from a match without netting a goal is the headline , maybe he 's right to do so
certainly his @entity10 coach , @entity188 , does n't begrudge him the efforts
@entity190 woes ? @entity192 's irrepressible keeper @entity191 -- who was a distant outlier for the @entity12 this year -- may feel aggrieved that his superlative @entity190 went unnoticed in voting
indeed , @entity195 won the award 's predecessor , the @entity198 in 2006 , off the back of his considerable influence captaining @entity201 to 2006 @entity190 glory
but while he had a largely anonymous @entity190 , it would be difficult to deny that , year round , it has been @entity6 's year
and , like the man or not , no one should begrudge him his time at the pinnacle .
