about halfway up the cobblestone stairwell , the screeching starts
loose stones tumble from the tops of the walls far up on the hilltop
all around me , tree limbs shake
it 's just after dawn , and i 'm alone , climbing the trail to the 15th - century royal compound on the hilltop at @entity13 in southern @entity14
alone , except for the baboons
like all the stone structures here , the stairwell is open to the sky , but the incline is so steep and the curves so sharp that i ca n't see more than 10 feet in front of me
sure enough , around the next bend a baboon is waiting for me on one of the dozens of terraces that skirt the hillside
we watch each other for a few moments until i 'm certain he 's not interested in me , and then i keep walking
baboons freak me out , but these moments are part of what makes @entity13 such an incredible place to visit
baboon standoffs unlike the world 's more visited ruins -- which is basically every other ruin -- here it 's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place , even if that means the occasional standoff with a baboon
the stairwell leads to a narrow passage through a cleft in the rocky hilltop
stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead
they once would 've extended even farther out over the stairs , but a terrace collapsed since the city was abandoned , bringing a wall down with it
it 's hard to find a vantage point to see the entire complex
the old city , which was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s , stretches over 1,800 acres
essentially the hilltop functioned as a palace and cathedral , the center of political and religious power
on the planes below , circular stone walls form a series of enclosures
the most iconic , aptly called the @entity77 , is the largest pre-colonial structure south of the @entity79
the walls rise up 36 feet and stretch 820 feet around
at one end , an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a conical tower , the most distinctive landmark in the old city
i like the hill complex more
here the walls curve around each other and the granite boulders , which are incorporated into the design
different chambers are linked by a labyrinth of narrow passages that snake up and down over the giant rocks
at the far side is a chamber with a towering stone ledge that once held a small stone wall that acted like a balustrade
destructive treasure hunters like all the structures here , the stones were assembled without mortar
each layer was slightly recessed , creating a slope that held it all together
over the centuries , some walls were knocked down by treasure hunters , or just by the elements
the chamber below is where a famous set of carved birds were found
most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park , which is worth a visit if only to see them
the image of a bird appears on the national flag , and is as much a symbol of @entity13 's national identity as the @entity126 is to the @entity127
there 's a good chance of being here alone
visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class , or the occasional park worker , but not many other visitors
tourism in @entity13 has been in a long and slow recovery
in the 1990s , @entity13 was for a moment the most visited country in @entity14
by the time the nation hit rock bottom in 2008 , hardly any foreign visitors came
now major attractions like @entity142 are bouncing back , but places like @entity13 have fallen far off the radar
the ruins are easily accessible by road , but it takes several hours from @entity148 or a full day from @entity149 , so not many people make the effort
but this is a place i love returning to
expert tours in the colonial days when @entity13 was known as @entity156 , white families used to vacation here , and remnants of those days remain
the national park has simple rondavel huts for hire , and there 's the dated but charming @entity163 ( @entity13 , @entity164 ; +263 39 262274 ) just outside the gates , as well as the posher safari - style lodge at the @entity167 ( no 1 shephared plot , @entity13 , @entity164 ; +1 888 790 5264 )
the inn 's restaurant -- where the buffet is designed like the stone walls -- serves lucky travelers fresh bream from the nearby dam
if not , there 's almost always a fisherman selling his catch on the roadside , which can be grilled outdoors -- or ask the restaurant to prepare it
on my latest trip , i went with an excursion organized by @entity183 at the @entity184 in @entity149
those going on their own can hire a guide on site
every guide i 've ever had here has been articulate and charming and well - informed , but it 's even more amazing to spend a few days exploring the ruins with people who actually wrote the book on @entity13
you can find their offerings at wsoa.wits.ac.za , under history of art. practical tips : @entity13 has started an online visa system ( @entity202 / ) , which is n't working at the time of this writing
when it does , applying online will get visitors a letter that they must present on arrival , which is when the visa is actually issued
those that require a visa might be better off simply getting it on arrival
anyone driving up from @entity216 can save themselves a lot of hassle at the border by contacting the @entity221 ahead of time
they can arrange to have an officer to wait at the border post and walk visitors through the immigration and customs process
this can save hours and endless headaches
and it 's a free service ( @entity233 at +263 772 409373 or lindarosentuli@gmail.com )
@entity234 is a writer and traveler based in @entity216
his latest project is a travel app for @entity239 cities for @entity240 and @entity241 .
