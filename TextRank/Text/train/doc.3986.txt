@entity0 -- a suspect is in custody after a man punched a young woman in the head , dragged her by the ankles and threw her onto train tracks this week , a @entity3 spokeswoman said friday
@entity11 , of @entity12 , faces assault , robbery , theft and reckless endangerment charges , said @entity17 , the @entity3 spokeswoman
the suspect is thought to be between 25 and 30 years old , she said
the attack occurred around 3:30 p.m. tuesday in @entity12 's @entity20 , after a man approached a 23 - year - old woman and asked her for a lighter
they were the only people at the @entity25 streets stop , @entity17 said
a surveillance camera captured the assault
it shows the man attacking the woman and pulling her off a bench , her back hitting the floor as he slides her toward the tracks
she manages to stand at the edge of the platform just before he hurls her off
" i started trying to fight him back as much as i could , " the victim told @entity1 affiliate @entity39
" after it was over , the first thing that popped in my head was my son
" unlike two incidents in @entity0 last month -- one in which a man was crushed by a train after a heated argument , and another in which a woman pushed a man onto the tracks , possibly because she believed he was @entity54 or @entity55 -- this victim escaped
she " managed to climb off the tracks , suffering only minor bruises and scrapes , " @entity17 , said
after the attack , the man , who is thought to be homeless , took the victim 's cell phone and left the subway station
police say they increased manpower in stations but withheld the video of the attack from the public because the attacker was wearing a jacket with a distinctive logo , and police hoped he would n't discard the jacket
@entity11 was taken into custody thursday afternoon , wearing a jacket with the @entity78 logo on the back , @entity17 said
police are seeking a motive but say they believe the attacker could be mentally unstable .
