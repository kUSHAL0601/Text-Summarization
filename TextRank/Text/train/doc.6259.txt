-- with news that @entity3 is buying the movie rights to an upcoming biography of @entity7 co-founder @entity6 , speculation has jumped to who could play the late tech mastermind
quoting anonymous sources , the @entity10 and other media outlets were reporting that @entity3 is in final talks and will pay $ 1 million for the rights to the book , which traces @entity6 ' story from college dropout to ceo of the world 's leading tech company
@entity21 announced last week that , based on the surge of interest in @entity6 following his death last week , it would move the release date of the authorized biography , " @entity6 " by @entity27 , from november 21 to october 24
capturing the iconoclastic @entity6 on the written page is not easy
but finding the right actor to bring him to life onscreen might be an even bigger challenge
" when you 're casting somebody to play someone that is familiar to audiences , you 're never going to get somebody that is going to look exactly like them , " said @entity32 , casting director at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35
" so you have to get at the sort of internal essence of the person
you have to get their energy
" think @entity50 as @entity51 , or more recently , @entity49 as @entity52
with a @entity6 biopic , there 's the added difficulty of finding someone who can play him both as a young man starting @entity7 in his parents ' garage with partner @entity61 , and as the 50ish ceo who captivated audiences three decades later with high - profile launches of the @entity65 and @entity66
and then there 's the dramatic weight loss @entity6 saw in his final years as he battled pancreatic cancer
the first name that came to @entity32 's mind was an actor that could capture @entity6 in his later years : @entity73
" i think physically there 's a resemblance , " she said of the veteran character actor from " @entity76 " and other films
" and i think @entity73 always plays very bright , articulate men
i think that really speaks to who @entity6 was
" going younger , she mentions another , perhaps less - likely choice : " @entity86 's " @entity85
" he does n't really look like him , but he does n't really look like anybody he plays and he pulls it off , " she said of the actor who has mimicked another tech titan , @entity90 's @entity89 , on " snl
" in a quick brainstorming session , @entity32 threw out a list of other possibilities : @entity97 from " @entity98
" " heroes " alum @entity99
we think that one was a joke )
" you could kind of go down the list and find a lot of people who probably could do it , " @entity32 said
" nobody is going to be exactly him
but it 's got to be somebody who 's right -- who 's got an intensity to them
" @entity6 has already been portrayed on screen once -- by " @entity122 's " @entity120 in a 1999 made - for - tv movie , " @entity123
" of course , to cast @entity6 ' life story today you 'd also need another actor to play the shorter , stouter @entity61
some first - instinct suggestions : @entity128 , @entity129 or @entity130
in the gallery above , we 've collected 10 actors who could bring something interesting to the role
does one of them work for you ? did we leave out an obvious choice ? let us know in the comments .
