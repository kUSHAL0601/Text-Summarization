-- @entity3 , who took rock ' n ' roll into dark corners as a songwriter , vocalist and guitarist for the @entity10 and as a solo artist , died sunday , his publicist said
the publicist , @entity12 , confirmed @entity3 's death but released no details
@entity3 had undergone a liver transplant in may , his wife , the musician / performance artist @entity15 , disclosed over the summer
@entity3 was a rock pioneer who went from record label songwriter to a member of the short - lived but innovative and influential @entity10
the band and @entity3 's solo work tackled taboo topics like drug addiction , paranoia and sexual deviancy in songs that were largely spare , muscular and often saturated in feedback
" @entity3 's influence is one that there are really only a tiny handful of other figures who you can compare to him , " said @entity29 , a senior editor at @entity30
" he spoke incredibly frankly about the realities of being an artist , being a person who lived life on one 's own terms
he did n't prettify things
he did n't sugarcoat things
he showed life as it really is and that 's something that made him a true original , and one of our great all - time artists , " he said
@entity3 , violist / keyboard player @entity53 , guitarist @entity54 and drummer @entity55 played their first show as the @entity10 in 1965 and soon drew the attention of pop artist @entity59 , who became their manager
rock mythology has it that even though the group sold few albums , everyone who bought one started a band
" we had fans who made us realize it was worth it , " @entity69 told @entity0
" but when we were together , actively , we did n't have a big splash like the @entity75 or whatever
" opinion : rockers stand in @entity3 's shadow nevertheless , @entity30 ranks the group 's debut album , " @entity81 , " as the 13th greatest of all time
tunes like " @entity84 , " from the group 's 1970 album " loaded , " have become rock standards
performers from @entity89 to @entity90 and @entity91 have cited them as inspiration , and the @entity10 was inducted into the @entity94 in 1996
" the world has lost a fine songwriter and poet
i 've lost my ' school - yard buddy , ' " @entity53 wrote on @entity98
@entity69 called @entity3 " generous , encouraging and thoughtful
" working with him " sometimes could be trying " to some people , but " never to me
" " i guess we learned from each other
we all learned from each other , " she said
in 1970 , @entity3 left the @entity105 for a long solo career
he had his only top 40 hit with " @entity113 , " from the @entity89 - produced 1972 album " @entity109 , " and @entity30 put both that album and 1973 's " @entity111 " on its top 500 list
@entity3 " was one of the first artists to experiment with guitar feedback on record and to show that sort of ugly noise can actually be quite beautiful and moving
he also , lyrically , wrote about all kinds of topics that were taboo before he started exploring them , " said @entity29
he also gave a voice to gay and transgender people in a way that had never been done before by a popular artist , which made his work incredibly important to many people , @entity29 said
in 1982 , @entity3 told the @entity131 that his goal was n't just to make music , but create literature
" people say rock ' n ' roll is constricting , but you can do anything you want , any way you want , '' he said
" and my goal has been to make an album that would speak to people the way @entity144 speaks to me , the way @entity145 speaks to me
something with that kind of power ; something with bite to it
" and @entity69 said @entity3 " influenced probably millions of people into maybe reading more , into playing music
" " when i have been on tour , there have been kids from 15 years old to 60 years old commenting on how they were influenced by @entity3 and the @entity105 , " she said
the rock band the @entity158 wrote on their @entity98 page , " @entity160 ...
" @entity162 wrote simply : " devastating news
" @entity3 won a @entity164 in 1998 for best long - form music video , for a documentary on his career up to that point
@entity169 , president and ceo of @entity171 , called him " an exceptionally gifted singer , songwriter , and musician who has had a profound impact on rock music and our culture , " " we have lost a true visionary and creative leader , and his groundbreaking work will forever hold its rightful place in music history , " @entity169 said
people we lost in 2013 @entity0 's @entity184 contributed to this report .
