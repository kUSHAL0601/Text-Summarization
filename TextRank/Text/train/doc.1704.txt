-- the tornado that tore through the @entity3 suburbs this week ranks among the strongest storms ever to strike the @entity5 , packing powerful winds that topped 200 mph
officials from the @entity8 gave the tornado that hit @entity10 on monday a preliminary @entity12 rating -- the highest score on the scale that measures tornado intensities
the @entity12 scale uses the physical damage caused by the storm to estimate how fast the wind was blowing
opinion : how can we be safe from tornadoes ? teams are still evaluating the destruction , and the rating released tuesday is preliminary
so far , they 've found that the tornado spanned 1.3 miles -- the length of more than 22 football fields lined up end - to - end -- carving a 17 - mile path of destruction
damage assessments show that the tornado was an @entity12 for at least some of the time it was ravaging the area near @entity3
@entity3 mayor @entity37 did n't mince words tuesday when he described what he saw
" we 're talking levels of debris that 's 4 feet high , as far as you can see
and we 're talking about cars that are upside - down and school books and children 's toys and trees without bark , " he said
" this was the storm of storms
" tornado prediction is improving , scientists say as officials continue to assess the damage , here are @entity0 senior meteorologist @entity56 's responses to some key questions about the storm : what are @entity12 storms ? storms now used the @entity12 scale , or ef scale , which is based on damage , which than translates to estimated winds
@entity12 storms are the strongest storms on @entity68 , with winds of over 200 mph
how frequent are @entity12 storms ? you can go years without an @entity12 tornado
in fact , since 1950 this is only the 59th tornado on record that has reached that threshold
how frequent are storms of this strength in this area ? while @entity12 storms are rare , the area in the @entity81 known as " @entity82 " is a focus for when this happens
there also seems to be a focus for strong tornadoes in an area known as " @entity89 , " which covers parts of the @entity91 and includes @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95
opinion : the making of a nightmare tornado what factors give rise to a storm of this strength ? a number of factors have to come together at the right time and place to produce a strong tornado
the clash of warm and cold air at the surface combined with lift in the atmosphere and strong winds both at the ground and high above help contribute
the greater the temperature differences and the winds , the greater the chance for supercells , or the thunderstorms that produce tornadoes
deadliest tornadoes on record how long does it take to assess the strength of a storm ? why does it take so long ? after a tornado , the local @entity8 office sends a team to take a look at the damage
in this case , the @entity132 , @entity133 , office sent numerous teams in the field to evaluate damage
since this storm path was 17 miles long and the damage path was so wide , it takes time to see all of the damage
some people are calling this the strongest storm ever
is that accurate ? crews are still surveying the damage
the strongest tornado on record to date struck @entity10 in 1999
it had winds recorded at 318 mph at 300 feet above the earth 's surface
at the surface , officials estimated winds were at 250 mph
the estimated winds of this week 's storm are 200 - 210 mph , but survey teams are still evaluating
it 's safe to say this is one of the strongest tornadoes
@entity10 in bull 's - eye twice , science may know why @entity0 's @entity165 contributed to this report .
