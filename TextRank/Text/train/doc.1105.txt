-- president @entity1 knows we live in a two - tiered @entity3
in july , the president , who is himself an example of how anyone can or should be able make it in the @entity7 , went on the road to make the point over and over again that the nation 's widening gap between rich and poor is tearing at the very fabric of society
" even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits , " the president said in prepared remarks delivered in @entity15 , " nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 %
" " i will seize any opportunity i can find , " he told the @entity20 later that month , " to work with @entity22 to strengthen the middle class , improve their prospects , improve their security
" any opportunity ? ok , then
here 's one : how about paying your interns ? as @entity33 , a former unpaid @entity32 intern herself , reports for @entity35 , the @entity32 is coming under pressure from groups like the @entity38 to pay the college students who work 9 - to - 6 jobs ( at least ) for no money
@entity33 told me it cost her " a couple thousand dollars " to take a @entity32 internship in 2010
" think about it , " she said
" you 're there for three months
you 're relocating to a new city
you have to pay rent
you have to pay transportation costs to and from the @entity32
" plus : she had to buy a suit
ca n't afford an internship ? try asking for donations " you have to be able to afford to be a @entity32 intern
" maybe intern pay and the health of the middle class , on first glance , seem unrelated
i saw a few tweets saying it 's no big thing that the @entity32 does n't pay interns
" no. it 's called ' paying your dues , ' " one woman wrote
" give school credit or something ! " but internships are an important ( maybe essential ) part of the modern @entity74 Â©
without one , it 's difficult to find some of the most desirable and high - paying jobs
@entity33 , for example , said her @entity32 internship has come up in pretty much every job interview she 's done
and she says it probably got her into graduate school
potential interns who ca n't cough up thousands of dollars in living expenses are left out of the mix , or have a much harder time making the situation livable , meaning the best internships and the best jobs are more likely to go to the upper middle class and rich
it 's just one of many ways middle - class and poor @entity3 are being left behind in the age of income inequality
the system seems rigged to ensure that wealthier @entity3 have a much better chance at success than their poorer counterparts
there are always great rags - to - riches examples that defy this trend
our pop culture eats that stuff up
but statistics paint a more sobering picture : only 9.5 % of kids born into the bottom income quintile in @entity109 will rise to the top fifth of earners , according to a recent study from @entity113 and the @entity114
the numbers are even worse in cities like @entity117 and @entity118
with college expenses skyrocketing and internships offering young workers little or no compensation , it 's no wonder it 's becoming more difficult to climb out of poverty and into the middle class
" when the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart , it undermines the very essence of @entity3
" yep , that 's @entity1 , again
the @entity32 is n't alone in offering an unpaid internship program -- and internships are far from being responsible for @entity3 's gap between rich and poor
opinion : you do n't have to be an unpaid intern ( @entity0 , for those who are wondering , does pay its interns )
but the executive branch could use this opportunity to make a statement about equality of opportunity in @entity3 by offering paid internships , as many others do
not everybody can be like @entity147 , which , according to the site @entity149 , pays some interns $ 6,800 per month
but look at the news site @entity152 , which made headlines when it started a @entity155 page to raise $ 22,000 to hire an intern to write stories about internships
there are ways to make this work financially
meanwhile , the @entity38 is right to point out the hypocrisy of the @entity163 lobbying for a higher minimum wage while paying some of its young workers nothing at all
the president can set an important example on this
hard work should be rewarded with fair pay
and the playing field for new workers should be as level as possible
otherwise , we 're just encouraging the rich - poor gap to grow
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity178 .
