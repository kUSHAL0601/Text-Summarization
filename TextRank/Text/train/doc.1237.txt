@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was hard to come by in @entity0 , @entity1 , tuesday
the sky still looked menacing , dark and foggy
from the air , this suburb outside @entity9 looked like flattened cardboard
on the ground , homes were messes of splinters
cars , thrown like toys , sat in ridiculous places
hunks of steel hung in trees -- the trees that were left
most were shaved down to gnarly apocalyptic wishbones
when people were allowed back on their street -- if emergency crews gave them the green light -- that 's when the real trauma set in for many
it 's bizarre and disorienting when every landmark and sign your eye knows is suddenly gone and there 's miles of nothing in its place
" it 's funny when you ca n't tell your own stuff when you get back and look at it like this , " @entity38 said , standing in the rubble that used to be his house
water is out and volunteers are handing out bottles
the twister is gone but the danger is still real
gas lines are being checked
crews are out searching for live wires
" it was horrible , " recalled one elderly woman , sitting in a chair near piles of debris
" the thunder and the sound was like a turning of the world
it was so bad but we were in the cellar right out there
you could hear the thing just blowin ' , hear the pounding
" i ca n't even believe i 'm still alive
" the realization of the loss of material things is just beginning
family heirlooms might not ever be found
how to help but there is worse
rescue workers are still trying to find survivors , as reports keep coming in about those missing
wearing a thick red hoodie , @entity81 looked intensely worried and lost in thought as he told a @entity2 reporter that a wrestler on his son 's wrestling team was missing
" it 's hard , " he muttered , looking like he has n't been to sleep
the death toll was 24 , according to @entity9 medical examiner spokeswoman @entity91
nine of the dead are children , she said
frantic kids and parents on monday evening , kids screamed for their parents and parents hollered their children 's names , walking and searching in panic in a parking lot near @entity104
" @entity105 ! @entity105 ! " one woman could be heard screaming , as another woman , her face bloody , walked zombie - like through the crowd , holding a young boy 's hand
" step over the wire ! " someone shouted
adults and children zigzagged past each other
one man went to a little boy standing alone , whose face was just then cracking into a full - out cry
the man put his arm around the child and they both looked out into the chaotic parking lot , apparently searching for the boy 's parents
one mother who spotted her son sitting with his teacher on a curb gently grabbed the boy 's hands and stood him up and then learned her whole body over him , hugging him
she cried and then laughed and cupped his face
" he was so brave ! " the teacher said
the mother then embraced the teacher
" thank you , " she wept , " thank you
" @entity142 , who showed up to help at the school , held his arm up and shouted , " 5th graders ! " but , of course , parents and kids continued to wander , desperate , scared
it was a valiant effort though -- trying to offer order where none could be found
three hours of emotional torture @entity152 was trapped at work , unable to get on the road because of downed power lines
she texted , desperate for news about her two boys at a day - care center
it was next to @entity104 , which @entity152 knew was badly damaged
" those three hours where i did n't hear anything , they were the longest three hours of my life , " she said
" knowing i 'd never see them again
no mother should ever have to go through that
" but she did see them again , thanks to a teacher who covered her 3 - year - old and 6 - week - old with a mattress and her body
@entity173 suffered a head wound and an ear injury
his baby brother ? unscathed
" it 's a miracle , an absolute miracle , " said @entity177 , one of the boys ' grandfathers
a day after the 200 - mph twister knocked down his building , @entity173 was in a playful mood , happily reunited with his family
when asked what happened to the day - care facility , he said , " broke ! " no one at the center was killed , officials said
an elementary school mourns while @entity193 families found their children , it was far worse for parents with kids at @entity197
the building was reduced to just a few walls
monday night a father sat on a stool , tears in his eyes , as a firefighter tried to comfort him
he awaited news of his son , a third - grader
at least seven children were killed at the school , police said
students who managed to escape said they hugged and clung to walls as the tornado passed through , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity214
one teacher told @entity214 that she lay on top of six students in the bathroom
@entity220 told @entity2 that when she arrived , she found her child and nieces and nephews and took them away
" i am speechless as [ to ] how this happened , why it happened , " she said
" how do we explain it to the kids ? " her son , @entity229 , said teachers told students to crouch and cover their heads
1999 : they 've been through this before what 's left behind a tornado leaves intact the most absurd things sometimes
a cardboard box of tax returns sat on a pile of wood that was once someone 's home
one woman 's bathroom was the only room untouched in her house , she said
though their home was obliterated , @entity249 and her husband @entity250 told a @entity254 reporter that the only thing untouched in their home appeared to be an empty water bottle
" you just wan na break down and cry , " @entity259 told @entity2 , holding a laundry basket that contained the belongings he could find
" but you know , that 's how it goes , " @entity259 said , his voice shaking
" you got ta be strong and keep going
" he 's lived in @entity1 his whole life
he 's seen tornadoes before , but nothing like this one
" i still ca n't believe this is happening , " he said
" you work 20 years , and then it 's gone in 15 minutes
" not far away , another woman was joyous when she got a text from her son , @entity275 , who started walking down a major street in @entity0 and saw his grandmother walking dazed along the road with her yorkie
" @entity281 is fine , " her son texted
" she is at my house
@entity284 , everything is gone
there is nothing left , anywhere
all of the pictures , all grandma 's stuff , all my pictures , my letter jacket , my college degree from @entity294
" in another part of @entity0 , @entity296 was shirtless , his hair and body caked with mud , as he described what happened at a horse and entertainment farm
" it was just like the movie ' twister , ' " he told @entity2 affiliate @entity214
" there were horses and stuff flying around everywhere
" the tornado slammed into the @entity311 , which had about 80 horses
it damaged several barns ; @entity296 was worried that most of the animals had been killed
" i tried to let some of the horses out of their stalls so that they would have a chance , " said @entity296
the building he took shelter in moved about 100 feet , he said , when the twister hit
a woman told @entity2 that she saw a horse after the twister
the animal was bleeding , but alive
it 's personal for @entity329 tuesday morning , lt. gov. @entity330 spoke to @entity2 affiliate @entity331 from a @entity333 parking lot
" i 'm not a pessimist and i have a lot of faith and a lot of hope , but just with the enormity and severity of this storm ... " he trailed off
at least 85 patients were at a local trauma center
of those , roughly 60 are children , @entity345 said
but he insisted that @entity349 stay positive
" let 's focus on the good news for a moment , the good news is that in the overnight hours , 101 survivors were found , " he said
" i talked to a ( @entity329 ) guardsman early this morning
he told me he found three bodies overnight , but his eyes got brighter as he said he found an elderly couple holding onto one another in their shelter scared to death
but they 're alive and well today
" so thank you to the men and women who are providing the search and rescue right now
" @entity2 spoke with several guard members overnight
they live in and around @entity0 when they are n't deployed
like so many others , some of them were searching for their own family members , too
" you do n't ever think about it as much when you 're at home , " said spc. @entity371
" when you see the devastation and people who are affected by it ... it really hits hard
" follow the severe weather tracker @entity2 's @entity381 , @entity382 and @entity383 reported from @entity1
@entity384 reported and wrote from @entity385 .
