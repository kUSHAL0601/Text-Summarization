-- @entity2 manager @entity1 and midfielder @entity3 have both been charged with improper conduct by governing body @entity5 following the @entity10 club 's @entity8 elimination at the hands of @entity12 on tuesday
the @entity14 duo are alleged to have made comments to @entity17 referee @entity16 after @entity12 's 3 - 1 second leg win at the @entity19 on tuesday
" @entity5 has opened disciplinary proceedings against @entity2 coach @entity1 and the @entity24 club 's midfielder @entity3 , " read a @entity5 statement
" both are to face charges of improper conduct , and their cases will be heard by the @entity28 and @entity29 on thursday march 17
" was @entity1 right - did the referee kill the game ? the @entity32 were angered by @entity16 's decision to issue @entity35 @entity34 with a second yellow card in the 56th minute for kicking the ball away following an offside decision , although the striker claimed to have not heard the referee 's whistle
at that point the match was level at 1 - 1 after @entity44 had given @entity12 the lead on the stroke of half time , only for makeshift defender @entity47 to head the ball into his own net in the second half
@entity44 returns to haunt @entity2 once the visitors were reduced to 10 men @entity12 took control and a @entity55 strike coupled with a @entity44 penalty helped the @entity57 to a comfortable success
@entity1 , 61 , and @entity3 , 23 , are both alleged to have made comments to @entity16 in the tunnel at the end of tuesday 's match .
