@entity0 -- with book deals , tv appearances and thousands of readers , moms who detail every moment of their domestic lives online produce some of the @entity9 's most well - read blogs
' @entity12 bloggers ' want to stem what they fear is a backlash against their profession
many of these " mommy bloggers " even draw the attention of companies that send them free product samples -- everything from toys to baby strollers to video game consoles -- in the hopes of getting positive coverage
but to some , these freebies are n't necessarily a good thing
readers have complained they can no longer trust their favorite blogger 's advice
veteran women bloggers grumble that newcomers sully the genre 's reputation by demanding free products and trips
@entity38 published an article last month headlined , " @entity40 or sellout ? " " there has been a turn of goodwill [ against mommy bloggers ] , " said @entity41 , the publisher and editor - in - chief of @entity43
" a year ago , bloggers were rising stars
six months later , really big marketers like @entity51 got into the game and started backing bloggers
" that created a new paradigm : an a-list blogger was not the one who wrote the best and had the most influence , but had the most marketing attention and free products , " she added
" it created a new generation of bloggers who blogged to get free stuff
" so @entity41 and other women bloggers are taking steps to become more transparent and stem what they fear is a backlash against their profession
at last month 's fifth annual @entity73 -- a gathering of more than 1,500 women bloggers in @entity76 -- @entity41 and three other bloggers launched @entity78 , a web site devoted to improving blogger ethics
" after a spring and early summer of polarizing debates about blogger compensation , sponsored posts and product reviews , an alarming increase in ethical lapses and idea theft , and a growing backlash against poor blogger relations practices , we believed it was time to refocus on integrity , " the site says
as of monday , people from more than 880 blogs had signed the site 's pledge , in which bloggers promise to disclose material relationships , policies and business practices , and let readers know the difference between editorial content and advertising
@entity107 , who writes the influential blog @entity108 , was among the first to sign the integrity pledge
in an e-mail to @entity1 she wrote , " i signed the pledge to help remind readers , other journalists and government regulators that many , if not most , online writers are committed to honest and ethical writing and that we share the same values as those in the more traditional media
" @entity122 , founder of blogging community @entity124 , organized another campaign to free bloggers who feel inundated by @entity128 requests and overwhelmed with product reviews
@entity134 's " @entity133 " asks mommy bloggers to go one week -- beginning monday -- without writing about products or services
@entity122 , who claims to get up to 75 pitches a day from @entity128 firms , instead wants mommy bloggers to " get back to the basics " and post about their marriages , homes and kids
" we are not saying down with @entity128 , we are saying let 's change how we interact with @entity128 and understand the relationship better , " she told @entity1
" it is important to get back to brand loyalty , not brand saturation
" it should not be about free stuff , " she said , setting up her own joke
" unless it is a @entity152
" " it seems like this is a case where a few bad eggs are spoiling the omelet , or however that old saying goes , " wrote @entity153 in a recent post on @entity155 , the tech news site
" the problem is n't @entity128 , but bloggers who are working with it in a less - than - sincere way
" even the federal government is turning its attention to how the mommy blogosphere conducts itself
the @entity170 is expected to vote this summer on new ethical guidelines for bloggers
while the revised guidelines will apply to all bloggers , @entity170 public affairs specialist @entity173 told @entity1 , " some of the bigger challenges include the mommy blogger issue and the extent to which the blogger must disclose a relationship with an advertiser
" @entity185 - based online marketer @entity183 believes many bloggers are n't intentionally deceptive -- just confused about what they should disclose
" there is a lack of knowledge [ about ethical rules ] , " said @entity183 , who runs @entity188
" the @entity170 did not deliberately set out to confuse everybody but blogging is new for a lot of these women and having that kind of both responsibility and power is new to a lot of bloggers
" @entity202 is the founder and ceo of @entity204 , a public - relations firm specializing in marketing to women
she believes mommy bloggers often feel overwhelmed by pr pitches and do n't know how to say no. " some bloggers just say ' yes ' because they like being asked and like the stuff , " she said
" but what they do n't realize is that they are not going to lose opportunities or not be asked again if they are too busy or overloaded
" this week 's @entity128 blackout and the @entity216 campaign may not change the image of mommy bloggers overnight , but they are starting a dialogue
" most people want to blog well , " @entity41 said
" we can not be the wild , wild @entity222
we are instituting a conversation that we all want to be in together
that is the best of what blogging is : a conversation
