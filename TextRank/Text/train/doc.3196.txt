-- after two years of a virtual stalemate of progress in @entity5 , members of @entity2 are headed home for five weeks during august
the pressure is on for both parties to tell two very different stories to voters with only a short time before the election
so who will have the better narrative ? and will @entity14 listen ? voters are unhappy with everyone , which includes president @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20
according to @entity24 polling average , president @entity18 's approval rating stands at 41.6 % while @entity2 approval is in the tank at 12.3 %
partisan warfare is a clear culprit to these low ratings
during august , voters should be prepared to take plenty of @entity32 , because their headaches are about to get worse
expect to hear @entity19 complain loudly that @entity20 are going to try to impeach @entity18 , that an attempt to sue the president is a useless partisan exercise designed to fundraise from conservatives across the country and that women should be very afraid of the @entity41 decision on contraceptives
republicans will shout that @entity19 are driving the impeachment story to fundraise off their liberal base , that the @entity46 is obstructing progress to protect their vulnerable members in red states from having to take tough votes and that suing @entity18 is necessary because he is n't doing his real job of working with @entity2
the polarization @entity53 in @entity5 can be very attractive for a member of @entity2 to fall into selling a partisan only message to their constituents
but , when @entity14 run into a tv show they do n't like , they turn the channel
voters are desperate to know about what can be accomplished to help them
climate change is n't going to cut it for @entity19 and abortion is n't going to work for @entity20
they simply do n't connect to the average voter concerns
the issues that matter are front and center in everyday @entity14 life
both sides are going to have to address the border crisis and their solutions to the problem
we are dealing with innocent children who are caught up in this mess
the news has saturated @entity14 and is a common topic around dinner tables and water coolers across the country
people are concerned and frustrated that @entity5 has spent too much time finger - pointing at each other
how do our elected officials plan to help create the conditions for more jobs , more money in their wallets and more food on the table ? how can their lives be made better for themselves and their children ? the @entity19 will likely point to some positive economic indicators and rising consumer confidence to show that it is turning around
but they lack an overall agenda to demonstrate there is a future method toward achieving economic stability
republicans can show they have a plan to turn around the economy faster , but rightfully point out the inaction by the @entity19 to address @entity20 plans
the @entity109 , run by @entity20 , has passed myriad bills dealing with job creation , gas prices and small business issues
these bills can be used as basis for a forward - looking agenda
the battle over the female voter will continue through august , with @entity19 pointing to the @entity119 decision on female contraception coverage as a threat to women 's rights
the @entity19 have also tried to push through votes appealing to the middle class on the minimum wage and the gender gap in pay
@entity109 @entity20 finally wised up and recently offered a female agenda of their own right before the august break that would increase job training , incentivize flexible work schedules , provide tax breaks for children and families , and strengthens charter schools
the package also includes new legislation to prevent retaliation when women ask about equal pay
beyond this rhetoric , there is a better opportunity for @entity20 in this election cycle to sell a positive message to voters because democrats are being forced to defend the @entity149 and its handling of the crises at home and abroad
it 's more difficult for a @entity154 to have to answer questions about the missing e-mail scandal at the @entity157 or president @entity18 's handling of @entity160 or the @entity161 and then pivot to a positive message on female gender pay
and people are mad at @entity5
republicans can blame the president for his failure of leadership , but the bulk of their arguments must be centered on positive solutions that connect with people who are tired of the finger pointing
this means that @entity14 could lean toward the @entity20 when they vote this november , if the focus is kept on what people are demanding to know , which is , " how we get out of this mess ? " join us on @entity180 / @entity179 .
