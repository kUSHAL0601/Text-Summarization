@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity5 woman who was trampled to death by an elephant in @entity1 , where she lived with her family , was a librarian who was determined to see that schools and libraries be built in poor villages , a former boss said wednesday
before moving with her husband to the @entity1 capital of @entity0 in 2006 , @entity12 was a reference librarian at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , said library director @entity19 , who hired @entity12 in 2005
@entity12 and her toddler daughter , who also died in the incident , were on a guided forest hike monday near the @entity23 , about 65 miles north of @entity0 , when the incident occurred , said lodge spokeswoman @entity25
@entity26 speculated the elephant was in a herd of about 20 that were spotted later in the day with their calves
elephants can be particularly defensive when they are sheltering their young , she said
in @entity0 , @entity12 was a librarian at the @entity34 , according to a security guard at the school
her husband , @entity37 , worked there as a fifth - grade teacher , according to the school 's web site
@entity12 only spent a year at @entity42 , @entity19 said , because when she got the opportunity to work in @entity1 , she felt it was a chance that was too good to pass up
at @entity42 , she worked with graduate students in environmental sciences and clinical psychology
" @entity12 was a quiet , open person
very present , " @entity19 said
" she believed that every exchange was a mutual learning
she opened the exchange by listening
" she was a cherished colleague , " @entity19 said
" to me , she was a citizen of the world in the finest sense

that was where @entity12 became committed to promoting education
@entity19 said she did n't know where they served , but @entity12 " had an affinity for @entity54
" @entity12 had said that while in the @entity55 , she totally immersed herself in the culture of the villagers , even asking the women to teach her how they washed clothes
a @entity55 supervisor told @entity67 that @entity12 provided the women and children with their very first books
@entity19 said she did n't know the name of the village
according to @entity26 , the property around the lodge is full of elephants , but encounters with humans " do n't normally end in tragedy
" there have been no tragic incidents with elephants in the area since 2001 , she said
" this area has wild animals , and i always warn my clients and everyone else to be aware of the danger , " she said
" but from now we wo n't allow children out anymore
the young child could have been saved
