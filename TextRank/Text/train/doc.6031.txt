violence in @entity1 has spiked in the last year , according to the @entity2 , but as has become the case with @entity4 , it 's rarely news if the day 's deaths are " only " in the tens
the same @entity8 governments who led the invasion of @entity1 in 2003 are now looking away , seeing @entity1 as the problem of previous administrations , and being preoccupied with fresher crises in @entity4 and @entity14
the impression of constant bad news belies the reality that violence in @entity1 had for some time been reduced , but is rapidly becoming worse again
more than 1,000 civilians died in july , levels not seen since the dark days of 2006 - 07
such violence is not a permanent reality for @entity1 , but is symptomatic of political failures
some @entity8 commentators portray @entity1 as a basket case , condemned to perpetual violence , reflecting something fundamentally wrong with @entity1 culture and society
this conveniently absolves the rest of the world of their shared responsibility for building up a political system where violence has been the main political currency , not just since 2003 but for years under the previous regime
@entity39 's 1980s war with @entity40 was encouraged by the @entity41 and by @entity1 's @entity43 neighbors , who turned a blind eye to his domestic repression and ethnic cleansing
after the @entity48 , internationally - imposed sanctions hollowed out @entity1 's middle class and made many @entity1 turn to corruption and organized crime to survive
examining the political causes of @entity1 's violence -- going beyond the caricatured and historical view that it is inevitable or permanent -- matters for the whole @entity56
@entity1 is not only geographically central , with about 30 million people and the world 's fifth largest oil reserves ; it has historically been a center of ideas
given @entity1 's international influence , the 2003 invasion was overtly designed not just to remove an anti-western regime , but to reshape the @entity56
but rather than becoming a model for democracy and the free market , the example of @entity1 has been used by conservative forces in the region to bolster their traditional pretense that the only political choices for @entity73 are authoritarian government or chaos
the violence between @entity78 and @entity79 political factions has also generated fears of wider sectarian conflict across the region , although violence occurs within , as well as between , religious groups , and its causes are political more than religious
the first reason for the recent spike in violence has been the spillover of fighting and tensions from the civil war in neighboring @entity4
there are close links between @entity1 and @entity4 societies and families , and as the conflict in @entity4 has become increasingly sectarian and internationalized , fighters from @entity1 are now involved on both sides
the recent split between the @entity102 and jihadi groups such as the @entity104 might present an opportunity for @entity1 's government to reconceptualize its interests in @entity4
despite their shared alliance with @entity40 , just a few years ago the @entity1 and @entity4 governments were at loggerheads as @entity1 suspected @entity4 of facilitating the entry of @entity113 fighters into its own territory
@entity1 's second problem is that it remains an arena where regional powers vie for influence , with @entity40 supporting the @entity79 ruling coalition , @entity120 supporting @entity78 groups and the secular @entity79 leader @entity122 , and @entity123 becoming ever closer to the @entity124
personal animosity between the leaders of @entity1 and @entity120 contributes to their poor relations , with @entity120 still unwilling to open an embassy in @entity1 more than a decade after the invasion
but the situation is not as simple as an inevitable tension between @entity78 and @entity79
the @entity120 king is said to respect @entity1 's main @entity79 cleric , ayatollah @entity133
encouraging religious dialogue between @entity78 and @entity79 clerics could be a useful aspect of conflict resolution
and the recent talks between the @entity139 and @entity40 is also an opportunity for @entity1 to act as a bridge , as one of the few countries to have strong relations with both
the third main driver of the current violence is the threat @entity1 faces from @entity113 -- and the political failure of the @entity1 government 's approach to fighting it
back in 2007 , thousands of @entity1 @entity78 fought with the @entity139 against @entity113
but rather than working with mainstream @entity78 political groups to build a united front against violent jihadis , the @entity153 government has treated the former as a political threat
this was epitomized by a death sentence passed against a @entity78 former vice-president , @entity161 , in 2012 for allegedly organizing death squads , when @entity79 politicians who have headed militias have been accommodated politically ( notably , the @entity165 , with a long record of sectarian violence , were absorbed into the national police )
protesters in sunni - majority provinces have called for changes to terrorism and @entity174 laws that they say treat all @entity78 as potential suspects
both @entity4 and @entity1 are rife with case studies of the ways in which human beings can be radicalized and brutalized
perhaps @entity8 find it easier to blame nebulous " cultural " factors than to imagine that we , too , could turn to violence and extremes if the states around us collapsed , and if we found ourselves in constant insecurity , with only sectarian or ethnic groups , and their militias , prepared to provide us with protection and services
but there is a need to refocus on @entity1 , as part of a broader strategy towards addressing the complex and interconnected problems across the @entity56 , though that will take more time and resources than continuing to lurch from crisis to crisis .
