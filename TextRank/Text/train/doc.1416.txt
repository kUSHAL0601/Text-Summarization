-- the @entity1 can not account for about $ 2 billion it was given to cover @entity4 - related expenses and is not providing @entity4 with a complete list of @entity7 - funded reconstruction projects , according to two new government audits
the reports come from the office of the @entity11
the @entity4 government in 2004 gave the @entity1 access to about $ 3 billion to pay bills for certain contracts , and the department can only show what happened to about a third of that , the inspector general says in an audit published friday
although the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) had " internal processes and controls " to track payments , the " bulk of the records are missing , " the report says , adding that the department is searching for them
other documents are missing as well , including monthly reports documenting expenses , the audit says
" from july 2004 through december 2007 , @entity1 should have provided 42 monthly reports
however , it can locate only the first four reports
" a letter accompanying the report is signed by @entity38 , the inspector general
the audit was overseen by @entity40 , assistant inspector general for audits
in a response letter also contained in the report , defense under secretary @entity42 acknowledges " a records management issue
" the audit says it believes records management is to blame , and " has been an ongoing problem for @entity1 in @entity4
by all accounts , @entity1 established good internal processes and controls to account for and report on " the funds it was given after the @entity53 dissolved
where the records did exist , they matched other records and contained " good financial documentation supporting individual payments
" also , there is " sufficient evidence " that required monthly reports were sent to the government of @entity4 , even though they ca n't be found , the audit said
the audit deals with a time when @entity4 's government was undergoing a transition
the @entity53 ran the country for 14 months from 2003 to 2004
during that time , the authority awarded numerous contracts
when it dissolved in 2004 , the @entity4 government gave the @entity1 access to the $ 3 billion to pay bills for contracts the provisional authority had awarded
the @entity1 letter from @entity78 -- the department 's deputy chief financial officer -- thanks the inspector general 's office for " the collaborative effort and professional courtesy " in a series of audits
separately , the inspector general 's office sent a letter sunday to the @entity7 ambassador to @entity4 complaining that the @entity7 government is not providing @entity4 with a complete list of reconstruction projects
the @entity7 criteria for selecting which projects to report to @entity4 -- which include only those valued at $ 250,000 or more -- is a central part of the problem , the letter says
the @entity7 @entity98 says the system is designed to help @entity4 " focus its limited resources on sustainment of infrastructure and other large capital projects done through @entity7 reconstruction efforts , " the report notes
the inspector general 's office argues that the limited list -- which is also " hampered by unreliable data and other data entry problems " -- does not allow @entity4 to decide where to focus its resources , and notes that the country might consider some smaller projects more important than those that are reported
" without more comprehensive knowledge about reconstruction projects the ( @entity4 government ) will not be in a position to maximize the use of its resources , " the report says
billions of dollars in spending are not reported to @entity4 under the current system , the report says
in a response letter , @entity122 , assistant chief of mission for the @entity98 in @entity4 , says that while the current system is incomplete , " it does capture the vast majority of reconstruction projects and there is no other alternative that captures more
" he also notes that the @entity4 reconstruction effort " is now in its very last stages , and all remaining capital projects will be reported through the asset transfer process
" the @entity11 was created in 2004 to continue oversight of @entity4 reconstruction programs .
