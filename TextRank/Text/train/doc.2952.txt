@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 groups from all corners of the party are reluctantly starting to pour money into this traditionally red state to try to save the incumbent @entity4 senator -- and lock down their prospects of taking control of the @entity12
the @entity1 - based @entity14 brothers , who have so far engaged minimally here , are poised to step up their efforts to help sen. @entity17 , according to sources familiar with their plans
worried that @entity17 could lose the @entity4 seat in their backyard , the @entity14 founded and funded group , @entity23 , plans to increase its activity in the last weeks of the campaign
@entity27 , another conservative group with ties to the @entity14 brothers , already spent nearly $ 1 million in television ads to help @entity17 and plans another buy before election day
other outside groups that hoped to spend campaign cash at this time to defeat incumbent democrats are also now coming in big to defend this @entity4 seat
until recently , @entity4 thought they 'd only have to play defense in @entity37 and @entity38 , where @entity35 have mounted competitive @entity12 campaigns
but @entity35 candidate @entity41 's abrupt decision to drop out of the @entity1 race last month transformed the election here into an unexpected head - to - head contest between @entity17 and independent @entity46
@entity46 has said he will caucus with whatever party is in the majority , but @entity4 do n't want to take any chances
they saw a @entity4 @entity12 takeover within their reach in the last two elections , 2010 and 2012 , only to be snatched away -- mostly by intra @entity4 fighting and candidate missteps
ruby red @entity1 has not elected a @entity56 to the @entity12 in over 80 years , but @entity17 is under attack for a cardinal sin in politics -- losing touch with the people back home
@entity63 came in to help overcome that image to win a tough primary fight , and he is now up against @entity46 -- a businessman who is successfully appealing to voters as outside @entity67 and outside the two party system
the @entity69 , founded by billionaire businessman @entity70 , announced it is pouring more than $ 1 million dollars into @entity1 for television and radio ads over the next several weeks , and is poised to spend more if needed
on friday the group released one of those ads , first shared with @entity2 , which casts @entity46 as a liberal who 's " masquerading " as an independent
@entity77 , who runs the group , tells @entity2 they saw polling that showed @entity17 in trouble , and worry that his opponent , independent @entity46 , is really an " @entity56 masquerading as an @entity82
" @entity46 ran as a @entity56 in the past , but has given money to and voted for candidates in both parties
" we think its crazy to leave the @entity12 majority to someone who wo n't come clean to the people of @entity1 about what he stands for , " said @entity77 , referring to the fact that @entity46 is cagey about who he will caucus with if he wins , and if his decision determines which party controls the @entity12
@entity77 was an aide to former @entity1 senator @entity96 , a close friend of @entity17 who is working behind the scenes as well as in public to pull @entity17 over the finish line
the @entity101 @entity100 , which played a major role helping incumbent @entity4 in the @entity4 primary season , is also about to " go big " in @entity1 for @entity17 , according to a source familiar with their plans
in a preview earlier this week , @entity17 appeared with the @entity108 to receive its endorsement
update : an initial version of this story did n't include the proper name for @entity69 and misquoted its president , @entity77
@entity2 's @entity115 contributed to this report
