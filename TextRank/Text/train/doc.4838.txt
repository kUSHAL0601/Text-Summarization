@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 said tuesday it has worked out a way for groups of @entity6 who are dissatisfied with their faith to join the @entity9
the @entity3 says more anglicans have expressed an interest in joining the @entity9
the process will enable groups of @entity6 to become @entity9 and recognize the pope as their leader , yet have parishes that retain @entity19 rites , @entity13 officials said
the move comes some 450 years after @entity21 broke from @entity0 and created the @entity19 , forerunner of the @entity22
the parishes would be led by former @entity19 clergy -- including those who are married -- who would be ordained as @entity9 priests , said the rev. @entity27 , ecumenical director of the @entity28
" this sets up a process for whole groups of @entity6 -- clergy and laity -- to enter in to the @entity9 while retaining their forms of worship and other @entity19 traditions , " @entity27 said
the number of @entity6 wishing to join the @entity9 has increased in recent years as the @entity22 has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy and blessed homosexual partnerships , said cardinal @entity42 , the head of the @entity3 's @entity44
their talks with the @entity3 recently began speeding up , @entity3 officials said , leading to tuesday 's announcement
" the @entity9 is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the @entity3 from groups of @entity19 clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion , " @entity42 said
@entity42 said " hundreds " of @entity6 around the world have expressed their desire to join the @entity9
among them are 50 @entity19 bishops , said archbishop @entity61 of the @entity62
while married @entity19 priests may be ordained as @entity9 priests , the same does not apply to married @entity19 bishops , @entity42 said
" we 've been praying for this unity for 40 years and we 've not anticipated it happening now , " @entity61 said
" @entity68 is at work here
" one interested group is the @entity71 , an association of churches that is separate from the @entity22 and has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide
the tac in 2007 petitioned the @entity3 for unity with the @entity9 with the stipulation that the group retain its @entity19 rites
the @entity71 's primate , archbishop @entity78 of @entity79 , said in a statement tuesday that the @entity3 's announcement " more than matches the dreams we dared to include in our petition two years ago
" that is because the @entity3 's move involves not only the @entity71 but other @entity19 groups that want to unite with the @entity9 , said the right rev. @entity88 , bishop ordinary of the western diocese of the @entity22 of @entity90 , which is part of the @entity71
the @entity3 has yet to release all details of the offer , and the @entity71 's leaders will meet and discuss how to respond when it does , @entity88 said
but @entity88 said he believes much of @entity71 will respond favorably
@entity88 , who also is rector of @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97 , said his parishioners have generally been " very warmly receiving " tuesday 's announcement
" it is encouraging for them to know their worship experience would n't be turned upside down by the @entity9 , " @entity88 said
" the person in the pew should see very little difference in the way we pray
we might be asked to pray aloud for any pope who happens to be in office , in addition to praying for our primate
" really , there 'd be very little other difference
" the parishes retaining the @entity19 rites would answer not to @entity9 bishops but to regional or nationwide " personal ordinariates " who would report to the pope , @entity27 said
those officials often will be former @entity19 clergy , @entity3 officials said
the @entity19 said the move ends a " period of uncertainty " for @entity19 groups who wanted more unity with the @entity9
both groups have a " substantial overlap in faith , doctrine and spirituality " and will continue to hold official dialogues , the archbishops of @entity131 and @entity132 said in a joint statement
" those @entity6 who have approached the @entity3 have made clear their desire for full , visible unity in the one , holy , catholic and apostolic church , " @entity42 said
" at the same time , they have told us of the importance of their @entity19 traditions of spirituality and worship for their faith journey
" preserving @entity19 traditions , such as mass rites , adds to the diversity of the @entity9 , he said
" the unity of the church does not require a uniformity that ignores cultural diversity , as the history of @entity158 shows , " he said
" moreover , the many diverse traditions present in the @entity9 today are all rooted in the principle articulated by @entity161 in his letter to the @entity164 : ' there is one lord , one faith , one baptism
' " @entity2 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .
