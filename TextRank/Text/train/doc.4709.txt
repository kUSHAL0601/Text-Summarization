-- a @entity2 plane that was hijacked shortly after taking off from @entity3 in the country 's @entity5 region , presumably by rebels , has landed in @entity8 , @entity9 , said @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity11
" i believe since it started in the sovereign state of @entity5
... it is more likely something to do with the rebels in that area , " @entity14 said
about 87 passengers and 10 crew members are thought to be on board , @entity14 said
it was unclear how many hijackers were on board
the hijacker or hijackers wanted to land the plane in @entity28 , but the @entity28 government refused them permission , @entity14 said
however , an @entity28 civil aviation official disputed that
" the hijacked plane never entered @entity28 airspace , " said capt. @entity33 , the head of @entity28 's civil aviation control
" it never requested to land on @entity28 soil
... we understand that it had a tank that would allow it to fly for four hours
it flew directly toward @entity8
" a reporter from @entity44 , a @entity46 - based @entity2 network funded by @entity2 's government , said passengers on the plane include some officials from the interim government of @entity5 , @entity2 's war - torn region
@entity9 's state - run @entity55 television , citing civil aviation sources , reported that the hijacked plane landed in @entity8 , in eastern @entity9
" we are in contact with @entity9 officials because of this dangerous event , " @entity56 , an official with @entity58 airlines , told @entity44
" we want to resolve this situation as soon as we can in a way where we can guarantee the safety of all our passengers
" asked whether the airline received any threat before the flight took off , he said , " there were no signs of any terrorist or criminal activity on the plane
we checked the plane like we do with all other planes
we followed the regular security checkup
we still do n't have any information on what type of weapons were used
" @entity56 also said 87 passengers were on board the plane
the hijacking follows a monday attack involving @entity2 government troops at the @entity87 refugee camp , 25 kilometers ( 15.5 miles ) from @entity3
it was unclear whether the incidents are related
the @entity91 @entity90 in @entity5 said the government of @entity2 reported that its military and police forces were granted a search warrant for drugs and weapons and raided the camp in executing the warrants
@entity100 said 60 government vehicles surrounded the camp
the refugees resisted the government 's attempts to enter the camp , however , and " the situation escalated into confrontation and exchange of gunfire , with no indication as to who started it
" the gunfire lasted about two hours , @entity100 said
" on the basis of information provided to the @entity100 team while on site , the casualty toll amounted to 64 killed and 117 wounded , of which 49 were evacuated by @entity100 to the @entity3 hospital , " the organization said in a written statement
@entity2 military and police were heavily armed , the organization said , but the refugees had only sticks , knives and spears
@entity2 security forces reported that they were met by a human shield of women and children , with gunfire coming from behind them , prompting them to return fire
" @entity100 strongly condemns the excessive , disproportionate use of lethal force by the [ government ] security forces against civilians , which violated their human rights and resulted in unacceptable casualties , " the @entity100 statement said
@entity0 's @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity28 , contributed to this report .
