@entity0 -- some may disagree whether @entity2 was a " uniter , not a divider , " as he liked to say , but he did get all five living presidents together for the dedication of his presidential library
at thursday 's event in @entity0 , @entity10 former presidents @entity8 and @entity11 praised @entity2 for his initiatives in @entity14 , and @entity2 defended his record
" the political winds blow left and right , polls rise and fall , supporters come and go , but in the end , leaders are defined by the convictions they hold , " @entity2 said at the ceremony for the @entity17
" my deepest conviction , the guiding principle of the administration , is that the @entity27 must strive to expand the reach of freedom
" @entity2 has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the @entity32 and the policies he pursued after the september 11 terrorist attacks
history will show , he said at the dedication , that he always stuck by his convictions
" a free society thrives when neighbors help neighbors and the strong protect the weak and public policies promote private compassion , " @entity2 said
" as president , i tried to act on these principles every day
it was n't always easy and certainly was n't always popular ... but when future generations come to this library to study this administration , they 're going to find out that we stayed true to our convictions
" @entity8 told a story of how he asked , on @entity2 's inauguration day , for a meeting to talk about a civil war in @entity56 that was entering its second decade
@entity2 kept his word and acted , @entity8 said
" in january of 2005 , there was a peace treaty between north and south @entity56 that ended a war that had been going on for 20 years , " @entity8 said
" @entity2 is responsible for that
" the last time the five living presidents were together was right before president @entity64 took office
it is a rare and special occurrence when the five gather , @entity64 said
" this is a @entity69 - sized party , " @entity64 said
" when all the former living presidents are all together , it is a special day for our democracy
" the presidents on the stage definitely differed on many policy matters , but they all share one quality , @entity64 said : they did what they believe is right
" that 's what president @entity2 chose to do , " @entity64 said
@entity2 became a little emotional as he closed his speech : " whatever challenges come before us , i will always believe our nation 's best days lie ahead
" the center 's library and museum take visitors through the turning points of @entity2 's two terms
the first exhibits recall the 43rd president 's initial priorities on education , faith - based community initiatives and tax cuts
and they show how the september 11 terrorist attacks changed everything
@entity2 43 : ' @entity100 will ultimately judge ' at one exhibit , the bright red dress that first lady @entity102 wore to her husband 's first state dinner , just six days before 9/11 , stands in contrast to the next , most talked - about artifact in the museum : the twisted hulk of two beams from the @entity111
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity114 , the former president said he knows that the center 's dedication will rekindle the debate about his presidency , and he conceded the library is in part an effort by him and supporters to influence history 's verdict
but he predicted visitors would find it " more objective " than they might have imagined , and he showed little interest in revisiting flashpoints like @entity129 , @entity130 or the 2008 financial crisis , or the scorn with which many look back at the @entity2 presidency
a glimpse at a @entity136 before everything changed " you know , i 'm really not that concerned about why people did what during my presidency , " he said
" i 'm more concerned about being an effective person for the rest of my life
" i know this : that @entity102 and i gave the presidency eight years of our life
we gave it our all
made the best judgment calls i could
i did n't compromise my principles
and i 'm a content man
and i am excited about what we 're going to do here
" as the son of another former president , @entity2 said he would n't mind seeing his brother @entity157 run for the highest office
if he could make the decision for @entity157 , he would tell him to run for president , @entity2 said
but in an interview thursday on @entity163 's " today , " former first lady @entity161 said that while @entity157 is able to do the job , she would like to see other families in the @entity136
" there are other people out there that are very qualified , and we 've had enough @entity171 , " she said
in addition to the library and museum , the @entity172 includes the @entity17 , a public policy institute
by the numbers : presidential libraries @entity1 's @entity178 wrote and reported this story in @entity180
@entity1 's @entity114 and @entity181 contributed from @entity0 .
