@entity0 -- firefighters , sailors and emergency workers reflected friday on the scenes they witnessed during rescue efforts for the passengers of a @entity9 jet that ditched into the @entity11 's frigid waters the day before
divers plunge into the icy waters of the @entity11 on thursday to rescue passengers from the ditched aircraft
it was far from just another day in @entity0 , a city that has experienced its fair share of emergency calls
" it was like a movie set , " said @entity19 of @entity20 1
" we 're at a @entity25 base , over a computer
@entity27 says ' plane crash
@entity11 , over 15th street
' " @entity19 rushed to the scene and began working on transporting some of the 155 passengers on @entity31 , many of them displaying signs of distress
" i said ' welcome to @entity0 , ' and a couple of them cracked a smile , " he said
" they were just glad to be warm and dry
" detective @entity39 , the head diver for the @entity41 @entity40 , was lowered into the @entity11 from a helicopter in full scuba gear to rescue a woman hanging onto a floating object in the water
" she seemed to be at the most distress at the time , " @entity47 said on @entity1 's " @entity48
" " they put us down to about 10 , 15 feet off the water
and that 's when we jumped into the water , " @entity47 said
" man , i 've been in cold water , but nothing like that
" darting speed boats and fighting strong currents was no easy job , said his partner , detective @entity61
" our first focus is to get a bit of communication established between us , kind of a game plan , " @entity61 said
" it comes down sometimes to hand signals and a tap on the shoulder , a point of a finger
" the unidentified woman was reluctant to let go of the net she was holding on to but eventually wrapped her arms around her rescuers
she was later treated for hypothermia , @entity47 said
" if there 's going to be a victim in the water , this is probably the worst time of year for them to be in the water , " @entity47 said
" these people were literally in just regular clothes , obviously
they were just taking a flight on an airline and wearing a sweater , maybe some jeans , some sneakers
" petty officer @entity91 recalled sailing alongside the airplane over icy waters to rescue passengers , some partially submerged in the near - freezing waters
" i actually put my boat inside the plane , " said @entity91 , who was one of the first to arrive at the crash scene
@entity91 and his crew , who plucked seven people out of the wreckage , praised the crews of the fast - moving swarm of commuter ferries that transported many of the passengers away from the sinking aircraft
@entity110 , a ferry operations manager , credited a hammock - like maritime rescue tool called a @entity114 cradle with helping save passengers from the water as quickly as possible
while @entity110 was helping people out of the water , he quickly turned his attention to a mother attempting to climb into a raft with her infant
" she climbed almost all the way up onto the boat , " he said
" she did n't have the strength , so we muscled her on
the baby was right back in her arms , and she was back inside real quick
" @entity132 capt. @entity131 's daily work consists of ferrying commuters from @entity134 to @entity0 's financial centers and basic ports
rescue was a new mission to @entity139 , who said freezing weather and the river 's currents made the task more challenging
" you had to maneuver the boat with the current , because the plane is going downriver , " @entity131 told @entity1 's " @entity148
" " and you had to make sure there was no one next to you or inside
" other rescue workers who raced to save passengers also looked back on thursday 's rescue mission in disbelief
" we heard it was a confirmed plane down
initially , you think of a small @entity156 - type plane , but when we got up on the scene , i saw the tail fin of a @entity9 jet out of the water , " @entity0 firefighter @entity19 said
" as @entity19 approached the partially submerged aircraft with passengers clustered on its wings , he was struck by the " organized " and " calm " atmosphere of the rescue efforts already underway
" there 's been helicopters that have gone down in the @entity170 the last few years
but to handle this -- this is a large airliner with this many people , it worked out well
i was amazed that no one was killed
