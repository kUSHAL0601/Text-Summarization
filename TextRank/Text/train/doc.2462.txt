-- a boy takes a condom
he inflates it slowly , each breath meticulously measured as the creation begins to take shape
he takes some plastic and carefully wraps it around the condom , ensuring it ca n't be punctured before using pieces of shredded tire and an old rope to tie around the oddly shaped sphere
this is football -- rural @entity16 style
no grass , no shoes , just a machete knife on hand to chisel out the thorns which get stuck in the players ' feet
welcome to @entity24 -- a small village in @entity26 , located 150 kilometers off the beaten track and an eight - hour drive through the bush
@entity24 exists without electricity or running water -- instead it lives off the " @entity36 's " : farming , family and football
" having less is interesting because it makes us see things in a different way , " renowned international photographer @entity37 told @entity0
" what i know is that everyone says the same thing , how can people be so content ? " happiness is a state of mind
you see people with so much who are buried in their belongings and burdened by their attachment to possessions
" those who have less also have less worries and are more focused on what is essential
" @entity24 was one of the places where @entity58 's photos spoke loudest
football is what keeps the village breathing
every evening a match takes place amid noise and a carnival of color
at 4pm each and every day the whistle sounds to signal the start of play with people arriving from all sides of the bush onto the field
" it was a moment of magic , " @entity37 said
" they forget the hardship of the day and people just had fun
not just for the players but for fans , the wives , it was real delight
" it was a real @entity16 match
bare feet , getting thorns , cutting them out with machetes , dressed in individual fashion
" @entity58 is well qualified to explain the attitudes and role of football in rural @entity16 society following the success of her " @entity97 " project
in her father 's @entity98 , @entity58 traveled across @entity101 , documenting in each and every shot just how crucial football is to the survival of those battling against the odds
" it was n't easy at the beginning
i was sitting in my tent , crying , why am i doing this ? " she recalled
it 's such a male world , then there is a little white woman , and everyone was looking at me
" with time on the terrain i learned that the best thing for me was to settle in an area where i felt a good vibe
i wanted to use my senses , feel , talk to people , make friends , see the fields and spend time with people to explain the project and gain their trust
" people are suspicious because white people take photos and make money off the back of it
i had to break that
i think that people saw i was putting love into my log books they saw it was n't a commercial project
" they saw that when i was stopping to write their names down and put some memorable quotes in that there was more to it
" @entity58 is no stranger to @entity101
her tour of @entity148 in 2007 whetted the appetite for something which delved deeper into the everyday lives of those living across such a vast and enriching continent
it was while spending @entity155 with her father in @entity101 five years ago that the idea of a football project was born
" i love @entity101 and my father loves football
he did the design of the book and i took the pictures and the traveling , " she said
" i 'm not a football fan at all
i did watch the @entity166 , but i 'm really not a big fan
" during my travels through @entity101 i had often seen handmade balls which i thought were beautiful and symbolic of so much
but i thought there was something wonderful about showing what life is like in @entity101 through football
" i wanted to do a study of football in its purest sense , without all the corporate sponsors , television and stuff which goes with it
" i wanted to show people playing just for the pure pleasure
" @entity37 spent a total of nine months traveling throughout @entity101 , taking in @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity101 on her first trip before visiting @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193
" every time i stopped somewhere , i found someone who could speak the dialect and @entity197 or @entity198 and they would be my link to the population
i wanted to have fun , " she said
in @entity204 , @entity188 , another story was brought to life through the lens
" i 'm ok , i 'm ok , " said @entity207 , manager of the famous @entity209 side
@entity207 , a quiet and humble man , has been training children since he was 14 and has been responsible for unearthing some of @entity188 's most talented players
the club , which is made up of 150 boys , has teams in several age groups and survives by selling players to the bigger teams
the likes of @entity220 's @entity219 , former @entity222 striker @entity221 and international midfielder @entity223 have all passed through the @entity224 set up
kids from across the country flock to attend trials , as @entity228 runs the rule over " these young dancers in the dust , " according to @entity58
" the boys look after @entity207 , and he looks after them , " she said
" he lives in a 10 square meter home , in old @entity236 neighborhood
" on the roof is a huge satellite dish with all the sport channels
the living room is the center of this house
here they listen to his massive old - fashioned radio , eat and watch football
" the place is an organized mess with footballs hanging up , old photos of successful young boys , old boots , cups , trophies and a dangerously low ceiling fan
" the project has sparked reaction from across the globe with hundreds of people donating both new and old equipment , while @entity261 has also contributed
" it has gone beyond all expectations , " she said
" i was always attracted to the world of image
i assisted photographers to make sure i actually wanted to do it
i did a trip in a @entity270 from @entity271 to @entity272 and then up to @entity101 when i was younger
" it really formed my way of seeing the world
i wanted to see the imperfect , the banal and all the simple things in life which we sometimes forget about
" for anyone , whatever their passions is , when you give a project everything you 've got and push yourself that bit further , there 's always some kind of magic that happens
" amen to that .
