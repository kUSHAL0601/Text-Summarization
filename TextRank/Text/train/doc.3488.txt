-- more than 200 former fighters and other members of the @entity4 -- including minors -- were discharged from a @entity4 camp thursday in line with @entity9 's ongoing peace process , officials said
those being discharged were part of a group deemed " disqualified " by @entity16 findings in 2007 , which identified at least 4,008 such combatants -- including 2,973 minors
the " disqualified " status applied to anyone under the age of 18 who was serving in the liberation army , and those who joined the @entity4 group after its 10 - year insurgency to abolish the country 's monarchy ended in 2006
more than 15,000 died in the fighting and more than 100,000 people were displaced , according to the @entity16 web site
@entity9 became a republic in 2008 following elections in which the people voted to abolish the monarchy
" those who left the @entity36 camp today are no more members of the [ @entity40 ] @entity4 , " @entity34 , commander of the @entity4 , told @entity0 in a phone interview from @entity36 , about 150 km ( 93 miles ) southeast of @entity37
the discharge process is expected to end in about a month
as part of the rehabilitation package for the disqualified combatants , the @entity16 has offered to provide vocational skills training and education up to high school to those who want such opportunities , but @entity34 said that these offers are still being discussed
the process of the discharge is seen as in important part of the @entity9 's ongoing peace process
the @entity55 and other political parties in the country are discussing ways to integrate the 19,602 verified @entity4 combatants into @entity9 's security forces -- a move that made up part of the peace deal signed in 2006 to bring the peace process to a conclusion
once the minors remain out of the command and control of the @entity4 military structure for six months to a year , the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) can be considered for removal from the list of parties that recruit and use children , which is included in the annual @entity16 @entity77 's report on @entity78
as the discharge and rehabilitation process began , about a dozen of the disqualified combatants were listed as being under the age of 16 and about 500 were under the age of 18
though called combatants , the @entity16 said the minors were used as messengers , cooks and porters during the fighting .
