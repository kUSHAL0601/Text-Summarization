@entity0 -- a federal appeals panel on wednesday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that halted enforcement of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy banning openly gay and lesbian soldiers from the military
the ruling by a three - judge panel of the 9th @entity10 gave the government the delay it sought in challenging a federal judge 's order last week to stop enforcing the policy around the world
" the order is stayed temporarily in order to provide this court with an opportunity to consider fully the issues presented , " said the appellate panel 's ruling , which gave parties in the case until october 25 to file further documents
@entity27 : please share your thoughts on do n't ask , do n't tell @entity30 , an @entity31 veteran and executive director of the @entity33 , said the appeals court panel 's ruling " means that ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' is once again on the books , and is likely to be enforced by the @entity35
" " gay and lesbian service members deserve better treatment than they are getting with this ruling , " @entity30 said
the @entity41 and the @entity42 also expressed disappointment and called for an end to " do n't ask , do n't tell
" earlier wednesday , the @entity46 administration filed an emergency request with the 9th @entity10 to stop the military from allowing openly gay troops from serving , putting itself in a strange position
in effect , the administration wants to continue barring gays from the military even though it ultimately favors repealing " @entity54
" " they are in a very bizarre position , frankly , of their own making , " @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity55 said
on wednesday , the @entity59 referred all questions about the issue to the @entity62
the administration filed a motion tuesday asking @entity66 district court judge @entity65 to stay her order last month that banned the enforcement of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy
when @entity72 denied the request , government lawyers took their case to the @entity75 on wednesday
in court documents filed in @entity77 , @entity78 , the administration argued that " do n't ask , do n't tell " should remain intact for now
the administration argued that changing it abruptly " risks causing significant immediate harm to the military and its efforts to be prepared to implement an orderly repeal of the statute
" toobinsaid the administration would like @entity85 to deal with the issue on a political level and does n't want the courts to take it on unilaterally
a measure that would repeal the policy after a military review and approval from the president , defense secretary and @entity96 chairman has passed the @entity59 and awaits action in the @entity98
by battling the legal challenge to the existing law -- a traditional practice of the @entity66 government -- the administration is trying to buy time to implement the repeal process worked out with military leaders and contained in the legislation before @entity85
if the @entity75 eventually overturns @entity72 ' ruling and @entity85 does not take any action , " do n't ask , do n't tell " could be back
" and the @entity46 administration would be responsible for that , " @entity55 said
meanwhile , spokeswoman @entity111 said wednesday that the @entity35 " will continue to obey the law , and we will abide by the terms of the court 's injunction unless and until the injunction is stayed or vacated
" the @entity120 , plaintiffs in the case that @entity72 ruled on , said wednesday that the group remained fully committed to defending this worldwide injunction because it is what is best for all service members
" while we are disappointed with the court 's ruling granting a temporary administrative stay , we view the decision as nothing more than a minor setback , " said @entity125 , a partner in the law firm @entity126 who is representing the group it the case
" we did n't come this far to quit now , " he said in a statement , adding that the group expected the appeals court to uphold the lower court injunction against " @entity54
" the @entity35 has already begun advising recruiting commands that they can accept openly gay and lesbian recruit candidates , according to @entity111
the guidance from the personnel and readiness office was sent to recruiting commands friday , @entity111 said
the recruiters were told that if a candidate admits that he or she is openly gay and qualifies under normal recruiting guidelines , the application can be processed
recruiters are not allowed to ask candidates if they are gay as part of the application process
@entity156 , executive director of the @entity120 , said there have not been any incidents of consequence the administration feared would occur
" the armed forces continues to move along and succeed because it is the greatest military in the world , " @entity156 said
@entity163 , an infantry officer who was discharged under the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , turned in paperwork wednesday to re-enlist in the @entity31
he said the @entity46 administration ought not to lift a finger to defend discrimination
" they should walk their talk , " @entity163 said after re-enlisting
the @entity46 administration has said it needs more time to work with the @entity35 to repeal the policy , blasted by critics as blatantly discriminatory
" this president has made a commitment , and it 's not a question of whether that program , whether that policy will change , but when , " @entity46 adviser @entity173
" we 're at the end of a process with the @entity35 to make that transition , and we 're going to see it through
" the arrangement worked out with the @entity35 includes a military review of how to make the transition work , which is to be completed in december
after that , @entity46 , the defense secretary and the @entity96 chairman would have to certify that the plan wo n't harm the combat readiness of @entity66 troops
@entity46 and @entity59 press secretary @entity192 have repeatedly stressed the need for an orderly transition from the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy in order to deal with myriad issues including barracks arrangements and benefits
speaking to a mostly young audience at the @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity202 town hall meeting last week , @entity46 reaffirmed that the " policy will end and it will end on my watch
" " i agree with the basic principle that anybody who wants to serve in our armed forces and make sacrifices on our behalf , on behalf of our national security , anybody should be able to serve , " he said
at the same time , @entity46 said , " it has to be done in a way that is orderly , " and he insisted that congressional action is needed because @entity85 passed a law that prohibits the president from unilaterally changing the policy
@entity1 's @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .
