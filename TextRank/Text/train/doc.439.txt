-- former world no. 1 @entity1 has announced her retirement from tennis , revealing that she no longer has the desire to play and train
the 30 - year - old won two @entity7 tournaments in 2006 as she spent 34 weeks at the top of the rankings , but has suffered a gradual slide since following a series of injuries and ended this year at no. 21
the @entity13 won the @entity14 earlier this year , but it proved to be a false dawn in her return to top form and she skipped the final two tournaments of 2009
" i came here to announce the end of my career
i made this decision after careful consideration , " she told reporters at an emotional press conference on thursday
" i do n't want to train anymore
i had to make a decision , which became evident in the last few months and weeks
when you grow older , it 's more difficult to stay at the top
" it 's a bit sad , but this is the right decision
i was lucky enough to have an exceptional career and to experience very strong feelings on the court
" i dreamt of this career , i dreamt of winning a @entity7 title
i lifted trophies in every city in the world and i lived 10 magical and unbelievable years
" @entity1 claimed her first major win at the @entity42 when @entity43 pulled out with injury during the final , but she defied her doubters by beating the @entity47 to claim the @entity49 title later that year
@entity43 and her compatriot have both ended their relatively brief retirements this year , but @entity1 said she was unlikely to have a similar change of mind
" even if i 've learned to never say never , the players you are thinking about stopped earlier than me before coming back , " she said
@entity58 chair @entity57 paid tribute to the player
" @entity1 's accomplishments not only include winning two @entity7 titles and becoming the first @entity13 player to reach the world no. 1 ranking , but leading @entity13 to a @entity67 victory , and generously donating her time to various social causes , " she said
" @entity1 is an extraordinary player , one of the nicest and friendliest personalities on tour , and a true champion both in tennis and in life
" @entity1 won the junior @entity76 and @entity49 titles in 1996 before heading to the senior circuit , where she reached the @entity42 final in 1999 before losing to @entity80
she became the first @entity13 player , male or female , to reach the top of the rankings in 2004 , when she won the silver medal at the @entity86 , losing to @entity43 in the final
but her career came off the rails in 2007 , missing two months due to injury and finishing outside the top - 10 for the first time in seven seasons
the following year was even worse as she ended it outside the top - 20
@entity1 won 25 titles overall , and was a losing finalist 23 times .
