-- @entity1 is already the most successful @entity2 female tennis player , but her achievements will reach a new level when the world rankings are released on monday
the 22 - year - old will climb to a career - high no. 5 after winning the @entity7 on saturday , when she beat @entity9 's rising star @entity10 7 - 5 6 - 4 in the final
@entity1 , the first @entity2 woman to pass $ 1 million in prize money , claimed the eighth title of her career and her first this year
she extended her record to 15 - 3 this season , with her only defeats coming against world no. 1 @entity20 in the last eight at the @entity22 and the semifinals in @entity24 and @entity25
gorges , making her @entity28 debut , had reached her fourth career final after knocking out @entity30 -- @entity32 's predecessor at the top -- in friday 's semis
victory on saturday would have seen the 23 - year - old climb to a career - high 15th in the rankings , up from 19 , but -- just like in the fourth round of january 's opening grand slam @entity39 -- she had no answer to @entity1 's game
meanwhile , former @entity44 champion @entity43 reached his second successive final after beating top seed @entity46 at the @entity48 on saturday
the fourth - seeded @entity49 , who has climbed back up the rankings to 10th after long - term wrist problems , won 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 9 - 11 ) 6 - 3 against the @entity55 world @entity53 -- who won this tournament in 2009
both players had reached the career milestone of 200 match wins on friday
@entity43 , who lost to world no. 3 @entity60 in the @entity62 final last weekend , will face 2010 champion @entity63 in sunday 's final
the @entity55 went through after beating @entity65 third seed @entity66 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 12 - 10 ) in the second semi
@entity68 reached the final of the @entity71 hard - court event on saturday , beating @entity74 third seed @entity72 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 3
the @entity75 followed up friday 's win over @entity78 top seed @entity77 , while @entity72 ended the hopes of 2010 winner @entity80 of the @entity78 in their quarterfinal @entity68 will face last year 's runner - up @entity82 on sunday after the in - form @entity84 defeated @entity9 's @entity85 in straight sets
the 21 - year - old , seeking a third @entity88 title of the year , took just 75 minutes to ease through 6 - 4 6 - 4
fourth seed @entity82 fired an impressive 14 aces on his way to a ninth straight victory and remains on course to add to his tournament victories in @entity96 and @entity97 .
