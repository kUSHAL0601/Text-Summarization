-- forget planking , it 's time to get " @entity3
" the latest @entity5 craze , currently exploding on social media , pays homage to @entity9 striker @entity8
photos of the @entity15 forward 's acrobatic headed equalizer against world champions @entity10 in friday 's 5 - 1 win has gone viral
@entity17 nodded delicately over @entity10 goalkeeper @entity18 while seemingly suspended in mid air to register one of the goals of the tournament
now @entity23 is awash with soccer fans the world over recreating his " @entity26 " pose
@entity29 dj @entity28 posted his tribute after a thumping win for @entity33 's team , but the craze caught the imagination of both old and young
this baby can barely walk , but it did n't stop him saluting @entity17 's wonder strike
not only was it a brilliant goal , it was also one that sparked a collapse from the @entity5 holders
after going in front thanks to a @entity46 penalty , @entity10 fell apart after @entity17 's equalizer , going on to lose 5 - 1
it meant @entity10 conceded more in its opening 90 minutes in @entity50 than in its last 10 games at @entity52 and @entity53 combined
@entity10 's captain and goalkeeper , @entity18 , was only 40 minutes away from besting legendary @entity58 goalkeeper @entity57 's record of 517 minutes without conceding during @entity5 matches .
