@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 groups voiced their horror and condemnation thursday over the slaying of a soldier in a @entity0 street by attackers who said they were acting to avenge @entity3 deaths overseas
but @entity3 commentators also suggested there is more that the country 's leaders can do to address issues within the @entity17 , particularly among alienated young men
@entity20 attack : latest developments according to 2011 census figures , @entity3 make up the second - largest religious group in @entity4 , with 2.7 million people
that represents an increase of 1.2 million ( from 3 % to 5 % of the population ) since 2001
the suspected attackers in the @entity20 slaying , who are hospitalized under police guard , claimed to be acting for @entity31 , but it 's not yet clear if they were affiliated with any group
" the only reasons we killed this man ... is because @entity3 are dying daily , " said one of the suspects , wielding a cleaver with bloody hands , in video aired by @entity1 affiliate @entity39
" this @entity4 soldier is an @entity44 , a tooth for tooth , " he said
" we swear by almighty @entity47 we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone
" the @entity49 condemned what it called " a truly barbaric act that has no basis in @entity31
" read more : @entity0 attack mirrors plot to behead @entity3 soldier it urged @entity3 and @entity57 alike " to come together in solidarity to ensure the forces of hatred do not prevail
" @entity61 and social commentator @entity62 also urged restraint
" what we have seen on the streets of @entity0 has been particularly sickening , a really , really heinous act of i would say criminality -- and i 'm being careful to say criminality , not terrorism , " he told @entity1
the motivation for what happened in @entity20 remains unclear , he pointed out
" what we need at this time is a sense of calm , a sense of measure and a sense of perspective
what we do n't need are knee - jerk reactions ... to really ratchet up tensions and really stoke and inflame anxieties within communities
" @entity87 , of the @entity4 @entity88 , described the attack as shocking , but said there had been failures by both the @entity4 government and the @entity17 when it came to tackling extremism in @entity4
@entity0 attack : terrorist targeting soldiers at home again ? the @entity4 government is " completely denying that it has anything to do with the political situation around the @entity3 world , " including its foreign policy , he said
@entity4 has been involved in wars in @entity104 and @entity105
at the same time , @entity3 organizations " have failed their own community by not teaching these young , angry men how to get a democratic change to this policy that 's ruining so many lives , " he said
he said @entity3 leaders were unwilling to bring about change , saying they preferred to debate minor theological issues than take practical steps to educate young people about political action
as a result , young people 's outrage over what is happening in the @entity3 world is creating a " blow - back " effect as they take violent action in the @entity126 , he said , as seen with the @entity128 bombings
the attack in @entity4 is " very , very sad , " he added , but reflects an anger bubbling under the surface that could boil over at any time
' heads in the sand ' @entity136 , of the @entity137 for the @entity138 at @entity139 , said wednesday 's attack appeared to reflect a tactical shift by terror network @entity142 toward targeted rather than mass casualty attacks
the suspects may have been radicalized online , he suggested , although police have as yet released no details in the @entity20 case
authorities have been trying to counter radical websites and messages , but it 's a difficult task , @entity136 said
witness : attackers ' were just animals ' alongside that , @entity136 said he believes @entity3 leaders in @entity4 can and should do more to root out radicalization in the community
" a lot of @entity3 leaders have had their heads in the sand for a very long time , " he said
" a lot of @entity3 leaders in this country were n't born here , they do n't speak the language necessarily , they do n't understand a lot of the pressures and debates and issues that young @entity3 are having
" there has been a sense of inertia in some cases , he said , and @entity3 communities have n't always reacted as quickly as they should have
there has been a small shift in the right direction with the emergence of new community groups and civil society initiatives , he said , but changes need to happen faster
" we need to have a very strong counter-narrative to the ideas of @entity142 , " he said , which suggest that there is a war against @entity3 led by non-muslims
" we need a civic identity , we need to make people understand that we are all @entity4 citizens , we are all part of this society
whether you disagree with a particular issue or not , there are ways to voice your feelings , and killing a serviceman is not one of those
" there is apprehension across @entity4 , not just in @entity0 , in the face of demonstrations by groups like the far - right @entity208 , he said
as each side gets more radical , it fuels the other , he said -- and that has consequences for the vast majority of people who do not share those opposing views
" ordinary people always get caught up in the crossfire of extremism , " he said
