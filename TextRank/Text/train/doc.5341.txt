@entity0 was born without a trachea but now has one made from plastic fibers and a stew of her own stem cells
the 2 - year - old @entity7 @entity6 has spent every day of her life in intensive care , kept alive by a tube that substituted for the windpipe that was supposed to connect her mouth to her lungs
but nearly a month after her transplant , the toddler is mostly breathing on her own and is responding to doctors and nurses
the surgery , pioneered by dr. @entity20 , director of the @entity21 at the @entity22 in @entity23 , was only the sixth performed in the world , and @entity0 was the youngest patient and first to receive the transplant in the @entity27
the procedure was approved by the @entity29 as an experimental operation for patients with very little hope of survival ; being born without a trachea is fatal in 99 % of cases
@entity36 : stem cell therapies may cure chronic conditions @entity20 performed the nine - hour operation on april 9 at the @entity40 of @entity41 after carefully creating the windpipe using stem cells from @entity0 's bone marrow that were saturated over a matrix of plastic fibers shaped into a tube
exactly what happens to the windpipe after it is transplanted is n't clear , but researchers believe that placing stem cells , which are capable of developing into different types of body cells , can pick up signals from their environment and integrate with existing tissues
@entity20 told the @entity57 that the body 's regenerative capabilities may help such bioengineered organs to integrate with existing tissues
children may make the ideal patients for these procedures since they have natural and active abilities to heal and grow
" @entity0 's transplant has completely changed my thinking about regenerative medicine , " he told the @entity57 , adding that he wants to conduct a clinical trial in the @entity27
for children born with a windpipe defect or without one , and for others with defective or diseased organs , manipulating stem cells to generate healthy tissues or organs could be their only chance at survival
@entity36 : cancer patient receives a man - made windpipe @entity20 performed all five of the previous transplants of the bioengineered windpipes ; four of the patients have done well , while one , @entity87 , who received his trachea in @entity23 , died
last year , in describing @entity87 ' operation , @entity90 's @entity89 wrote : " @entity20 has been perfecting the process of using stem cells to seed bioengineered scaffolds for organs like the trachea since 2008 ; in his first such procedure , he used a donor trachea to replace that of a @entity100 woman , stripping the organ of its cells and coating it with the woman 's own stem cells
but using a completely synthetic , bioengineered matrix such as the one transplanted in @entity107 , he says , makes the transplant safer for the patient , potentially sparing him the complications that can arise if he ca n't accept the new organ
" researchers have used similar stem - cell - seeding techniques to create other organs
dr. @entity115 at @entity116 generated bladders and a urethra using scaffolds and patients ' stem cells
" because of the small number of patients he has treated , his critics say it 's hard to determine how valid @entity20 's bioengineering technique is in treating patients like @entity0
but he plans to conduct a clinical trial to properly assess the risks and benefits of the procedure , and document how bodies react to the transplanted devices
hopefully those trials will show that it 's possible to regenerate not just organs but hope as well
