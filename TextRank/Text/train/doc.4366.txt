-- @entity1 will kick off its annual @entity4 developers ' conference wednesday in @entity5 , but ceo @entity6 wo n't be speaking there
he also was a no - show at thursday 's annual stockholders meeting and is expected to miss the company 's quarterly earnings call next month
left to explain @entity6 's unexpected absence at the shareholder 's meeting , @entity1 executive chairman @entity11 told attendees that @entity6 had " lost his voice " and " ca n't do any public speaking engagements for the time being
" in an e-mail to employees the same day , @entity6 wrote , " there is nothing seriously wrong with me , " a person familiar with the matter told the @entity26
the company issued a statement thursday saying , " @entity6 has lost his voice
this means he ca n't do any public speaking engagements for the time being , including today 's shareholder meeting , @entity4 next week and our earnings call in mid july
" @entity6 will , of course , continue to run the company and he will be involved in all the strategic business decisions we make
" there is no evidence that @entity6 , who has long been reluctant to speak in public , is seriously ill. but four days later , @entity1 has had nothing else to say on the matter , and analysts and bloggers are getting restless
news sites have speculated about @entity6 's " mystery @entity46 , " and @entity1 's stock has been trending down since late last week
" we have no specific reason to think there is anything more to @entity6 's condition , but we find it odd that the company would already rule him out of the @entity59 call , which is likely still a few weeks away , " said @entity48 , an analyst at @entity49
" we think this could raise some questions among investors
" @entity63 : where 's @entity6 ? investors deserve to know " we have absolutely no idea what is going on , " said @entity63 's assistant managing editor , @entity66 , in a video report monday
" we can only hope that it 's nothing serious , maybe just a really bad case of laryngitis , and he 's under doctor 's orders not to speak
" observers point out that while @entity6 's health may be a private matter , @entity1 is a publicly traded company
" there should n't be any mystery ( here ) , " @entity66 added
" @entity1 should own up to whatever it is
... it could stop , maybe , any rumors from going around
" the health of a tech giant 's ceo may bear extra scrutiny at a time @entity89 is still recovering from the death last fall of @entity93 chief @entity92
many investors and others criticized @entity93 for failing to disclose details about @entity92 ' condition
@entity6 , 39 , is one of @entity1 's two co-founders and took over as ceo last year after @entity11 became chairman
" not being able to speak hardly puts someone on the same path as @entity92 , nor does it keep him from making key decisions or pointing his company in the right direction
it 's also possible the full extent of what 's ailing him is n't known , " wrote @entity106 on monday in the @entity107
but " more specific information could calm any rattled nerves of investors , keep customers from worrying , and stop remote diagnoses from being offered in the press , " she added
" more than likely , the matter would cease to be an issue : everyone would say " get well soon , " and move on
