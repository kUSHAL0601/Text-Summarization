-- days after photographing scenes at the @entity4 in @entity5 , a @entity2 veteran found himself behind bars -- where he could remain for a decade -- for alleged passport fraud
former @entity10 petty officer 2nd class @entity8 was arrested in april , spending friday like many others in a federal detention center in @entity13
a federal indictment says @entity8 ' failed to acknowledged that he 'd once applied for a passport when filling out a new application , something his lawyer @entity18 calls an innocent oversight -- albeit one punishable by up to 10 years in prison , if he 's convicted
his case has triggered an online and letter - writing campaign from @entity8 ' supporters , including an effort to raise $ 10,000 for his release on bond
" he put his life on the line , " said friend @entity27 , a veteran herself who met @entity8 in nursing school
" i am not going to allow anyone to belittle his service to his country
" the @entity36 for the @entity37 of @entity38 , via spokeswoman @entity39 , declined to comment on @entity8 ' case , because it is still active
@entity41 -- a spokeswoman for the @entity42 , which investigates passport fraud -- similarly would not address the matter because it was an " ongoing investigation
" the grand jury indictment claims that @entity8 " did knowingly and willfully make a false statement " on an april 2006 passport application completed in @entity48
specifically , @entity8 said that he had never before requested a @entity10 passport , " when in truth ... and as the defendant ... knew , he had previously applied , " according to the indictment
the @entity42 calls passports " the most highly valued travel document in the world
" the department opened 5,282 investigations into passport and visa fraud worldwide last year , leading to 1,680 arrests
" @entity68 " @entity62 , a @entity63 accountant and a former @entity2 pilot , said that his friend @entity8 started filling out a passport application in 2004 but did n't finish it
when he filled out another application two years later , @entity8 checked " no " next to the question about whether he 'd completed an application previously -- assuming that was the right answer , since his previous attempt was n't complete
but five years later , in march , a warrant was issued for @entity8 ' arrest -- at the same time he was in @entity5 working as a military photographer , according to @entity62
he returned to the @entity10 on april 10 , and was arrested nine days later , @entity27 said
" when you have a good - hearted person who serves their country and is doing everything the right way , we need to have some leniency , " said @entity62 , who is trying to raise the bond money for @entity8
adding to the complexity of the case is the fact that @entity8 is not a @entity10 citizen -- something that , according to his attorney , he learned only recently and did not factor into his arrest
@entity94 had been told by his mother that he was born in @entity13 , and he had a social security number and birth certificate , added @entity62
his friend said he fears that , if @entity8 is released on bond ( or even if he 's exonerated on the passport fraud charge ) , he 'll be detained and possibly deported to the @entity101 , where his mother hails from
but @entity102 , a spokeswoman for @entity103 , said that the agency does n't have a detainer for @entity8 , which would be used to keep him in federal custody on immigration charges
the questions of his citizenship notwithstanding , @entity8 has served in the @entity10 military since graduating from high school , said @entity62
that includes one tour of duty in @entity114 as an @entity116 photographer , before he switched to the @entity117 -- in part so he could attend nursing school , in hopes of eventually putting those skills to work in the military , @entity62 said
" he is committed to the country
he 's committed to always doing the right thing , " @entity62 said of his friend
" he 's a leader , he 's an overachiever , and he 's super-friendly
" a document , provided to @entity0 by @entity62 as authorized by @entity2 vice admiral @entity127 , indicates that @entity8 had secret clearance while at @entity4
in an evaluation report , one superior lauds @entity8 as " a team player ... with a strong work ethic and desire to learn " and recommends him for promotion
" @entity8 is eager to tell the military story and to further the the image and success of @entity10 service members , " wrote petty officer 1st class @entity135
@entity27 , who said she had no idea where @entity8 was until this week , has started a fledgling @entity143 group entitled " @entity144 be a free man ! ! " to raise awareness and support
@entity10 sen. @entity148 , a @entity150 @entity149 , is one of those legislators who have received letters on the subject , while @entity62 said that @entity10 sen. @entity154 , @entity38 , has taken particular interest in the case
meanwhile , @entity62 said , the @entity157 is among those federal agencies going after @entity8 -- for falling behind on his student loans , related to his nursing studies , while he 's been behind bars
according to @entity18 , a bond hearing is scheduled next week
@entity39 , from the @entity36 , said that a calendar call hearing will take place june 28 , at which point more details -- including a possible trial date -- could be finalized
meanwhile , @entity62 said that his normally upbeat friend is struggling to keep up his morale while in federal detention
" he 's extremely upset , but he 's dealing with it as best he can , " @entity62 said
" he just says , ' tell me it 's all going to be ok
