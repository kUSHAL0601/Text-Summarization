-- @entity1 have overtaken rivals @entity2 at the top of the @entity5 table after a double from @entity7 saw the champions defeat @entity9 2 - 0 on sunday
@entity7 's brace gives the defending champions a one point lead over rivals @entity2 , as @entity14 's side surrendered top spot following a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity17
both sides were playing on sunday following disappointing @entity20 defeats on thursday at the hands of @entity22 and @entity23 respectively
@entity1 were outplayed in their 3 - 2 home defeat by @entity22 , but they put that performance behind them to brush aside a 10 - man @entity9 side in comfortable fashion
@entity30 striker @entity7 made the breakthrough 10 minutes from half - time , diverting @entity34 's cross past former @entity1 goalkeeper @entity35 for his 23rd goal of the season
and @entity1 's stranglehold on the game became even stronger midway through the second half when the visitors had @entity44 defender @entity43 sent off for a second bookable offense
@entity1 made the three points safe in the 71st minute when @entity7 scored from the penalty spot after @entity48 had been brought down by @entity49
meanwhile , @entity2 , who lost 1 - 0 in @entity51 three days previously , were always struggling against a @entity17 side that are difficult to beat at home
and the hosts should have taken a sixth minute lead when they were awarded a penalty after @entity57 was fouled by goalkeeper @entity58
however , @entity58 atoned for his error by diving to his right to keep out @entity63 's weak spot - kick
but @entity2 's expensively - assembled side struggled throughout the 90 minutes and it was no surprise when they finally fell behind with seven minutes remaining
a mistake from defender @entity67 saw @entity57 collect the ball , and he crossed for unmarked substitute @entity69 to head home the winner
those results see @entity1 overtake their neighbors to lead the table on 67 points , one ahead of @entity2 , with @entity77 a distant third another 13 points adrift
meanwhile , @entity79 remain bottom of the table despite recovering to earn a 1 - 1 draw at @entity82 in sunday 's other match
@entity85 netted a second half equalizer for the visitors and , although @entity79 are still propping up the rest of the division , there are just four points between the bottom five teams .
