-- what started as the @entity3 movement in @entity4 in september has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth
here is a roundup of some of the movement 's recent developments : @entity14 , @entity15 the @entity16 placed two police officers on administrative leave after video of them pepper - spraying non-violent protesters at point - blank range sparked outrage at school officials
the chancellor of the @entity16 , established a task force saturday to look into an incident in which a police officer sprayed seated protesters with pepper spray at point blank range
see full story on @entity16 incident @entity33 told @entity0 's @entity34 that she considered the police action on friday " unacceptable , " but stressed she has no plans to step down
" we really want to look into this very carefully and take action ... make sure that it will never happen again on our campus , " she said
one of the protesters hit by the spray told @entity0 's @entity34 that she was still feeling some after - effects saturday evening
" i was shocked , " said @entity45
" when students are sitting on the ground and ( have ) no way of moving to be violent , being totally peaceful , i do n't understand the use of pepper spray against them
" on saturday evening , as @entity33 left campus , dozens of students sat cross-legged and with their arms linked in a silent protest
a reporter asked @entity33 , " do you still feel threated by the students ? " " no , " she said
" no. " photos : navigating a mob on a ' day of action ' @entity61 , @entity62 the crowd at the @entity65 forum in @entity61 erupted in applause as @entity68 president contender @entity67 said the occupy protesters need to " go get a job , right after you take a bath
" " all the @entity73 starts with the premise that we all owe them everything , " he said
" they take over a public park they did n't pay for , to go nearby to use bathrooms they did n't pay for , to beg for food from places they do n't want to pay for , to obstruct those who are going to work to pay the taxes to sustain the bathrooms and to sustain the park , so they can self - righteously explain they are the paragons of virtue to which we owe everything
" now , that is a pretty good symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country , and why you need to reassert something by saying to them , ' go get a job right after you take a bath
' " @entity103 , @entity15 @entity103 police on sunday cleared an encampment set up by occupy protesters a day earlier in a vacant city lot
the removal took place without incident
no arrests nor injuries were reported , according to a city news release
" @entity103 , not unlike many cities across the country , supports upholding free speech and peaceful forms of expression , but the cost of the encampments is growing and putting a strain on our already fragile resources -- police , public works , and other @entity129 staff , " @entity103 mayor @entity114 said in a statement
the encampment was set up saturday night when protesters tore down a chain link fence surrounding the lot and put up tents as police watched , but did not intervene
the lot is in a district of shops and nightclubs , and the new @entity3 venue did not sit well with some residents
" i do n't want it in my front yard , my backyard nor my side yard , " resident @entity142 told @entity0 affiliate @entity147
" this is not the way to do it
this is not the way to do it at all
" @entity151 protesters unfurled a black banner from the roof of the historic @entity156 building saturday that said , " @entity157
" they vowed to would stay inside until the vacant building was converted for community use
the school , built in 1869 , served as a homeless shelter in recent years until it was shuttered in 2008
protesters say they are against a city plan to sell it for private use
officers later led the demonstrators out and placed them in police vans .
