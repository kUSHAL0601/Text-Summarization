@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 has re-ignited the so - called gender war that shone so brightly after the country 's prime minister 's blistering attack on sexism and misogyny in parliament earlier this month
@entity12 's tirade , which drew global attention , and at the time of writing had been viewed almost two million times on @entity17 , was directed at the opposition leader , @entity18
" the leader of the opposition says that people who hold sexist views and who are misogynists are not appropriate for high office
well , i hope the leader of the opposition has got a piece of paper and he is writing out his resignation , " @entity12 blared
@entity18 's @entity29 took deep offense
had the prime minister conflated or confused " sexism " and " misogyny , " or worse , deliberately distorted the meaning of misogyny to score a resounding political point ? was @entity12 seriously asserting that her opposite number held a pathological hatred of women , as most dictionaries define misogyny ? for the @entity29 , it seemed a bit rich that the prime minister saw misogyny in @entity18 but not in one of her own supporters , the former speaker of the house who resigned in disgrace following sms texts widely viewed as meeting the dictionary definition of misogyny
into the fray weighed @entity3 's leading dictionary
editor @entity52 surprised the nation wednesday by declaring @entity2 would alter its definition of misogyny , closer to the conflated version used by the prime minister
in its next published edition , the dictionary 's editors said the word would be defined as both the " hatred of women " and " entrenched prejudice against women
" @entity52 said @entity2 had decided that for the past 20 or 30 years , " misogyny " had taken on wider meaning , particularly in feminist discourse and that with changed usage should come a changed definition
" you 're not really saying they [ misogynists ] have a pathological sickness , that they should be on a psychiatrist 's couch discussing their early relations with their mother or anything like that , " she told the @entity69 ( @entity69 )
" they merely have what we think of as sexism , an entrenched prejudice against women , " she added
and so , @entity85 , who said she sees herself as the " person with the mop and the broom and the bucket who 's cleaning up the language after the party 's over , " decided that after this " fairly big party , " the word misogyny needed mopping
@entity18 has refused to buy into the debate , dismissing the issue as the latest outbreak of the " politics of smear
" but the decision has divided @entity3
as " @entity106 , " a reader of the @entity69 website , put it : " this is just ludicrous ! a prominent figure misuses a word -- and gets embarrassingly caught out for doing so by anyone who understands the @entity111 language or who can read a dictionary -- and so the @entity114 decides to redefine the word to match the prominent person 's intended meaning
... is the @entity2 also going to redefine ' misandry ' , or is it only accusatory and inflammatory words used by women against men that need to have their definition broadened to save embarrassment ? " for the record , @entity2 has said that it 's also considering redefining " misandry , " which it says currently covers " entrenched prejudice rather than hatred
" even for those who applauded @entity12 's speech , the dictionary 's move seemed odd and unhelpful
comedian and columnist @entity135 said the debate over dictionary definitions was " reductive and pointless
" she said she thought questioning the prime minister 's use of the word misogyny detracted from what she said was @entity12 's triumph -- calling out sexism -- and diminished the speech to a whine
" ... if the only way to have any kind of debate about gender in this country is to play the dictionary card , we ask @entity2 to change the definition of complaining to ' women defending their right to take part in public and private life without being ridiculed , negated or abused on the basis of their gender
' " @entity162 found an army of supporters
one of them wrote : " it is obvious that many males and alas females ca n't accept the idea that the behavior the prime minister called out is misogynistic
much easier for their conscience that the word be attacked as the wrong word than face the truth of the situation
" one female who believes the new definition of misogyny is silly is prominent @entity181 columnist @entity180 who wrote : " he ( @entity18 ) is now just to be officially accused of exhibiting entrenched prejudice rather than having a " visceral hatred '' of half the world 's population
it must be like the 2012 version of a mortal as opposed to a venal sin
guilty as charged , apparently , " she wrote
@entity180 continued : " what is even more astonishing though is how so much of the feverish argument has seamlessly managed to equate @entity12 's attack on @entity18 into a general and principled assault on the evils of sexism or misogyny , however defined
" the thing about fevers is that they can be catchy
following the @entity2 decision , the @entity204 dictionary @entity202 has said it is closely following developments in @entity3
@entity202 associate editor @entity207 told the @entity3 newspaper ( itself , experiencing fever at the change of definition ) : " a quick review of our citational evidence shows that ' misogyny ' has been used to refer to a very broad range of behaviors , attitudes , policies , and so on ...
no dictionary definition is set in stone
we will continue to gather evidence of the word ' misogyny ' in use , and compare our definition against that use
" watch out @entity227 , who like @entity18 , is trying to mend his image with female voters , after his statement in the second @entity231 that he 'd been brought " whole binders full of women " by women 's groups after he issued a plea for qualified women to work in his @entity237 government .
