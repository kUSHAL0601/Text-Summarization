-- the @entity1 and @entity2 cut diplomatic ties during the 1979 hostage crisis , and relations between the two countries today can only be described as tense
but that did n't stop a sharp - shooting @entity1 basketball player from winding up his professional career in the @entity11 republic
@entity12 -- a six - foot point guard who competed internationally for 10 years after playing college ball -- was one of 13 @entity1 recruited by the @entity14 in the fall of 2008
he joined @entity2 's only non-government - sponsored team , in the cultural center of @entity18 , mostly " out of curiosity " -- and immediately fell in love with the country
" @entity2 was beautiful , " @entity12 said
" i saw something i 'd never really seen on the news , heard from people or read in the newspaper
" what he saw was the generosity of the people -- they treated him to dinners , took him on tours of historic landmarks and welcomed him , a non-muslim from the @entity33 , into their homes
a native of @entity36 in the @entity37 , @entity12 starred in both basketball and soccer for @entity40 in @entity41
he decided to pursue a professional basketball career overseas , excelling as a shooter and playmaker on teams from @entity46 and @entity47 to @entity48 and @entity49
he stunned family and friends when he decided to play in @entity2 , where he averaged 26 points a game and eight assists as the team captain
now retired from playing , his memories extend well beyond the basketball court
" sometimes you have to go out there and see it for yourself , " the 32 - year - old said
" i thought if it 's nice then i 'm going to see one of the best things a lot of people on this side of the world will never see
" @entity12 was taken aback with the level of admiration and respect @entity2 showed toward @entity1
despite being the highest - paid player , his teammates welcomed him , introducing @entity12 to their culture and hoping to benefit from his professionalism
" they brought me in as a brother , " @entity12 explains
" and my job was to teach them how to play the game the mental way
they had skills , they could dunk and guys could shoot , but they lacked mental discipline
" @entity12 says he taught his teammates how to prepare for games , watch film and learn from scouting reports
he quickly emerged as the undisputed star and captain of @entity18 ; regularly swarmed by young @entity2 fans for his autograph
every thursday , sell - out crowds jammed the gym , with more than 3,000 fans cheering , " @entity12 ! @entity12 ! " that first year in @entity2 , @entity12 , along with another import , @entity97 @entity96 , led their team to the playoffs for the first time
" i brought a sense of belief to them , " @entity12 recalled
" when i got there , they had no playoff aspirations
once we started winning , they realized we can do something special
" by this time , @entity1 filmmaker @entity111 , intrigued with @entity12 's @entity2 adventure , had begun shooting a documentary of his success with the team and how he was adapting to life in a faraway land
@entity111 and his @entity2 - @entity1 wife @entity118 said they were fascinated by the notion of an @entity1 playing basketball " in a land allegedly full of nukes " and enjoying every minute of it
in his initial conversations with the couple , @entity111 said , " he had us on the floor laughing
" " @entity118 and i looked at each other and said if he 's as clever and funny as he is on @entity131 then i 'll stay in @entity2 and we 'll make this film , " @entity111 said
but @entity12 , who also played for @entity133 in the @entity2 league until this year , had no idea he was about to become the star of what initially struck him as a 24/7 reality show
" i was starting to think this was like ' @entity140 , ' or some craziness , " he said
" i was like , man , i ai n't gon na do this
" but @entity111 and @entity118 hoped to make @entity12 's story much deeper than his basketball because he was breaking cultural barriers
for instance , @entity12 became close friends with three @entity2 women , rare in a country where the sexes are forbidden from interacting in public
the bonding began with @entity154 , the team physical therapist , and two friends who became @entity12 's translator and driver
the relationships gave @entity12 his first sense of human rights issues in @entity2 , especially the inequality between the sexes
" it was really bad for women
once i got to know some of the ladies it was so ... it was even worse , " he says
" most of the women are so highly educated and ca n't use it to their potential
" but the filmmakers insist their documentary -- " @entity174 " -- is not meant to be a heavy - handed political documentary on a @entity177 country fighting for its freedom
they felt that @entity12 's witty personality attracts colorful characters that bring playfulness and humor to an unusual story
" through sports we wanted to get into a society that is often misrepresented and misunderstood , " @entity111 said
" @entity12 had the same perception about these places as many @entity1 ; he just goes there and shatters them
" @entity111 continued filming the discussions and cultural exchanges @entity12 encountered both on and off court , but as the 2009 presidential elections and violent street protests took hold , it became increasingly difficult to gather footage of him on the streets of @entity201
working as a one - man band , @entity111 found himself filming non-stop for three to four hours at a time
with nothing but a backpack and endless tapes , he was extra cautious not to attract attention , often trying to blend in as a tourist
he would mail footage to his mother in @entity210 who would send it to his wife in @entity213 -- in one case , 90 hours ' worth
" i mailed 80 tapes and kept the 10 i felt had the biggest nuggets with myself , " @entity111 says
" i hid them in my underwear and socks out of fear
" that was the scariest time for me because i knew that was great footage
i knew this was potentially a really good film if it ever gets to @entity1
" @entity111 , who had been denied a journalist 's visa , freely traveled in and out of the country before his last planned trip near the end of the basketball season
shortly before the june elections he was detained in @entity2
he spent 24 hours in confinement before being sent back to the @entity1 with no explanation
on the basketball court , @entity12 was unfazed by the street protests
however , off court he found himself enmeshed in the tangle of politics , current affairs and sports
" i could see it on my teammates ' faces , " he said
" their relatives were being hurt and kidnapped
that 's when it really hit me that this thing is real , and i just could n't escape it
" @entity12 is now focusing on his after - school education program mentoring children in the @entity37
the most talented are given the opportunity to meet basketball scouts in hopes of one day following in his footsteps
while still interested in visiting his friends back in @entity2 , he admits that might be difficult
" after this documentary is released , i do n't think i will want to go back -- they 'll lock me up ! "
