the fallout over @entity3 candidate @entity2 's controversial comments on rape jolted @entity5 nationally on monday and threatened longer - term consequences for them , potentially reviving the " war on women " debate and possibly hurting their campaign to win control of the @entity3
@entity5 leaders let out a collective groan when @entity2 claimed in a television interview on sunday that " legitimate rape " rarely resulted in pregnancy , saying that " the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down
" a social conservative congressman , @entity2 apologized repeatedly as the political uproar intensified and sought to clarify his remarks , saying he misspoke
@entity23 skewered him nevertheless and many top @entity5 called for @entity2 to reconsider his decision to stay in the @entity26 race a week before they nominate @entity27 for president at their @entity30 convention
abortion moves front and center in an interview with the @entity36 , @entity27 said that @entity2 's comments on rape were " insulting , inexcusable , and , frankly , wrong
" but @entity23 sensed a political opening to shift the conversation away from the sluggish economy , saying that @entity5 led by @entity27 and his running mate , @entity42 , were pushing policies that were anti-women
@entity44 , a senior editor at the @entity45 , said @entity2 potentially reignited the " war on women " rhetoric that factored prominently in the political debate earlier this year and for a time put @entity5 on the defensive
" it plays into this @entity23 messaging that it is not a party friendly to women , " @entity44 said
" as the top political story of the day it is going to be something that plays into the larger narrative that @entity23 want in order to appeal to women voters
" a @entity62 member who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity said the issue is " is not where ( governor ) @entity27 and his ticket want to spend their time " between now and @entity70
president @entity72 handily won over women voters in the 2008 election and holds an edge with that key bloc in his race with @entity27 , polls show
a recent @entity79 survey showed @entity72 with an 8 % lead over his @entity5 rival among women
the " war on women " label stemmed in part from a fierce political fight in @entity85 this year over contraception coverage for employees of religiously affiliated institutions
@entity92 , in addition , waged a partisan fight over updates to the @entity95
the @entity27 campaign has adopted a message that @entity23 are the ones waging a " war on women
" for instance , @entity27 has accused the @entity72 's administration of failing working women
the potential longer - term implications of the @entity2 controversy also were evident in @entity5 calls for him to withdraw from his @entity3 race where incumbent @entity108 @entity107 has been trailing in the polls
republicans were concerned the flare - up would permanently harm their chances of upending @entity107 in november and push them closer to taking control of the @entity3
@entity114 , a veteran @entity5 strategist for several congressional leaders and partner at the political communications firm @entity118 , said @entity2 's comments were " politically indefensible " and " virtually guarantees " @entity107 would be re-elected
outside of @entity26 , @entity121 sen. @entity121 , locked in a tough fight in @entity123 , also called for @entity2 to step aside
@entity124 editor of the @entity124 , said he has been told by @entity5 strategists that @entity2 is now " too radioactive
" " there is a lot of national pressure being put on @entity2 that he 's not going to be able to raise @entity5 money and get the party behind him , " @entity124 said
@entity2 said he plans to remain in the race
video of the @entity2 interview with @entity26 television station @entity135 was posted online by the liberal super @entity136 .
