-- " djs are the new rock stars , " @entity0 recently declared when announcing that he -- along with @entity3 and @entity4 -- will be developing a new reality competition to find the next great dj talent
while the former " @entity8 " and current " @entity10 " judge is known for his provocative statements , he 's not usually wrong
and it looks like this time is no exception
one of the most anticipated races at the @entity15 this sunday is among the dance / electronica artists , including chart - topping @entity17 and producer @entity18 ( @entity20 ' " @entity19 " ) , festival and stadium headliner @entity21 , and the year 's breakout star , @entity26
@entity26 ( born @entity26 ) , the 24 - year - old dubstep producer best known for his album " @entity29 , " is the first - ever @entity17 nominee in the best new artist category , where he 's up against @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34
he scored a total of five @entity37 nominations , more than the biggest pop acts like @entity39 and @entity40 combined
" i almost do n't even know what it means in terms of the big picture , " he recently told @entity41
" this whole year has been insane , and these are surprises beyond my wildest fantasies because we 've come a long f --- ing way , man
people did n't believe in us and it 's pretty awesome just to get that acknowledgment
" but @entity26 admits he 's not in it for the glory
" if i did n't get ( these @entity37 nominations ) , i would still do the same exact thing , " the @entity17 said in a chat with @entity57
if i were to win a @entity37 , i just hope it opens doors to everyone else that 's amongst my peers and the people i 've grown up doing this with
" despite his newfound success , not everyone " gets " @entity26
reactions to his music range from generation - based bewilderment to genre purists ' outright hatred
" a few hundred people might be b --- - ing on a message board , but you can go to a festival and find 100,000 people dancing to my music , " he said
" no one gives a f -- k. " in the best dance / electronica category , @entity26 's " @entity29 " will compete against @entity21 ( born @entity21 ) and the house grooves of his " 4x4 = 12 " and @entity18 's " @entity89 , " which spawned ubiquitous club songs featuring @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity31 among others
rounding out the nominations is artist @entity95 for " body talk , @entity97
" those who follow the genre definitely have their thoughts
@entity101 from the @entity102 put his chips down for @entity21
" @entity21 is , at this point , the big dog of dj - producers , " @entity101 wrote
" the guy makes phenomenal songs in the studio , and he sold out to capacity this year during @entity17 gigs at @entity112 ( a fair set ) and at @entity114 at @entity115 ( a terrific set )
" and , in another first for the genre : @entity18 and @entity21 will be performing live in a special electronica / dance segment on the @entity37 stage alongside @entity121 ( their single " rope " was remixed by @entity21 ) and " @entity89 " collaborators @entity123 and @entity124
@entity18 , the veteran of the of the new crop of rock star @entity17 , with countless radio hits and two past @entity37 wins already under his belt said , " i 'm very happy that not only me , but also the dance community and dj culture is getting a lot of attention in @entity133 now finally
it 's becoming a big deal and i 'm happy about it
