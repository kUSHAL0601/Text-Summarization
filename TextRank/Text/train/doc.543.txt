@entity0 -- in an effort to confront the growing problem of global counterfeiting of @entity7 consumer goods , the government tuesday launched a campaign designed to grab the public 's attention
a series of catchy and dramatic tv and radio public service announcements and print ads were unveiled at a @entity16 event headed by attorney general @entity17 and several other administration officials
the officials stressed the negative impact the sale of tons of counterfeit goods is having on the @entity7 economy
the majority of the " knockoff " products originate in @entity29 , officials said
the low prices available from the online crime groups are hard for consumers to resist
" the lure of the bargain overcomes the moral compass every time , " said @entity33 , president and ceo of the @entity35
officials said research shows the @entity7 public believes intellectual property theft is a harmless , victimless practice
" make no mistake , @entity45 crimes are anything but victimless , " @entity17 said
" ... these crimes can destroy jobs , suppress innovation , and jeopardize the health and safety of consumers
" officials emphasized the personal danger from buying cheaper fake medicines and pills online
they also focused on the cost to artists , musicians , and others who are victims of knockoff dvds and free downloads
that message was effectively driven home by a single performer
in a dramatic new @entity67 unveiled tuesday , a young female street musician sings and plays her guitar , and watches dumbfounded as members of her audience start taking money rather than putting it in her open guitar case
the announcer then declares " illegal downloads are not victimless crimes
" the singer - songwriter @entity80 was on hand for the event .
