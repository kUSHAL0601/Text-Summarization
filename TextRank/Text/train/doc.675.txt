-- rail experts tuesday questioned the effectiveness of one step being taken by @entity5 's @entity4 to ensure safety one week after the derailment of a speeding commuter train killed four people and injured dozens of others
the @entity11 , which operates the railroad , said late sunday that " alerter " systems -- which require engineers to respond to alerts , sound an alarm if they are unresponsive and eventually brake the train in an emergency -- will be installed in every operator cab within the next year
currently , such systems in the engineer 's position are present in two - thirds of the railroad 's fleet
the @entity28 line train that derailed on december 1 had an alerter system in the engine car at the rear but not in the front cab , where the engineer apparently nodded off at the controls as the train approached a curve at 82 miles per hour
the engineer 's lawyer and union representatives said the train 's hypnotic motion may have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed " highway hypnosis
" man vs. machine : who should be at the wheel ? @entity49 , a @entity50 professor and expert on railway operations , said the effectiveness of " alerter " systems is debatable
" it 's not the cure all for all problems , " he told @entity0
" research has been done showing that some crews are adapting to these ' alerters ' and they 're still sleeping to the ' alerters
' it 's that whole highway hypnosis thing
" a 2007 study of " alerter " technology by @entity64 said , " engineers can become inattentive and keep hitting the alerter even when nodding off
' @entity67 ' has become a commonly used term
" the study cited a 2006 @entity71 investigation report on a freight train collision in @entity73 , @entity74 , in which escaping liquified chlorine ultimately killed the conductor and two local residents
the study said the engineer experienced what it called " alerter naps " in which he " apparently drifted in and out of micro-sleep
" " i view the alerter devices as being only partially effective , " @entity82 , a former @entity83 official who teaches at @entity84 , said in an e-mail
" during my years in the railroad industry , there have been numerous occasions when locomotive engineers have responded to alerter alarms while being in less than a fully conscious state
" while two - thirds of @entity4 's operating fleet is equipped with alerters in the engineer 's position , the remaining one - third is equipped with " dead man " controls , another safety measure which theoretically requires the conductor make continuous conscious input to keep the train running
at the time of the accident , the train was in " push mode , " meaning that the locomotive was in the rear of the train pushing it along the tracks , with engineer @entity113 in a cabin at the front operating it remotely
his cabin was equipped with a " dead man pedal " that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving , the @entity11 has said
the dead man pedal was working properly , authorities said
the newer model locomotive in the rear , however , was equipped with an alerter system which sounds a tone every 25 seconds , requiring the engineer to respond with a tap within 15 seconds while the train is in steady motion
late sunday , the @entity11 said it was taking additional safety measures : signal crews installed new protections at the bend near the @entity138 station in the @entity139 -- where the fatal derailment occurred -- to warn engineers of the speed reduction and automatically apply emergency brakes if speed is not lowered to 30 mph
by tuesday morning , the @entity11 said , @entity4 also enhanced communication between engineers and conductors to ensure trains are operated at safe speeds at four other critical curves and five movable bridges
conductors will stand with engineers at the control cab through the critical curves or they will communicate by radio
on monday , the @entity71 continued to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly crash while adding to the possibility that human error was involved
the @entity71 said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies
the board found no problems with speed sensors , the brake control unit or the train 's propulsion controller
at 7:11 a.m. that sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train 's headlights as required when it passed another train , the @entity71 said monday
it also said it believes that positive train control , a costly , high - tech system that targets human error , could have prevented the crash
the safety board has pushed the system for about 20 years
@entity181 is requiring most major railroads , including @entity4 , to install the costly systems by the end of 2015
@entity185 , an instructor at the @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity188 , advocates putting another person in the engineer 's cab of commuter trains , a practice that is common in freight trains and airplane cockpits
" it will increase the cost , of course , but the alternative that the railroads are looking at , and the federal government is trying to force on the railroads , positive train control , is certainly much more costly , " @entity185 told @entity0
" we 're into the hundreds of millions of dollars right now and we have n't even had the implementation of that system
... the problem here is that we are dealing with humans in the cabs of those locomotives and we have frailties
