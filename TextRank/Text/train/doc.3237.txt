-- a day after a jubilant first delivery , giant panda @entity1 gave birth to a second cub saturday night , but it was stillborn
@entity8 's celebrity panda gave birth to the first cub friday , to the excitement of hordes of fans watching it on public panda cams
the cub , about the size of a stick of butter , appeared to be doing well
so was its mom , who was cradling it in her den at the @entity25 's @entity24
" it is robust , healthy and fully formed , " the zoo said in a @entity28 post sunday after the cub 's first neonatal exam
after the first cub 's delivery , zoo officials said there was a 50 % chance of a twin being born by saturday
but the zoo 's second baby watch did not end so well
@entity1 's second cub arrived at 7:29 p.m. saturday
she groomed it for 17 minutes before it fell onto the floor of the den , said @entity45 , a spokeswoman for the zoo
" it lay motionless and made no sound
throughout , staff could see it visually and hear the first cub squealing , and @entity1 never set it down , " she said in a statement
after zoo staff used a device to grab the motionless cub , they realized it had developmental abnormalities and was n't fully formed
" it was never alive
a necropsy is under way , and the zoo will provide additional information tomorrow , " she said
zoo babies and other intriguing critters ' not going to relax ' the first cub is doing well , and the zoo is cautiously optimistic it will thrive
" the cub is nursing & digesting well
it is very active , very vibrant & very pink , " the @entity24 said sunday
in another post , the zoo said veterinarians observed that the cub 's heart rate was steady and its belly was full
" they could hear breath sounds from both lungs , " the zoo said
a year ago , @entity1 delivered a female cub that died within days because of lack of oxygen due to underdeveloped lungs
" after our last experience , and this is such a small cub , i am not going to relax , " said @entity88 , the zoo 's director
" we 're going to be tense for the next two or three months
" it will take two to three weeks to know the sex of the cub and zoo officials wo n't name it for 100 days , following @entity99 tradition
third pregnancy the cubs were conceived through artificial insemination , and it was the third pregnancy for @entity1 , 15
the @entity24 says the father is either their own @entity105 , 15 , or the @entity107 's @entity106 , who is about 23
the @entity24 said it also expects to know the cub 's paternity in two to three weeks
all three pandas are on loan from @entity99
@entity1 and @entity105 are already the parents of @entity114 , who was born in 2005 and is now in @entity99 , the native region for the endangered animals
endangered species @entity118 zoo officials are consulting with their @entity99 counterparts about panda reproduction and ways to encourage newborns to thrive in captivity
the giant panda is one of the world 's most endangered species , with an estimated 1,900 in existence
@entity118 welcomed its first panda twins in 26 years in july at @entity130
the twins were the first for @entity133 , who has two other offspring at that zoo , and were the product of artificial insemination as well
their father is @entity139 , also a resident at @entity130 's zoo
@entity24 experts began watching @entity1 a couple of weeks ago
the anticipation peaked when she started cradling objects
panda twins born at @entity130 @entity0 's @entity145 contributed to this report .
