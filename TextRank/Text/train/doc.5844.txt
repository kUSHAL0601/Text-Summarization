@entity0 -- rep. @entity5 is " receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder , " according to a statement released by the congressman 's office , which attributed the quote to an unidentified doctor
the @entity12 @entity11 and son of the rev. @entity5 , the civil rights leader , has not been on @entity14 since late may , and in early june his office announced he was taking a leave of absence because he was suffering from a " medical condition
" @entity5 's office on wednesday noted that information on @entity5 's status is protected by federal law , as is the information of all medical patients
at the same time , the congressman 's office released what it said was a statement from @entity5 's doctor
@entity5 's office declined to give the doctor 's name
the doctor also was quoted as saying @entity5 " is responding positively to treatment and is expected to make a full recovery
" depression in the workplace : do n't ask , do n't tell ? according to the @entity37 's @entity36 , " mood disorder " is a broad term covering a variety of neurobiological abnormalities that can include a major depressive episode , bipolar disorder and catatonia
" generally speaking , to be diagnosed with a mood disorder , your feelings must be intense , with the patient feeling either depressed , or having excessive energy for days at a time , where sleep is not needed and decision - making can be significantly hindered , or one can fluctuate between both extremes , " said @entity45 , a psychologist in private practice in @entity47 , @entity12 , and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at @entity51 in @entity52
@entity5 's illness comes as the @entity63 is examining allegations that in 2008 he or one of his associates offered to raise funds for then - @entity12 gov. @entity67 in exchange for the @entity70 seat vacated by president @entity71 going to @entity5
@entity72 : @entity5 should take all the time he needs @entity5 has maintained his innocence and pledged to continue to cooperate with authorities
" i did nothing illegal , unethical or inappropriate in that pursuit , and i believe that is what the @entity63 will conclude at the end of this process , " he said
in a separate incident , @entity5 apologized to his constituents in september 2010 , after the @entity84 reported that a @entity52 businessman told federal investigators that @entity5 had asked him to pay for a restaurant hostess to fly between @entity0 and @entity52 several times
he said he was " deeply sorry " that he had " disappointed some supporters
" a life shaped by history earlier wednesday , before @entity5 's office released the statement about his health , @entity95 in the @entity96 aired differing views on whether the younger @entity5 should reveal the details behind his leave of absence
@entity96 minority leader @entity72 , @entity100 , said @entity5 should disclose information on his own timetable , but @entity103 of @entity104 , the @entity96 minority whip , said more information should be provided
" he 's obviously facing a health problem , " @entity103 said wednesday in response to a question from @entity1
and when people get sick , they miss work
everybody in @entity112 understands that , but i think the family would be well - advised to give his constituents as much information as is appropriate
" it was a direct message from a @entity117 who had been reluctant , until now , to publicly press @entity5 for more detail
rep. @entity5 's ailments ' more serious ' than ' initially believed ' the chairman of the @entity122 told reporters wednesday he has spoken several times with members of @entity5 's " blood family " and is confident @entity5 will return from his leave of absence
rep. @entity128 , @entity129 , said there was no urgency for @entity5 or his family to come forward with any details about the absence
@entity128 told reporters outside the @entity96 chamber that " when the people in his district have become concerned , then congressman @entity5 will respond , but so far there is no evidence that there is upheaval in his congressional district
" added @entity128 : " he 's fine
he 's an old football player -- he 'll be back
" @entity128 made it clear he is in regular contact with @entity5 's family , not directly with @entity5 himself
" it 's frustrating and upsetting to me " that other @entity95 on @entity14 have called on @entity5 to provide more information , @entity128 said
every member of @entity150 deserves privacy , he added , and he cited @entity150 ' vote on a law that keeps medical information confidential
" this is not about a congressman
this is about a human being who is sick
this is not a political matter ; it 's a health matter , " he said
@entity128 said @entity5 's situation was discussed at the weekly @entity122 lunch on wednesday and added that caucus members were alarmed that other @entity95 were urging the family to provide more information
" we all agreed today , 100 % , that that should not be the way in which we deal with members of @entity150 who get ill , " @entity128 said
pressure began mounting on @entity5 , a nine - term representative , on tuesday after comments to reporters in @entity52 by fellow @entity12 @entity176 sen. @entity176
" as a public official ... there reaches a point when you have a responsibility to tell people what you 're facing and how things are going
sen. @entity185 has done that , and i think congressman @entity5 will face that , too , " @entity176 said
earlier this year , sen. @entity185 , @entity189 , suffered a stroke
he is still recovering and his office continues to give updates on his progress
more questions arose late last week , when @entity5 communications director @entity195 said , " congressman @entity5 's medical condition is more serious than we thought and initially believed
" " we have been made aware that he has grappled with certain physical and emotional ailments privately for a long period of time , " @entity195 said
initially , @entity5 's office said the congressman was suffering from " exhaustion
" @entity63 finds ' probable cause ' to suspect @entity5 misconduct @entity1 's @entity205 contributed to this report
