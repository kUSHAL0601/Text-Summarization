just not when it comes to his hotel towels
@entity0 composts when he 's at home in @entity5 , @entity6
he eats local , organic and fair - trade food and drives a @entity9 hybrid sports car
you might call him green
except he 's not so green when he travels for his work at an education nonprofit and stays in a hotel , which happens about 10 weeks per year
there , he uses a new towel every day
and do n't try to bribe him with a drink or dessert coupon to get him to reuse the same one
" i could care less about rewards for environmentally conscious behavior unless it 's miles , " @entity0 wrote in an e-mail
if hotels ca n't convince a hybrid - driving recycling enthusiast like @entity0 to go green while traveling , how can they possibly convince everyone else ? 9 glamorous movie - star hotels that 's the problem of hotels trying to " green " your hotel stay
after guests have paid a pretty penny for a night at the inn , even the most environmental guests may want to treat themselves to fresh towels every day and those little bottles of sweet - smelling shampoo
despite the fact that most people describe themselves in surveys as environmentally conscious and as preferring green products , there 's a big gap between consumer attitudes and consumer behaviors when it comes to going green , said @entity48 , a marketing professor at the @entity49
" it can be nice to have fresh towels , and not doing so is a sacrifice , " said @entity48 , whose current research focuses on the impact of hotel sustainability programs on guest satisfaction
" @entity57 requires some effort , and there 's some cost to be incurred on the part of the consumer
" guests who go green are happy nearly 90 % of hotel guests are offered the chance to do something sustainable during their stays , and about two - thirds will participate , according to @entity48 's analysis of 2011 data from the @entity72
those guests who participate in a hotel 's green programs report that they are more satisfied with their stays than guests who do not participate
participating in a hotel 's sustainability program provides " a feeling that it was good to be green , it made them feel good about themselves , and that translated to the service provider , " @entity48 said
8 getaways we wish we could afford " these guests , who are ostensibly receiving a lower level of service , report being more satisfied overall with their stay
" there 's just one catch : guests who do n't participate in voluntary sustainability programs reported the lowest levels of satisfaction with their hotel stays
" one explanation for these findings is that when people do n't live up to their ideals , and vice versa , this affects how satisfied they are with the entity that presented them this ' moral dilemma , ' " @entity48 said
sustainability is becoming the norm it makes business sense for hotels to go green : increasing sewage rates , stricter water use requirements and more recycling options are all convincing hotels to reduce their water and energy costs , said hotel industry veteran @entity116 , an environmental consultant and " green guru " for the @entity117
more than 75 % of @entity120 hotels have linen and towel reuse programs , 59 % have guest or internal recycling programs , and 46 % have a water - saving program , according to a 2012 @entity117 survey of its members
they also have " back of the house " programs that include low - flow shower heads , faucets and toilets ; energy - efficient light bulbs , high - efficiency appliances and other efforts
some are required by local governments ; others just make business sense
that translates into real dollars : the @entity120 @entity142 has found that hotels and other lodging facilities use more than 510 trillion btu of energy annually at a cost of more than $ 7.4 billion
that energy use generates 54 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions , equal to the emissions from more than 11 million passenger vehicles , according to the agency
beyond @entity153 : best cruises for 2013 the @entity142 reports that the lodging industry could save $ 745 million annually by reducing energy use by 10 %
that translates to 60 cents more revenue per room night at limited - service hotels and $ 2 at full - service hotels
annoyed that the hotel 's bottom line benefits from your sacrifice ? some hotels are trying to make water - saving behavior pay for their guests
participating @entity169 gives guests a $ 5 food and drink voucher or 500 @entity173 points for every day they decline housekeeping 's services ( except departure day )
part of the @entity179 culture some hotels are making green cool
it seems to be an easier sell for hip , higher - end chains like @entity187 's properties , which cultivate an edgier base of customers
about 85 % of hotel guests participate in the chain 's towel and sheet reuse program , said @entity194 , @entity179 's executive vice president of hotel operations
@entity195 started the boutique hotel chain by rehabbing older buildings and turning them into hotels
although @entity195 died in 2001 , the company that bears his name still has the reputation he cultivated
most locations welcome guests to mingle at a lobby cocktail hour , lounge in their animal - print robes and bring their pets on their stay
and many locations will lend guests a goldfish as part of the @entity214 program
" i think our guests expect us to push the envelope and try things that are different than what the mass - appeal hotels are doing , " @entity194 said
@entity194 's convinced that some guests do n't actually mean to ask for new towels but are much like his teenage daughter , who tosses her towels on the floor at home for no good reason
" once it 's on the floor , you 're going to get a clean towel , " he said
( hotel guests , not his daughter
) the pressure on a mid-priced chain it 's trickier for other hotel chains , where sustainability is n't necessarily part of the appeal to the customer
the mid-priced chains are competing for a more price - sensitive business and leisure traveler
@entity245 , which offers a hot breakfast at its nearly 1,900 company - owned and franchise locations across the country , has two environmentally friendly options for disposable plates , bowls and cutlery : 100 % biodegradable @entity254 or @entity255 , a resin material made from potato starch
the chain 's takeout coffee cup sleeves are made from 100 % recycled fiber , and the towel reuse program simply asks customers using a door hanger to " reuse or replace " towels
no big deal either way , the sign suggests
" we 're delivering these messages in a light - hearted way
... it 's not preachy or paternalistic , " said @entity272 , vice president of corporate responsibility for @entity274 , which owns @entity275
more happens behind the scenes at @entity275 , which benefits from @entity277 , @entity274 's company - wide sustainability system that tracks the sustainability of 200 operational practices at nearly 3,900 properties around the world
@entity274 has saved more than $ 147 million since 2008 through efficiency projects , including reporting through @entity277 , @entity272 said
satisfying the luxury guest you 'd think environmental sustainability programs would hit a roadblock with luxury guests , who want the best of everything
not so , said @entity292 , vice president of @entity294 's @entity293 , the chain 's social and environmental responsibility program
" it in no way diminishes the luxury experience , " @entity298 said
" we still have the best towels , linens and amenities
" many @entity294 guests now use the same sheets two nights in a row ( introduced in 2011 ) and hang up their towels to use another day ( introduced in 2009 )
" we 've not had a single negative guest comment but have certainly had positive guest comments , " @entity298 said
" guests want to see we 're doing the right thing
" it helps that the onus is really on the business to be responsible in its construction , hotel operations , food service and landscaping , she said
" the majority of what can be done for the environment is what we can do as a business , " @entity298 said
no matter the price point , no hotelier can afford to lose a guest because he or she does n't like the way a hotel communicates its message
even @entity195 's @entity194 said the boutique chain wo n't roll out an environmental initiative if tests show that customers do n't like it
but in @entity195 's case , @entity194 found that guests approve of their efforts
" our guest satisfaction has improved since our green initiatives were introduced , and it 's given us confidence that efforts have not deteriorated the guest experience , " he said
the tide may be turning it 's possible that younger people used to recycling and saving water will bring those attitudes into their hotel stays as they age
@entity294 's @entity298 sees children leading their parents into caring about the environment on their hotel stays
betting that more and more consumers want to choose environmentally friendly hotels right now , travel website @entity362 is launching its @entity364 program this year to let travelers know which hotels have sustainable practices
about 71 % of travelers reported that they planned to choose hotels based on sustainability over the next year , compared with 65 % in the previous survey , according to an april 2012 trip advisor survey
yet while 81 % of hotels have some green programs , almost a quarter do n't communicate that fact to their guests , said @entity362 spokeswoman @entity379
the website is accepting applications from hotels to qualify for a " @entity383 " or " @entity385 " label on the @entity362 site based on their sustainable practices
the program will rely on traveler feedback , and any discrepancies could trigger an independent audit of the hotel
that 's information that @entity395 , 33 , who always hangs up her towels at hotels to reuse them the next day , would enjoy having
" trying to limit my impact on the environment makes me feel good , " said @entity398 , assistant director of residence life at @entity400 in @entity401
" when i go against my green principles for the sake of convenience or to go with the flow , i feel bad about myself and guilty
i ca n't imagine how those feelings would enhance my vacation , which is supposed to be all about feeling good
