@entity0 -- tens of thousands of university students took to the streets of @entity0 on wednesday , @entity6 media estimated , amid heavy security to protest educational reforms planned by prime minister @entity10 's government
students say the reforms will harm their futures and @entity6 's educational system
the demonstrations came in the wake of violent protests on december 14 , after @entity10 survived a parliamentary vote that could have ended his tenure as prime minister
he pulled through by three votes
ensuing violence on that day caused an estimated 20 million euros ( $ 26 million ) damage to @entity0 's historic center when cars , garbage cans and benches were set aflame and cash machines and store windows were smashed
more than 100 people were injured , although none seriously
protesters on wednesday opted to avoid the heavily patrolled city center by aiming for the outskirts of town , where they blocked a major thoroughfare
we think the only violence is the reform the government is imposing on our country in these days , " @entity36 , a demonstrator outside @entity0 's @entity37 , told @entity1
the student marches remained peaceful into the mid-afternoon in the @entity6 capital
however , there were reports of pockets of violence in other @entity6 cities , including @entity49 and @entity50
backers of the reform say it will save @entity6 's education system by increasing transparency and reinforcing a meritocracy
students claim the reform package amounts to cuts and the privatization of the education sector
known as the " @entity63 " after education minister @entity64 , the reform was scheduled for a vote in the @entity66 wednesday , but voting is now likely to be put off until thursday
students are reaching out to @entity6 's president @entity69 and planned to meet with him later on wednesday
@entity69 has the power to block the reform 's passage by withholding his signature
a group of university neuroscience researchers were also at the march
one protester who identified herself only as @entity78 told @entity1 , " we are researchers in cognitive neuroscience and are not going to get our projects funded ... plus a lot of hospitals where we carry on our research are going to close because of budget cuts
" some estimates say the reform will result in 130,000 job losses in the education sector .
