-- if there is one clear emotion emerging before november 's @entity5 congressional elections , it is that citizens across the political spectrum are worried about government spending and a perceived lack of government accountability regarding where tax dollars are spent
oddly , the government 's approach to the illegal drug problem -- which has cost @entity5 taxpayers more than $ 2.5 trillion since former president @entity16 first declared @entity5 's " war on drugs " -- has been largely immune from this concern
@entity20 : you tell us whether it 's time to legalize pot one dramatic exception is @entity26 , where @entity27 19 , which proposes to " regulate , control and tax cannabis , " will be on the statewide ballot on november 2
in @entity26 alone , the illegal market for cannabis , or marijuana , has been estimated to be worth about $ 14 billion per year , and the legalization initiative aims to redirect the flow of these massive profits from violent drug cartels toward government coffers
although the full financial impact of legalization can not be known , cannabis law enforcement in @entity26 is estimated to cost taxpayers anywhere between $ 200 million and $ 1.9 billion each year , whereas the @entity43 has estimated that taxation could generate $ 1.4 billion a year in new tax revenue
as the vote approaches , a clear division in political support for @entity27 has emerged , with a recent @entity51 - @entity50 poll showing that 54 percent of @entity52 support legalization as @entity55 support sits at 33 percent
this division is curious , given that cannabis prohibition takes its biggest toll on the traditional conservative wish list of fiscal discipline , low crime rates and strong families
in fact , as detailed in a report published this month by my organization , the @entity62 in @entity63 , research funded by none other than the @entity5 government clearly demonstrates the failure of marijuna prohibition
for instance , government reports demonstrate that even as federal funding for anti-drug efforts has increased from $ 1.5 billion in 1981 to more than $ 20 billion today , surveillance systems show that marijuana 's estimated potency has increased by 145 percent and its price has declined by 58 percent since 1990
at a 1991 lecture titled " @entity82 as a @entity83 , " conservative economist @entity80 noted : " there are some general features of a socialist enterprise , whether it 's the post office , schools or the war on drugs
the enterprise is inefficient , expensive , very advantageous to a small group of people and harmful to a lot of people
" @entity80 , who won the @entity95 in 1976 for his achievements in the fields of " consumption analysis , " had strong views about the certain failure of the war on drugs , which are shared by most economists who stress that costly efforts to remove the drug supply by building prisons and locking up drug dealers have the perverse effect of making it much more profitable for new drug dealers to get into the market
this explains why surveillance systems funded by the @entity112 concluded that over the last 30 years , cannabis has remained " almost universally available to @entity5 12th - graders , " with between 80 percent and 90 percent saying the drug is " very easy " or " fairly easy " to obtain
@entity80 was also vocal about the unintended consequences of the war on drugs , including the enrichment of organized crime and drug market violence
as he wrote in the @entity125 : " the young are not dissuaded by the bullets that fly so freely in disputes between competing drug dealers -- bullets that fly only because dealing drugs is illegal
@entity126 epitomizes our earlier attempt at @entity129 ; the @entity130 and @entity131 epitomize this one
" in this context , consider that about 28,000 people have died in drug market violence in @entity136 since 2006 , when @entity138 president @entity137 declared a war on drugs in that country , and that the @entity5 government once estimated that @entity138 drug trafficking organizations derive 60 percent of their revenue from cannabis exports to the @entity5
the war on drugs has also had a devastating impact on families
primarily as a result of drug law enforcement , one in nine @entity151 - @entity5 males in the 25 - to - 29 age group is incarcerated on any given day in the @entity5 , despite statistics that show ethnic minorities consume illicit drugs at rates comparable to those of other ethnic groups in the @entity5 in @entity26 , where the government spends more on prisons than post-secondary education , a recent report estimated that the cannabis possession arrest rate for african - americans in @entity166 is more than 300 percent higher than that for whites
this disparity has emerged despite data from the @entity5 @entity171 , which has consistently shown that young african - americans are less likely to use cannabis than whites
in addition to both the racial and budgetary implications of this failed experiment , sociologists and criminologists are decrying the intergenerational effects of these policies on low - income families , as children left behind by incarcerated parents turn to gangs and the cycle continues
one explanation for the persistently high support for cannabis prohibition is the concern that ending the war on cannabis will result in increased use
interestingly , comparisons between the @entity5 and the @entity198 , where cannabis is de facto legalized , indicate that despite the @entity5 's record rates of anti-drug enforcement expenditures , 42 percent of @entity5 adults report that they have used cannabis , which is more than twice as high as that observed in the @entity198 , where only 20 percent report a history of cannabis use
while some @entity5 economists predict that rates of cannabis use could increase in @entity26 under legalization , they have generally ignored the potential benefits of the broad range of strict regulatory tools -- including licensing systems for vendors , purchasing controls and sales restrictions -- that have all proved effective at reducing rates of use and related harms of tobacco and alcohol
as described earlier this month in an article published in the influential @entity227 , @entity225 stressed the need for an urgent consideration of the benefits of cannabis regulatory systems , especially given that successful government lobbying by the tobacco and alcohol industries have slowly eroded or eliminated many of these effective regulatory mechanisms in the @entity5 as @entity80 said , " if you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view , the role of the government is to protect the drug cartel
" recent estimates suggest that national regulation of cannabis in the @entity5 would result in savings of more than $ 44 billion a year on enforcement expenditures alone
conservatives should look at the ongoing legacy of the failed war on drugs , in light of their traditional commitment to stronger families , economies and societies , and reconsider supporting drug policies that only serve to weaken @entity5 society
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity262 .
