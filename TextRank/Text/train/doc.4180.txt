-- when i first arrived in @entity3 's capital in 2012 , i deliberately did not visit the @entity4
i was n't sure what to expect , but i did not want that experience to influence how i approached the country and its people
in my mind , @entity3 was going to be this country that was still on the brink of economic disaster
it would be very poorly set up , with a bad road system and difficult telecommunications
frankly , i despaired of working with the government , thinking it would be extremely challenging to work with
i was a @entity18 in @entity19 and the @entity3 genocide , right on the heels of @entity23 's election in @entity24 , was big news across the continent
the child - run household i met after the genocide when i was assigned to @entity3 18 years later , my first thought was the genocide -- this is probably true for most people
but when i asked friends and colleagues who had lived there for advice , they spoke highly of the country and her people
i started seeing this as another adventure on this continent that i love , though i had visions of the film " @entity48 " resounding in my mind
those preconceptions were quickly dispelled once i got there
when you get to @entity3 , you are hit by the incongruity that strikes so many : how could such a horrible thing have happened in such a beautiful country ? the nickname @entity3 is not an exaggeration
@entity3 's countryside is dotted with what appear to be literally a thousand hills that are a mixture of mountains , volcanoes and hillocks
the beauty is reflected in the people : @entity3 are incredibly friendly and hospitable
but just as you can not see the other side of a mountain , you can not always tell what is going on behind those eyes
@entity3 obey their country 's many rules
i love that , to reduce pollution , plastic bags are forbidden and even taken from you when you arrive at the airport ! for anyone who has spent time in @entity24 , it 's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles , drivers and passengers alike , both in @entity4 and in the countryside
national pride and a commitment to the idea that @entity3 should lead the development of their country are strong
from them came the concept of @entity93 , or community service
during the last saturday of each month , citizens do some type of community work in their neighborhood , like picking up garbage or cutting the grass
if they do not show up , they 're fined an amount determined by the neighborhood leader
( these days the neighborhoods are like anywhere else : some are made up of different tribes and ethnicities and others are homogenous
) amid the beautiful parks and tea plantations are the somber genocide memorials found in virtually every community
they serve as a daily reminder to never forget the atrocities
at the same time , they allow for personal reflection on mankind 's capacity for both evil and resilience
four months after my arrival , i was ready to see the @entity4
i was glad i had waited
you walk alongside slabs of cement : a mass grave where over 250,000 people killed in @entity4 are buried
at the end of one of the cement tombs is a wall with names , an attempt to identify some of the souls lost during the tragic 100 days of the genocide
you almost weep when you realize they will never identify them all
one room tells the tale of other genocides or " cleansing " events in history around the world , reminding us that the international community has not been diligent about the oft - quoted pledge , " never again
" and in the room dedicated to children who were killed -- you see their names , what they enjoyed doing and who was their best friend -- your heart starts to tear
i was never able to actually read all the remembrances to these children
though i have always considered myself a pretty tough and realistic humanitarian worker , i had never seen anything like this
a single visit ensures that the memorial realizes its purpose -- you will never forget
it 's an experience that makes you wonder how any society can come back together after something that tears so deeply
but i know from what i had seen , and from my organization 's work , that it is possible
many genocide survivors and perpetrators have since been able to seek and grant forgiveness and now live peacefully , side by side
i watched a woman tear up and embrace a man who had killed her family
witnessing these scenes is almost surreal , but deeply moving and humbling
could i ever forgive ? could i ever confess and ask for forgiveness ? looking at @entity3 today with a certainty that such an atrocity can never happen again , you wonder " how did this ever happen in the first place ? " when @entity3 say " never again , " i believe them
but when i look at the international community , those words do n't have the same meaning
are we really a community in which most of us watched this suffering and death from the sidelines ? it will happen again somewhere else
we 've seen it in history
in march of this year , i was asked to head our program in the @entity201
the lessons from @entity3 still echoing in my head , i was compelled to say " yes " to a country being torn apart by intercommunal fighting , just as @entity3 had been
my time in @entity3 has shown me the limitations of what the international community will do in situations like this , but also taught me lessons and given me hope
just 20 years ago , @entity3 went through genocide , but they came back and they came back quickly
i attribute a lot of that to the strong will , the leadership and most importantly , to the resiliency of the @entity3 people
i pray that we can realize the same here in @entity201
and we can , with a little influence and a lot of political will .
