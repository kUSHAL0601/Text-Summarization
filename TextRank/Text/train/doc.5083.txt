-- @entity2 writer and director @entity1 has been hailed as the modern master of macabre
the master of macabre , @entity1 did n't start out in film aiming to make horror movies
his 1998 film " @entity10 " -- adapted from a novel by @entity12 , the @entity2 @entity13 -- redefined the horror genre , propelled @entity1 into the international spotlight and soon had @entity17 calling
born in @entity18 , @entity2 , in 1961 , @entity1 enrolled at the @entity19 to study journalism
on graduating he went on to work in @entity2 's @entity21 , the same place where renowned director @entity23 started out
he did n't ' start out aiming to make horror films , but it was @entity21 that @entity1 met @entity26 , the screenplay writer for " @entity10
" an international hit , " @entity10 " centers on a cursed videotape that kills whoever watches it
it appeared in cinemas at the same time mainstream western horror films were churning out gruesome violence as the means to get audiences hiding behind their popcorn
@entity1 's artfully directed and terrifying film was a nether - world away from these schlock horror and slasher flicks , instead utilizing suspense and a pervading sense of dread
@entity48 audiences expecting to watch good - looking teenagers getting chopped up in a blizzard of gore were treated to something much creepier
for @entity17 producers , @entity1 has been a gold - mine of remake material
if dread is the word that has become synonymous with @entity1 's work , there was a great sense of it among many of @entity1 's fans when it was announced that there would be a @entity17 remake of " @entity10 , " starring @entity66
despite fans claiming that the terror of the original was lost in translation , @entity1 himself was given the opportunity to direct the @entity17 sequel , " @entity73 , " in 2005
the series ' success has spawned a third installment , due to be released in 2009 that @entity1 will also be directing
shunning computer generated monsters or gallons of fake - blood and guts , " @entity10 " and other @entity90 films including " @entity91 , " which was also remade by @entity17 in 2005 , use glimpses of mysterious abstract images -- a reflection in a tv screen , an unsettling , spreading damp patch of water -- to ratchet up the terror
fans and critics have compared the chilling atmosphere of his films with that of @entity98 's work , in " @entity99 " and " the tenant
" @entity1 then has been credited with turning on a whole new audience to @entity103 horror films with an altogether more subtle approach to scaring the wits out of people
he reveals the finer points of his scare tactics to @entity109 on @entity110 this weekend
