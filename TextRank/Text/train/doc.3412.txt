@entity0 says she was misquoted
she says she was n't being dismissive of the women who 've accused @entity3 of sexual assault when she came to the comedian 's defense in an online interview
" i am a woman
i would never do that , " she said on @entity10 's " @entity8 with @entity9 " on wednesday
' forget these women ' @entity13 played @entity14 , @entity3 's tv wife , on the groundbreaking @entity16 sitcom " @entity17
" @entity3 's now been accused of harassing , drugging and sexually assaulting multiple women
and in an interview with @entity20 , @entity13 said she never saw any indication of the behavior that the women have attributed to @entity3
" forget these women , " @entity13 is quoted as telling the outlet
" what you 're seeing is the destruction of a legacy
and i think it 's orchestrated
i do n't know why or who 's doing it , but it 's the legacy
and it 's a legacy that is so important to the culture
" fast forward to wednesday night
@entity13 says the @entity20 piece did n't accurately reflect what she said -- especially the " forget these women " part
" that was a misquote
that is not what i said , " @entity13 said
" what i said is , ' this is not about the women
this is about something else
this is about the obliteration of legacy
' " in a wednesday post , @entity54 , the columnist who wrote the @entity20 article , denied that he misquoted @entity13 , but wrote that he understands how her words were taken out of context
" she did n't mean for it to be taken the way it was , and i should have punctuated
there was never the meaning in ' forget those women ' that she was saying to actually forget or dismiss then
" he continued , " she meant , ' those women aside ' -- as in , she 's not talking about that , she 's talking about @entity3 's legacy being destroyed
i am really sorry if the way i presented it made it seem like either one of us was forgetting anyone
" @entity78 calls @entity13 out in coming to the defense of her tv husband , @entity13 has now waded into a controversy that continues to dog @entity3
more than 20 women have come forward with claims , and a defamation lawsuit has been filed against @entity3
on wednesday , attorney @entity78 brought out three more women -- @entity88 , @entity89 and a woman who chose to be identified only as @entity91 -- who say they were sexually assaulted by the comedian after being drugged by him
while introducing the women , @entity78 addressed @entity13 's statements to @entity20
" @entity0 , you should be supporting these women rather than joining @entity3 's paid ' attack dogs ' who are trying to undermine them in any way that they can , " @entity78 said
@entity3 stays mum and @entity3 ? he 's maintaining his silence -- as he 's done while his reputation suffers
he was in @entity105 , @entity106 , on wednesday night for a standup appearance
a few dozen protestors rallied outside , but the show went on without a hitch
larger protests are planned for thursday night 's shows
after his set , @entity3 released a statement thanking attendees
" i would like to personally thank you for giving me the opportunity to bring laughter back into your lives tonight , " he said
also , i would like to applaud all of you and give you a standing ovation for respecting yourselves , the theatre ( @entity123 ) and the event organizers that produced a spectacular show for the @entity126
" @entity1 's @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 contributed to this report from @entity131 , and @entity132 from @entity106 .
