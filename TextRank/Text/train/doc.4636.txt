-- @entity1 reached an out - of - court settlement with her former assistant who sued for unpaid overtime , according to a court filing
details of the deal were not revealed in a document filed in court last week asking the clerk to close the case
the lawsuit , which sought $ 350,000 in back pay from the singer , had been set for trial in @entity16 starting next week
@entity18 district judge @entity17 ruled last month against @entity1 's lawyer 's request that the case be dismissed
in her lawsuit , @entity22 says that she worked " 24/7 " as @entity1 's personal assistant
@entity22 was employed in early 2009 , and again from february 2010 to march 2011
after she was rehired , she was told her annual salary would be $ 75,000
" every day is a work day for her , so every day is a work day for the rest of us , " @entity22 said , according to court documents
" there is no , we 're going to stay in , we 're going to sleep
there is no , let 's put on sweatpants and go out to the movies and be girlfriends
it does n't work like that
" @entity1 , whose real name is @entity1 , testified that @entity22 " deserves every one of her $ 75,000 that we agreed to
but she does not deserve a penny more
" @entity0 's @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 contributed this report .
