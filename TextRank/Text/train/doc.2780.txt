-- in the time it takes your computer to boot up , you can probably make some toast or a cup of tea before the thing is ready to use
in the near future , you might only have enough time to take a sip of that tea or check your watch
do you get impatient waiting for your computer to start up ? manufacturers say they 're working on that
mindful of how frustrating the wait is , makers of @entity19 ' basic input / output systems ( @entity20 ) are working on bringing instant - on computing closer to reality with promises of significantly faster boot time
" people want pcs to be like their toaster
push a button and it is ready , " says @entity29 , vice-president and chief scientist of core systems at @entity32 , one of the biggest bios makers
the bios is the first piece of code that a computer runs when it is powered on
before @entity40 or @entity41 can start , the bios identifies , tests and gets system devices such as the video display card , the hard disk and other hardware up and running
but running the tests every time the machine powers on can be time consuming
at @entity50 's developer conference last month , @entity32 announced that the latest version of its bios could boot in just about a second by cutting out redundant checks and creating a smarter version of the firmware
of course , that still leaves the time that it takes @entity40 to start up , but @entity58 has been working on that , too , and claims that @entity60 starts up in about 20 seconds , compared to the 50 seconds or so for @entity61
the faster boot time will help users , says @entity64 , a research fellow at market research and consulting company @entity67
but even with @entity58 's improvements , he says , it is still nearly a minute before the user is completely up and running
" every software application today wants to go out there and check for the latest version on boot up , which just gets in the way of what you really want to do
and that is check e-mail , " he says
shrinking this digital annoyance is the new quest for pc makers
for most people , computers today have become as much a consumer electronics product as tvs , cellphones and dvd players
that means , consumers expect the same kind of instant response from their computers are they get from other electronics devices
" if you pick up a phone , you expect to instantly hear a tone , " says @entity29
" that 's the future for computers , too
" @entity29 says the ' i am ready for use ' signaling is an important psychological factor for consumers
" @entity106 worked hard on this
they figured if you pick up the phone and did n't hear something within 250 milliseconds , then you would be pretty uncomfortable with the device , " he says
on pcs , that signaling time has been much longer
boot - up on pcs is split into two chunks : the bios boot up , which is the time taken from pressing the power on button to the time bios finishes booting , also known as pre-boot , and the time taken for the operating system to load
today , this can take anywhere from a minute to nearly three minutes
and that can feel like eternity for users
" lots of users today just press the power button and then grab a cup of coffee , " says @entity64
" if the line at @entity136 is n't too long , the system will be ready by the time they 're back
" the bios has been part of pcs since the first @entity142 pc in 1981
the firmware initializes every computer to a point where an operating system can come along and with no knowledge of the machine start running
" the bios is doing a lot more than waking up the machine and handing it a cup of coffee in the morning , " says @entity149 , senior technical marketing engineer , for @entity150 , a major bios maker
" it provides a layer so you can buy a pc , take it home , wipe the configuration clean , change it and do it 100 times a day and your @entity40 will still start up
" running the hardware checks takes time
about 15 years ago , the bios firmware in pcs would take up to two minutes to boot
finding that customers were becoming impatient with the boot times , pc makers started pressing for pcs to be more like appliances with their ability to be switched on instantly
" electronics are not supposed to warm up anymore , " says @entity149
" so we have been trying to shrink the time it takes to get the machine ready
" bios boot times can vary depending on configuration of the pc : more memory and more cards mean it will take longer
increasingly , operating systems , such as @entity58 's @entity40 , run initial checkups on boot to verify system details and ensure the most updated versions of the software is loaded
in other words , the os is doing some of the work that the bios traditionally has done
" effectively what bios makers are saying is that if the @entity40 is not going to believe us anyway , why bother ? " says @entity64
that 's why pc makers are pinning their hopes on a new standard called @entity194
@entity194 hopes to improve the intelligence of the bios so it does n't have to perform all checks every time the computer is powered on
ultimately , the idea is to run fewer initializations as the computer boots
@entity32 and @entity150 say there are some machines already whose bios is based on the @entity194 standard for quicker boot but it will be late next year before a majority of pcs have it
and unlike the bios , which is tied to @entity50 's x86 processor architecture , @entity194 will not be specific to any processor architecture
@entity58 's upcoming @entity60 operating system has also laid out some criteria for pc manufacturers to get hardware aligned in a way that they can meet the company 's standards
@entity58 has set a criteria of five seconds for bios boot time and 20 seconds for the operating system to boot
that 's still nowhere near the instant - on computing dream and promises of faster bios risks setting unrealistic expectations among consumers , says @entity64
there 's a way to get instant - on
it 's called the sleep mode
" people assume they get instant - on with their cellphones but no one reboots their cellphone everyday , " says @entity149
" so one form of instant - on is never to turn it off
" another route to quick boot is to do what @entity244 has done with its latest notebook
@entity244 's newly launched @entity247 offers instant boot to check e-mail , calendar , contacts and the web as part of a mode called ' @entity255
' in it the @entity19 boots from a special chipset running an arm processor , the same kind of cpu that powers most cellphones , and a slimmed down version of the @entity41 operating system
the @entity255 mode comes with its own power on / off button
users can click on an adjacent power button to switch to @entity40 os. that gives consumers options , says @entity273 , product manager for @entity247 at @entity244
" when you directly go to the latitude on mode , you never bring up the main operating system , " he says " and when you turn it off , it goes into the suspend mode , which is not like that of @entity61 or @entity279 but more like what you see in cellphones
" at $ 2000 , the @entity247 laptop is a pricey answer to the problem of a two - minute boot up time for pcs. and it does n't give users access to all features and programs that run on @entity40 such as @entity295 or @entity296
that 's why , @entity299 advocates just staying away from the power off button as much as you can
" most systems today have the ability to go to sleep as opposed to being turned off , " says @entity64
" too many users do n't understand that
