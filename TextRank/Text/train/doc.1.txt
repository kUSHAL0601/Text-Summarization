@entity0 , @entity1 -- three current or former @entity4 , @entity1 , city officials , accused of misappropriation of public funds , won bail reduction wednesday
the arraignment for them and five others arrested in the case was postponed until october 21 after a defense attorney asked for more time
the bail for former city manager @entity14 was reset from $ 3.2 million to $ 2 million
assistant city manager @entity17 's bail went from $ 377,000 to $ 350,000 , and mayor @entity18 won a $ 10,000 reduction to $ 275,000
city council member @entity21 , former council member @entity23 and vice mayor @entity24 showed that their bail funds come from legitimate sources and can post it anytime , a judge ruled
the charges allege that the officials misappropriated more than $ 5.5 million , including being paid for phantom meetings , district attorney @entity29 said tuesday
@entity33 , @entity17 and police chief @entity34 resigned after media reports that they were making several hundred thousand dollars a year each
@entity34 was not charged , @entity37 said
" the complaint alleges they used the tax dollars collected from the hard - working citizens of @entity4 as their own piggy bank , which they looted at will , " @entity37 said
other defendants are council member @entity44 and former councilman @entity45
@entity33 , who was being paid nearly $ 800,000 annually , is charged with 53 counts of misappropriation of public funds and conflict of interest
among the allegations are that he wrote his own employment contracts and that they were never approved by the @entity54 , prosecutors said
@entity37 alleges that @entity33 , hired as @entity4 's chief administrative officer in september 1994 , gave nearly $ 1.9 million in unauthorized loans to himself , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity18 and dozens of others
@entity33 is responsible for $ 4.3 million of the city 's losses , @entity37 said
@entity33 's attorney , @entity62 , said @entity37 ensured that reporters witnessed the arrest of his client and called it " grossly unprofessional
" " candidate @entity37 wants some good campaign material , " @entity62 said , making reference to the district attorney 's candidacy for @entity1 attorney general
" [ @entity33 's ] salary was openly transparent to the @entity54 , and the council approved it , " he said , adding that his client will fight the charges
@entity62 also said the city 's loan program followed procedures and that @entity37 's office did not interview many pertinent witnesses
prosecutors charged @entity18 , @entity81 , @entity44 , @entity23 , @entity45 and @entity21 with nearly two dozen counts of misappropriating approximately $ 1.2 million of public funds
@entity37 alleges that they held " bogus meetings " that lasted only minutes at a time -- or not at all -- and collected payment
" the [ council ] for their part provided no checks , no balances , " @entity37 said
" the council members were busy enriching themselves for collecting money for meetings that never occurred
" @entity1 attorney general @entity93 recently sued several of the former officials " to recover the excess salaries " that @entity4 officials were being paid
he also was pursuing a reduction of their pension benefits
" this is a very serious matter when public officials breach their duty to the public and enrich themselves with enormous obscene salaries which then trigger pensions of similar magnitude , " @entity93 said
the suit accuses officials of fraud , civil conspiracy , waste of public funds and breach of fiduciary duty
it also alleges they deliberately misled citizens about the accurate amount of their pay
@entity4 , in southeast @entity120 , had 36,624 residents as of the 2000 census
the median annual income is less than $ 35,000
@entity33 's last annual base salary was $ 787,638 , @entity34 earned $ 457,000 , and @entity17 received $ 336,000 , according to @entity93 's office
before recently cutting their pay , @entity127 members received $ 96,000 a year , compared with $ 4,800 a year earned by council members in similar - sized cities
since 1993 , the council raised @entity33 's salary 16 times , with an average jump of 14 percent yearly , the attorney general said
in 2005 , he received an increase of 47 percent
since 2001 , city council members also awarded themselves 16 percent raises yearly
@entity93 , who is running for governor , said @entity33 prepared a memo for the public saying council members received $ 673 a month and he was paid $ 15,478 a month , which would amount to annual salaries of about $ 8,000 and $ 185,000 respectively
@entity2 's @entity143 contributed to this report .
