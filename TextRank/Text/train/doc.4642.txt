@entity0 -- if case you had any doubts , do n't -- @entity5 's fully on board president @entity7 's re-election effort
" @entity7 deserves to be re-elected president of the @entity14 , " the former president said sunday night , as he joined the current officeholder at a fundraiser for the @entity7 re-election campaign
it was a very different story four years ago , when @entity5 was the biggest and most vocal supporter of his wife , @entity16 , in her historic battle against @entity7 for the @entity19 presidential nomination
@entity5 was a critic of then - sen. @entity7 , arguing that the freshman senator was n't ready to handle the duties of the @entity22
among @entity5 's most controversial comments came when he challenged @entity7 's claim to be more against the @entity25 than @entity16
" give me a break
this whole thing is the biggest fairy tale i 've ever seen , " the former president said at the time
after @entity16 ended her bid for the nomination , she and her husband took to the campaign trail to help @entity7 win the @entity35
the rest is history : sen. @entity7 became president @entity7 and sen. @entity5 became secretary of state @entity5
now , as @entity7 runs for a second term in the @entity35 , @entity5 will once again serve as one of the current president 's most high - profile surrogates
" i think he is beating the historical standard for coming out of a financial collapse and a mortgage collapse
i think the last thing you want to do is to turn around and embrace the policies that got us into trouble in the first place , " @entity5 said at the @entity46 at the @entity48 home of former @entity50 chairman @entity49 , a longtime member of the @entity5 inner circle
" we need to keep going forward by re-electing @entity7 president of the @entity14
" later , at the same event , @entity7 praised his predecessor and joked that " you guys get two presidents for one out of this event , which is a pretty good deal
" but it 's not just fundraisers -- the former president had the starring role in an @entity7 campaign video that generated a lot of buzz after it went up online friday
" the president is the decider in chief
nobody can make that decision for you , " @entity5 says in the web video , discussing @entity7 's decision - making process to give the go - ahead to carry out the raid that killed @entity81
tuesday is the one - year anniversary of the @entity88 leader 's death
" look , he knew what would happen
suppose the @entity90 had gone in there and it had n't been @entity81
suppose they had been captured or killed
the downside would have been horrible for him , but he reasoned , ' i can not in good conscience do nothing
' he took the harder and the more honorable path and the one that produced in my opinion the best result , " @entity5 adds in the video
the video also questions whether @entity107 , the presumptive @entity108 presidential nominee , would have given the same order
an @entity7 re-election official told @entity1 , " what 's clear is that the @entity19 is unified for the 2012 campaign , " and added that " president @entity5 will help raise money for the campaign at three fundraisers and we anticipate more activity on the trail as the election approaches
" the former president can help the current @entity35 occupant in a number of ways : @entity5 's an extremely talented political strategist and surrogate who can campaign for the president in places such as the @entity127 and parts of rural @entity14 where @entity7 may not be so popular
with the economy remaining the top issue on the minds of @entity14 , someone like @entity5 touting @entity7 could remind them of better economic times
" @entity5 represents economic strength in the eyes of most @entity14 , " @entity19 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity138 said
" there is no one with more economic credibility than president @entity5 -- so when he says president @entity7 will revive the economy and save the middle class , folks listen
i expect to see @entity5 making the case all over the country in 2012 , " added @entity138 , who was a top adviser in the @entity147 and who now is a senior adviser to @entity149 , the pro-obama super pac
beyond his campaigning and fundraising , @entity5 has also come to @entity7 's aid in his elder statesmen missions for the @entity7 administration in @entity158 and @entity159
and while offering constructive criticism of some of @entity7 's actions in the first two years of his presidency in his 2011 book " back to work , " @entity5 also makes the case for the @entity7 @entity35 and appears to mark a warmer relationship between the two men
expect the requests for @entity5 to keep coming
a source close to the former president points out that since @entity16 's role as secretary of state will continue to keep her off the campaign trail this cycle , the former president will be busier than ever
of course , there appears to be something in this equation for @entity5 too
by lending @entity7 a helping hand , @entity5 continues to erase any lingering bad memories from the @entity5 - @entity7 clash during the 2008 primaries
and just in case his wife decides to make another bid for the @entity35 in 2016 ( never say never ) , helping @entity186 now could pay dividends in four years .
