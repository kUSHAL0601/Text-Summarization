-- it was n't the sight of tortured bodies that scared " @entity4
" it was what was written on the sign that was left next to them
" this will happen to all the @entity11 snitches
" it was signed by @entity13
the banner was placed next to the two victims , a woman and man , both in their 20s , both gruesomely killed
the woman was disemboweled , left with her intestines protruding from her belly
they were found in september 2011 , hanging from a bridge in @entity24 , @entity25 , robbed of any future dignity
about three hours away in @entity28 , @entity4 's stomach grumbled when he saw the banner on the @entity11
" those people hanging from the bridge could have been me , " he thought
@entity25 : a deadly beat for the past two years , @entity4 has taken to @entity33 to act as a tipster to cartel activity in his town
when local and state authorities tried to downplay news about the cartels operating in the northern @entity25 state of @entity41 ( at one point the government attributed the tension to the " psychosis of the residents " ) @entity4 was one of the first people on social media to tip the world about what was really happening
his news of " narco blockades " and gun fights throughout @entity28 in late february 2010 was among the first news people received about the fresh war that erupted between @entity13 and the @entity57 cartel
he has become such a trustworthy source of information that the social media savvy residents of @entity28 head to his account to find what places to avoid before leaving their homes
others trapped in the street after gunfights look to him to offer alternate ways to get home
his account has become both a tool of information and survival
he asked @entity0 not to use his name to protect his identity
" during an attack , the network goes beyond @entity33
people on the street send me an sms alert , a radio alert or a phone call to let me know what 's going on , " @entity4 says of his role of protecting @entity28 's innocent
" we continue to report after the attack to cover the information gap by the local press
" thanks to @entity33 we have documentation , with video , audio and images , of violent events , " he says
" it 's a registration [ countering the ] opacity and denial of local and state government
" many people have trusted me and i appreciate it , " he says
" it 's very rewarding and a great responsibility that motivates me to make sure i use @entity33 properly ... as a tool of social utility
" @entity4 is well aware of his responsibility
the short description on his @entity33 account makes that clear , " a society [ that is ] selfish , apathetic , indifferent has no moral authority , it is more comfortable complaining , blaming , criticizing than participating [ to ] contribute , [ to ] build ... " inspired in part by the " @entity110 " in @entity111 , @entity25 citizens became increasingly active on the social media site in 2010 as a way to combat the drug violence infesting their cities
lacking confidence in their local authorities , they took @entity33 to " spread truth , " denounce cartels and warn each other of shootouts
on @entity123 , a video titled " @entity33 " gives guidance on how to create anonymous @entity33 accounts so users can announce where cartels are operating
it gives examples of how to circulate information to a wider audience by using hashtags and how to direct tweets to legitimate journalists on @entity33
in some cities of @entity25 -- especially in the northern part of the country -- cartels have used violence and intimidation to control swaths of land and smuggling routes in their unquenchable quest for money and power
their assault on @entity25 bloggers seemingly takes aim at controlling cyberspace as well
for many within the blogging community the development comes as no surprise
some were even anticipating it
@entity4 was n't always so plugged in
before the cartels used his town as their battlefield , he spent the majority of his days at work
born into a family of traders in @entity162 , he moved to @entity28 a few years ago to follow his passion and open up his own store
he would use the internet sparingly , most of the time to play games or stay in touch with friends back home in the capital
he has always been low key , passing the time at weekend carne asadas with friends or going to the movies
life is radically different now
" i avoid the street at night , " he says of the unofficial curfew local residents adhere to in @entity28
he speaks in a hushed tone , choosing his words carefully before delivering them
his voice is delicate , but soaked in concern
" if you go to a party , you sleep there
if not , you might suffer an attack by armed civilians if you come across the wrong people on your way home
" in @entity28 , the bad guys are n't always so easily recognizable
@entity4 says most residents are suspicious of the public security forces
" they will , under any pretext , extort you , " he says of the authorities
about a year ago the hashtags frequented by @entity4 were saturated with tweets about his confrontation with the local police
his friends messaged the media , asking for news outlets to cover the assault
they cited it as a microcosm for what everyday residents go through
when asked by @entity0 what happened , @entity4 downplayed the incident , saying instead it 's what to be expected " in the environment of corruption and war
" " they roughed me up outside of my store ... the police are the more visible arm of the local cartel , " he says , as if asked to state the obvious
" when asked about the specific allegations of corruption , @entity0 was referred by local authorities to the @entity41 attorney general 's office
after repeated requests for an interview , @entity0 did not receive a response
in past interviews conducted by @entity0 with attorney general 's spokesman @entity235 , similar allegations of abuse among local and state officials were denied
@entity4 says the incident with the police was the only " direct threat " he 's received
but in a part of the world where talking about threats is enough to get you killed , it 's no surprise he is shy when the subject comes up
" i think there is a real risk [ to my life ] " , he says
" sometimes you get that feeling , so you have to maintain a low profile
in @entity28 , one slip - up can cost a lot
it 's not a place where people feel comfortable asking the police for help staying safe , " he says
as for those who are trying to keep people like him silent , @entity262 addresses it with indignation
his defiance is clear with every tweet he sends
" they try to silence the voice of citizens with their organization through fear , terror , " he says
" obviously what we do affects the interests of the cartel and local government
but the citizens have found a way to organize and protect each other on @entity33
the police and authorities ... they do n't care
so you find a way take care of them
