-- she is small but only in physical stature
@entity3 is the very embodiment of @entity5 's long struggle for democracy
the 65 - year - old human rights activist has defied @entity5 's authoritarian military junta with her quiet demeanor and grace
for that she has endured house arrest for most of the past two decades and , perhaps , has become the world 's most recognizable political prisoner
she has lived quietly by herself at her disintegrating @entity16 in @entity17 ( the former capital , also known as @entity17 ) , accompanied solely by two maids
the @entity21 laureate has had little outside human contact except for visits from her doctor
sometimes , though , she has been able to speak over the wall of her compound to her supporters , never once giving up her crusade to break down the tyranny of dictatorship in her beloved homeland of @entity5 , the alternate name for @entity5
known as the " lady " in @entity5 , @entity3 has been compared to former @entity36 president @entity35 , who spent a chunk of his life in jail for fighting apartheid
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity3 , in fact , likened @entity5 's plight to @entity36 's former brutal race - based system
" it 's a form of apartheid , " she said
" in @entity36 , it was apartheid based on color
here , it is apartheid based on ideas
it is as though those who want democracy are somehow of an alien inferior breed and this is not so
" the daughter of gen. @entity3 , a hero of @entity5 independence , @entity3 spent much of her early life abroad , going to school in @entity63 and at @entity64 in @entity65
she never sought political office
rather , leadership was bestowed upon her when she returned home in 1988 after her mother suffered a stroke
during her visit , a student uprising erupted and spotlighted her as a symbol of freedom
when @entity3 's mother died the next year , @entity3 vowed that just as her parents had served the people of @entity5 , so , too , would she
in her first public speech , she stood before a crowd of several hundred thousand people with her husband , @entity82 , and her two sons and called for a democratic government
" the present crisis is the concern of the entire nation , " she said
" i could not , as my father 's daughter , remain indifferent to all that was going on
this national crisis could , in fact , be called the second struggle for independence
" she won over the @entity5 people
the following year , the military regime threw her in jail
but even with @entity3 sitting behind bars , her @entity98 won the 1990 elections by a landslide , gaining 82 percent of the seats in parliament
the regime ignored the results of the vote and senior gen. @entity107 continued to impose numerous terms of house arrest on her
@entity3 , meanwhile , became the recipient of several human rights prizes and was awarded the @entity21 in 1991
over the years , @entity3 has repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in @entity5
in one incident in 1998 , soldiers prevented her from leaving @entity17
but @entity3 refused to turn back and was detained in her minivan for almost two weeks
the ordeal left her severely dehydrated , but was typical of her almost stubborn determination
" she is the symbol of the hope for the people of @entity5
if she is out today the whole country will rise up , will follow her , " said @entity122 of the @entity123
over the years , @entity3 has made it clear that she remains devoted to bringing democracy to @entity5
she has spoken of her separation from her loved ones as the sacrifice she chose to make for the freedom of her country
she has not seen her sons since 2000
the year before , her dying husband petitioned the @entity5 authorities to allow him to visit his wife
he had last seen her in 1995
instead , the junta encouraged @entity3 to join her family abroad
but she said she knew that if she left , she would never be allowed to return
@entity82 died of prostate cancer in march 1999
even before they were married , @entity3 had penned a letter to @entity82 professing her love of country
" i only ask one thing , " she wrote , " that should my people need me , you would help me to do my duty by them
" @entity3 tried to break the monotony of her life by playing her piano , another passion in her life , according to the independent @entity155 magazine
but the piano has been broken for years and she has taken up painting to fill the void , the magazine reported
one day , maybe , people will see her canvases
@entity3 has also asked her lawyers to bring her books in @entity162 and @entity163
last year , @entity165 - winning economist @entity164 was allowed to present her with his book " @entity167
" again in 2007 , people defiantly took to the streets to protest rising fuel costs
the demonstrations were seen as a direct challenge to the authority of the government
the regime answered with a brutal crackdown
@entity3 's detention was extended again and again
she appeared gaunt -- and unhappy
even when @entity178 devastated @entity5 in may 2008 , @entity3 was not allowed to leave her house , though trees were crashing down all around her
the following year , @entity5 was again propelled into the headlines by a bizarre incident involving an @entity183 , @entity184 , who improvised flippers to swim @entity16 to @entity3 's compound
he said he had received a message from @entity190 to do so
@entity191 was arrested , and @entity3 was put on trial , charged with harboring @entity184 , and was punished with another 18 months of house arrest
during the trial , she was able to meet with diplomats
high on her agenda was the election that was held this week
she and her party boycotted the vote , certain that it would be a sham
" in @entity5 , the regime can control people but they can not control her , they can not shut her mouth , " said analyst @entity202 " they can release other political prisoners but they are worried that if they release her she will speak out
" the junta has organized national conventions to debate their version of a new democratic @entity5
the road map makes no mention of @entity3
some believe that @entity3 's stubborn defiance has become an obstacle to progress in @entity5
but her followers remain ardent in their admiration
she has clung to her dream of democracy , peace and freedom for @entity5 's 50 million impoverished people , they say
those simple ideals have greatly complicated one woman 's life
@entity0 's @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report .
