-- the @entity4 prime minister 's coalition has won the most seats in @entity6 , despite the cancellation of ballots from 300 polling stations , election officials said monday
votes in those stations were nullified because of attempted tampering and inconsistencies , the nation 's @entity10 said
prime minister @entity17 's @entity16 won 92 out of 328 parliamentary seats in last month 's election , far more than any other political bloc , according to the commission
his main rivals finished with fewer than 30 seats , putting the @entity25 prime minister far ahead of his competition but short of a majority
though the win improves his chances of a third term , his coalition must reach out to other blocs to gain enough support
@entity17 faced fierce opposition amid the worst sectarian violence in more than five years
" as the people of @entity4 have now spoken , i call upon all elected representatives to work together for the future of @entity4 , " said @entity36 , the top @entity37 official in @entity4
last year was the deadliest in @entity4 since 2008 , with more than 8,800 people killed , most of them civilians , according to the @entity37
tensions are fueled by widespread discontent among @entity45 , who say they are marginalized by the @entity25 - led government and unfairly targeted by brutal security tactics
some 277 political entities across @entity4 contested for 328 seats of the @entity50 , the country 's parliament
" today 's announcement is a testament to the courage and resilience of the @entity4 people , and another milestone in the democratic development of @entity4 , " the @entity55 @entity54 said after the results were announced
" as the process moves toward government formation , we encourage all political entities to conduct talks in a spirit of cooperation and respect for the will of the voters
" @entity4 voted april 30 in their first nationwide polls since the 2011 withdrawal of @entity55 forces
" given the challenges confronting @entity4 , it is essential that a new government and its leaders seek to unite the country through the formation of a new government that is supported by all @entity4 communities and that is prepared to advance tangible and implementable programs , " said @entity76 , spokeswoman for the @entity77
opinion : why @entity4 elections ca n't fix chaos left behind by @entity55 @entity0 's @entity91 and @entity92 contributed to this report .
