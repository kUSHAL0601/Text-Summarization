-- " homefront " tries to craft an expansive , historical " what if ? " scenario
but the new game ends up delivering " oh ... not again ! " game play
the first - person shooter from @entity7 and @entity8 expands on current tensions with @entity10 , but delves into a future where @entity12 unify and ultimately occupy the @entity13 in 2027
you play as @entity15 , a former pilot who is thrown in with a band of rebels intent on fighting to regain control of @entity13
the depiction of a brutalized and beaten - down @entity23 city is very well done
in the game , the @entity25 forces have erected a wall around the city and the remaining homes and businesses look as if they have been under siege for quite some time
it is hard to find an oasis in the bleak surroundings and the scene accurately portrays a sense of doom that plagues a nation after a wartime loss
but @entity39 remembers the old glory of the @entity13 and wants to do what it can to bring it back
game play is straightforward , first - person shooter action -- with a massive emphasis on shooting
there is very little stealth or strategy involved as the game progresses along a pretty strict linear path -- giving players few choices as they move from one virtual shooting gallery to the next
weapons are the automatic rifles , machine guns , sniper rifles , pistols and grenades that are typical for the genre
ammo is scarce early in the game but seems to become easier to find as the story moves forward
the characters who initially rescue @entity67 and assist him throughout the missions border on stereotypical , with very little personality other than what 's needed to move the game from point a to point @entity73 there is the strong but calm leader , who ends up getting killed during a cut scene
there is the overbearing foul - mouth who just wants to attack at nearly every chance
there is a female nonplayer character who is good at stealth and is really the only character who exhibits any emotion other than anger
and there is a character of @entity25 descent that is great at fixing the tech , but is the target of racial hatred
none of the characters really connect on any level
even when they die , it does n't really evoke any empathy from the player and just feels like another video - game casualty
the game is frequented by buggy movement and areas that load awkwardly
often , a scene will be completed and an opening will appear to move on , but instead of walking through , a nonplayer character will block your way for a minute or so before moving on
other characters will also appear to be having some sort of fit when standing around as they shake violently before progressing
it was really hard to feel immersed in the game play
while there were objectives to be met , there was no real sense of accomplishment in getting them done
in fact , there was one scene where i decided to see what would happen if i made @entity67 just stand off to the side
a nonplayer character completed the mission without my help
the story and the idea for an alternative future with a unified @entity10 as a world power had great potential
trying to retake @entity13 soil against overwhelming odds is rooted within our national dna and would have made a great tale for an fps / strategy - style game
in one scene , the resistance fighters crest a hill overlooking the town they are attempting to flee , only to see it in flames from @entity25 rockets and explosives
instead of exploring possible revenge or expressing remorse , the characters quickly gloss over it and head to the next shooting ground
it was that sort of repetition that brought the game down
individually , the pieces felt like they were there -- good action , nice story -- but without any sense of accomplishment or involvement , " homefront " stagnated , hampered by slow transitions and spotty animation
it also did n't help that the single - player campaign was over quickly ( six hours for me )
" homefront " also stirred up controversy with its choice of a real world opponent
the game has been banned in @entity25 and censored in @entity176 , removing all references to @entity10 and its leader , @entity178
on the positive side , the multiplayer action was better than the campaign because it took the elements that worked and added objectives that felt real when accomplished
ground - control mode and " team deathmatch " mode pit one side against the other , but there are bonuses and points that let you rack up new weapons and ablatives as the fighting is still ongoing
kill streaks can also gain players additional abilities , like increased weapon damage
there 's a twist , though
the longer your kill streak , the more likely you are to be targeted by enemy forces
players become " instigators " for completing mission elements and the opposite side can then use hunters to eliminate you
the more missions you complete , the more hunters can be assigned to find you and kill you
it makes the game feel alive in multiplayer action and it really does take teamwork to win
it is just too bad those qualities could n't transfer over to the single player
" homefront " is available on @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221
it is rated m for mature due to strong language , violence , and blood
this review was done on a retail copy for the @entity220 .
