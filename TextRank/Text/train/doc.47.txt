-- president @entity2 is " deeply concerned " about the growing number of deadly attacks on @entity9 forces by @entity4 security forces , and plans to contact the @entity4 president to discuss taking tougher actions , he said monday
" i 'll be reaching out to @entity2 ( @entity17 ) @entity16 , " @entity2 told reporters at the @entity12 , adding , " we 've got to make sure that we 're on top of this
" @entity2 spoke monday with gen. @entity18 , chairman of the @entity19
the top @entity9 military official is in @entity4 for meetings with coalition and @entity4 leaders , including gen. @entity24 , commander of @entity27 forces , and @entity29 gen. @entity28 , @entity18 's counterpart in the country
there has been some success , including better counterintelligence , @entity2 said
" but obviously we 're going to have to do more
" " and hopefully over the next several weeks we 'll start seeing better progress on this front , " he added
an incident sunday brought the death toll in attacks by @entity4 military and police personnel this year to 40 , according to @entity9 military officials
twenty - three of those killed were @entity9 , according to the @entity45
the @entity27 death toll in what the military is now calling " insider attacks " is already higher than it was last year , according to statistics compiled by the @entity51 , a public policy think tank
@entity27 's @entity54 said friday that 39 people had been killed in these attacks in 2012
that was before sunday 's attack killed one @entity54 service member
the exact number of attacks remains unclear
while the @entity9 military said there have been 40 insider attacks this year , @entity54 tweeted last week that there had been 27 such attacks this year
there have been two more since that tweet
an @entity54 spokesman told @entity0 on friday there had been 31 such attacks before sunday 's attack
@entity27 and the @entity9 say the vast majority of the attacks are not the work of the @entity76 or insurgent groups
" some 10 % we know are related to the insurgency , " brig
gen. @entity80 , a spokesman for the @entity54 , said last week
an april report by the @entity45 said , " investigations have determined that a large majority of green - on - blue attacks are not attributable to insurgent infiltration of the @entity29 , but are due to isolated personal grievances against coalition personnel
there is no indication that these recent attacks are part of a deliberate effort by insurgents , nor were they coordinated with each other
" the term " green - on - blue " refers to a color coding system used by the military , in which blue refers to the friendly force , in this case @entity54 ; and green refers to an allied friendly forces , in this case @entity104
when investigators traveled to the attackers ' home villages to investigate what was known about them , the information they collected led them to believe most of the attackers were generally not aligned with an insurgent group , but had their own grievances , military officials say
but the motivations of about half the attackers are difficult to determine definitively because the perpetrator is dead or has fled , @entity0 national security analyst @entity117 and @entity118 of the @entity51 write in a column on @entity0
some of the incidents appear to have taken place after arguments between @entity4 and international troops , the column notes
last year , @entity9 military behavioral scientist @entity124 interviewed more than 600 @entity4 soldiers and police and found they held overwhelmingly negative perceptions of @entity129 soldiers , stemming from incidents including alleged indiscriminate shootings that killed civilians and the public searching of @entity4 soldiers outside @entity27 bases , as well as @entity9 soldiers urinating in public or cursing at their @entity4 counterparts , @entity117 and @entity137 write
" another likely cause of the increase in the number of green - on - blue incidents is straightforward : in the past two years the size of the @entity4 army and police force has almost doubled from around 200,000 to around 350,000 , " the column says
@entity4 president @entity16 spoke sunday with @entity9 defense secretary @entity147
" they expressed shared concern over this issue and agreed that @entity9 and @entity4 officials should work even more closely together to minimize the potential for insider attacks in the future , " @entity45 spokesman @entity148 said
@entity18 , in a statement monday , said @entity16 's public statement condemning insider attacks was " tremendously important , and i hope it permeates to the lowest levels of the @entity4 government and military
" @entity4 police are most likely to launch such attacks , @entity18 said
" the vulnerability of local police to ( terrorist ) influence is great
... they do n't move around the country the way the @entity29 does , so they live at the point of corruption
i 'm sure that 's the case here too
" officials are examining the vetting process for @entity4 soldiers and police " and investigating where it failed , " a @entity45 statement said
all troops at @entity27 headquarters and all bases across the country have been ordered to carry loaded weapons around the clock , @entity0 learned friday
@entity0 's @entity188 contributed to this report .
