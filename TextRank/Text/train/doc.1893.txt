@entity1 , @entity0 -- at a time of economic uncertainty in the @entity6 , the writers strike cast a dark cloud over the eternal sunshine of the @entity10 mindset and its most glittering awards ceremony
oscar winner @entity12 dazzled in @entity14 diamonds last year and gained masses of publicity for the jeweler up until a fortnight ago , the million dollar question was whether the @entity19 would go ahead as stars refused to cross the picket line
make that the 400 million dollar question
according to the pundits and bean - counters , that 's how much the strike would have cost @entity27 and the industry if @entity29 's most glamorous evening had been cancelled
not only would the stars have been robbed of their moment to shimmer along the world 's most famous red carpet , but a whole hinterland of ancillary trades would be affected
limo drivers driven to despair , caterers with no - one to cater for , make - up artists struggling to make up lost earnings and security teams facing an insecure future -- and the paparazzi would have no - one to focus on
but it 's not just the little guys who would have lost out on the @entity19 millions
big - name jewelry designers like @entity14 traditionally dress the stars
@entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 are among their successful models at the @entity19
last year , @entity12 wore a 55 carat diamond flower bracelet along with a 62 carat diamond brooch worth $ 4m dollars to accept the @entity55 gong
it is estimated that having a celebrity pictured in an item of jewelry or an outfit can be worth $ 1m in publicity for a jeweler or fashion house
with hundreds of celebrities strutting the red carpet on @entity19 night , the scope for generating revenue is seemingly endless
but even @entity14 's famous sparkle was tested by the uncertainty surrounding this year 's event
" leading up to the @entity19 business for the whole of @entity73 was a little sketchy
everyone was thinking , what 's gon na happen ? " @entity76 , @entity14 spokesman , told @entity2
" we felt for the writers , we felt for the studios and we wanted a great outcome for everyone
we would have been very disappointed had the @entity19 not happened
" films which achieve success at the @entity19 can expect a new injection of cash with a boost in dvd sales and renewed interest at the box office
@entity90 , a @entity27 theater boss , told @entity2 , " it 's not just the studios who are affected by the @entity19 show
as a single - screen theater owner , my whole year is based on how well films perform from november through march through the @entity19
it 's the busiest time of year for me
" " we really try to figure out , not just what the big @entity19 film is gon na be -- the @entity105 -- but also the smaller films , the independent films which might get the edge like @entity109 and @entity110 , films which will have a lot of legs to them once they get the nomination , " he continued
" it usually means between 25 % and 75 % in box office revenues alone
" the prime candidate for a new lease of life at the box office is the @entity122 ' film , " @entity123
" on the opposite side of the @entity6 , @entity125 critics are expecting it to yield a decent crop of @entity19 after taking their own awards night by storm
@entity131 , chair of the @entity132 , told @entity2 , " it won best picture because the direction from the @entity122 was really assured
they were completely in control of the mood throughout that film
" i think the screenplay , also by the @entity141 , while being truthful to @entity143 's book , managed to turn it into cinema , " he continued
" it made it consistently visual and imparted its message and its mood through images
the acting -- and again , @entity151 got the fourth of the four awards we gave it -- i thought the acting was spot on throughout
" will the rest of the results be equally clear cut ? if so , the tips are @entity162 and @entity163 for @entity164 , @entity165 for " @entity109 , " " @entity166 " for @entity167 , @entity168 for @entity169 for " @entity170 , " and in the @entity172 , @entity171 is marked for " @entity173
" but of course , no one can really be that certain
just ask producer @entity176 , who seemed set to take @entity105 for " @entity177 " after it won virtually every award except the @entity180
but it was n't to be , after @entity184 's " @entity183 " pipped him to the post
then a year ago , @entity176 finally won the big one with " @entity186
" one year on from winning the @entity19 , he spoke with @entity2 's quest team about how his life changed
" i think for a good few months after the @entity19 i was floating on air , " he said
" it was really hard to come down from it and it was hard to realize that you 'd achieved the goal that you 'd set out to achieve many years ago
there it is : in one night , you 've got it
" and as @entity176 explains , even @entity19 - winning @entity29 producers are prone to attacks of the jitters too
" it was a year where i just took stock and decided what i wanted to do next and what kind of movies i want to make , " he told @entity2
" then , bam ! we get hit with this strike , which was horrendous
i felt like i was unemployed ... your phone calls go from 60 or 70 a day to three and emails were not coming in and i felt really insecure about it
" for producers like @entity176 , the end of the writers strike is crucial for their business -- far more important than whether the @entity19 ceremony takes place
but imagine being producer of the @entity105 in the one year when the ceremony was cancelled
and it 's inconceivable to think of @entity29 without the @entity19
@entity221 without its carnival , @entity1 without the @entity223 , @entity125 without the @entity224
the famous statuettes of @entity27 may be somewhat smaller , but their presence is felt far beyond the @entity29 hills ... e-mail to a friend
