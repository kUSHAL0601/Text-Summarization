-- @entity2 officials announced an extensive restructuring of the agencies that oversee offshore oil drilling wednesday , pledging " fundamental change " for a system widely criticized after the worst oil spill in @entity10 history
the expected moves split the since - renamed @entity12 into separate agencies , with one responsible for approving offshore leases and another to enforce safety and environmental laws
@entity17 , the head of the current @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 , told reporters the reorganization is aimed at beefing up safety after " decades of neglect " and conflicts of interest among regulators
" this reorganization is much more than just moving boxes around , " @entity17 said
" it is about a comprehensive review and a fundamental change in the way that these agencies operate
" the @entity2 said it plans to have its newly created @entity18 and @entity34 up and running by october 1
a separate agency to collect revenues from leases was spun off from @entity12 in 2010
the announcement came eight days after the presidential commission that investigated last april 's sinking of the drill rig @entity42 sharply criticized regulators for their passivity , finding they were outmatched , underfunded and had conflicting responsibilities that prevented them from effective oversight of the offshore oil industry
the sinking killed 11 workers and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed more than 200 million gallons of crude into the @entity54 before it was contained in june
efforts to reshape the @entity12 began shortly after the explosion
before the disaster , internal watchdog reports criticized @entity12 inspectors for accepting meals and tickets to sporting events from oil companies they monitored in the @entity54 and found regulators in the agency 's @entity67 office received improper gifts , engaged in illegal drug use and had inappropriate sexual relationships with energy industry representatives
the @entity2 is also setting up a committee of top scientists and engineers to recommend improvements in offshore safety and well containment procedures
@entity80 , the former head of @entity81 , will lead that committee , the department announced
" i think what has become abundantly clear through the various investigations , including the report of the @entity87 , is that industry moved deeper and deeper into our nation 's waters , " interior secretary @entity83 said
" and while the technology for oil and gas drilling in those waters developed very quickly , other technologies that should have come along hand - in - hand simply did not
