-- jury selection was under way for a second day tuesday in the trial of a man accused in the rape and beating death of an @entity8 television anchor a year ago
@entity9 , 29 , would face the death penalty if convicted of charges including capital murder , rape , residential burglary and theft in the october 2008 death of @entity17 , 26
he has pleaded not guilty
@entity17 , the morning news anchor for @entity18 , @entity8 , television station and @entity0 affiliate @entity20 , was found badly beaten and unconscious in her home and died five days later
@entity9 was linked to the killing through dna , and police told @entity0 last year they are " 110 percent " sure he killed @entity17
@entity9 has given several statements to police , including one saying he was at her home and another admitting to her slaying
defense attorney @entity29 told @entity0 affiliate @entity30 that such evidence presents an obstacle for them to overcome , but he said he hopes an emotional closing argument will persuade jurors to spare @entity9 's life
" literally , you can affect an individual , and by affecting that individual you affect the outcome , " @entity29 told the station
@entity17 's mother , @entity42 , told @entity43 last year her daughter fought for her life -- so much so that her left hand was broken
" i found my daughter beyond recognition with every bone in her face broken , her nose broken , her jaw pulverized so badly that the bone had come out of it ; i actually thought that her throat has possibly been cut , " @entity42 said
" her entire skull had numerous fractures from which she suffered a massive stroke
" dna evidence has also tied @entity9 to a rape in april 2008 in @entity63 , @entity8 , about 90 miles east of @entity18 , police said in december
police have said they found no previous link between @entity9 and @entity17 and do not believe her being on television played a role in the slaying
" i think he saw her someplace , probably followed her home with the intention of robbing her , " lt. @entity68 , spokesman for @entity18 police , told @entity0 in december
" and then went from there
" @entity17 's purse was taken , police have said
parties in the case are hoping to finish jury selection tuesday , according to the @entity82 circuit court clerk 's office .
