-- the showdown between the @entity2 and @entity4 's largest group of @entity6 nuns is expected to peak this week when group leaders will meet to determine a response to the @entity2 's reprimand for the group 's " radical feminist themes
" the church also demands major reforms from the nuns ' group
the @entity21 , initially surprised by the @entity2 's report last month , " plans to move slowly , not rushing to judgment " when the group 's 21 - member board meets for three days in @entity20 , beginning tuesday
" the board will conduct its meeting in an atmosphere of prayer , contemplation and dialogue and will develop a plan to involve @entity21 membership in similar processes , " the group said in a statement
" we will engage in dialogue where possible and be open to the movement of the @entity37
we ask your prayer for us and for the church in this critical time
" last month , the @entity42 , the @entity12 's doctrinal watchdog , did a years - long " doctrinal assessment " investigation of the group -- which represents 80 % of the @entity6 nuns in @entity4 -- and found " serious doctrinal problems
" the @entity2 accused the @entity21 of sponsoring " certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the catholic faith in some of the programs and presentations
" the @entity2 report , made public by the @entity54 , said the doctrinal assessment began in part because of the group 's dissent on the @entity2 's teaching on the ordination of women and human sexuality
the @entity12 ordains only men to be priests and says sex is to be between a man and woman who are married in the eyes of the church
while the assessment praised the social justice work of the group and other organizations such as @entity75 and the @entity76 , it said the groups were " silent on the right to life from conception to natural death , a question that is part of the lively public debate about abortion and euthanasia in the @entity4
" @entity86 , a nun who 's executive director of @entity75 , a national @entity6 social justice lobby in @entity20 , said her " hunch " is that the @entity21 will put together an outline response this week to be presented to the group 's full assembly during its august meeting
" i think the results for the media will be very anticlimactic because we as catholic sisters do things with a lot of prayer and very slowly , " @entity86 about this week 's meeting
" it 's going to be like watching paint dry , " she added in a @entity0 interview
the @entity42 appointed archbishop @entity103 of @entity104 to institute the reforms
the @entity54 is providing support to @entity107 , and the @entity21 is n't expected to publicly address the @entity2 report until after this week 's meeting , said @entity110 , spokeswoman for the bishops ' conference
nuns in various orders around the @entity4 have been conversing about the @entity2 report , and their reactions have been " surprised , stunned , shocked , " @entity86 said
she said the report left her feeling " as being suspect
" " for myself , the shock made me numb at first , and then i was profoundly sad that my life as a woman religious and my commitment to serving the poor would be so denigrated by the leadership of our church , " @entity86 said
" all we do is work for love
" for the report to say " you do n't do everything , " @entity86 said , is " ridiculous
" " they 're saying we 're silent on some issues
it 's not our issue
other people do those works , " @entity86 said
the report took note of public statements from the nuns that opposed the @entity144
the @entity21 and @entity75 vocally disagreed with the @entity147 ' conference 's position on the @entity148 , which they supported and the @entity147 did not
the @entity42 called the current doctrinal and pastoral positions of the groups " grave and a matter of serious concern , " because of the global influence of the groups
some observers of the church say the @entity21 may take a low - key position in its response and seek to defuse a confrontation
others such as @entity0 's senior @entity2 analyst @entity162 said the @entity2 report has basically decreed that the @entity21 " needs an overhaul in which it will have a tighter relationship with the bishops
" " basically , it needs to be more obedient , " said @entity162 , who 's also a senior correspondent for the @entity168 , based in @entity169 , @entity170
the @entity4 nuns ' group could do one of three options this week : it could go along with everything the @entity2 is saying ; it could offer to work and negotiate with the @entity2 but say " let 's talk " ; or it could say " we 're not going to play ball and we 're going to walk away , " @entity162 said
the last option would essentially mean " we 'll disband the @entity21 and let it die on the vine and go off and do our own thing , " @entity162 said
" that 's what on the table here : how do the nuns want to respond to the crackdown that they received from the @entity2 , " @entity162 added
he also noted how many of the group leaders are in their 60s and 70s
" some of them do n't want to spend the last 10 years of their life engaged in negotiations with the @entity2 , " @entity162 said
" some of them just do n't want to deal with this
this will be the first opportunity where we 'll be able to take the temperature of the group on where the nuns stand on this
" one way or another , it 's an important crossroads moment , " he added
for @entity86 , the @entity2 report does n't pose a crisis of conscience
" it 's not affecting my conscience
it affects my sadness and heart
this life is profound and deep , " @entity86 said
" when politics interferes , it does n't change the depth of the spiritual
it 's not an issue of conscience
" @entity86 belongs to the @entity222 , an order based in @entity224 , @entity225 , and the community is meeting for the feast of the @entity228 from sunday to tuesday
the congregation might put together a position statement for the @entity21 's assembly meeting in august , @entity86 said
" we 're open to the @entity37 and to let the group wisdom lead us , so i have no idea " on whether on a position will be taken by the order , @entity86 said
