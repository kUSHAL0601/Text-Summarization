-- while we 'll never know for sure what he would have done differently , the hallmark of @entity3 ' genius was that he reacted to changes in the marketplace by forging entirely new territory through powerful design and radical innovation
@entity12 spent a decade far out in front of the competition through @entity3 ' almost uncanny combination of vision and showmanship
during that time , buying a new @entity12 device was always exciting and surprising ( even if it was occasionally frustrating )
and now , @entity12 seems to be in danger of becoming a wallflower
instead of leading , will the company increasingly become a follower ? @entity12 is reportedly testing larger screens for its phones and tablets , partly in reaction to the success of the devices released by its main rival , @entity31
sure , competition is tough in the mobile devices market
@entity31 's @entity37 , with its 5 - inch screen , has become the fastest selling @entity39 phone in history
@entity12 's @entity41 has a 4 - inch screen and its @entity43 has a 9.7 - inch screen
devices that run the @entity39 operating system come in a range of sizes , most of which tend to be bigger
one can argue that most apps do n't need a big - screen experience
in fact , a big part of the mobile revolution was about creating simple experiences that are vastly superior because they were designed to work on a small screen ( @entity60 and @entity61 are two good examples )
to put it another way , people may want an suv because it 's bigger , but a sports car would probably give them a smoother ride
although it 's hard to argue that playing games and viewing videos can benefit from a big screen , it 's perfectly fine to kill off all the pigs in @entity74 or finish an episode of " @entity76 " in the confines of a 4 - inch screen
if it 's any indication , more than 50 billion apps have been downloaded from the @entity12 app store in just five years
so if thing are great then why should @entity12 be thinking about bigger screens ? one reason is that @entity12 's stock has fallen in the past 10 months , with @entity86 feeling nervous about the company 's future and its ability to come up with innovative products
on tuesday , @entity12 released its quarterly earnings
while sales beat expectations , profits were down
@entity12 has already put out a smaller @entity43 , the ipad mini
but every new screen size brings the company one step closer to the riot of sizes and resolutions that have made developing apps for @entity39 devices far more difficult than for @entity105 devices
we tend to tout changes in technology as a good thing
and like all companies , @entity12 is looking to make smart changes
although @entity12 has modified its stance , it 's clear that the ipad mini is not quite the device we would have seen if @entity3 was around today
in the hyper - competitive mobile market , two years is a lifetime
since @entity3 passed away in 2011 , the current version of @entity105 already seems dated and stale
@entity39 may not be better in many ways , but it 's pulling ahead in innovation , including better meshing of apps , smarter and more interactive icons , and reinventing basic interface elements like the keyboard
in response , @entity12 is releasing a new version of its operating system in the fall
despite showing off some bold ( and controversial ) design choices , it seems more evolutionary than revolutionary
@entity12 is well aware that innovation is still a key part of its appeal
but without its creative genius at the helm , the company is going head to head with @entity31 in the marketplace
that still leaves us waiting for the next big thing
what @entity12 needs most are bold new ideas , not bigger iphones or @entity43
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .
