-- hey @entity3 fans , how much do you know about capt. @entity4 ? were you aware that he was born in @entity6 , @entity7 , and raised in @entity8 , @entity9 ? that he graduated from the @entity11 ? does n't sound familiar ? we 're talking about the real @entity4 , who , like the fictional @entity3 character @entity13 , commands a ship of the most cutting - edge technology
@entity16 up ! scientists work to produce ' @entity3 ' deflector device capt. @entity19 will be commander of the @entity21 's new @entity20 , the first of the ddg - 1000 class of destroyers
it is longer , faster and carries state - of - the - art weapons that will allow it to destroy targets at more than 60 miles away , according to the @entity21
much of the ship 's superstructure is wrapped in a huge canopy made of lightweight carbon fiber composite
@entity21 owes $ 1.5 million for damage to reef , @entity33 says the @entity36 ca n't travel into deep space like the @entity38 , but it does have a feature that the fictional capt. @entity4 coveted
on the television series , the captain once stole a " cloaking device " from a @entity45 ship that effectively made the @entity38 " disappear " from their enemies ' eyes
while the @entity50 can not completely disappear , its canopy and the rest of the ship is built on angles that help make it 50 times harder to spot on radar than an ordinary destroyer
when its begins missions , the @entity36 will be the largest stealth ship in the @entity21
this man cost the @entity21 a submarine @entity0 's @entity64 and @entity65 contributed to this report .
