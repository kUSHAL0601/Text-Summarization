-- do n't be confused , @entity1
you did not wake up in a fraternity house
you are not still in college
those celluloid - ball - throwing , beer - chugging patrons invading the @entity7 and @entity8 are not trying to scare you
they are probably just members of @entity10 -- wednesday night 's winners of the annual @entity12
@entity13 and @entity14 came out on top after 22 games to take home the $ 50,000 prize , money that the recent @entity20 at @entity22 graduates will certainly be able to use
" it 'll get me by for now , " @entity14 said after the win
he said the secret to his team 's success in the tournament was " staying sober to play well consistently
" not always an easy task in a game with " beer " in it name
beer pong , or @entity34 as it is called on many college campuses , is played with two teams standing at opposite ends of a table
at each end of the table , ten 16 - ounce cups , filled with roughly 4 ounces of beer or another liquid , are placed in a bowling - pin formation
each team takes turns tossing beer pong balls ( similar to table tennis balls ) at their opponent 's cup formation
if a ball goes into a cup , the cup is removed from the game , and its contents are usually imbibed by the opponent
the first team to knock out all of their opponent 's cups wins
@entity13 and @entity14 learned to play beer pong the same place most people do -- in college
it was n't until recently that the two started playing competitively and realized they were actually pretty good
their move from casual beer pong players to tournament competitors mimics that of @entity72 co-founder @entity71 's decision to establish a competitive beer pong league
but he insists he and his business partners were n't the first ones to think of organizing it
" we 're just the only people to actually carry it out , " he said , laughing
the world series , in its seventh and largest year , has drawn more than 1,000 players ( 450 teams ) from 48 @entity84 states and 14 countries
organization of a sport which for many college students is nothing more than a mindless drinking game may sound a little far - fetched , but @entity71 said it actually came quite easily to him and his college buddies , all members of the @entity88 swim team in the late 1990s
" we played a ton of beer pong , " he said
despite the popularity of the game on his campus and others , @entity71 said there was never really any way to measure a player 's skill level
" there were no organized tournaments , " @entity71 said , " we figured a lot of people thought they were pretty good , but might wonder , ' how good am i really ? ' " after graduating from college with a history degree , @entity71 said , his desire to become an entrepreneur paired with the game 's widespread popularity made for a perfect fit for the formation of a @entity72
the league established rules for the game , a regulation - size beer pong table , as well as a national ranking system similar to that for chess
competitors can move up and down in the rankings based on the ranking of those they beat
no surprise to @entity71 , his friends think his job is " pretty cool , " but overcoming stereotypes about the game has proved to be one of his greatest challenges
" people who did n't play beer pong in college do n't really get it , " he said
" it 's tricky trying to convince them it 's something that people take seriously
" even his own parents have mixed emotions
" my dad loves it , " @entity71 said
" my mom thinks it 's debauchery
" @entity71 said the tournament attracts a " mixed bag " of people who all " happen to be good at beer pong
" the @entity72 's latest development is an app for the @entity156 smart phone that he says will bring competitive beer pong to even larger crowds
the most casual backyard beer pong player can log on and track their wins on the league 's website
at the end of the day , @entity71 said , " it 's really just a sport that happens to involve alcohol
