-- @entity2 sci - fi fans are missing something
after roughly 20 years on television , the " @entity5 " franchise is defunct
the " @entity8 " franchise is still waiting to launch its latest iteration , " @entity13 , " and the resurrected " v " franchise , which ran on @entity11 , ended after two seasons
where are all the aliens on television ? this weekend , at least some aliens will be on @entity18 , as " @entity27 " premieres sunday at 9 p.m. et. @entity19 and @entity20 have been working on the show ( an apocalyptic science fiction show about an alien invasion that decimates @entity25 's societies ) for three years , and fans have been waiting
( @entity18 , like @entity0 , is owned by parent company @entity28
) the " @entity27 ' " preview at last year 's @entity30 sparked excitement from a packed room of fans , but series star @entity34 knows the stakes are high
" i was amazed at the turnout we got , " @entity34 said
" and just how closely that particular audience pays attention to detail
how wounded they feel ( after ) being jilted in the past ( by other science fiction shows ) and so they have an apprehension about embracing a new project
" but once that audience is won over , i do n't think there 's a more loyal following anywhere
they seem to be the most vociferous letter writers in the country to support shows they enjoy , and hopefully we 'll be one of them , " he said
sci - fi fans say they have been burned by @entity55 in the past and are cautious with their excitement for shows like " @entity27 " and @entity61 's upcoming " @entity60
" fledgling shows with ardent fan support have not been lucky in prime time in the last year
" it seems like if a show does n't come out of the gate blazing white hot and maintain that ' wow ' factor , they 're gone in two episodes , " sci - fi fan @entity65 said
@entity65 , who works in the it security industry , spent 13 hours getting a stargate tattooed around his elbow
" i feel like @entity2 networks do n't get it , " said @entity75 , an insurance agent in @entity77 , @entity78 , and an avid science fiction fan
citing @entity83 's recent pass on " @entity84 , " a supernatural show created by " @entity8 " alum @entity86 , which would have ostensibly been a cross between " @entity88 " and " @entity89 , " @entity75 said , " the networks are not catering to the people who want to see something intelligently written
i think they 're absolutely missing out and @entity93 and @entity94 get it
" in order to fill the programming void , plenty of fans who tuned in to long - established franchises are turning to " @entity101 " on @entity102 and " @entity103 , " " haven , " " sanctuary " and " @entity105 " on the @entity94 channel
" @entity27 " executive producer @entity107 knows what sci - fi fans have been missing and said it was a specific design of the show to get writers who could offer compelling stories
" we literally had writers from ' @entity8 , ' ' lost , ' ' heroes ' and for the second season , a writer from ' @entity5 , ' " @entity107 said
" we specifically went out there to pursue people who could tell those types of stories
but then we also wanted to make sure the people that were tuning in weekly who did n't know about the mythology because maybe they missed a week or two could still get on for the ride , " he said
@entity125 , a co-executive producer and writer for " @entity27 " is one of those people
he 's worked on " @entity8 , " " @entity127 " and " heroes
" " one of the big differences i think with ' @entity27 ' from many other invasion shows is that we 're actually starting six months after the main ' shock and awe ' invasion has happened
so our survivors have had six months for the shock to fade and now they 're faced with a series of choices
they 're essentially under occupation from this alien force , which is very strange , " @entity125 said
the aliens are mysterious , he said , because they are n't talking or negotiating with the captive @entity25 population
" these are n't the @entity143 , who look like us and we can talk to and try to talk our way out of it or negotiate or something
these creatures are very complicated and strange
" @entity34 admits the aliens seen in " @entity27 " are " really freaky
" " we did n't have the benefit of knowing what they were going to look like when we shot the pilot , " he said
instead , the actors reacted to an image of one of the giant spiders from the movie " @entity158 " that was blown up on a piece of cardboard and carried around by a prop guy
freaky aliens and end - of - the - world scenarios are often catnip to the sci - fi fan community , something executive producer @entity162 knows all too well
" @entity169 ( @entity20 ) spoke about from the beginning is , it should feel incredibly authentic and incredibly grounded in real human emotions
people should be able to posit the question , ' what would you do if you were in this scenario ? ' " he said
apocalyptic science fiction uses out - of - this - world circumstances to describe human struggle , @entity162 said the most interesting area for " @entity27 " creators to explore was the human character , he said
" everything in terms of how we judge people in society -- socioeconomically , education-wise , all those things -- they go away immediately given what 's happened here , " he said
it 's one reason why science fiction fans love the genre so much
stories that envision the future can focus on how society evolves and what fantastic technology could exist , like @entity201 's vision in " @entity202 , " but they can also show a more directly relatable side of future humanity
" everyone pulls together for the good of all mankind " in apocalyptic science fiction , said @entity75
" there 's a lot more pulling together in science fiction than really any other genre
" " and you do n't see that every day
with a tragedy you do , you see people pull together for a little while and it gives you hope that people do have that in them , " she said .
