@entity0 -- former vice president @entity2 said sunday he supports the @entity5 administration 's decision to repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy banning gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military -- a move that was staunchly opposed by most top @entity11
" i think the decision that 's been made with respect to allowing gays to serve openly in the military is a good one " @entity2 told @entity1 's @entity16 on " @entity17
" " it 's the right thing to do
" the policy , first enacted during the @entity21 administration , was officially repealed on september 20
over 14,000 people were kicked out of the military due to " @entity24
" the controversial repeal of the policy became a focal point of a @entity11 presidential debate last month when members of the audience booed a gay soldier who asked about the decision
president @entity5 criticized the @entity11 presidential contenders on saturday night for failing to rebuke the audience
" we do n't believe in standing silent when that happens , " @entity5 told attendees at the annual @entity36 of the @entity37 , an organization that promotes equality for gays and lesbians
if " you want to be commander - in - chief , you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the @entity47 even when it is not politically convenient , " @entity5 said
@entity2 responded to @entity5 by noting that he 's " a little bit leery of the notion that somehow we ought to go hammer the @entity11 candidates because they did n't respond to booing in the audience
" " when you 're in a political campaign and debates , people boo a lot of things , " @entity2 told @entity1
" i 'm not sure that it was all focused specifically on that particular issue
" after the debate , former @entity61 sen. @entity60 said he had n't heard the booing when the question was asked
@entity60 was being asked the question when the incident occurred .
