@entity0 -- we start with the obvious question : why do the media , political observers and presidential campaigns spend so much time talking about the @entity8 vote ? many @entity9 resent the implication that some votes are more important or have more impact than others
( no one is saying that 's the case
) still , why do n't we talk with equal enthusiasm about voting by african - americans or white evangelicals or left - handed senior citizens who live in @entity21 ? here are four reasons : 1
the number of @entity25 voters has been increasing steadily -- by 2 million since the last presidential election
an estimated 12 million @entity27 are expected to cast ballots in november , up from 10 million in 2008
that could account for as much as 10 % of the total number of ballots cast across all demographic groups
latino voters live in swing states that pick presidents
they are a major presence in four battlegrounds : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41
while they are also a force in blue states such as @entity47 and @entity48 and red states such as @entity50 and @entity51 , their real influence is in the purple states
@entity8 are up for grabs , more than african - americans who vote overwhelmingly for @entity55 and white conservative @entity56 who usually support @entity57
while the majority closely identify with the @entity55 -- a december 2011 study by the @entity60 said 67 % call themselves @entity55 and 20 % @entity57 -- @entity8 have in the past shown a willingness to support @entity57 with moderate views on issues such as immigration
the @entity25 population will become more important and politically powerful
according to the 2010 census , the number of @entity8 in this country grew 43 % in the last decade
only one group is growing faster : @entity71
by 2050 , hispanics are projected to number 132 million and represent 30 % of the population
what questions would you like to ask the candidates ? share a short video question
it 's a new world
look no further than the 23rd @entity79 in @entity50 , where @entity80 rep. @entity80 and @entity55 challenger @entity81 recently faced off in a debate in @entity83
the debate was entirely in @entity84 , a show of respect in a district that is 66 % @entity8 and where 53 % of residents speak a language other than @entity90 at home
unfortunately , there are still remnants of the old world
for that , we can thank both political parties who put their own interests ahead of everyday @entity9 -- with @entity27 being no exception
in this nation of immigrants , the federal government and local law enforcement officers now work hand - in - glove to round up and deport the undocumented
and this is n't just happening in @entity57 - controlled @entity51
thanks to a program called @entity110 , which requires local police to submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of anyone they suspect might be in the country illegally ( read : @entity8 ) , that kind of cooperation is now standard operating procedure from sea to shining sea
the program was started at the end of 2008 , but it has been ramped up during the @entity124 as a way of increasing deportation figures
latinos , according to the @entity60 study , are nearly twice as likely as the general public to support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants
in the presidential matchup between @entity134 and @entity135 , @entity27 have a @entity136 between a @entity57 challenger who talks about getting tough on illegal immigrants and a @entity55 incumbent who already has
of course , there is always the chance that @entity27 do n't consider immigration a top priority
but we have already been assured that they do
by whom ? why , by @entity55 who use the issue to attack @entity57 , and @entity57 who use it to attack @entity55
back in the world of bad choices , if @entity27 fall in line behind @entity134 , despite his record 1.5 million deportations and the dividing of hundreds of thousands of families , they will send the president a clear message : " do with us what you will
we have no real influence and no power because we have no principles and no integrity
you can wipe your feet on our concerns , and we 'll still support you
" if they vote for @entity135 despite his harsh rhetoric in the primary , they 'll be saying : " it 's ok to propose simple solutions , to demagogue the immigration issue , to twist your opponents ' positions and to caricature immigrants as takers and a burden on society
we 'll still take a chance on you as a better alternative to what we have now
" if @entity8 voters go down either path , there could soon come a day when we wo n't have to worry about discussing the power of the @entity8 vote -- because there may not be much power to discuss
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .
