-- retired @entity2 agent @entity1 is charged with chasing down stories and shadows more than four decades old
retired @entity2 agent @entity1 is helping the bureau re-examine civil rights cases from the 1960s
" i knew these old informants , i knew these old witnesses , " @entity1 said
" some of them can not hear , some of them have really lost their eyesight almost , but you still , most of them had good memories
" and those are the ones that we called upon to testify
" in the 1960s , as a young @entity2 agent , @entity1 investigated civil rights cases in @entity20
" the 1960s were turbulent years in @entity20
oh , my goodness , " @entity1 said
" oh , we had a lot of action
" in 2005 , after he 'd been retired for years , the @entity2 asked him to help re-examine dozens of unsolved civil rights cases that had slipped through history 's cracks
" i never in my wildest dreams thought the @entity2 would call upon a 75 - year - old man to assist them , " @entity1 said of his work in the bureau 's cold - case initiative
his tasks include sifting through old evidence , tracking down witnesses and re-interviewing them
sometimes , he testifies in court
his work helped convict @entity40 , a former @entity20 sheriff 's deputy , of kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1964 deaths of black teenagers @entity44 and @entity47 @entity46
according to the @entity48 ( @entity20 ) @entity49 -- citing @entity2 documents -- @entity44 and @entity46 were picked up by two men while hitchhiking on may 2 , 1964
the men were members of the @entity53 , but they told the two teenagers they were law enforcement officials
instead of giving them a ride , however , the men drove the pair deep into the woods and beat them
later , they drove them across the @entity60 , weighed them down with a jeep motor block and dumped them into the @entity64 in @entity65
a fisherman found one of the bodies in july of that year and reported it to authorities , the @entity49 said
@entity40 and another man were suspected in the case , but authorities had trouble lining up witnesses
pursuit of the case dissipated over time , but as other civil rights - era cases were solved , notably the 2005 conviction of @entity79 for the deaths of three civil rights workers , interest was regenerated
" you can just imagine the terror of these two young men after being beaten in the woods , " @entity1 said
he and another @entity2 agent retraced the steps of that spring day with federal prosecutors , @entity1 said
" they knew they were going to die because ... [ the men ] told them what they were going to do
" @entity40 will be sentenced later this year , @entity1 said
@entity1 says he does feel a sense of accomplishment for bringing @entity40 and others to justice
" there is a feeling of satisfaction because i 've been at this thing for years , " @entity1 said
" i entered the @entity2 in 1953 , and here it is , my goodness , 2007 , and i 'm still active in many ways , and i told the @entity2 as long as my memory holds up , i 'll help them , " he said
