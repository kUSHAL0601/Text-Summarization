@entity0 -- the @entity3 is concerned that @entity4 may have given @entity5 access to the high - tech helicopter that crashed in the @entity3 raid on @entity10 's compound , a @entity3 official said monday
" we have reason to suspect @entity5 was given access but we can not confirm it definitively , " said a @entity3 official who is not authorized to discuss intelligence matters publicly
" we have strong suspicions
" the comment came after news reports suggested @entity4 authorities may have allowed @entity5 engineers to see the stealth aircraft
@entity4 's military has denied the allegation , saying there is " no truth to the report
" in a written statement , maj. gen. @entity27 told @entity1 the claim is part of a " malicious campaign " against @entity4 's security forces
@entity27 " expressed his astonishment at the far - fetched reporting of certain foreign media outlets , " the statement said
officials at the @entity37 in @entity0 did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the @entity41 newspaper in @entity42 reported that it had learned that @entity4 " allowed @entity5 military engineers to photograph and take samples from the top - secret stealth helicopter
" it added that " people close to the @entity49 and the @entity50 " told the paper that " the @entity5 were in fact given access to the helicopter
" @entity5 declined to comment , the article said
the @entity55 reported that " @entity4 's intelligence service probably allowed @entity5 military engineers to examine the wreckage , " citing " @entity3 officials and others familiar with the classified intelligence assessments
" it noted that the " @entity3 assessments were disclosed " by @entity41
when the aircraft crashed during the raid that killed the @entity67 leader in may , @entity63 destroyed most of it to protect the technology
but the tail section remained mostly intact and it was that area that the @entity5 engineers examined , according to the @entity55 report
@entity5 and @entity4 enjoy a long - standing military relationship , and the may raid that killed @entity10 -- staged without informing the @entity4 government -- stoked tensions between @entity0 and @entity78
in july , the @entity3 said it was withholding $ 800 million in aid to @entity4
" they 've taken some steps that have given us reason to pause on some of the aid which we 're giving to the military , and we 're trying to work through that , " @entity49 chief of staff @entity80 said at the time
@entity1 's @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity90 contributed to this report .
