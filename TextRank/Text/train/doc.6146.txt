there was a time when thursday night on @entity2 was truly " must - see tv " -- and it was thanks to comedies
the lineups changed gradually over the years , but they always brought in huge ratings and trounced the competition
the golden age began in the 1980s with a lineup of classics including the top - rated " @entity12 , " " @entity13 , " " @entity14 " and " @entity15
" the 1990s brought the debuts of " @entity18 " and " friends , " which went on to become two of the decade 's top tv sitcoms
those days are long gone
on friday , @entity2 announced a new midseason schedule completely absent of thursday night comedies
" @entity29 , " the last of the string , is set to finish its run on tuesdays
the new thursday will have hit drama " @entity32 " as its centerpiece
the day has been on the horizon for years
after " @entity36 " and " @entity37 " ended and " @entity35 " was canceled , thursday comedies began to dwindle
@entity38 , a hardcore tv watcher who posts his musings at @ @entity40 , said @entity41 and @entity42 have made strides on thursdays in recent years , loosening @entity2 's grip on the night
" what was really interesting to me was what happened last season , when @entity2 made a concerted effort to sign @entity52 thursday alumni @entity50 and @entity53 to very prominent sitcom deals , both of which flopped completely in the 9 p.m. hour , " he observed
it 's also a sign of changing tv viewing habits , @entity57 of @entity58 said
" today 's viewers watch tv in entirely different ways than they did in the 1980s and 1990s and broadcast networks are hit hardest by this change , " she said
" many viewers , especially younger viewers , watch shows on demand via dvr and via streaming services like @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73
this means there are almost no tv shows that are appointment tv like there were in the ' 80s and ' 90s
" that could have signaled the real end for @entity2 's comedy legacy on thursdays
nows , @entity2 's monday hit drama " @entity32 " will make the move to that night , following a prime showcase after the @entity87
@entity2 is hoping to make a ratings dent in @entity41 's thursday night dramas , not to mention @entity42 ' thursday night comedy lineup , led by " @entity91
" this comes in a season where many of the canceled shows have been comedies , including @entity2 thursday night shows " @entity96 " and " a to @entity97 " " as a longtime fan of tv comedy , it 's sad to see a broadcast network make this decision , " said @entity98
" i hope they 're not permanently abandoning the thursday comedy lineup
