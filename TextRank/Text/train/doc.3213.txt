-- no one ever expected the humble pencil to kickstart a revolution
but , by peeling apart pencil graphite into atom - thick layers using regular adhesive tape , two @entity8 - born scientists , @entity9 and @entity10 , earned a @entity11 in 2010
with it , they sparked the beginnings of a material that could change the world
it is no exaggeration to say that graphene , the substance that the two scientists -- along with others -- discovered in 2004 , is a miracle material
now a @entity25 research lab may have made the leap from theoretical to practical with the development of a new way to synthesize it , potentially on a commercial scale
the substance , " the perfect atomic lattice , " boasts a number of hugely attractive properties , meaning it has the potential to be used in myriad industries , and for a huge range of purposes
attractive properties as well as being super-strong -- 20 times stronger than diamond , 200 stronger than steel and six times lighter -- it is also remarkably conductive , both electrically and thermally
if that was n't enough , it is also almost perfectly transparent , impermeable to gas , and its properties are , scientists say , easily alterable
graphene is one form -- an allotrope -- of carbon , the basis of all life on earth
more familiar carbon allotropes include diamonds and graphite
what makes it unique is its thinness -- at one atom thick it is as good as two - dimensional
its flexibility means that it could potentially be used for flexible or wearable devices
" graphene has a lot of potential , especially in terms of industrial applications for optical and electronic devices , " says @entity67 , a professor of @entity68 at @entity69
" the caveat is really in the quality of the graphene that can be produced on a large scale ... if they can overcome that then it will be a big breakthrough
" another byproduct of its remarkable thinness is its low weight
it could be used to create ultra-light components for , say , the aviation industry , dramatically reducing the weight of aircraft -- and thus significantly improving fuel efficiency -- without compromising strength or integrity
the substance is so versatile that it has even been touted as the future of condoms
the @entity100 last year awarded a $ 100,000 grant to fund the development of graphene prophylactics
drawbacks currently , its limitations include the fact that its conductivity ca n't be turned " off , " meaning that as a semiconductor it is useless , although researchers are experimenting with the substance to figure out a way around this problem
one possible fix could be to build artificial breaks in the substance , allowing for circuits to be opened and closed , or to alter its properties with the use of chemicals
if this deficiency can be overcome , however , graphene could be used in a huge range of devices as a super-fast replacement for silicon transistors , which are already reaching their capacity
graphene has one hundred times the electron mobility of silicon
another limitation comes in the form of its production -- currently it can only be synthesized in small crystals
while this is enough for researchers to test its properties and understand the tantalizing benefits of the material , it is not sufficient to produce it for mass commercial use
but with an announcement made last week , all this could change
public - and private - sector funding governments and the private sector are actively exploring the potential of the substance , with the @entity152 devoting â ‚ ¬ 1 billion ( $ 1.3 billion ) to it between 2013 and 2023 , funding research which could potentially transform a range of sectors , including electronics , energy , health and construction
the @entity161 last week announced it had developed " a breakthrough synthesis method " of producing graphene , and the hopes are that this will pave the way for the commercialization of the material
the results were published in the journal @entity172
@entity161 sees graphene as the " perfect material " for next generation device , and the breakthrough could have huge implications for its commercial production
" this is one of the most significant breakthroughs in graphene research in history , " researchers said in a statement released by the company
" we expect this discovery to accelerate the commercialization of graphene , which could unlock the next era of consumer electronic technology
" in partnership with with @entity192 , the @entity161 has pioneered the growing of large - area , single crystal wafer scale graphene
previously , small graphene particles had been combined to form large - area graphene , but the process diminished both the mechanic and electric effectiveness of the substance
the material 's conductivity would make charging a device take a matter of seconds , and its strength , durability and flexibility would allow @entity161 to truly innovate with a whole range of new devices and ways to interact with technology
it has not been revealed if @entity161 plans to make the groundbreaking synthesis process public , a move that would rapidly accelerate the adoption of graphene into daily use
however , @entity67 thinks that it wo n't be long before the process is widely available
" i do n't think they can keep it proprietary very long , even if they want to ... this will start many factories around the world doing the same thing
