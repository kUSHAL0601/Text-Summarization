-- when mixed martial arts fighters @entity2 and @entity4 stepped into the octagon saturday night , they made history for women 's sports
when @entity2 stepped out , she was the champion in the first women 's match in the @entity10
@entity2 and @entity4 met in the headline fight for the @entity10 157 pay - per - view event in the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15
@entity2 used her signature armbar move to force @entity4 to submit late in the first round
" the place was going nuts , " @entity2 said , " and i 'm glad it was a full house and i 'm just honored to be a part of it
" meet the @entity10 's first female superstar just having two women in the ring was a historic first for the @entity10 , which has been around since 1993
in 2011 , @entity10 president @entity26 said there would never be a women 's @entity29 match in the @entity10
at the time , he was n't convinced people would pay to watch women fight
but then @entity2 came along , and @entity26 changed his mind
" i know i was the one talking smack about women 's @entity29 , " @entity26 said saturday night
" but i believed in this fight , and i believed in it enough to make it the main event
" before becoming an @entity29 fighter , @entity2 competed in judo
she took bronze at the @entity42 , becoming the first @entity43 to win a women 's judo medal since it became an @entity48 sport in 1992
on saturday , @entity2 found herself in early trouble for the first time as an @entity29 fighter
@entity4 , a former @entity52 , mounted @entity2 's back and tried a neck crank for several seconds before @entity2 escaped
" i was n't worried , but i was very aware of the situation , " @entity2 said
@entity2 recovered , responded with a series of strikes and eventually got @entity4 in an armbar
" it was a great fight , " @entity4 said afterward
" i thought i had it
" the armbar has been a reliable weapon for @entity2
she had won by armbar in all six of her previous @entity29 matches before joining @entity10
and like saturday , all six of those came in the first round
@entity2 improved to 7 - 0 in her @entity29 career and made history by winning the first women 's match in the @entity10
now , she just might become a household name
" this is something really special and it might take a little to really sink in , " she said
@entity0 's @entity76 contributed to this report .
