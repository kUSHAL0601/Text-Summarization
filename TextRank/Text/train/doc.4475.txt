-- @entity3 , @entity2 , resident @entity1 is worried about the spike in the number of pistol permits sought in his small town after a gunman massacred children and adults at an elementary school there last december
" i am concerned that it can get out of hand , " he said
" you only have two hands
how many guns can you fire at once ? " his concern prompted him to create the @entity20 in the wake of the shooting at @entity23 that claimed the lives of 20 children , all aged 6 or 7 , and six adults
its mission : to reduce gun violence
" @entity30 is n't in the lexicon
what we 're about is gun safety and anti-gun violence , " @entity1 , who does n't own a gun and does n't intend to , told @entity0 in a recent interview in @entity3
in the months since @entity41 shot through the doors of the elementary school and targeted children in classrooms , the demand for guns in this western @entity2 city has jumped
as recently reported by the @entity46 , the @entity47 issued 171 pistol permits in 2012
as of august 8 this year , it has issued 209 permits , already a 22 % increase over last year 's total
if applications continue at this rate , @entity3 is on track to double the amount of pistol permits it issued last year
five things to know about guns and while government data show the number of @entity64 who own guns has been declining for several decades , experts say we are now seeing more guns in the hands of fewer @entity64
" i think it 's a little bit of a reaction to what 's going on both here and across @entity64 where i think the gun owners are seeing there is this huge outcry in the @entity64 to reduce gun violence and there 's a perception that the government is going to come and grab all their guns , or is not going to allow them to purchase certain guns , " said @entity69 , another @entity3 resident who 's also a member of the @entity20
that 's one reason why @entity84 -- a widow , grandmother and former @entity3 resident who 's never owned a gun -- applied for a permit to buy one in january
she lived in @entity3 for 28 years before recently moving to the nearby town of @entity93
" @entity96 did not prompt me , " she said of applying for the permit , which she finally got in may
" when i started to hear all the gun control talk , that 's what prompted me , " @entity84 said , adding that she 's looking to buy her first firearm now because she wants to be able to protect herself in her home , if needed
it was also a reaction to the tougher gun laws the state of @entity2 passed in april , she explained
" our rights are being slowly infringed upon and that this whole idea of controlling guns has come to my backdoor
in other words , there may be a time when i may never be able to get a firearm , " said @entity109
the new gun legislation in @entity2 is among the toughest in the nation
it adds more than 100 guns to its list of banned assault weapons and limits the capacity of magazines to 10 rounds
it also mandates the creation of the nation 's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of a dangerous weapon , among other things
@entity3 - based firearm trade group sues for repeal of @entity2 gun law the new laws in @entity2 prompted @entity137 to buy another gun this year
" i thought it was 100 % certain they were going to pass more strict gun laws , " said @entity137 , a @entity3 resident who owns multiple guns but did n't want to discuss what types of firearms he has
for him , it 's a matter of protecting his wife and two children
" i do n't criticize police departments , they simply ca n't be everywhere
just like @entity150 , they could n't be everywhere , " he said
" so i think at the end of the day , an individual has to take responsibility for themselves
" @entity137 believes @entity2 's new gun laws put residents in danger
" the restriction on magazines is a real threat to people who are law abiding citizens that just want to protect themselves and their family
" @entity166 , whose daughter , @entity167 , was among the victims at @entity150 , said the increase in pistol permits in @entity3 is " sad , it 's really sad
" " it makes me sad to think that people , they think they 're protecting themselves , but they 're just adding to the problem
" @entity150 was a substitute teacher at the elementary school
her family says her lifelong dream was to be a teacher
" it does n't compute in my brain that you buy more guns because somebody got shot at the school , " her father said , adding that he had his first dream about his daughter just last week -- the first since she died
" that does n't change anything
it 's going to make things worse
" gun demand surges nationwide the @entity196 says there have been 38 straight months of increased gun sales in the @entity64
in @entity2 , the number of background checks for potential gun purchases rose nearly 53 % from the six months before the @entity3 mass shooting to the six months after
@entity204 statistics show the number of background checks it conducts nationwide has also steadily increased over the last three years
in 2012 , the @entity204 conducted 19,592,303 background checks on potential gun buyers , compared with 14,409,616 in 2010
but , the @entity204 notes , " a one - to - one correlation can not be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale " because of differing state laws
according to the most recent data from the @entity214 , roughly 6.5 million guns were manufactured in the @entity64 in 2011 , nearly a million more than in 2010
has the moment passed ? why gun control push fizzled tragedy spurs gun sales in the year following the january 2011 mass shooting in @entity221 , @entity222 -- in which 20 people , including congresswoman @entity224 , were shot and six people were killed -- the number of background checks for potential gun purchases conducted by the @entity204 in @entity222 increased by nearly 50,000 from 2010
there was a similar spike in @entity231 following the mass shooting at an @entity234 movie theater in july 2012 in which 12 people were killed and 58 were injured
the number of @entity204 background checks for those attempting to buy a gun in @entity231 increased 44 % from the year before the @entity234 shooting to the year following it
back in @entity3 , @entity69 says he wants to educate people about gun violence
he does n't want his city to be remembered only for the senseless shooting that happened there
" we have a real desire here to be remembered as the place that made a difference in the world
i think we make a difference in the world by transforming our culture and trying to change the gun culture in a positive way so we can reduce the risk of another @entity150 occurring , " @entity69 explained
" my heart breaks for them
it truly does , " says @entity109 , referring to the victims of the @entity3 shooting and their families
but , she says , " did the guns cause the tragedy ? no. it is the person behind the gun that caused the tragedy
