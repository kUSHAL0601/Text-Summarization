@entity0 -- congressional republicans pummeled him with questions and accusations , all but accusing him of perjury
but @entity7 just did n't sit there and take it
the @entity11 commissioner hit back
this all has unfolded over the past several days with @entity7 enduring two grueling appearances before @entity15 committees led by @entity16 , who have been aggressively pursuing the controversy over @entity11 targeting of conservative groups
" i did n't come out of retirement to play games , " @entity7 told reporters after monday night 's marathon hearing before the @entity22
" i came out of retirement to restore the credibility of the @entity11
" he 's new to the top job since the targeting revelations rocked the agency last year , and triggered congressional inquiries
but @entity7 , 74 , a government veteran , is taking the brunt of congressional pressure now after the agency admitted it lost thousands of emails wanted by lawmakers investigating the scandal
rep. @entity37 flat out questioned whether he was being truthful with @entity38 , and @entity39 , the @entity40 chairman , called him out for being evasive
" all the emails we have will be provided
i did not say i would provide you emails that disappeared
if you have a magical way for me to do that , i 'd be happy to know about it , " he said
that answer raised eyebrows in an environment where committee chairman are rarely crossed
e-mails : ex-irs official @entity54 queried sen. @entity56 invitation mixing it up but it looks like @entity7 likes to mix it up , and from all appearances , it looks as if he likes to take the field when the chips are down
firm , direct and experienced
that about sums up the no nonsense former corporate executive who also held top positions in government and is a big league @entity70 political donor
he also does n't really need a job
financial disclosure papers show his personal wealth may be as high as $ 27 million
the @entity15 described him as a " retired corporate restructuring expert " before president @entity77 nominated him to the post last summer
" @entity7 is an expert at turning around institutions in need of reform , " @entity77 said at the time
" i am confident that @entity7 will do whatever it takes to restore the public 's trust in the agency
" @entity7 went to @entity87 undergrad and @entity88 before clerking for a federal judge
he has political chops , too
having worked for a @entity92 mayor , a senator , and was once deputy mayor of @entity0 during a financial crisis
he had a critical role in preparing for @entity96 , and headed mortgage giant @entity97 when its troubles were spinning out of control
he also helped manage two government shutdowns in 1995 when he worked in @entity102 's @entity15 budget office
@entity103 , a former @entity97 board member , told @entity104 that @entity7 boosted morale as the agency struggled to survive
" obviously after the financial crisis , the company was in internal and external crisis , " @entity103 said after @entity77 nominated @entity7 for the @entity11 job
" @entity7 walked in and immediately handled what was happening with the company
he had the quiet strength and openness to take a very depressed management team and employee group to give them the confidence they were valued and the company had a future
" ' unflappable ' and ' honest ' @entity7 also served on the board of trustees at @entity87 from 1985 to 1998 and chaired the board 's business and finance committee during the tenure of then - university president @entity126
@entity126 , who is also a psychiatry professor , said he spent a lot of time working with @entity7 during difficult financial times at the university and called @entity7 " remarkably talented
" and although congressional republicans are questioning his integrity , @entity126 said @entity7 was a " very , very honest guy " and steady
" he was quite unflappable back then and really a joy to work with , " @entity126 said
beating back accusations while @entity7 could plunge a @entity87 boardroom into a deferential silence , @entity38 is a very different animal
by the end of his question time on monday , a dissatisfied @entity39 proclaimed : " i 've lost my patience with you
" but @entity7 kept his cool
rep. @entity143 , a @entity144 @entity16 , tried to push @entity7 to say whether a crime had been committed amid the @entity11 scandal
@entity143 pushed back after @entity7 said he had not seen any evidence of a crime or any evidence for any number of other things relating to the lost emails belonging to former top @entity11 official @entity54
" we have no evidence whether she ( @entity54 ) beat her dog , whether she beat children , " @entity7 said
but then @entity143 questioned @entity7 's integrity when he said he would not call the @entity159 to investigate the agency
" i reject the suggestion that my integrity depends on my calling the @entity159 , " @entity7 said , and later said there were " no facts " behind @entity143 's criminal accusations
he later said he had n't seen any evidence of " wrongdoing " in the loss of @entity54 's emails , triggering more @entity16 incredulity
@entity172 official : @entity11 did not follow the law @entity11 blasted over lost hard drive key questions about the controversy
