@entity1 , @entity0 -- the war in @entity0 may no longer be forgotten but the true victims always are
having been denied healthcare and education under the @entity8 , @entity0 women are now training as midwives women and children in the landlocked @entity13 country have continuously paid the ultimate price throughout the decades of conflict and war
it is their lives that are considered not precious enough to save
a woman here dies every 29 minutes due to childbirth complications , according to the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) -- one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world
one in four children die before they reach the age of five because of the lack of health care and medical facilities in their cities and villages
but ignorance is also deadly
misguided cultural pride prevents men from allowing their women to see a doctor , merely because the doctor could be male
and in many cases , it 's not just women who die from childbirth - related issues
it is young girls forced into marriage before they even reach puberty
their still - forming bodies can not handle the complications of childbirth
but there are women in @entity0 stepping up within the crowds of the forgotten and pushing past the barriers
they are training as midwives across the country to help bring change and save lives
" a woman can help a woman more , " midwifery student @entity59 told @entity2
" we have to introduce them with what to do , what foods to eat , how to take care of themselves
" [ we ] tell their husbands how to treat them
there are some husbands who beat their wives to the point where they can no longer even get pregnant
" at the @entity75 in @entity1 , dozens of future midwives study and practise in the hope of bringing a brighter future to their countrywomen
" it 's very heartbreaking , " @entity59 said of the situation women face
" @entity0 has gone through so much war and most girls were not allowed to get an education , so i want to study and bring forth something new
" sympathy for @entity0 women is the strongest motivating force among students in this field : many know personally what is like to live in a society where pregnant women are ignored and forgotten
" we live in an area where we are far from any clinic or hospital and there are a lot of difficulties there for pregnant women , " @entity97 , a student and mother , told @entity2
" it 's very difficult for them to reach a hospital
this is why i was so keen in learning this profession and helping these women ; so in the future they are in less danger
" all the women here are training with the permission and support of their families
they are leading the way to a brighter tomorrow for @entity0 women -- one that may one day catch up with the rest of the world
" the world is moving forward and he did n't want me to sit around jobless , " said future midwife , @entity126 whose husband is supportive of her new career
" he wanted me to push ahead in this field , especially a field in which our people need help in
" there are still many obstacles left and these women are still in the minority
according to the @entity142 there are only about 2,000 trained midwives servicing @entity0 's population of just under 33 million
but that is a giant leap from just eight years ago when most women were denied an education , medical care and the basic necessities of survival under the @entity8 regime
it will take many years to change mindsets instilled by decades of brutality
but these women prove that maybe , just maybe , the next generation can fix the mistakes of the last .
