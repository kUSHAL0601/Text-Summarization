-- in 2009 , we wrote a book , " 40 more years : how democrats will rule the @entity4
" building on @entity5 and @entity7 ' 2002 tour de force " the @entity9 " predicting the 2008 election , we argued that @entity11 's diversifying and increasingly liberal youth voters would secure a lasting @entity3 majority
our collaboration seemed appropriate then and is only more so now
on one half of the byline , you have @entity18 , 68 - year - old white man from @entity19 and professor at @entity21
on the other side , you 've got a 26 - year - old second - generation latina with a fiancée
voters who look like @entity18 are on their way out ; voters like @entity28 are our future
a few reviewers missed the point of our focus on demographics
others , primarily young , entitled , progressive men , critiqued us for not recommending that @entity3 focus on appealing to young , entitled , progressive men
to this , we plead guilty
our book was about demographic diversity and the future of the @entity3
politics : what the election teaches us about ourselves after the midterm elections in 2010 , we were mocked viciously
our thesis was laughable , @entity44 hooted , ignoring the book 's careful caveat that midterm election turnout differs substantially from that of presidential elections
we would like to direct these critics to the @entity52 , 1:10 : " yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand ; and what things they do understand by instinct , like unreasoning animals — these are the very things that destroy them
" tuesday night proved our 2009 selves could not have been more right
" mid- 20th century , white men made up half of the electorate , " we wrote in 2009
" in 2008 , white men made up only 36 % of the electorate ... and their vote share is dropping by a percentage point a year
" our only error was in slightly underestimating the rate at which white men 's vote share is shrinking
white voters were 74 % of voters in 2008 ; they were 72 % this year
@entity72 men comprised just 34 % of the electorate on tuesday
politics : the new @entity11 electorate has arrived in 2009 , we also commented on the @entity44 ' reliance on the far right and evangelical voters : " the shrinking @entity79 right leaves a void in the @entity44 ' collection of base groups — and they ca n't look to any growing groups to replace those votes
" @entity86 outperformed sen. @entity87 , the 2008 @entity44 presidential candidate , by 5 points with both white voters overall ( 59 % ) and white men ( 62 % )
he also bested @entity87 's margin among @entity44 , winning 93 % of self - identified republicans as compared to @entity87 's 90 % , and white evangelical voters , 79 % compared with @entity87 's 73 %
@entity86 lost by relying on a tapped - out , ever - shrinking group of voters
by way of contrast , @entity96 now make up a greater share of the electorate than they did four years ago : 10 % of all voters
@entity102 won 71 % of @entity96 , reflecting an increase in support of 4 %
similarly , the proportion of the electorate identifying as @entity107 increased from 2 % to 3 % , and @entity102 's support among @entity107 voters rose 11 points , from 62 % to 73 %
there 's an entire chapter in " 40 more years " on the importance of youth voters
four years ago , 18 % of the electorate was between 18 and 29
now , youth are 19 % of voters
we highlighted a critical trend within the youth vote : " back in 1972 , almost nine in 10 youth voters ( 87 % ) were white
by 2004 , only 62 % of youth said they were white
" this year , about 58 % of voters 18 - 29 identified as white ; 42.1 % of youth self - reported as @entity126 , @entity127 , or otherwise nonwhite
opinion : how @entity44 can attract @entity127 voters we also predicted the implosion of @entity44 ' culture war strategy
our conclusion was that " [ w ] hat @entity134 started in 2000 was a two - election trick that had met its natural and timely death by 2008
" our critics tried to answer our claim by citing the success of culture - war tactics in 2004 and their state - level effects in 2008
as we said , " the consequence of @entity44 ' lingering preoccupation with the culture war is that it has led them to become a party of ridiculous positions
" republicans would " have to be certifiable , " our sage selves circa 2009 warned , to ever try a culture war strategy again
we could not be more delighted that @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 became the first states in the country to pass same - sex marriage by popular vote on tuesday
what we 're downright thrilled about , however , is the fact that @entity86 got fewer votes than " traditional " marriage in every one of those states
the @entity44 did their damnedest to use the specter of homosexual marital bliss to incite their base voters to vote for @entity86
in the past , that has worked
this time , the best they could do with millions of dollars and overt hate mongering — their favorite weapons — was mobilize a conservative minority that voted for " traditional marriage " but rejected @entity86
some analyses have tried to make 2012 about single women or educated white women or some other narrow slice of the electorate
the big picture is this : democrats are continuing to win big with the demographic groups that are growing ; @entity44 are still struggling to increase support with shrinking base voter groups
republicans made critical , unforced errors in 2008 and 2012
our present hope is that @entity44 continue to mock rather than read " 40 more years , " and that @entity3 take heed
it 's not that we like saying we told you so
it 's just that we wrote an entire book telling you so
opinion : @entity44 voter suppression fueled black turnout the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity18 and @entity200 - @entity199
