-- this weekend , @entity2 's family will gather at a private memorial service to honor the legendary radio host , who died on @entity5 at age 82
" the world will miss @entity2 , an incredible talent and humanitarian , " his children @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 said in a statement
" we will miss our dad
" @entity2 dominated the radio world from 1970 until his retirement in 2009 and leaves a powerful legacy
yet at the end of his life , @entity2 's name dominated headlines for a different reason : a bitter legal battle as his family debated the best health care for the ailing radio host
a rift that dated back years between his wife , @entity29 , and children from his first marriage deepened as @entity2 's health deteriorated
@entity2 was incorrectly diagnosed with @entity33 in 2007 , a diagnosis that was later changed to a progressive brain disorder called @entity35
lewy body dementia is the most misdiagnosed form of dementia , according to the @entity39
like @entity40 's , confusion and memory loss are present , but visual hallucinations , severe sleep disruptions , fluctuating alertness and problems with movement are also symptoms
as @entity2 lived out his final days , the family feuded over the best care options for him
@entity2 's children said they were complying with their father 's wishes to die comfortably and peacefully surrounded by family and friends , while his wife claimed they were ceding care and prematurely ending @entity2 's life
@entity2 's family feud " my husband 's a fighter ! he 's an @entity62 treasure
he would have never , ever wanted this , " @entity63 tearfully exclaimed to @entity0 shortly before @entity2 's death
the family battle over @entity2 's end - of - life care was magnified by the media
yet the story of families facing difficult decisions at the end of a loved one 's life is one that millions of @entity62 can relate to
" if you take away the fact that he has a net worth of $ 80 million , he represents a case that is a very typical , " said @entity75 , an elder law attorney based in @entity76 , @entity77
" i think we 're going to see more of these cases hit the limelight at all levels
" baby boomers are turning 65 at the rate of 10,000 per day , according to the @entity88 , a trend that 's expected to continue for the next 16 years
people 65 and older are expected to make up 20 % of the total @entity62 population by 2050 , according to the @entity92 on @entity93
" we 're in the midst of a longevity revolution , " said @entity94 , co-founder and director of @entity96
" we now live 30 years longer than we did 100 years ago
sixty is not the new 50 ; 60 is the caregiver of the 85 year old
" eighty - five - year - olds today are driving , playing tennis and going to book clubs
yet extended life spans require resources , and the responsibility of caring for loved ones with dementia or diminishing physical capabilities can weigh on families -- emotionally and financially
overwhelming burden , cost of @entity40 's to triple " we have to make decisions about how we want to end our lives , " @entity94 said
it 's always too soon until it 's too late
do n't wait for a diagnosis ; do n't wait for until someone is in the @entity119 " it 's important for seniors to designate a health care agent , also known as a proxy or surrogate , to speak on their behalf when they become ill or cognitively impaired
while a spouse or child may seem like the obvious choice , sometimes a health care agent more removed from the situation is emotionally better suited for making tough choices
it 's essential that the proxy have a strong backbone and be willing to fight for the elderly person 's wishes
" i see it all the time , the edginess that occurs when somebody starts becoming incapacitated , " @entity75 said
" issues of power come to the forefront , internal struggles between family members rise to the top , and it all explodes
" seniors should write down specific instructions about their end - of - life care and identify the designated health care agent in a document called a durable power of attorney for health care
the written record ultimately becomes a gift to family members , since it eliminates the guessing game
it 's also important for you to be aware of your state 's medical laws
many states have a pecking order for designating a health care agent : spouse , children , parents , then siblings
however , some go by different rules ; for instance , @entity170 will not let anyone step in to make decisions if a health care agent is n't designated , while @entity175 allows the patient 's tending physician to determine who will be the best decision - maker
" i 've never heard anybody say , ' i want to end my life with a feeding tube and on a respirator or ventilator , ' but that 's what happens to a lot of people if they have n't expressed their wishes , given the medical system , " @entity94 said
dying : what no one wants to talk about beyond medicine , it 's essential to also think about other care decisions , such as whether you would prefer hospice care or to be moved back home for your final days
the most imperative thing for families to remember , @entity94 says , is that even if there are varying religious views amongst family members , the specific wishes of the ailing elderly individual must be respected
" a lot of families can relate to the chaos and confusion
when you do n't hear the voice of the person you love in your ear , you always doubt whether you 've done the right thing , " @entity94 said
the @entity96 seeks to eliminate the stigma surrounding conversations about death and encourage families to have early discussions about end - of - life decisions
a recent survey by @entity220 indicated that 90 % of seniors thought it was important to plan their end - of - life decisions , but only 30 % of those people actually had open discussions about facing death
" too many people are not dying in ways they choose ; too many are experiencing hard deaths , " @entity94 said
" the difference between a good death or a hard death is whether they had sat down at kitchen table , talked about values and talked about how they wanted to live at end of life
" " @entity2 is a celebrity , but this is an everyday @entity62 story
" opinion : give patients end - of - life options common end - of - life medical terms @entity0 's @entity246 contributed to this story .
