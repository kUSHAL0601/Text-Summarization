-- as recognizable as the brand itself , @entity2 is adamant about one thing in fashion : " @entity7 is not frivolous , " she told @entity0
@entity8 , femininity and sensuality : the three watchwords of @entity2 's fashion empire
it may not be frivolous , but in many respects it is a form of fantasy , something that @entity2 has developed as head of the @entity19 fashion house since taking over the reigns after the tragic death of her brother @entity22
" we sell a lifestyle , so to own one piece of @entity2 is like to own a whole outfit of expensive things
that 's why we do many different things , " she told @entity0
with a range of lifestyle items from sunglasses to furniture and even hotels , the @entity32 brand developed since the 1980 's when it was all about supermodels and a confident , almost decadent , glamour
not that the rich and beautiful have disappeared from the world of @entity2
fans and faces of @entity2 read as catalogue of glossy party a-listers included @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51
@entity32 was one of the first fashion designers to recognize the power of celebrity , and @entity2 , working with her brother , had a strong hand in the advertising campaigns
with iconic photographer @entity61 taking the shots , his images and @entity2 's direction helped create the bold image of @entity2 in the 1980s and early 1990 's making it synonymous with toned and beautiful @entity65 stars
it was @entity22 who designed " that dress " that launched @entity71 's career and @entity2 's own safety pin moment came when @entity47 had the paparazzi and fashionistas goggling when she wore a plunging green @entity32 at the @entity75 in 2000
while she has taken the @entity32 company in her own direction , @entity22 was a huge influence on her life , encouraging her to join him when he was setting up his burgeoning fashion business
" @entity22 was a very strong personality
we were two people who loved each other dearly
we were brother and sister
when @entity22 became a big fashion star i was the only one who told him the truth , " she said
after he was shot dead outside his @entity94 home in 1997 , @entity2 had to cope with running the fashion empire and deal with her own grief
" i did n't know if i would follow exactly @entity22 's steps or find my own way and i was suffering from my brother 's death
but in the meantime i had to be strong because everybody around me was looking at me for direction
but then i found my way and i started to believe in myself more and more , find my confidence and here i am , " she told @entity0
the @entity32 image may be more toned down compared to 20 years ago , but for @entity2 the three guiding words of @entity2 remain : " glamour , femininity and sensuality
" " i think fashion is to make people dream
nobody thinks they are going to look exactly like the model on the runway , nobody wants people to think that , but it is here to make people to want to have something
i try the best i can to try and make people to want and desire things , " she said
@entity125 is one part of the world that @entity2 is increasingly selling the dream , with the first @entity32 show in @entity130 in early november signifying a new chapter in the @entity32 brand expansion
" @entity125 people view fashion in a different way from other people
they buy the whole style , the whole look together
in other countries they like the accessory or they like the clothes but they like one thing of the look
[ in @entity125 ] it 's good because you can convey they message together , " she told @entity0
@entity2 's fashion tips : @entity0 : what should a woman always have in her wardrobe ? @entity2 : a pair of black high heels
@entity0 : what should a man always have in his wardrobe ? @entity2 : a pair of low - waist pants
it makes your upper body taller and your shoulders larger
@entity0 : what is the most commonly made fashion mistake ? @entity2 : too much make - up and clothes together
it 's about one of those , not all
@entity0 : what is the ugliest trend you 've ever seen ? @entity2 : flat shoes and lunch pants together .
