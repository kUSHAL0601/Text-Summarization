-- ten states plan to file a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the new health care reform bill , @entity2 's attorney general announced monday
@entity7 , the @entity8 attorney general under fellow @entity9 gov. @entity9 , told a news conference that the lawsuit would be filed once president @entity12 signs the health care bill into law
he said he 'll be joined by his counterparts in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24
all of the attorneys general in the 10 states mentioned by @entity7 are @entity8 , but @entity7 said the lawsuit would be about the law and not politics
also monday , @entity30 's @entity8 attorney general said his state would file a lawsuit challenging the health care bill
it was unclear if @entity30 would join the other states or proceed on its own
the @entity38 @entity37 passed the bill on sunday night , and @entity12 intends to sign it tuesday , according to @entity42 sources
what will health care reform mean to you ? @entity7 said the lawsuit would challenge the bill 's provision requiring people to purchase health insurance , along with provisions that will force state government to spend more on health care services
" this is a tax or a penalty on just living , and that 's unconstitutional , " he said of the mandate to purchase health coverage
" there 's no provision in the @entity61 giving @entity62 the power to do that
" @entity7 also said that portions of the bill would force states to spend money they do n't have , which he called a violation of the 10th amendment to the @entity72
" there 's no way we can do what 's required in this bill and still provide for education , for foster care , for the incarceration of prisoners , all the other things that are in this bill , " he said
@entity7 said he expected the lawsuit to eventually reach the @entity38 @entity85
later monday , @entity87 press secretary @entity86 said the @entity12 administration expected to win any lawsuits filed against the health care bill
the @entity42 governor of @entity24 criticized her state 's attorney general , @entity92 , for being part of the planned lawsuit
gov. @entity96 issued a statement that said she disagreed with @entity100 's decision and that the attorney general was not representing her
@entity96 's statement also said she would actively oppose the lawsuit .
