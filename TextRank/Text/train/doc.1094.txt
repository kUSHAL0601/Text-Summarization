@entity0 -- shots fired at a congressman 's campaign headquarters
windows smashed at @entity7 offices across the country
a coffin placed on a lawmaker 's lawn
hate - filled voice mail messages left on members of @entity15 ' phone lines
those are just some of the incidents reported since the @entity18 passed historic health care reform legislation sunday -- a bill that became the law of the land
the issue has unleashed a deep - seated anger from those worried about a government takeover of health care , and what they deem as the process being " rammed through " @entity15
@entity31 , with the @entity32 , said that while many of the acts may be protected under first amendment rights , " that does n't mean that they 're morally justified
" " and we have to think of ourselves as , ' what kind of people are we ? ' " @entity31 said
" are we one people working together with rival thoughts , or are we enemies within ? and i think there 's something that 's been let loose in @entity47 politics that has to be thought about
" that anger was visible in unruly protests by health care activists at the @entity51 over the weekend
@entity53 @entity18 members encouraged protesters outside and inside the @entity18 gallery , some of whom carried messages like " vote no or else " or " if @entity60 wo n't stop it , a @entity59 will " -- a reference to newly elected @entity63 sen. @entity60 accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol
but the anger has boiled over into physical and verbal threats
windows have been smashed at @entity7 offices in at least three states , and federal agents are investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a @entity76 congressman 's brother was related to the lawmaker 's yes vote
@entity53 have the right to be angry over the @entity83 's health care bill , but " resorting to violent measures is exactly the wrong way to send a message , " @entity80 chairman @entity79 said thursday night
rep. @entity87 , @entity89 - @entity88 , confirmed thursday that his district office in @entity91 received an envelope containing white powder and a threatening letter
later thursday , @entity87 told @entity1 that initial tests indicated the powder was not a biological agent , but that he still was awaiting final word from the @entity98
workers at the office turned over their clothes for testing and were given protective suits before being allowed to go home a few hours later , @entity87 said
the @entity105 and other law enforcement agencies are now looking into the threats , and at least 10 @entity18 @entity7 have been given extra security
the voice mail has been vicious toward @entity111 's @entity110 , who switched his vote to seal the deal for the bill
he has released one of the voice mails
listen to the voice mail " @entity110 , you are a lowlife , baby - murdering scumbag , pile of steaming crap
you 're a cowardly punk , @entity110 , that 's what you are
you and your family are scum , " an unidentified caller said
" that 's what you are , @entity110
you are a piece of crap
" " go to hell , you piece of [ expletive deleted ] " another caller said
read more about @entity110 's political future on sunday , @entity7 rep. @entity133 of @entity134 had a coffin placed on his lawn , said his spokeswoman , @entity137
she said @entity139 protesters at his office in @entity141 had a coffin with them and later brought it to his house
the coffin was later removed , she said
@entity7 congressional leaders have demanded @entity53 join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed sunday 's vote on the health care system overhaul
the top @entity53 in the @entity18 , minority leader @entity151 , condemned the threats and vandalism , telling reporters thursday that it " should not be part of a political debate
" " there are ways for people to channel their anger , and they should do it in a constructive way , " he said
@entity162 , a @entity53 consultant , said protesters " are unfortunately crossing a line
" " when we 're talking about violence , vandalism , threats , that crosses a legal line , in addition to being in plain old bad taste , " @entity162 said
" and i think that there 's a lot that is in plain old bad taste that is going on
" @entity7 are n't the only ones being targeted
rep. @entity175 , the no. 2 @entity53 in the @entity18 , said thursday that a bullet had been fired through a window at his campaign office in @entity180 , @entity76
watch @entity175 warn against @entity7 " fanning flames " a @entity180 police spokeswoman confirmed to @entity1 that a bullet was fired at the congressman 's office
" we are investigating the circumstance surrounding it , " spokeswoman @entity187 said
@entity175 also said that he had received threatening messages but that he would not publicly release the messages out of concern that doing so would only incite further violence
he also accused @entity195 chairman @entity194 and rep. @entity196 of @entity197 -- a member of the @entity7 @entity18 leadership -- of " fanning the flames " of violence by using threats that have been made against @entity7 members " as political weapons
" @entity205 : ' violent threats after the @entity206 ' " enough is enough , " @entity175 said
" it has to stop
" @entity195 spokesman @entity208 hit back against @entity175 's claims
" we disagree with the charge made by rep. @entity175 today that @entity7 are using acts of violence for political gain , " he said
" let 's be clear : calling on @entity53 leaders who have contributed in part to this anger by wildly mischaracterizing the substance and motives of health reform to condemn these acts is entirely appropriate
" another @entity53 -- rep. @entity224 of @entity225 -- said in a news release thursday that she received what appeared to be a death threat on her district office 's voice mail
" just wan na let you know i have 27 people that are going to make sure that this b * * * * does not live to see her next term
goodbye , " the voice mail said , according to the release
@entity224 said she contacted both the @entity240 and the @entity242 sheriff , and they are " looking into the matter and subpoenaing telephone records
" at least one of the threats aimed at lawmakers appears to be racially based
@entity18 @entity7 majority whip @entity248 , who is @entity249 , said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home
" we 're giving aid and comfort to these people , and this stuff gets ratcheted up , " @entity248 told @entity1
" we in this @entity15 have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down
it does n't make sense
that 's not what a democracy is all about
" @entity7 officials and liberal web sites are also upset that @entity270 used an image of crosshairs in a @entity274 post this week listing 20 vulnerable @entity7 who voted for the legislation
she plans to target them this election year with money from her political action committee

one @entity18 member mentioned her @entity274 posting during a wednesday meeting on safety concerns , a @entity7 source told @entity1 's @entity291
mention of the map brought audible groans to the room , the source said
an adviser to @entity270 responded by pointing to several instances in which the former @entity299 governor has urged supporters to focus their energies on civil debate and action at the ballot box , not extremist activities
@entity1 's @entity306 , @entity291 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310 contributed to this report .
