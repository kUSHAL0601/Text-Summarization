a gruesome snuff video that has garnered more than 180,000 views on @entity2 underlines just how grim the @entity4 conflict has become
this video appears to document one of the worst kinds of war crimes : the summary executions of wounded men
( warning : the scenes are extremely graphic
) several paramilitaries in battle fatigues armed with automatic weapons -- some speaking @entity16 in distinctive @entity18 accents -- pull wounded men out of the back of a van and drop them on to the ground , then shoot them in their heads at point - blank range
as they shoot their victims , some of the paramilitaries seem almost giddy with excitement
a man who appears to be their commander admonishes his men , " come on guys , we are here to carry out our duties not to seek revenge on our own
" one of the paramilitaries smilingly replies , " but we are killing them in @entity38 's cause , only in @entity38 's cause
" the wounded men lying on the ground awaiting their deaths repeat religious phrases that are commonly said just before death
they all appear to be civilians
there has been much analysis of the @entity49 - aligned groups in @entity4 fighting the @entity51 regime that have recruited thousands of foreign fighters from around the @entity54 world and a smaller number from the @entity56 , but there has been far less discussion of the @entity60 militias in @entity4 that have recruited foreign fighters from @entity62 as well as from @entity18 @entity63 , all of whom are fighting to support @entity4 president @entity51
@entity66 , an @entity67 journalist who is a fellow at the @entity68 and who has reported inside @entity4 for many months , says that one of the executioners in the videotape is wearing a distinctive yellow armband that @entity63 fighters wear
@entity66 says , " this appears to be a @entity63 video , though we can not conclude this with high confidence
" similarly , @entity80 , professor of international relations at @entity82 and the author of an authoritative study of @entity63 , says , " the only identifying marks on the uniforms are yellow ribbons , which , in theory , would identify them as @entity90
" @entity91 , also a fellow at the @entity68 and a scholar at the @entity93 who is writing a book about @entity63 , says that based on the accents of the @entity16 - speaking executioners the video shows @entity4 as well as fighters from @entity62 and @entity18
slim cautions , however , that the paramilitaries conducting the executions could well be members of an @entity104 militia made up mostly of @entity4 who have been trained by @entity63 , but that are not part of @entity63 itself
@entity107 , a researcher at the @entity108 who specializes in @entity60 militias operating in @entity4 , says that the fighters are likely from @entity63 as they speak in a @entity18 accent and when they perform the executions they mention a religious edict handed down by a key @entity63 religious guide
@entity114 is a @entity115 who worked at the @entity117 for much of the past decade as a @entity119 analyst , including a stint on general @entity122 ' staff during the @entity123 , and is now a vice president at the @entity125 , which supports " moderate elements of @entity4 's armed opposition
" @entity114 has been tracking @entity63 since 2007 and he asserts that the executioners in the video are definitely from @entity63 and that the video itself was shot in @entity132 province in western @entity4
an analysis done by @entity135 's international desk confirms that the dialect spoken by the executioners in the videotape is @entity139 and they can be heard shouting " @entity141 , " an @entity16 phrase that means " in @entity38 's cause , " an expression commonly used by @entity63 fighters on the battlefield
the international desk 's analysis points out that the yellow and green ribbons tied to the fighters ' uniforms appear to mark them as @entity63 fighters
as is now well known , many of the players in the @entity4 conflict , including most prominently the @entity51 regime itself , have committed war crimes against civilians
on friday , @entity161 released a report documenting a massacre on august 4 that was perpetrated by two @entity49 - aligned @entity165 militant groups , the @entity164 and @entity166
the massacre took place in the coastal region of @entity170 in a number of @entity104 villages supportive of the @entity51 regime
according to the report " eight survivors and witnesses described how opposition forces executed residents and opened fire on civilians , sometimes killing or attempting to kill entire families who were either in their homes unarmed or fleeing from the attack , and at other times killing adult male family members , and holding the female relatives and children hostage
" @entity161 collected the names of 190 civilians who were killed in these attacks , including 57 women and at least 18 children and 14 elderly men
while the world in the past few weeks has been distracted by the @entity67 government shutdown and the brutal attack on the mall in @entity198 by an @entity49 affiliate that left at least 67 dead , the @entity4 war has ground on
it is a war that has now claimed as many as 120,000 lives
four of those deaths are documented in the appalling videotape of the @entity60 paramilitaries gleefully executing wounded men who appear to be civilians
and the deaths of 190 civilians killed by @entity165 militias in august are documented in great detail in the @entity161 report that was released friday
just when you thought the @entity4 civil war could n't get any worse , it does .
