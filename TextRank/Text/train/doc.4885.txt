-- is the anger in @entity3 politics edging towards violence ? a man is shown legally carrying a rifle at a protest against president @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10
about a dozen protesters carrying guns gathered this week , not far from a building where president @entity8 was talking to the public about his plans to reform @entity3 healthcare
one of them had a rifle slung over his shoulder , a handgun in a holster and bullets in his back pocket
last week , a man protested outside another @entity8 healthcare meeting with a gun strapped to his thigh
it may be hard to believe but it was n't illegal
the meetings were held in parts of the @entity3 that restrict concealed weapons but allow them to be carried freely if they 're in plain sight
a small number of activists make a point of exercising that right
the @entity44 can bar anyone with a gun from entering the buildings where the president was speaking
the protesters stayed far enough away to avoid trouble , though one man was arrested for trespassing and police found a gun in his car
in both places , the protesters said they opposed the president 's plans for healthcare but meant him no harm
" an armed society is a polite society , " said @entity62
should people be allowed to own guns ? sound off below lately , the @entity3 has been anything but polite
the healthcare reform plan has sparked the angriest opposition that the president has encountered since taking office
most of the ire has been directed at lawmakers , who have also been meeting voters to discuss the plan
they 've been interrupted , insulted and threatened
@entity8 does n't attend those meetings but he 's hardly overlooked
a protester outside one meeting held up a sign saying " death to @entity8 " and " death to @entity82 and her two stupid kids
" is the president in danger ? when it comes to armed protesters standing outside a building while the president is inside , a @entity44 spokesman told @entity0 " of course not
" but @entity3 remember the assassinations of presidents from @entity94 to @entity95 and the attack that wounded @entity97
now , @entity8 's trips across the country to talk about health may be attracting people with guns
it 's an odd and unsettling thing .
