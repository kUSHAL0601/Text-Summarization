@entity0 , @entity1 -- want a sign of economic hope ? look to a place where the housing collapse began : @entity0 , @entity1
" we 're talking about ( home ) prices being 3 to 4 % higher than last year , which most people do n't believe because they 're used to bad news , " said @entity7 , director of @entity9 's @entity8
@entity7 's new report on the @entity0 market shows a direct reverse of the situation that sparked a massive housing bubble
monthly foreclosure starts have fallen 49 % since a year ago
home sales are up 8 %
the result ? what had been a market with far more housing supply than demand has now become a place where buyers have to act fast and beat out heavy competition
@entity2 's @entity31 reports on the turnaround in @entity0 " it 's no longer difficult to sell your house here , " @entity7 told @entity2
" if you price it at market , it well sell quickly
the supply situation is unusually low
" supply is down some 42 % , @entity7 estimates , from september 2008
top 10 turnaround towns that is a dramatic turnaround for an area that once had a massive supply glut
according to @entity7 's predecessor at @entity9 , @entity49 , during the recession foreclosures hit an eye - popping 12 % of the homes in @entity53 , which includes @entity0
but now @entity7 's report indicates that supply has been soaked up and @entity0 is again becoming a seller 's market where buyers must stand in line and move fast
" ( the listing ) came out on the market on a friday morning
we looked at it friday afternoon and put a bid on it friday night , " said homeowner @entity62 of his new house
he and his @entity69 Â© , @entity70 , are combining their two families , which includes five teenage girls who will all live at home
" so we need space , " @entity70 said
she and @entity62 had already lost bids on other homes and decided to put in a contract on what would become their home while sitting in the driveway after their walk - through
" according to the neighbors , there were 11 other couples who went through this house , " @entity70 said
" so you have to be quick
" @entity91 to slash mortgage balances by $ 100,000 or more @entity70 and @entity62 got their five - bedroom , three - bath house in @entity94 for $ 290,000 , 40 % less than the asking price a few years ago
but neither the homeowners nor the experts think buyers are getting bargains anymore
they believe prices have already passed their low point , hit their natural floor and are rising again
this is not the housing market of a year , or even eight months ago
" it 's getting very , very tough to find a real bargain nowadays , " said @entity105 , a @entity0 real estate developer who also teaches at the @entity8 for @entity106 at @entity9 's @entity107
the classic bargains , foreclosures and bank - owned properties , are drying up
according to @entity7 's new report , the number of homes reverting to lenders in the @entity0 area is down 62 % since january 2011
trustee sales of foreclosed properties are down 42 %
" the market has tightened up substantially , " @entity105 said
" in fact , i know of investors coming to town and leaving very disappointed because they thought they 'd find huge bargains and they ca n't find them
" the question is , will this trend last ? @entity7 , a self - professed data addict , says the numbers indicate a fundamental shift in the market
" if there is a major economic crisis that we have n't foreseen , things can go back to square one , " he said
" but this is not just a slight trend
this is something i see as being very significant
and it 's starting to accelerate
