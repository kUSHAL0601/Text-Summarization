within two weeks of the raid that killed @entity2 , the head of @entity4 special forces issued orders that all photos of the body be either turned in or destroyed , a newly released document shows
in an e-mail dated may 13 , 2011 , then - vice adm. @entity8 wrote the following : " one particular item that i want to emphasize is photos ; particularly @entity12 remains
at this point -- all photos should have been turned over to the @entity15 ; if you still have them destroy them immediately or get them to the [ redacted
] " the e-mail was obtained by the conservative activist group @entity20 , which has called for the public release of photos of the raid in @entity24 that killed the @entity26 leader
the e-mail , which was almost entirely redacted , was released under a @entity28 request
see a pdf of the redacted e-mail days before @entity32 's instructions , @entity20 had filed a @entity28 request for such photos , and hours before , they filed a lawsuit , according to the group 's president , @entity36
" despite there being multiple requests for this information , and a lawsuit for this information , there was a directive that was sent out , to who knows who , to destroy records , " he said
" it may have been in violation of the law , " he said
it is not clear whether any photos of @entity2 's remains were actually destroyed
through a spokesman , @entity8 declined to comment
retired gen. @entity56 , a @entity57 military analyst , says if @entity8 ordered photos deleted , he may have been trying to protect operational secrets , sources and methods and trying to make sure no commandos kept any photos or video of the covert raid that they were not authorized to keep
" it would n't be surprising if they shook them down , and they said ' ok , i want to make sure you do n't have something that 's hidden away someplace , ' " he said
in the days after the raid , president @entity72 said he would not authorize the release of any images of @entity2 's corpse , saying it would create a security risk
@entity2 : the fast facts " it is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence , as a propaganda tool , " the president told @entity82 news magazine " 60 minutes
" former @entity93 assistant director @entity92 said he would have similar concerns if photos of the terrorist 's body were made public
" you would see those images forever on television , " he said
" that could lead to more recruitment of future @entity26 members , making him a martyr
" @entity36 is not persuaded by that argument
" @entity4 ' right to know about what their government is up to should be circumscribed because we do n't want to offend terrorists and their sympathizers ? that to me is unbelievable , " he said
" this is a historic raid
people have a right to this information
" but so far , the courts have not sided with @entity20 on that question , and the @entity120 declined to hear the organization 's appeal
the @entity4 raid on @entity2 's compound in @entity125 , @entity24 , was conducted on may 2 , 2011
what the @entity4 planned if the raid in @entity24 had not worked ' nightmare ' at home for seal who shot @entity2
