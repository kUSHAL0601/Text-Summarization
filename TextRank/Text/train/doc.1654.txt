-- @entity1 , the 7 - year - old boy whose parents fought to get him an experimental antiviral drug , is recovering well -- sitting up on his own and even taking a few steps with the help of a walker and his parents ' supportive arms
" he 's getting stronger every day , " says his mother , @entity10
" we 're completely optimistic and hopeful that he 'll make a full recovery with no disabilities
" @entity1 was in critical condition and near death in march when the drug company @entity18 denied him the use of its drug brincidofovir
a few days later , following reports by @entity0 and intense pressure from social media , @entity18 reversed course and allowed @entity1 and other patients like him to become part of its clinical trials
@entity1 was released from @entity28 in @entity29 , last month but continues to receive care there
drug brings remarkable improvement for boy he , his parents and three brothers , who live in @entity37 , are now staying at an apartment near the hospital
his mother says he wo n't be healthy enough to return home until next month at the earliest
before receiving brincidofovir , an adenovirus was ravaging @entity1 's immune system , left vulnerable by treatment for cancer , and the only available antiviral drug to treat it was n't working
once he started taking brincidofovir , the adenovirus was gone from @entity1 's blood in two weeks
" it 's truly a miracle drug , " his mother says
while the adenovirus has disappeared , @entity1 is still suffering the effects of the medication his doctors gave him as a second - choice drug when he was n't allowed to take brincidofovir
he now receives blood transfusions once a week and dialysis three times a week
he has to be fed intravenously
but there are signs his kidneys are beginning to work
" on @entity67 he peed 110 milliliters at one time and i said , ' oh , thank you ! ' " his mother says
dying patients denied drugs traditionally , drug companies have not been allowed to treat so - called " compassionate use " patients such as @entity1 as study subjects , so helping them out has been pure charity work on behalf of the drug company
but the @entity78 allowed @entity18 to use data from @entity1 and others as part of its application to the agency , helping to get the drug on the market faster
the @entity86 said they were saddened to hear that @entity87 , who as president of @entity18 initially denied them the drug but eventually helped @entity1 get it , is no longer with the company
according to @entity18 , @entity87 resigned " to pursue other interests
" " i feel terrible
i feel like it was our fault , " @entity10 says
" he 's a genuine guy who was just put in a bad situation
" @entity87 says he 's looking for a new job
" the @entity1 family should feel no responsibility for this whatsoever , and i appreciate their kind thoughts , " @entity87 says
" i 'm collateral damage from a very complex situation
" @entity1 's father says son faces ' long road to recovery '
