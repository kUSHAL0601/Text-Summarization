@entity0 -- church bells rang out wednesday afternoon in @entity0 , marking a major moment in history -- @entity5 and the @entity6 are renewing diplomatic relations after decades of ice - cold tension
word of the massive change was met with passionate opinions and some protests in the @entity6
and tearful celebrations erupted in the streets of the island after president @entity16 announced the news in a televised address
but there was uncertainty and some anger amid the joy
dissident @entity5 blogger @entity23 tweeted that his neighbor asked him whether a change in @entity6 - @entity5 trade relations would mean that he could finally afford to buy meat
other dissidents worried that their concerns will now be overlooked
@entity30 , a well - known @entity5 blogger , decried what she described as a carefully plotted victory for the @entity16 regime in the swap of detained @entity6 contractor @entity35 for @entity5 spies imprisoned in @entity6
" with the main obstacle for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations eliminated , the only unknown is the next step , " she wrote in a column for 14ymedio.com
" is the @entity5 government planning another move to return to a position of force vis - a - vis the @entity6 government ? or are all the cards on the table this time , before the weary eyes of a population that anticipates that the @entity16 regime will also win the next move
" even with the next steps unclear , happiness spread quickly through a market in the heart of @entity5 's capital , where crowds watched speeches from @entity16 and @entity6 president @entity61 announcing the news on tv screens
" in the audience , " 14ymedio reported , " many threw kisses to @entity61 and hugged each other
" angry debates erupt in @entity69 in @entity69 , where the vast majority of the large population of @entity5 exiles once fiercely opposed any change in the @entity6 stance toward the island , reactions were split , mostly along generational lines
a rift over the embargo that political analysts have noted within the @entity5 - @entity6 community was on full display
angry debates erupted in the city 's @entity0 neighborhood between groups of younger demonstrators who said they supported @entity61 's decision to exchange the prisoners and thaw diplomatic relations and older protesters who said they were opposed to the move
outside the iconic @entity95 , demonstrators shouted : " @entity61 a coward ! @entity97 , coward , coward ! " one held a sign that read : " @entity61 administration conspiracy with @entity16 terrorist
" one man stood with an @entity6 flag around his neck , smiling and proudly holding a sign with @entity61 's face on it as other demonstrators yelled at him
a june poll by @entity112 found that more than half of @entity114 surveyed in @entity69 support an end to the embargo and a solid majority of them also favor restoring diplomatic relations with @entity0
younger generations who immigrated more recently , analysts say , are more open to dialogue and have different priorities than older generations who came to the @entity6 decades ago
@entity126 told @entity1 en @entity129 the time for change has come
" i represent a generation of @entity5 who are very interested in the future of @entity5
we think that the best days for @entity5 have yet to come
and we think that in the end , the @entity5 people need to stop being pieces in a game of chess , " he said
for decades , they were pawns in the @entity142 standoff between the @entity6 and the @entity143 , he said
then , he said , they became pawns in the @entity6 election politics as candidates jockeyed for @entity149 's 29 electoral votes and feared the political repercussions of reshaping @entity6 policies toward @entity5
" in the end , the 50 years of the embargo that we have had without having any type of dialogue with the @entity5 government has not done anything to try to change the system , " he said
" but it has allowed the @entity5 government to manipulate this status in order to be able to justify its actions
" @entity164 said she can sense a generational divide
" being a relatively recent @entity69 re-transplant , i think i have an optimistic view , " said @entity166 , a nonprofit , nonpartisan organization based in @entity69 that helps students and young professionals in @entity5 to their peers in the @entity6 to share information through the @entity172 and other technologies
there 's value to how older @entity5 - @entity6 feel , she said
but the conversation , she said , has shifted
" it 's more focused on what we ( @entity5 and the @entity6 ) can agree on as opposed to the things we disagree on
" ' i do n't trust the @entity16 government ' some older @entity5 , many of them exiles in @entity69 , were decidedly angry about the news
a crowd quickly grew outside the @entity95 , and hours before @entity61 addressed the nation to explain the release of @entity35 and the change in policy , many were fuming
while happy about @entity35 ' freedom , some said the price was too steep : the release of three @entity5 intelligence agents convicted of espionage in 2001 , and a sweeping change in @entity6 's diplomatic approach toward its communist neighbor
" there is a long history here of people who have a lot of anger , people who have been hurt , " said @entity203 , who 's been an exile since the 1960s
@entity69 mayor @entity213 , who came to the @entity6 in the ' 60s , said he thinks @entity5 will make more arrests and crack down even more on human rights after the @entity6 changes its policy
the @entity16 government wo n't change its ways , he said
@entity218 , another exile , said there 's a practical issue to consider : 70 % of @entity5 exiles " do n't support business to @entity5 , " he said
easing relations with @entity5 feels like a " betrayal , " @entity224 told @entity1 on wednesday
the 76 - year - old @entity114 came to the @entity6 in 1961 and had come to @entity95 for his morning coffee
" i do n't trust the @entity16 government , " he said
" but others in the @entity6 seemed cautiously optimistic
" it was a huge surprise for me , " said @entity230 , a @entity5 - @entity6 historian who also works for a public television station in @entity232
" i know that they opened economic doors
but beyond that , we are still in a situation that is just beginning
there is a lot more to do still
" @entity230 , who 's lived in the @entity6 since the 1960s , told @entity1 en @entity129 he was grateful that @entity61 had taken the steps to thaw relations with the @entity5 government , and interested to see what happens next
" the @entity5 side of me , " he said , " is hoping that someday i can travel to @entity5 freely
" @entity5 @entity247 @entity1 's @entity249 reported from @entity0 , @entity248 reported from @entity69 and @entity250 reported and wrote from @entity251
@entity1 's @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 and @entity1 en @entity129 's @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .
