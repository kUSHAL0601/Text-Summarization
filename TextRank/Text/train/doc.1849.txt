two @entity3 gunmen tried to kidnap two @entity5 embassy employees in @entity1 last month but were shot and killed by one of the @entity5 , a @entity1 government official told @entity7 on saturday
the attempted kidnapping was carried out by two armed men with @entity11 ( @entity11 ) on april 24 , and the fatal shooting occurred near a @entity1 barbershop " where many foreigners and diplomats go to get their hair cut , " the @entity1 official said
the two @entity5 @entity19 personnel , however , were apparently wayward and should n't have been at the barbershop , the official said
" these individuals violated security protocol , " the @entity1 official said
" @entity19 personnel are not allowed to leave their secure facilities
the @entity5 who shot the kidnappers had a gun permit and was authorized to carry a gun
the two armed kidnappers were @entity11 militants
they were n't unarmed civilians
" @entity30 , deputy spokeswoman for the @entity31 , said in a statement : " we can confirm that , last month , two @entity5 @entity19 officers in @entity1 fired their weapons after being confronted by armed individuals in an attempted kidnapping at a small commercial business in @entity39
two of the armed individuals were killed
the @entity19 officers are no longer in @entity1
" two @entity1 national security officials told @entity7 the plot against the @entity19 is bigger than initially believed
the revelation of the incident comes after the @entity19 in @entity1 was indefinitely shuttered wednesday amid security concerns and as fighting between security forces and @entity11 intensifies , including in the capital , @entity49
just days before the alleged abduction attempt , a joint @entity5 - @entity1 operation was being carried out against @entity11 in the @entity53 and @entity54 regions of @entity1 , but authorities did not disclose whether drones were used in the strikes
the use of the unmanned drones has stirred controversy due to the accidental killings of civilians in some cases , a high - level @entity1 official said at the time
on saturday , a top @entity1 @entity66 official said the @entity5 government had been considering closing the embassy two weeks ago , as attacks on foreigners intensified
the violence at the barbershop -- as well as violence against other foreigners in the past six weeks -- eventually convinced the @entity5 to close down the @entity5 embassy this past week , the official said
meanwhile , the @entity77 announced that seven more @entity11 fighters were killed saturday in the southern province of @entity54 during clashes with security forces
of all @entity3 - affiliated networks worldwide , @entity11 is considered the most dangerous threat to @entity5
meanwhile , the @entity1 government thursday expelled @entity5 freelance journalist @entity90 on accusations that " there was an issue with his documentation , " the @entity84 said
on @entity92 , @entity90 said the only official explanation for his deportation was he 's " no longer welcome in @entity1
" he 's written for the @entity96 and @entity97 and has lived in the @entity1 capital since january 2011 , his website says
a second @entity5 freelancer , @entity99 , was denied entry thursday into @entity1 after flying to @entity49 from @entity101 because , an unidentified @entity1 official told @entity84 , he lacked a journalist visa
a @entity1 national security source said saturday that two @entity5 journalists were recently barred because they are a high target for kidnapping with their continuous movements
the source also cited the growing @entity11 attacks in @entity49
at least seven journalists were abducted last year in @entity1 , @entity110 said
@entity3 - linked militants killed by @entity1 security forces
