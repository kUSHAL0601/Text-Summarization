-- from " @entity4 " to " @entity3 , " @entity2 's movies have entranced audiences in @entity6 and the @entity7
@entity0 spoke to the director of " @entity9 " and " @entity10 ! " at the @entity11 in @entity12 about filmmaking in @entity6 and @entity13 and her adaptation of @entity17 's novel about loss and family , " @entity16
" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
film director @entity2 @entity0 : what inspired you to make " @entity16 " ? @entity2 : i happened to read " @entity16 " on a plane in early 2004 , when i traveled from @entity25 to @entity26 to finish the filming of " @entity3
" i read " @entity16 " while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me [ @entity2 's mother in law ]
it was at that state of mourning that i picked up this novel , and in it @entity17 writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country , and i thought i had been understood by someone
it was also a story that linked the two cities in which i had grown up -- @entity44 and @entity25 -- and it was almost certainly the road that i had traveled
it just spoke to me and i felt compelled to do this film
a few months later we were shooting it
@entity0 : it 's filmed in both @entity6 and @entity25 , such different cultures
tell us about the universal themes involved during the film
@entity2 : well , the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills
it 's a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another , and tried to find out who we are through these places
then when we have children , life gets more interesting
it is about growing up through our adult lives and our children 's lives
it is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who do n't send roses and diamonds for love ; who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other
it 's about that generation of parents who have that stillness about one another , versus the clang and hustle of young @entity89 who is 15 and grows up in an @entity13 world because he wishes to be @entity13
that flow -- that see - saw between parents and children , that 's what " @entity16 " is about
@entity0 : tell us about casting the role of @entity89
@entity2 : well , @entity98 plays @entity89 and he 's known as a comic star , but i had no idea that he existed until my 15 - year - old son said , " this has to be your @entity89
" i did n't take him seriously at all until every night the campaign mounted at home : " tell me in the morning it 's @entity98 ! " he would say
and then @entity98 wrote to me and told me he became an actor because he had seen " @entity4 " when he was eight years old and realized people on the screen could look like him , and other such seductive things
he came to my office and auditioned and he was just so appealing , and so much the real thing , that i cast him as @entity89
@entity0 : how have @entity6 audiences reacted to your heavily western - influenced films ? @entity2 : it 's not that different a kind of audience , that 's what pleases me
" @entity10 ! " we really made for the children on the streets and the kids who really love that @entity127 stuff , and also with " @entity128 , " which ran for 27 weeks
" @entity9 " was also a big hit in @entity6
but no , they do n't come to my films for @entity127 fare ; it 's a completely alternative thing
in terms of audiences on both sides , i 've been blessed : the films have been really well received and highly anticipated
@entity0 : " @entity16 " was filmed in @entity13 and @entity6
what differences were there in the two locations ? @entity2 : in @entity6 it is more about orchestrating chaos , and it 's about sifting the chaos , but i get especially excited about the throb and chaos on the streets and so on , and in @entity13 it 's about paying for the chaos , you know every head has to be placed there and paid for
@entity0 : " @entity16 " is about not losing the identity of @entity6 culture
was that a challenge ? @entity2 : i am at home in many cultures
i live actively in three continents and i 've done that for most of my life , so i just make films as i see the world , and that happens to speak to people
i do things that i want to do
it so happens because i am fluent in both worlds that my films enter both worlds , perhaps
@entity0 : do @entity6 and @entity13 audiences behave differently ? @entity2 : no , not really
i think films have to reach people and really grab them
that 's what i hope to do when i make a film -- to get under your skin and really make you think about something , and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere
