-- pediatrician and neurologist dr. @entity2 has noticed a disturbing trend
over the past 20 years , he begun to hear stories of an increasing number of doctors who give perfectly healthy children prescriptions for the sole purpose of enhancing their focus or memory
the dramatic increase in the number of children taking stimulants and other " study drugs , " as they are popularly known , seems to back up his anecdotal evidence
inspired by his growing concern over this trend , @entity17 collaborated with five other doctors to write a position paper that offers guidance to physicians and discusses the ethics of the practice
published wednesday in the @entity29 's journal , the paper is the first of its kind to focus solely on prescribing these drugs to healthy children , @entity17 said
" it was n't clear to any of us why this has n't been written before , " @entity17 said
" the trend has been around for a couple decades now
it was clear to us that there needs to be this kind of conversation with physicians
" the paper argues that doctors have a " moral obligation " to " prevent misuse of medication
" it concludes that the practice of " neuroenhancements " is n't justifiable
it adds that the prescription of these drugs is inadvisable because of " numerous social , developmental , and professional integrity issues
" " we are a highly competitive society , and we know some physicians are prescribing these at a parent 's request , " @entity17 said
" other parents have told us they felt doctors pushed these drugs on their children
" though the drugs are effective in treating problems like attention - deficit ( hyperactivity ) disorder in healthy children , they can have serious side effects like cardiac risks , and taking them can be addictive
" this is not what these drugs were designed for , and doctors can be a part of the problem , " @entity17 said
" our professional integrity is at stake
" @entity17 said the number of prescriptions written for these kinds of drugs has increased tenfold in the past two decades
according to a 2004 study ( @entity89 ) , in some @entity91 school districts , " the proportion of boys taking methylphenidate exceeds the highest estimates of the prevalence of attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder
" @entity93 diagnosis rising another study ( @entity89 ) suggests that about 16 % of the population of some high school and college campuses uses prescription drugs as study aids
" many students think there 's a magic pill that could fix everything
trouble is , that 's not true , " said @entity105 , associate director of counseling and psychological services at @entity107 at @entity108
he believes that when the law changed to allow pharmaceutical companies to market directly to the public , an entire generation 's acceptance of taking prescriptions changed
" it did make a huge difference in self - diagnosis
" college students take adhd drugs for better grades @entity122 has seen an uptick in the number of students taking or asking for the drugs at @entity108 , an @entity127 school known for its rigorous curriculum and ultracompetitive atmosphere
his clinic puts students through a rigorous battery of tests to make sure they actually have adhd before they receive a prescription for the medication
still , he knows that if students ca n't get the drugs at his clinic , they may try to buy them from their peers
that 's why he warns students that buying prescription drugs from other students is illegal and dangerous
" they have a tendency to think if they can @entity147 it , they know what they are getting into , " he said
" but there 's a reason only people who 've gone to medical school for a long time can prescribe these drugs
these drugs are serious business
" dr. @entity159 , chairman of the @entity161 clinical practice guideline subcommittee on @entity93 , says this newly published position paper represents " pretty much the position that all clinicians have
" his only concern is that parents who hear about it may be too nervous to seek treatment for their children with @entity93 , for whom the drugs would actually be beneficial
" they can work really well with kids with @entity93 , " @entity159 said
he also notes that there may be more valid reasons for the growing number of young people taking adhd medicines
more people are being legitimately diagnosed with the disorder , and doctors have changed their thinking about @entity93 , he said
until recently , many doctors believed that children eventually outgrew adhd symptoms
" we used to think it disappeared at puberty , but it 's not the case
so there will be more cases of adolescents and people at older ages diagnosed with @entity93 , " @entity159 said
as neuroenhancement grows more popular and new drugs become readily accessible , @entity17 said , he and his colleagues wondered whether their paper would it still be valid 20 years from now
" some have argued this practice is not going to stop
@entity200 is going to continue regardless , " he said
" but we came to the conclusion that i think we should draw line at this practice
we do n't believe that will change
