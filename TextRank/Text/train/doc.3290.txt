-- if you 're watching the first round of the @entity3 playoffs this weekend , take a good look at the players ' jerseys
you 'll see the standard features : names of the teams , numbers and names of the players
make a mental picture of what you 're looking at
because there 's a chance the old - style jerseys may become just a memory
as @entity22 of the @entity23 reported , @entity3 owners at a meeting in @entity21 this month were presented with a display of six mannequin torsos
three of the mannequins wore @entity29 jerseys
but the jerseys had been intentionally altered , for the owners ' consideration
they were festooned with advertising
the prominence of the on - jersey ads varied : one version did away with the team name and replaced it with the name of a corporate advertiser ; a second version featured the advertiser 's name beneath the player 's number ; a third put the advertiser 's logo on a strap of the jersey
the @entity3 has not decided whether it will begin the move to jerseys bearing ads. none of the four major @entity57 sports leagues -- the @entity3 , @entity58 , the @entity59 and the @entity60 -- permits advertising on team uniforms
but other professional sports -- auto racing , golf and soccer -- let athletes display ads on their clothing
and when @entity22 asked @entity70 , deputy commissioner of the @entity3 , about the league 's position on instituting jerseys with ads , @entity70 said : " if we add sponsor logos to jerseys , we recognize that some of our fans will think we 've lost our minds
but the @entity3 is a global business and logos on jerseys are well - established in other sports and commonplace outside the @entity85 " if and when it happens -- if the @entity3 becomes the first major @entity57 sports league to turn uniforms into advertising billboards -- the surprising thing may turn out to be how quickly the public , after expressing initial consternation , decides that it 's no big deal
advertising once was seen as having the potential to be an unwelcome intrusion of hucksterism into places where hucksterism did not belong
but if there was a line that was not supposed to be crossed , that line was obliterated long ago
not only is advertising ubiquitous and largely unquestioned today , it has managed to become a sought - after symbol of something 's -- or someone 's -- worth
if a national corporation -- a soft drink , a breakfast cereal , an energy bar -- pays to put its brand on the t - shirt for a charity race , or on a local school 's football stadium , or in the program for a college reunion , there is a sense of officially making the big time
" selling out " was for years a pejorative phrase , but it has lost much of its punch ; national advertisers have worked so effectively to elevate the power of their brands , that there is status inherent in being connected with them and with their success
to paraphrase the old @entity133 song : you 're nobody till somebody buys you
and , increasingly , national companies do n't even have to offer money to people to promote their brands -- people pay their own money to do just that for the companies
all the customers who eagerly hand over cash so they can wear the @entity145 swoosh become free ambassadors for the manufacturer
at least the hardy souls who wear sandwich boards on city sidewalks to promote stores and products are compensated for doing it
objecting to this trend is futile
it has been building steadily for years
the @entity29 won their first three @entity3 championships while playing in the classically named @entity158 , but their second three championships were won while playing in the new @entity160 , sponsored by the airline , and it just seemed like the way of the world
people sometimes bemoan encroaching commercialism inside @entity166 , home of the @entity167 , but that ballpark was , in contemporary parlance , and early adopter of you - ca n't - escape - it advertising , having been named for the man who owned it , a chewing - gum manufacturer
if there was a stigma associated with advertising appearing in untraditional places , it is all but gone
should the @entity3 decide to go forward with ads on jerseys , the players will probably put up a fight until they get their desired percentage of the income from the sponsors , but that will be negotiated
if the players resist , the owners will say : do you want to keep making more money or not ? in professional sports , there is only one thing considered more important than winning , and that is finding new revenue streams
the major sports leagues wo n't be the end of this
what are two parts of @entity57 life that urgently need an economic boost ? the @entity206 and the financial system itself
so perhaps the day will come when top - shelf advertisers are invited to bid for the right to place their logos on postage stamps , and on currency
it would be an unbeatable way to pump cash into the postal service and into the @entity218
there would be certain complications : @entity221 might not be thrilled if consumers bought its food with dollar bills emblazoned with the @entity226 's arches
ground rules would have to be worked out
@entity228 , more than a half - century ago , made the plain white t - shirt the ultimate symbol of cool
that shirt , in marketing circles , would seem naked now ; where 's the logo ? @entity228 would be seen as foolishly missing a golden opportunity
all that potential ad space on his shirt , wasted
@entity228 never played in the @entity3 , though
enjoy the playoffs this year , and savor the sight of the unadorned jerseys
the startling thing is not that a major sport is considering plastering ads on those uniforms
the startling thing is that it has taken them this long
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .
