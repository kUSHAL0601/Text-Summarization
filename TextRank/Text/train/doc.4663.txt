@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 gov. @entity3 signed emergency legislation tuesday that bars protests within 300 feet of a funeral and within an hour from its beginning or end
earlier in the day , the state legislature passed the measure , which targets a @entity13 church whose members announced they plan to picket the funerals of the victims of saturday 's shootings in @entity0
" such despicable acts of emotional terrorism will not be tolerated in the @entity1 , " @entity3 said in a statement announcing she had signed the bill
" this legislation will assure that the victims of saturday 's tragic shooting in @entity0 will be laid to rest in peace with the full dignity and respect that they deserve
" the legislation makes protesting too near a funeral a misdemeanor in the state
it went into effect immediately upon @entity3 's signing it
the action is in direct response to the @entity39 's announcement that it will picket the funeral of @entity41 , the 9 - year - old who was among six people killed during saturday 's attempted assassination of @entity45 rep. @entity44 , @entity46
the controversial church , based in @entity48 , has made its name by staging protests at funerals of people who died of @entity53 , gay people , soldiers and even @entity56
the church was founded by @entity58 , 80 , and most of its members are members of his extended family
" today we have joined together to provide some small measure of comfort for families grieving over the lost of a loved one , " said @entity64 state sen. @entity63
" during times of grief , families should be free from harassment or intimidation
this law does the right thing by protecting those families
" " protesting or picketing outside the funeral of an innocent victim is despicable , " said @entity77 state house speaker @entity76
" it 's time to bring @entity1 in line with the many other states that protect the sensitivities of victims against groups that use fear and hate to denigrate the lives of @entity45
" within hours of the church 's announcements , @entity89 groups sprang up to plan actions surrounding the funerals that would keep the church members separate from the mourners
@entity0 just is n't that kind of town , says @entity98 , 26 , referring to the actions of the church
" for something like this to happen in @entity0 was a really big shock to us all , " she said
" our nightmare happened when we saw @entity39 was going to picket the funerals
" @entity107 and others are planning an " angel action " -- with 8 - by - 10 - foot " angel wings " worn by participants to shield mourners from picketers
@entity115 actions were created by @entity116 , who was shocked to find the @entity48 church and its multicolored signs outside the 1999 funeral of @entity120 , a young gay man beaten and left on a fence to die in @entity122 , @entity123
the angel action is part of a larger effort , organized by @entity127 , a 20 - year - old @entity128 senior , aimed at showing what she said are @entity0 's true colors
" once i heard that the @entity39 was coming , i felt like something should be done to show support for the families , " she said
" i do n't have any experience in organizing these things
i thought i might get 50 to 100 people
" " this is n't a counter-protest , " she said
" we wanted it to show support for the families and to show that @entity0 is there with love and support
" the groups do n't want to interfere with the funeral in any way , @entity127 said
" we plan on being completely silent , and we 're asking people not to bring signs or make comments about the @entity39 , " she said
@entity152 , chairman of the @entity153 , said tuesday that his organization as well as the local @entity77 also will ask people to line the funeral routes to form a barricade if the church follows through on its planned protest
@entity39 spokeswoman @entity160 , daughter of @entity58 , provided @entity2 with a statement detailing their decision to picket the funerals
it is filled with anti-gay , anti-abortion and anti-divorce rhetoric that members have used in the past to justify their pickets -- that @entity170 hates @entity45 because it has turned its back on what they see as @entity170 's way
" we picket the funerals to make these vital points to the living ! " @entity160 said
" if you heed , it is life and health and peace and safety
" @entity170 sent the shooter ! " the statement continued
" praise @entity170 for all his works , and @entity186 !
" @entity2 's @entity187 and @entity188 contributed to this report .
