-- nine @entity2 miners emerged into the daylight wednesday morning after six days trapped in a collapsed mine
state television showed the miners leaving the mine , each supported by two rescuers
they wore sunglasses to protect their eyes from the light , after spending so much time in darkness
for days , a tube snaked down to the collapsed cavern was the only connection the miners had to the surface
it provided them with oxygen , food and water , as well as communication
@entity2 president @entity25 greeted the miners at the mouth of the mine
the group unfurled the red and white @entity2 flag and waved at television cameras
" we are happy that this high - risk operation was successful , " said @entity32 , a fire department official with knowledge of the rescue efforts
the miners had been stuck since thursday in the wildcat @entity39 mine in southern @entity2
a cave - in over the weekend slowed rescue efforts
it was not clear what caused the initial collapse
@entity25 's government has made a push for illegal mines and miners in @entity2 to be formalized and regulated so that risks decrease
after the rescue , he made a similar argument
" this should lead us to reflect that we have to avoid these kind of risks because the results will not always be like today , " he said
mining is big business in @entity2 , which is a major world producer of copper , silver , gold and other minerals
the ordeal stirred memories of a 2010 @entity67 mine collapse in which 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days
all those miners were rescued , pulled one by one from hundreds of meters beneath the @entity71 's surface with a specially designed capsule .
