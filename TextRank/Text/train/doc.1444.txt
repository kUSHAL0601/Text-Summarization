@entity0 @entity2 , who emerged as the hero of the @entity0 supermarket attack , received his new @entity6 passport from the hands of prime minister @entity8 and interior minister @entity9 at a ceremony in @entity0
the @entity6 government decided to award citizenship to the @entity14 - born 24 - year - old supermarket employee after he risked his own life to hide customers from hostage - taker @entity17 earlier this month
four people lost their lives in the hostage - taking and shooting at the kosher grocery store
but the 15 people whom @entity2 led downstairs to hide in a walk - in freezer stayed safe
bathily , who describes himself as a " practicing @entity30 , " told @entity1 affiliate @entity26 he switched off the freezer , turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm
he went upstairs , following orders from the hostage - taker , but managed to run outside and tell police about the situation in the store
in his opening speech at the ceremony tuesday evening , @entity9 praised @entity2 's gesture " of courage and humanity " which had become " the symbol of an @entity30 of peace and tolerance
" @entity2 , who arrived in @entity6 when he was 16 , had dreamed of gaining @entity6 citizenship since his childhood
" today , this dream is becoming true , a bit faster than expected , " @entity9 said
@entity8 also paid tribute to the courage of the young man
" with you and with all the people in this room , " the prime minister said , " we just saw one of the most beautiful images of our country
" @entity8 also recalled the strong ties between @entity6 and @entity14 , a " country which saw @entity60 being wrecked by terrorists , " and which received @entity6 support in its fight against jihadism
the @entity6 military has been involved in fighting @entity67 extremists in @entity14 and the wider @entity68 since early 2013
both @entity69 and @entity9 emphasized the importance of keeping @entity6 citizenship open in order to remain faithful to the @entity74 ideal
" welcoming new @entity6 citizens is an opportunity for the country as well as for those who become @entity6 , " @entity8 said
@entity2 then took the floor
" i thank you with all my heart for awarding me @entity6 citizenship
i am proud and moved , " the young man said
" people think i am a hero , but i am not
" at the end of the ceremony , @entity2 received his passport together with a letter from president @entity86 and the " citizenship kit " distributed to all new @entity6 citizens
@entity17 , the terrorist killed in the police operation that ended the supermarket attack , also had roots in @entity14
but , unlike @entity91 , he was born in @entity6 and had @entity6 citizenship .
