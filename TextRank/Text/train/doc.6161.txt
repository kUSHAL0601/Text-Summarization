@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's interior minister , citing police evidence gathered after a deadly house bombing friday , said people at the dwelling had been planning to attack him during a court appearance in @entity10
@entity11 , who appeared in a @entity10 court regarding an outstanding corruption case against him , said intelligence officers warned him against going to pre-announced events such as friday 's court appearance , which was well - publicized a few weeks ago
the house blast occurred in the @entity19 section of @entity10 and killed seven people
when police came to the scene , they interrogated three survivors , two men and an elderly woman
they then determined the people were intent on launching an attack on the court , according to @entity30 , @entity10 's police chief
@entity30 said officers also discovered two suicide vests , 25 hand grenades , three ak - 47s and 17 magazines of ammunitions
police also found tins of food , which led them to believe the attackers might have been planning to take hostages and set up a siege of the court
police were investigating the cause of the blast , and @entity11 said people in the house were members of a family from the @entity49 in @entity50
the @entity1 army has conducted intense operations in that province and the tribal region to rout militants from their safe havens
@entity11 had been among thousands of bureaucrats and politicians who had been granted amnesty by @entity1 's @entity59
the ordinance shielded them from having to face corruption charges
but the ordinance has been nullified , and @entity11 was no longer protected by it
also friday , a suspected @entity67 drone strike killed five people in northwestern @entity1 , two intelligence sources said
the suspected drone launched two missiles at a car in the village of @entity74 , in @entity75 , a rugged area near @entity1 's border with @entity77 that is rife with @entity79 extremists , the sources said
two of the dead were from countries other than @entity1 ; three were locals , the sources told @entity2
the attack , at about 7:45 p.m. also injured two people , the two intelligence sources said
additional details were not immediately available
@entity2 's @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 contributed to this report .
