-- @entity1 has just seen his sister for the first time in 59 years , a sibling he thought was dead until last year
they reunited over the weekend for the first time since the @entity6 tore apart their family
@entity1 , his sister and @entity11 's son started crying immediately on seeing one another , said @entity11 's son , @entity13
the family took part in family reunions that began october 30 and will end friday at @entity18 , the two @entity19 ' joint mountain resort in the @entity20
many burst into tears at the reunions , which involve 100 people from each side
elderly men in suits and women in traditional @entity30 silk hanbok dresses sat at numbered tables in a large restaurant
some sat , spoke and exchanged photographs ; others simply looked bewildered as they clutched hands and stared into faces unseen for six decades
the relatives have been separated from since the 1950 - 53 @entity6
" after a while , my father said they need to stop crying and smile , so the memories of the meeting could be better
he said they should say goodbye smiling , not crying
it was hard to see that , " @entity13 said
@entity11 's father was n't immediately available for comment
" we were very happy to meet her and learn about how she had lived , " @entity13 said of his aunt
" i felt relieved to hear she had worked as a nurse and later became a doctor , that probably means she had a better life " than many @entity30
" still , it broke my hear to see her and think of the difficulties she might have gone through , " @entity11 said
" she told us that when the @entity20 family meetings started , she was upset that no one in her family had looked for her , " he said
" it was a shock for us to hear she felt that way , " @entity11 said
" we did our best to explain to her we thought she had died during the war and that we would have tried to look for her , had we known she was still out there
when she left , she said she understood , but i wondered what she really thought and how she really felt
" the elder @entity11 had not seen his sister since 1951 , when she was 15 years old
he was a police officer during the war and often was away from home
when he returned one day , " she was gone
i asked where she was and she had been kidnapped [ by @entity30 soldiers ]
after that , we did n't know where she was , " @entity11 said
" my mother was just waiting for her to get back
she could n't go out to look for her
even if she wanted , she did n't even know where she could search , " @entity11 added
" it was a vague hope
she wondered , will it be today ? will it be tomorrow ? she just waited
" @entity11 's wife , @entity95 , shared her memories of those traumatic years : " all the family was alive then
three generations lived at the house and people waited for her to come back
" " but time passed , we were n't able to think
there were shootings , bombs , the men went to the army
... i did n't even know if my husband was alive
" " life was hard then
that was how we lived then
my brother and my father were also gone
everything was taken from us
we did n't have food
" " there were bombs
it was not a proper life
we just tried to survive
after this , we thought she died
we could have never imagined she survived
" last year , the @entity125 got word through government channels that his sister was alive , in @entity30
no mail , telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the @entity30 border , so the siblings pinned their hopes on the government - sanctioned reunions
millions of @entity30 were divided by the war
it ended in a truce , but without a formal peace treaty
the prickly relationship between the countries has since had periodic conciliatory moves and flare - ups
some 80,000 @entity147 have registered with their government to join one of the infrequent reunions , but 40,000 people are thought to have passed away or given up hope , according to the @entity125 's @entity153
numbers are unknown in the secretive @entity20
the first family reunions took place following a landmark summit between the two koreas in 2000
since then , 17,100 people representing 3,500 families have been reunited on 17 separate occasions
