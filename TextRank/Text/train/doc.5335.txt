-- army sgt. @entity2 's release from @entity4 captivity was largely celebrated at first
in the ensuing days , however , several serious issues have arisen , bearing upon death , honor and the law
were @entity10 soldiers killed searching for @entity11 sgt. @entity2 ? a controversy exists over whether soldiers were killed , directly or indirectly , in the search for @entity2 after he was taken captive by the @entity4
former soldiers involved in the operations to find @entity2 asserted to @entity0 this week that at least six soldiers were killed because of the search for @entity2 in 2009
they provided the soldiers ' names and their dates of death , with circumstances for some of them
a day later , @entity26 , a former member of @entity2 's battalion who searched for him that summer in 2009 , wrote in the @entity28 that eight soldiers ' deaths were tied to the @entity2 search
@entity26 provided the eight soldiers ' names -- including six names that @entity0 earlier reported
asked about this point , defense secretary @entity34 told reporters wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find @entity2
@entity2 's former team leader , @entity42 , told @entity0 that , " i ca n't say for a fact and i do n't know if there is really anyone who can prove that soldiers died on a directed mission to find @entity2
however every mission , especially in the following two or more months , those were directed missions
everything after that , they were still missions that were in search of @entity2
... @entity2 leaving changed the mission
" @entity2 : strong , well - rounded and easy to talk to , friends say did @entity2 desert ? an @entity11 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that @entity2 left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a @entity10 military official briefed on the report
the official spoke to @entity0 tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information
there was no definitive finding @entity2 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity11 officials could n't do without talking to the soldier
the investigation included interviews with members of @entity2 's unit , none of whom reported seeing him go , the official said
it is " unfair " to @entity2 and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base , @entity83 said wednesday
secretary of the army @entity89 said tuesday that " a comprehensive , coordinated " review of @entity2 's case will be conducted
the review " will include speaking with sgt. @entity2 to better learn from him the circumstances regarding his disappearance and captivity , " @entity89 said
earlier in the week , @entity83 declined to address directly detailed questions about @entity2 's case -- particularly accusations that he deserted , as some of his former brothers - in - arm allege
before he went missing , @entity2 spoke of wanting to get lost in the mountains and walking to @entity105 , his comrades said
" i believe he totally deserted , " said former staff sgt. @entity106 , @entity2 's former squad leader
did @entity108 break the law ? the @entity4 freed @entity2 in exchange for the @entity10 release of five @entity4 fighters held in @entity113 , but the @entity108 administration did n't tell @entity115 of the releases
under law , the @entity117 has to give a 30 - day notice to @entity120 before any terrorists are transferred from @entity113
@entity117 national security adviser @entity122 defended president @entity108 's decision not to notify @entity115
" given the acute urgency of the health condition of sergeant @entity2 , and given the president 's constitutional responsibilities , it was determined that it was necessary and appropriate not to adhere to the 30 - day notification requirement , because it would have potentially meant that the opportunity to get sergeant @entity2 would have been lost , " @entity124 said
the president did indeed break the letter of the law , said @entity135 , a law professor at @entity136
but there are questions about the law itself , he added
" there 's two different questions here
one is , did he violate the federal law ? the answer to that is most obviously yes , " @entity135 said
" the second question is whether that law is constitutional
and the answer to that is more difficult
" this is just a notice requirement
there are thousands of such notice requirements
and the problem with the president 's argument is there 's no limiting principle , that he could argue that all national security laws could fall into the same unilateral power , " @entity135 said
@entity159 wanted tougher deal for @entity2 did @entity2 help the @entity4 ? there 's no evidence that @entity2 helped the enemy directly , though he 's certainly been used in @entity4 propaganda
what has partly fueled this accusation is how @entity2 reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing @entity10 activities in @entity170 , according to a 2012 story in @entity173 magazine
@entity2 's former comrades also wondered if he gave the @entity4 intelligence because the enemy executed " very calculated , very methodical " strikes after @entity2 's disappearance , said former @entity11 sgt. @entity42
but a @entity10 official who has been briefed on the initial @entity11 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after @entity2 disappeared told @entity0 that @entity2 's commanders referred to him as " a good soldier " in that report
some of his teammates said he had expressed " boredom " and thought his unit was too passive and should have been " kicking down doors , " the official said
@entity4 video shows @entity2 's release in @entity170 was @entity2 tortured ? it 's too early to say how severely @entity2 was mistreated during his five years of captivity
officials have yet to state the findings of their medical examination of @entity2 following his release saturday
a @entity4 propaganda video of the handover of @entity2 showed him looking gaunt and blinking repeatedly -- as if in disbelief or shock
" he does n't look that bad to me , " remarked @entity200 , a former @entity201 lead international hostage negotiator , about @entity2 's condition
some experts speculate @entity2 may have experienced @entity206 , in which he may have emotionally bonded with his @entity4 captors over the five years
why is his unit coming out against him ? there 's something new and something old motivating the former members of @entity2 's unit to condemn him
first there were the immediate reports that @entity2 was being hailed as a hero
those accounts incensed the former soldiers
the comrades also remembered 2009 and how they searched for @entity2
" he walked off , " former @entity220
@entity221 , 27 , of @entity222 said
" he left his guard post
nobody knows if he defected or he 's a traitor or he was kidnapped
what i do know is , he was there to protect us , and instead he decided to defer from @entity10 and go and do his own thing
i do n't know why he decided to do that , but we spent so much of our resources , and some of those resources were soldiers ' lives
" in fact , the former soldiers say they are so outraged that they are speaking out publicly at significant peril
the former servicemen said they earlier signed nondisclosure agreements about the disappearance and search for @entity2 , but they 're now violating it
opinion : five tough ethics issues in @entity2 swap is that illegal ? the former soldiers may well be in open violation of that contract
but they say they will risk punishment
" it 's certainly a possibility , but i do n't think that i could have continued to go on without being able to share with you and the people the true things that happened in this situation , because if you guys are n't made aware of it , it will just go on , he will be a hero , and nobody is going to be able to know the truth , " said former @entity11 sgt. @entity251 , whose back is tattooed with the names of three soldiers who purportedly died while searching for @entity2
@entity11 officials did n't immediately return a @entity0 request for comment about what consequences , if any , the former soldiers may face if they 're in violation of a nondisclosure agreement
for those former troops , honor is at stake
" for me , he 's a deserter
@entity10 needs to know , " said @entity106 , the former squad leader
" he 's back , and he needs to be held accountable
" was @entity2 swap legal ? depends on who you ask official : @entity11 will review freed soldier @entity2 's case but it 's not first priority @entity2 hurts @entity108 's most promising chance to close @entity113 @entity0 's @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .
