@entity0 , @entity1 -- the arrest of a @entity5 politician who deposited millions of dollars of stolen money in @entity8 accounts has raised questions about the role of @entity8 banks in corruption
as governor of the oil - rich @entity16 in @entity5 , @entity14 's salary was only $ 6000 a year , yet he managed to afford luxury properties , fleets of @entity20 , a @entity21 and a @entity22 , first class travel , private boarding school fees and a private jet worth $ 20 million
in april , accused of money laundering , @entity14 pleaded guilty to stealing $ 80 million , although investigators believe he may have stolen three times as much
he was sentenced to 13 years
prior to entering politics , @entity14 had lived in @entity0 , @entity1 with his wife @entity30
in 1990 , the pair were convicted of stealing from a hardware store where @entity14 worked as a cashier
the next year , he was convicted of handling a stolen credit card
by the end of the decade , having lied about his criminal record , @entity14 was governor of @entity16 , and was reelected for a four year term in 2003
the @entity39 looking to make it in @entity41 although acquitted by a @entity16 court in 2009 , justice finally came for @entity14 in a @entity0 court , after a seven year investigation by the @entity46 of @entity0 's @entity47
the unit , staffed by a dozen or so detectives , traces the flow of foreign politicians ' money through @entity0 , and is funded by the @entity8 government 's @entity54 , which also delivers aid to @entity39
" we hope that , by tackling the likes of @entity14 , we 're saying to those stealing from the state purse , you ca n't have your children at private school in @entity0
you ca n't have a multimillion pound house in one of the most affluent areas of @entity0
you ca n't drive around in top of the range vehicles
we wo n't let you move money around to buy multimillion pound jets , " says unit head detective chief inspector @entity71
@entity14 employed a range of methods , some straightforward , some devious
he inflated contracts , took kickbacks , and simply transferred cash out of state accounts
he was helped by his family , wife and mistress , as well as by @entity0 - based professionals , who set up shell companies , assisted in purchases and provided false due diligence
according to @entity89 of anti corruption @entity90 , @entity0 holds a double attraction for corrupt politicians
" we are a major financial and legal center so there 's a lot of expertise , and there 's also a lot of assets that go through the @entity8 financial institution , so it 's easier to disguise your assets
" @entity89 believes @entity0 also seems like a great place to spend " illicit loot "
" there 's a prestige about being able to bring your assets and your wealth into the @entity8 , " he observes
in march , the @entity113 fined @entity114 , a private arm of @entity116 , a record $ 14 million for failing to monitor three - quarters of its high - risk customers , known as @entity119
although @entity114 says it found no evidence of money laundering , and its processes are now robust , campaigners say @entity0 's banks are still playing a role in the problem of @entity39 corruption
" i think we need to see more sanctions , " says @entity130 of @entity131
" and the greater the severity of penalties , the greater the deterrent effect
and that will ensure fewer institutions would commit these offenses
" @entity89 has similar concerns
" according to the prosecutor , @entity14 and his associates had accounts with @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146
he had a @entity148 card
these are major financial institutions that all took money from @entity14 and his associates , " he notes
" i think the only way we 're going to get serious change is if you have heavy penalties , you go after individual bankers and , in the worst cases , in the most egregious failures , you put people in jail
" is narcotic khat funding terrorism ? prosecutors in @entity14 's case were aided by a whistleblower , @entity167
although @entity167 's identity was accidentally leaked back to @entity5 , resulting in his relocation to the @entity8 , he continues to campaign against @entity5 corruption -- whether it 's in @entity8 or @entity5
he observes a " terrible paradox " : " the international financial intermediaries believe they can engage in this kind of activity , being protected by the same states or the same governments that are leading the same anti-corruption battle
" detective @entity71 says although @entity8 banks do cooperate with his unit , tracing the sources of money can still be difficult , particularly without international cooperation
" they may have accrued legitimate wealth
they may have had family interests in businesses
what you are trying to do is look at a pot of money and go , ' what is legitimate and what is n't ? ' and that can be very , very , difficult
a spokesperson from the @entity46 said @entity14 's embezzled assets will be confiscated and repatriated to their rightful owners -- the people of the @entity16
" it is always rewarding for anyone working on a proceeds of corruption case to know that the stolen funds they identify will eventually be returned to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world
