@entity0 has become the latest tennis star to turn to a former legend for help with the 17 - time grand slam champion adding his " childhood hero " @entity8 to his coaching team for the upcoming season
the 32 - year - old @entity9 announced the move on @entity11 , revealing that @entity12 will join the team for the first grand slam of 2014 in @entity15 next month
" i am happy to announce that beginning in @entity16 , @entity8 will join @entity17 on my coaching team , " @entity0 posted
" @entity19 , who has been part of my team for the last seven years , will do most of the weeks and @entity8 has agreed to work with us for at least 10 weeks
" @entity8 was my childhood hero , and i am really looking forward to spending time and learning from him
" @entity0 endured a difficult 2013 and dispensed with the services of @entity28 coach @entity27 in october
but @entity9 @entity30 captain @entity29 has remained in the fold and told @entity0 's official website that he was looking forward to working alongside @entity8
" like @entity0 , i have a tremendous amount of respect for @entity8 and i am sure he will bring a lot to our team as @entity0 continues to chase titles in 2014 , " he said
@entity8 spent a couple of days with @entity0 in @entity41 earlier this month and his hiring follows a recent trend , started when reigning @entity45 champion @entity44 took on @entity46 before the start of the 2012 season
six - time grand slam champion @entity8 will be hoping that his involvement with @entity0 will prove as successful
" i 'm really excited to be part of @entity0 's team and i hope together we can bring out his best tennis , " he told @entity0 's official website

@entity66 has been watching @entity64 in action this week at the big exhibition tournament in @entity79 and the @entity80 reached the final friday with a 7 - 6 6 - 3 win over @entity83 @entity82
he will play @entity84 , who upset fellow @entity86 and world number one @entity88 with a 6 - 4 6 - 4 win on a fast indoor surface
@entity64 , who ended 2013 with 24 straight wins , revealed he will not play any further warm up events ahead of his defense of the @entity15 crown
but he believes @entity66 's experience will take him to even greater heights next year
" he had a great serve and he can help me in different parts of my game on court as well , including the mental aspect , " @entity64 told gathered reporters
meanwhile @entity44 , returning after injury wrecked the back end of his 2013 campaign , finished fifth in the six - man field when he beat @entity107 6 - 3 6 - 4 .
