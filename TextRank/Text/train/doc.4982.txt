-- the mysterious visitor stands in a patch of scrubland in @entity4 , surrounded by @entity6 militants wielding @entity7
his face is covered by a white - and - red headscarf ; he is slim and seems young
but there is something puzzling about him : his skin is fair , and when he speaks in an audio recording , his @entity14 is near perfect and spoken with a @entity17 accent
the militants -- belonging to @entity19 -- say his name is @entity21 ( the foreigner )
and they say he is an envoy from the @entity23 leader , @entity22 , thousands of miles away in @entity24
@entity21 has turned up in the desolate scrubland , they say , to offer @entity23 's help with famine relief
photographs show him at what appears to be an aid camp that @entity19 claims it has set up for victims of the famine
the recording says he is delivering aid that @entity23 had purportedly collected , including food , clothing and $ 12,000 converted into @entity4 currency
a video showing the images and audio recording was posted to @entity43 websites last week
@entity45 counter-terrorism agencies are still trying to ascertain @entity21 's identity and whether he really was an @entity23 envoy -- about which there is some doubt
the event , at which a large group of @entity4 were shown sitting crossed - legged on the ground , was clearly a propaganda ploy by @entity19 to boost its popularity -- and that of the @entity23 brand
international aid agencies have sharply criticized the group for banning or obstructing aid in areas in central and southern @entity4 worst hit by the famine
the group 's brutal imposition of @entity63 - like practices in territory under its control has also alienated many @entity4
if authentic , the event suggests a strengthening of the relationship between hard - line factions of @entity19 and @entity23
though factions of the group have long been allied with @entity23 and share its vision of global jihad , the video of the meeting would be a rare demonstration of such ties
the so - called emissary told his @entity4 audience that @entity23 felt their pain and urged @entity82 to support @entity19 , which is fighting @entity4 's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of @entity6 law
he also recalled @entity88 's long interest in @entity4 , saying he " played a major role in repelling invading forces of the @entity82 land in @entity4
" and @entity21 promised that @entity23 's new leader , @entity22 , would continue that support
" in a recent release , @entity94 brought the drought in @entity4 to the attention of the @entity98 ( or global @entity82 community ) and encouraged them to support their brothers in @entity4 , " he said
western counter-terrorism analysts have been puzzling over the identity of " the foreigner
" several @entity45 and @entity106 are believed to have joined @entity23 in @entity24 in recent years and risen through the group 's hierarchy
the most prominent has been @entity109 - born @entity110 , 33 , @entity23 's @entity111 spokesman who joined forces with the group around a decade ago
but counter-terrorism analysts say that @entity110 's voice ( and waistline ) is very different from that of the mysterious @entity23 envoy pictured in the @entity19 video
another candidate is @entity121 , 36 , an @entity17 citizen born in @entity122 who spent much of his youth in @entity124 and @entity125 , who joined @entity23 around the time of 9/11 and rose up the ranks to become a planner for the group 's external operations
but the envoy appears to have fairer skin than @entity121
and then there is @entity135 , 22 , from @entity136 , @entity137
he is believed to be still at large in @entity24 after leaving the @entity45 in october 2008 to allegedly wage jihad
just after he arrived , he was arrested by @entity24 officials , charged with weapons possession and released on bail
the following year , he failed to show up to his court hearing , suggesting he may have slipped into tribal areas
it may be that the whole event was manufactured in an effort to bolster @entity19 's credentials after a series of military setbacks
sending an @entity23 envoy from @entity24 to @entity4 -- especially a @entity151 -- would be risky
and there are more than a dozen @entity17 ( from both the @entity45 and @entity106 ) who have gravitated to @entity4 to wage jihad in recent years , among them @entity156
the 27 - year old from @entity158 , whose real name is @entity156 , has produced @entity19 hip - hop videos in an effort to extend the group 's appeal to @entity14 - speaking youths
despite several unconfirmed reports that he had been killed , @entity156 remains on the @entity168 's most - wanted list
but his voice is not an obvious match to that of the mysterious @entity23 envoy
@entity19 still controls most of central and southern @entity4 , and has recently shown ambitions to take its campaign beyond @entity4 's borders
in july 2010 , the group carried out a pair of deadly bombings in @entity179 , @entity180 , killing more than 70 people
it was the first attack the group launched outside @entity4 , and was in retaliation , @entity19 claimed , for @entity180 's deployment of peace support forces in @entity4
in september , the @entity187 warned that @entity19 , @entity188 in @entity189 and @entity190 were trying to synchronize their efforts to launch attacks on @entity45 and @entity194 interests , but had yet to show a significant capability to export terror
there is also evidence , according to @entity194 intelligence officials , of cooperation between @entity19 and the @entity23 affiliate in @entity202
but within @entity4 , the group is under growing pressure
it has been pushed from its last redoubts in the capital , @entity207 , even though it retains the ability to launch suicide bombings in the city
and in recent weeks , @entity211 has accused @entity19 of kidnapping @entity194 tourists and aid workers in northern @entity211 , allegations which the @entity4 group denies
@entity211 troops have launched a cross-border operation against @entity19 in southern @entity4 with the apparent intention of setting up a buffer zone across the border
that 's prompted the threat of retaliatory strikes inside @entity211
" the @entity211 public must understand that the impetuous decision by their troops to cross the border into @entity4 will not be without severe repercussions , " the group said in a news release in @entity14 on monday
@entity4 analysts view this threat as real but believe @entity19 will carefully weigh the costs and benefits of any such reprisal
the @entity4 group has an extensive presence in @entity238 -- home to a quarter - million @entity4 refugees -- and operates a network of safe houses in the city
" they could easily tear apart @entity238 , but they 've done nothing there at all because they realize this is their golden egg , " said @entity244 , an @entity19 expert at the @entity245 .
