@entity0 , @entity1 -- tens of thousands of @entity1 were demonstrating saturday on the streets of the capital to protest the government 's decision to import what they say is unsafe @entity10 beef
@entity1 protesters protest against government 's policy on @entity10 beef imports on saturday
@entity1 police estimate that the crowd in @entity0 is about 50,000
no clashes were reported between the protesters and riot police , although ongoing protests have at times turned violent
@entity1 have protested regularly since april when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the @entity10 after a five - year ban
that ban was instituted over a case of mad cow disease in the @entity10 in 2003
the widespread public protests essentially paralyzed the government of president @entity30 , who replaced seven top aides this month and plans to reshuffle his @entity32
tens of thousands of auto workers in @entity1 went on strike wednesday to oppose the government 's lifting of the ban
after a series of negotiations , @entity0 and @entity39 came up with a revised agreement on june 21 -- one that limits imports to cattle younger than 30 months old
animals older than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease , which can be transmitted to humans
the revised agreement also excludes the import of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease
the initial deal would have allowed the import of all @entity10 beef imports
scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals
the @entity10 banned recycled feeds in 1997
eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant @entity65 , a rare and fatal malady in humans
until the 2003 ban , @entity1 was the third - largest market for @entity10 beef exporters
@entity1 's new pro- @entity10 president agreed to lift the import ban in april before a summit with @entity10 president @entity73
but the move provoked a backlash over health concerns spurred in part by false media reports about risks , along with a sense that @entity1 had backed down too easily to @entity10 pressure
the government has vowed to get tough with the rallies
in @entity39 , the @entity84 announced that @entity73 would visit @entity1 on august 5 - 6 before heading to the @entity85
@entity73 had originally been expected to go to @entity0 next week when he visits @entity86 for the @entity87 , but the trip did not materialize amid the protests
@entity2 's @entity90 contributed to this report .
