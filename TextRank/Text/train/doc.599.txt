it 's a bit of a joke around my office that i 'm a professional bridesmaid and wedding attender , sacrificing vacation and a lot of money to celebrate the nuptials of my friends
total bridesmaid appearances : 12 total weddings attended : i stopped counting at 74 total amount spent : i 'm scared to find out , but according to @entity13 , the average amount spent attending a wedding is $ 539 , so you do the math. let 's just say my credit card company loves me
luckily , i happen to love weddings
but after doing things the wrong way the entirety of my bridesmaid career , i now consider myself an expert on how not to go broke or resent your friends getting married
consider these my gift to you
take a deep breath and smile if the thought of attending yet another wedding does n't fill your heart with happiness like it does mine , try to remember : this is your friend
and he or she has asked you to participate in one of the biggest days of his or her life
this is a good thing
weddings are not an exercise established to stress you out or bring you down , and if you 've been lucky to have been included in any part of the day , well , then , smile , because that means you 're someone 's friend ! smiles and deep breaths also help when it 's time to fork over your cash and kiss your precious vacation days goodbye
be realistic and honest after the squeals and hugs and " i 'd be honoreds " are over , the sometimes - uncomfortable conversations about what 's expected of you as a member of the wedding party will inevitably follow
@entity64 is the site director for the popular wedding website @entity66
she advises wedding guests -- that 's right , guests -- to " get organized " when it comes to attending a wedding
" if you know you have a wedding coming up in august and you know there will be expenses coming up , you may have to cut back in other areas , " @entity64 said
" @entity78 out your calendar and set a budget
" once you know what 's expected of you as a guest or attendant and you 've taken inventory of your budget , communicate any worries you might have to the bride or groom
let them know what you can do and , more important , what you ca n't
if you 're having trouble making rent , for example , an extravagant bachelorette party in the @entity94 is probably not feasible
ask the dress shop whether you can set up a payment plan to make monthly contributions toward your wedding wardrobe
once the date is set , book your flight and hotel rooms early to avoid high fares
whatever you do , let the bride and groom know where you stand
flaking at the last minute because you ca n't afford it is a guaranteed way to put a friendship in turmoil
get choosy i 'm not one for putting a hierarchy on friendships , but when it comes to minding your finances and attending weddings , you ca n't do it all
so it 's ok to be selective when it comes to whose wedding invitation you accept and whose you decline
we all know about the " courtesy invite
" your childhood neighbor you have n't seen in 15 years would love to have you there , but sometimes you have to say no. be polite and send a thoughtful gift , but do n't waste your frequent flier miles on a wedding for someone whose middle name you do n't know
shack up and double up part of the fun of traveling to weddings is that they 're usually a reunion with old friends -- and therefore present excellent opportunities to cut costs
" going in with your friends for a group gift is a great way to buy something more substantial for the couple , " @entity64 suggests
@entity64 advises finding out ahead of time who is going to the wedding so you can make plans to share a hotel room or at least share transportation costs from the airport
parading down the aisle dressed is n't exactly the same as strolling down a white , sandy beach , but if weddings are eating up your money and your vacation time at work , turn it into a vacation by tacking a couple of days on to the beginning or end of the trip
last summer , when my friend @entity169 got married in @entity170 , i scheduled a visit with another friend in @entity173 and then drove up the @entity174
think outside the gift box one of the best things about getting married is the loot you receive
but when it comes to presents , most of the brides i talked to said they 'd prefer their loved ones ' presence at their nuptials to a fancy gift
thanks to @entity189 and @entity190 blogs , homemade gift ideas are easy to find and replicate
some of my favorites include homemade soaps , a scrapbook of unprofessional pictures from the wedding and collections of recipes from friends and family
if @entity189 makes you feel as inadequate as i do , offer to house - sit or dog - sit while the couple is on their honeymoon or stock their fridge with a homemade dinner for when they return
just because it 's not on their registry does n't mean it wo n't be appreciated
recycle that dress you were waiting for this one , were n't you ? it 's a myth , ladies
despite many a bride promising her maids " you can wear it again , " i 've actually never been able to pull this off
count the dress as a loss , a memory of a good time and the start to your very own " @entity228 " collection
though i 've never regretted any of the money i spent helping get my friends down the aisle to say " i do , " with a little more forethought , planning and creativity , i could have chicken danced a lot easier without cracking open my nest egg
