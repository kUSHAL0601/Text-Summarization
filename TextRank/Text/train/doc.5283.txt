-- i 'm thinking back to when my girls , now 6 and 7 , were just a few months old
" delicious " is the word that most immediately comes to mind
as i spent countless hours -- like any new mom -- looking adoringly at each of my daughters ' chunky cheeks and dreamy eyes , i often wondered , " what is going through your mind ? " turns out , maybe a whole lot more than i realized
according to researchers at @entity19 's @entity18 , also known as " @entity20 , " babies can actually tell good from evil , even as young as 3 months old
that research is the focus of a three - part series this week on " @entity25 360 , " which airs weeknights at 8 p.m. et. to the skeptics who say , " come on , how can an infant tell the difference between a good guy and a bad guy ? " -- i can relate
it certainly runs counter to our notion that children are born as blank slates and learn right from wrong entirely from us
but the research paints a different picture
puppets are used to demonstrate good and bad behavior
in one case , a puppet is struggling to open a box
another puppet , the " good " puppet , helps it open the box , while another , the " bad " puppet , slams the box shut
more than 80 % of the times that experiment is conducted , babies will select the " good " puppet when presented with both puppets and given the chance to choose either one
" humans are born with a hard - wired morality , a sense of good and evil is bred in the bone , " wrote @entity55 , @entity19 's @entity56 and @entity58 professor of psychology , in an opinion piece for @entity0
@entity55 , author of the new book " @entity66 : the @entity71 , " collaborated on the research with his wife , @entity68 , a professor of psychology at @entity19
" we are naturally moral beings , but our environment can enhance -- or sadly , degrade -- this innate moral sense , " @entity55 said
so now i 'm wondering if , during those months when i thought my babies had zero clue about the world around them , i did anything i should not have done
@entity80 , a contributor to the parenting site @entity83 and mom of a nearly 3 - year - old daughter and 7 - month - old son , wonders the same thing
" when i was pregnant with my daughter , i read a history of our cultural perceptions of the devil and watched a lot of ' @entity98 , ' " said @entity80 of @entity88 , @entity89 , referring to the @entity90 show about a serial killer
@entity99 : @entity0 : when they were babies " then , during my maternity leave , i watched all of ' damages , ' a show where @entity105 plays an evil lawyer
so , what i 'm saying is , if my daughter makes it to her 5th birthday without murdering someone , it wo n't be for lack of trying , " joked @entity80 , who also blogs for the site @entity108
many women i chatted with over e-mail or on @entity117 were n't really surprised to learn there 's much more going on in the brains of our littlest ones
@entity122 , founder of the blog @entity123 in @entity125 and mother of three , remembers when her daughter @entity127 was 4 months old
" she would babble animatedly and -- i swear -- as if she were ' ticked off ' at the large family photo hanging in our home , " said @entity122 of @entity128 , @entity129
the photo was taken before her daughter was born and included everyone in the family -- except her
" she truly seemed put out that she was not in the picture , and this was before she was even eating solids ! when the photo was replaced with a new one including her , she squealed , smiled , waved her hands and would happily look at it each time she passed it , " she said
opinion : do babies know right from wrong ? @entity150 , a single mom of an 8 - year - old in @entity152 , recounts what happened when her soon to be " ex-mother - in - law " came to visit when her son was just a few weeks old
" as soon as she picked him up , he cried and cried and cried
when she handed him over to me , he was fine , giddy , happy , " said @entity150 , co-founder of the blog @entity156 on a shoestring
" my siblings would say @entity162 was an excellent judge of character , even at two weeks ! " the research does show , according to @entity55 , that children just a few months old can judge a person 's character -- siding with the " good " puppet and not with the " bad " puppet
but @entity55 said the research also shows something else , which gives this parent pause
babies , @entity55 said , are born with an inherent bias , and start off as " little bigots , eagerly dividing the world into ' us versus them ' and strongly favoring their own group over everyone else
" " they prefer puppets who have the same tastes as them and they actually want the puppets with the different tastes -- they like other puppets who punish them , " @entity55 said during a @entity180 hangout
" so early on , one of the most tragic aspects of humanity is how we split the world into ' us versus them ' and we find this from the earliest age we can test
" knowing this not only gives us more respect for what 's going on in our children 's minds , but also helps us as parents deal with certain moral issues , such as racism , @entity55 said
watch : baby brains : what are they really thinking ? while it is important to teach children that humans naturally separate ourselves into groups such as families and friends -- and place more value on these people in our lives -- it is also important to clarify that it 's not acceptable to value people according to group traits like skin color , said @entity55 , who is the father of two teens
" so if you realize kids come in a world with their own beliefs and judgments and propensities and expectations , it gives you more respect for them , and it also helps you parent them , helps you know how to make them into more moral people
" on that point , i loved what @entity80 , the @entity83 contributor , said : " children know the world is deep and dark and bright and beautiful
we do n't have to teach them that
instead , we have to equip them to slay the monsters and hold fast to what is true and good
" what do you think babies really know ? chime in below in the comments or tell @entity246 on @entity247 and @entity248 on @entity117 , or share your photos and stories on @entity251 !
