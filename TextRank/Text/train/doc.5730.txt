@entity0 , @entity1 -- whether inside or outside the @entity5 where singer @entity6 died saturday afternoon , the grief and shock were the same
they were just expressed differently -- by the famous indoors and by the everyday fan outdoors
inside the hotel that occupies a full block , the music industry 's biggest names gathered in elegant attire for an annual pre-grammy party that had been long planned by @entity6 's mentor , @entity16
but a party just did n't seem right , participants said as they walked down the red carpet
some , like songwriter @entity20 , thought twice about attending a gala at the same hotel where 48 - year - old @entity6 died in her room just hours earlier
" we debated whether to come tonight and we realized it was going to continue and it was going to be a memorial , " @entity20 said
" it 's just shocking , " he said of the death
when the party started , legend @entity31 listed the names of great entertainments who recently died : @entity36 , @entity37 , and now " the magnificent @entity6 , " he said
@entity31 then made a well - understood reference to @entity6 's past problems with drugs , and he called on " everyone to get our government to legalize drugs " so persons do n't have to get it from " gangs " under the table , he said
the country needs to " legalize drugs like they did in @entity51 , " @entity31 added
he then sang " @entity55 " and received a standing ovation with the last line : " hope the music never ends
" @entity16 opened his remarks about the " unspeakably tragic news of our beloved @entity6 's passing
" @entity16 has long hosted a party the day before the @entity61 , the music industry 's most celebrated event
" i do have a heavy heart , and i am personally devastated by someone so close to me for so many years , " @entity16 told the gathering of artists and entertainers
" my heart goes out to her daughter @entity70 and her mother , @entity72 , " @entity16 said
@entity6 's mentor then asked for a moment of silence , saying , " we dedicate this evening to her
" outside , as a coastal chill settled over people who gathered until the small hours of sunday morning , fans and media flocked to two places : the front and back entrances of the sprawling hotel complex
in between , they laid roses and flickering candles
at the front entrance , a @entity0 police officer pushed back mourners and journalists from the entryway and said that they had to stand on the public sidewalk , pointing to the line dividing public space and private property
many of the 100 persons carried the flame of a candle
singing accompanied the vigil , including such @entity6 standards as " @entity103
" one singer , @entity104 , who met @entity6 once about 10 years ago , started singing " @entity105 " in memory of @entity6
mourners , as well as journalists , immediately started recording video of the sidewalk performance on their cameras or smart phones
@entity104 remarked how @entity6 struggled with drug problems
" pain -- they 're carrying a lot of pain , " @entity104 said about @entity6 's drug woes
" it could be relationships from the past
all we can say is that she 's at peace now
" then @entity104 added , remembering that @entity6 has a teenaged daughter : " there 's a teenager out here who 's lost her mother
" but it was at the back of the hotel -- at the service entrance -- where the largest group of fans , mourners , media and paparazzi gathered
about 200 persons assembled on the ficus - tree - lined sidewalk
everyone was waiting for whether @entity6 's body was going to taken away by authorities through the service door
a police vehicle marked " @entity153 " was parked at the door , also joined by a large truck marked " rental " -- which conveniently shielded off spectators from the best view of the entrance
the rear door was also being used by artists such as @entity31 and @entity156 attending @entity16 ' party
the entertainers apparently were seeking to avoid the public , but it hardly worked saturday night
at one point , a woman in the crowd shouted : " @entity164 ! " as singer @entity164 walked by
paparazzi and fans with cameras pushed the hardest to get to the front of the line , where the public sidewalk met the private driveway
keys entered the back of the hotel , and then the pack of spectators eased and resumed friendly conversation in the cool night air beside the seven - foot tall bushes
some fans wept , as they played @entity6 's music videos on their smartphones
one fan , @entity184 , 31 , just had to stop by the hotel , even tough she , her girlfriend and @entity184 's daughter should have been making the two - hour drive back home to @entity189
@entity184 's daughter , @entity191 , turned 11 years old on saturday , and the group of three drove to @entity193 to do some shopping and have a celebratory dinner for @entity191 's birthday
it was also a celebration of @entity184 's 31st birthday on friday
but when @entity184 's girlfriend , @entity201 , 26 , received a phone call from her father saying that @entity6 had died , none of the three could believe it
@entity184 thought it was another @entity205 rumor of a celebrity 's death , and she used her phone to check it out the information
she found that @entity6 had indeed died -- at the @entity5
the day become a birthday that @entity191 will never forget , she said
so the two women and girl visited the hotel -- and decided to join the crowd at the back door , wondering when the coroner or police would remove @entity6 's body
" we just wanted to come by and show some support , " @entity184 said under a towering ficus tree by the rear driveway
" it 's just so sad , " she added
then she referred to @entity6 's history of drug abuse
" everyone has their own demons , and some overcome them and some never do , " @entity184 stated
" sometimes life gets the best of us
