@entity0 -- @entity2 is a @entity0 and the author of five novels , including the best - selling " @entity5 " and " @entity6 "
she tells my city_my life about her marriage , real life in @entity0 and the secrets of her success
" in @entity0 you 're going to see sides of human nature that you 're going to be shocked by
" @entity1 : how would you describe your work ? @entity2 : i try to write about the human condition , and shopping , materialism and consumerism comes into that , because @entity23 is a very consumerist economy
@entity1 : tell me about when you first arrived in @entity0
@entity26 : i first arrived in @entity0 in 1979
i was 19 and i was going to @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , and i decided that i knew what i wanted to do and it was time to go and do it
i literally ran away from college
then i went to an acting school , " @entity38 " and i moved into this apartment with three other girls who wanted to be actresses
of course , they were all waitresses so i was a waitress
watch @entity2 take @entity1 on a tour of @entity0
» i was incredibly determined -- i wrote short stories , i wrote the beginnings of novels
i wrote a little children 's book and sent it to the editor - in - chief of the children 's division of @entity49 and she asked me to write a little children 's book for a series she was doing
i got paid $ 1,000 for it and i was like " @entity56 , who says you ca n't make it in @entity0 right away ! " of course that little dream crashed in about a month
@entity1 : so you did n't have an overnight success ? @entity26 : i was a freelancer all through my twenties
i did about one story a month and i wanted to write fiction , so the stories that i would do were precursors to " @entity5
" i started working for the @entity69 when i was 33
after i had been writing for them for about a year and a half the editor said , " your stories are the most talked about stories in the @entity69 , you should have your own column
" i was paid $ 1000 a column and the reason was that the column " @entity5
" was so popular that they sold newspapers and advertising off it
see photos of @entity2 's @entity0
» people in @entity0 were faxing it to their friends who worked in the movie business in @entity86 and almost immediately i was getting phone calls from movie producers who wanted to buy it and @entity90 and @entity91 wanted to buy it
it started as a seed , with an absolute truth that people may agree with or it may disturb them
it disturbs me sometimes when i read it because it 's very wrong and very honest
i think most call it cynicism but i call it realism -- it is absolutely raw reality
it was never written for a big audience and it was never written to make people feel good
it was written as the truth in a humorous way
@entity1 : how do you feel about the tv series ? @entity26 : i think the reason why the tv series has continued , and has continued as a movie , is that they have never lost the authenticity of the column
@entity1 : how would you describe @entity0 today ? @entity26 : it 's a very , very busy place and it 's a city where everybody has a place to go and a million things to do
it certainly can be a very stressful city but it can also be an incredibly exciting city
it is a place where your dreams can come true
it 's also a city where you 're going to see sides of human nature that you 're going to be shocked by
@entity0 is a city where , if you are open minded , when you walk out of your apartment you do n't know what could happen
@entity1 : what do you do to get away from it ? @entity26 : i go to @entity128 and i look at bugs and i do n't socialize
if i 'm here for 10 days in a row i 'm exhausted
when i was younger the energy really fed me
this is a city of energy vampires -- people really feed on each others ' energies and that 's why @entity0 talk fast and gesture and they 'll come in and say " @entity56 you wo n't believe what happened ! " that 's a normal greeting in @entity0
@entity1 : what was it like to get married and stop being the single girl ? @entity26 : @entity144 [ @entity145 , a principal dancer with the @entity0 ballet ] and i met at the @entity148 seven years ago
it was really a magical moment because i was 43 and i had kind of given up on that
i was cynical about relationships and i was n't sure about marriage -- i was always very worried that marriage was stifling
but when i saw @entity144 across the room i thought , " that 's the man you 're going to marry
" we met and we talked and i thought , " this is the nicest guy i have ever met in my life , " and we went to a club and we danced and we kissed
we got married two months after we met
@entity1 : can you describe @entity0 in 5 words ? @entity26 : it 's exciting , passionate , fast paced , straightforward and , strangely enough , it 's friendly .
