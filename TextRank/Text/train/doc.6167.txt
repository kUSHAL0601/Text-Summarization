-- a @entity2 company plans to build a full - scale replica of @entity4 , complete with a simulation of an iceberg collision , at a theme park in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity2

the sinking of the @entity4 , on its maiden journey from @entity37 to @entity38 , resulted in more than 1,500 deaths and inspired @entity42 's hit film
the @entity43 said the replica will be permanently docked on the @entity45 , some 930 miles from the nearest coast

" there are museums dedicated to @entity4 in the @entity56 and @entity57 , " said @entity53 , chairman of @entity23
" it 's time for @entity2 to honor the spirit of human responsibility -- how passengers tried to save one another as the ship sank
" last year @entity65 billionaire @entity64 announced he would be funding a working replica of the @entity4 -- the @entity68 cruise
that ship is also being made by a @entity2 shipyard and plans to set sail in the same year the theme park opens .
