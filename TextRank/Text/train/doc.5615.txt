-- @entity1 and friends of a well - known literary translator in @entity4 are concerned for his well - being after he was detained for unknown reasons nearly two weeks ago
@entity7 , 39 , has been held since january 10 , according to a source close to his family
the family does n't know where he 's being detained or why he 's being questioned , but they fear he is in solitary confinement at @entity15 's notorious @entity14 , according to the source
the prison is known for its harsh conditions
@entity7 's family is " so worried about his health , " said the source , who did not want to be named for safety reasons
" he 's not a strong person physically
" his ordeal began in late november when he was questioned by security and intelligence officers
friends and family are n't sure the motive behind that questioning as phones are monitored in @entity4 and @entity7 was tight - lipped about the experience , which resulted in him being banned from leaving the country , according to the source
on january 10 , officials called him to the @entity39 , where he reported that morning
the court hears cases of smuggling , blaspheming , inciting violence or trying to overthrow the @entity46 government
after arriving at court , he was accompanied by security guards to the home he shares with his parents in @entity51 , outside @entity15
the guards searched the house , seizing electronic devices and documents , and prohibited @entity7 from speaking to his parents , the source said
his whereabouts have been unknown since the guards left the home with @entity7 in their custody
@entity62 , an @entity46 - @entity63 author whose best - selling book " @entity66 " @entity7 translated for the @entity46 audience , described her friend as " a very gentle soul
" " he 's a very innocent , very delicate man , " @entity69 said , adding , " i do n't think he would physically survive " the harsh conditions of prison
the source close to the family offered a similar description : " he 's a gentle , polite person , " comparing his manner of speaking to " how poets and writers talk
" both @entity69 and the source were adamant in describing @entity7 as someone who is not involved in @entity4 's politics , making the reason for his detainment even more of a puzzle
" he made a point of distancing himself from politics , " @entity69 said
@entity7 's mother has gone to court daily to arrange a supervised meeting with her son , the source said , but each day she is told that he is still being interrogated
the family has tried to obtain a lawyer for @entity7 , but they 've been advised that until he has been formally charged , they can not take up his case , according to the source
in addition to his translating work , @entity7 also runs a social media network in @entity4 called @entity103 , similar to @entity104
the site has 60,000 members
" he 's basically somebody who likes to connect artists and he 's never made any money -- he 's somebody who is in it for the higher good , " @entity69 said
" he 's always pursued things that have really benefited the people of @entity4
" @entity7 's case is just one of thousands circulating through @entity4 's justice system -- many as a result of religious or political persecution
but unlike the recent high - profile cases of @entity63 hikers detained for more than two years or a former @entity124 sentenced to death for espionage , many of those detainees ' stories are never made public
@entity4 's notoriously secretive trials have been assailed by human rights groups and governments around the globe
the @entity132 's annual human rights report on @entity4 says the court system is , in practice , " corrupt and subject to political influence
" and while the country 's constitution provides a defendant the right to a public trial , presumption of innocence , and a lawyer of his or her choice , " these rights were not respected in practice
" for his family and friends , the lack of information is gut - wrenching
" a man is in jail for no reason whatsoever and no one has heard from him , " @entity69 said , her voice breaking
" it 's a nightmare
this is this man 's life and i think about his parents and i got physically sick when i heard the news
" @entity0 's @entity168 contributed to this report .
