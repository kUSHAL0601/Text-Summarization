@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 military action in @entity5 is comparable to that of @entity8 soldiers during the @entity9 , a @entity12 @entity11 lawmaker whose family suffered at the hands of the @entity15 has claimed
a protester confronts police in @entity1 last weekend at a demonstration against @entity4 action in @entity5
@entity20 , a member of the @entity11 's ruling @entity21 , also called for an arms embargo on @entity4 , currently fighting militant @entity24 group @entity23 , during the debate in the @entity11 parliament thursday
" my grandmother was ill in bed when the @entity15 came to her home town of @entity30
a @entity8 soldier shot her dead in her bed , " said @entity31 , who added that he had friends and family in @entity4 and had been there " more times than i can count
" " my grandmother did not die to provide cover for @entity4 soldiers murdering @entity24 grandmothers in @entity5
" @entity31 , a senior @entity21 politician who was raised as an @entity42 , has often opposed @entity4 policy throughout his career
@entity4 has said it initiated the operation into @entity5 -- which is controlled by @entity23 -- to stop rocket fire on its southern cities and towns
thirteen @entity4 , including 10 soldiers , have died in the operation in @entity5 and from rocket strikes on southern @entity4 , according to the @entity4 military
more than 1,000 @entity24 have been killed , including many civilians , @entity24 medics said
during thursday 's debate , @entity31 also said that @entity4 needed to seek real peace and not peace by conquest , which would be impossible
he also accused the @entity4 government of " ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of @entity12 in the @entity9 as justification for their murder of @entity24
" but @entity31 added that while it is necessary to talk to @entity23 , which had been chosen by an electorate , it nevertheless is a " deeply nasty organization
" @entity71 , the minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs , said the @entity11 government backed an @entity75 presidency statement calling @entity4 action disproportionate
but he also criticized @entity23 rocket attacks on @entity4 during the cease - fire between june and december 2008 , adding that the militant group 's " whole ethos is one of violence " and that it had " made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians
" " nothing , not the restrictions on @entity5 nor its frustration with the peace process , justifies what @entity23 has done and continues to do , " @entity71 said
" in december , i was in @entity91 near the @entity5 border , and i heard the sirens
the fear was palpable : this is daily psychological and actual warfare
" @entity71 added that @entity23 has " committed acts of terrorism , it is committed to the obliteration of the state of @entity4 , and its statement last week that it was legitimate to kill @entity12 children anywhere in the world was utterly chilling and beyond any kind of civilised , humanitarian norm
" the debate came on the day that @entity109 , @entity23 ' third - ranking leader in the territory , was killed by an @entity4 airstrike , the @entity107 militant group reported
the @entity113 ' main relief compound in the territory was also hit and set on fire , which @entity113 secretary general ban ki - moon blamed on @entity4
@entity4 prime minister @entity117 expressed sorrow over the incident but said @entity4 forces were responding to militant fire near the complex
@entity11 prime minister @entity124 described the shelling of the compound as " indefensible , " media agencies reported
speaking to @entity127 during a call , @entity124 said the @entity11 would increase its calls for a cease - fire and also deliver aid to @entity5 once a cease - fire took hold
@entity11 has witnessed several demonstrations since the conflict in @entity5 began late last month
last saturday , up to 20,000 people gathered outside the @entity4 embassy in @entity1 , @entity136 said
later , parts of the crowd began pelting officers with sticks , rocks and pieces of metal barriers , police said
a similar protest sunday was peaceful
rallies were also held in @entity1 and @entity149 last weekend in support of @entity4 action against @entity23 .
