@entity0 , @entity1 -- at a frenzied friday rally in this garrison city outside of @entity6 , thousands warned pope @entity7 to keep his nose out of the debate over @entity1 's blasphemy laws
the demonstration came days after the @entity12 called for @entity1 to repeal the controversial laws that say anyone who defiles the name of the @entity17 prophet @entity14 should face the death penalty or life imprisonment
" if you challenge the prophet , we will take revenge
it does n't matter who does it , " shouted a cleric on loudspeakers to thousands of cheering onlookers
@entity1 's blasphemy laws came into sharp focus when a security guard allegedly killed his boss @entity31 , the governor of @entity1 's @entity33 province , who criticize the laws
since the shooting , hardline religious groups have held demonstrations praising suspected killer @entity39 -- who @entity1 's interior minister says confessed to the killing -- calling him a hero and a defender of @entity17
at friday 's rally , pictures of the the suspects 's smiling face adorned scores of posters and a banner that covered the length of a truck
the banner also pictured a cleric who allegedly inspired @entity39 to assassinate @entity31
the cleric is now wanted by police
@entity31 , who was sprayed with more than 20 bullets last week , according to a medical clinic spokesman , had led an aggressive campaign to change @entity1 's blasphemy laws after what he called the wrongful conviction of a @entity1 @entity63 woman
the laws are often used to persecute minorities , @entity31 had said
at the rally , many said @entity31 wanted to repeal the blasphemy laws , which they called an attack on @entity17
" no doubt he was an agent , " said protester @entity70
" after the pope 's statement it 's clear where he 's getting orders from
" at the protest , @entity39 's lawyer said his client should be set free because he was compelled to defend his faith
for now , the suspected assassin remains behind bars .
