@entity1 , the pugnacious @entity2 actor known for playing gangsters , tough guys and working - class gentlemen in such films as " @entity7 , " " @entity8 " and " mermaids , " has died , publicist @entity0 said wednesday
his passing comes nearly two years after he retired from acting following a diagnosis of @entity12
@entity1 was perhaps best known for 1988 's live - action and animation hybrid " @entity7
" in the comedy , he played detective @entity16 , who hates " toons " -- cartoon figures who live in a separate showbiz world bordering @entity26 's 1940s @entity25 -- and takes up the task of proving the innocence of the cartoon title character , accused of murder
the film was the second - highest grossing movie of 1988 , after " @entity29
" he followed the turn with performances in a variety of films , including 1991 's " @entity34 " in which he played @entity37 , the pirate assistant of captain hook ; 1995 's " @entity39 " as fbi director @entity40 ; and 2001 's " @entity41 " as the gambler friend of protagonist @entity43 , whose pals gather to spread his ashes after his death
@entity1 was nominated for an @entity47 for 1986 's " @entity48 " as a cabdriver who establishes a relationship with a high - priced call girl
@entity43 was also in the film
@entity1 won both a @entity54 and @entity55 for his performance
@entity57 was born on october 26 , 1942 , in @entity58 , @entity59 , the only child of a bookkeeper and a cook
he dropped out of school at 15 and took jobs as a truck driver and window cleaner , among others , before falling into acting by accident : a friend was auditioning for a part and @entity1 , who was waiting nearby , was asked to try out
a natural , he got the role
" i fit into this business like a sore foot into a soft shoe , " he told the @entity74 paper @entity73 in 2009
in @entity2 , he gained fame for his performance as a @entity81 - era song - plugger in @entity83 's miniseries " @entity84 , " later turned into a 1980 movie starring @entity86
though he had a handful of recognizable roles in films after " pennies " -- including 1980 's " @entity8 , " 1982 's " @entity92 " and 1985 's " @entity93 " ( in which he played a gleefully malevolent repairman ) , it was n't until " @entity7 " that he broke through to mainstream @entity97 audiences
that film drove him a bit nuts , he told @entity73
" i think i went a bit mad while working on that
the voice of the rabbit was there just behind the camera all the time , " he recalled
" the trouble was , i had learnt how to hallucinate
my daughter had an invisible friend called @entity110 and i played with her and this invisible friend until one day i actually saw the friend
" it was his daughter , however , who set him straight
" my daughter , when i came back from filming in @entity116 , she said ' @entity117 , slow down , slow down
you 're going barmy , mate
" always a steady and straightforward worker -- no " method acting " for @entity1 -- he appeared in at least one production every year from 1972 until his retirement in 2012
" there 's two things i love about this business
one 's acting and the other one 's getting paid for it , " he told the @entity74 paper @entity127 in 2007
" the rest of it is a mystery to me
" in one of his last roles , he played the @entity135 in 2012 's " @entity136
" in the 2011 tv miniseries and @entity140 prequel " neverland , " he played @entity37 -- a character he had portrayed in " @entity34
" but true to his working - class roots -- the @entity73 described his natural voice as " cockney as jellied eels " -- he hated to put on airs
" i met a little old fella in @entity148 when i was walking a character around
he said , ' you are who you are , ai n't you ? ' and i said , ' yeah , i am who i am
' and he said , ' that 's good
i grow roses , ' " @entity1 recalled
" and we sat talking about roses all afternoon
" @entity1 is survived by his wife , @entity159 , and four children
people we lost in 2014
