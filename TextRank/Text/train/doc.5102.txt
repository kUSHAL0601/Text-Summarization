-- world no. 2 @entity1 battled from behind to win another epic encounter with his great rival @entity4 on thursday and earn a place in the @entity7 final
the @entity8 triumphed 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 6 - 2 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 4 in three hours and 42 minutes as he set up a clash with either defending champion @entity10 or @entity12 fourth seed @entity11 , who meet in friday 's second semifinal
@entity1 , seeking his 11th grand slam title , extended his winning record over @entity17 third seed @entity4 to 18 - 9 -- and 8 - 2 in major tournaments
@entity4 , who has a record 16 grand slam titles to his name , saved a match point but was unable to repeat the form that had seen the 30 - year - old not drop a set in his previous five matches in @entity26
it capped a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for @entity1 , who feared that he might not be fit to start the tournament
" sunday afternoon , 24 hours to play my first match , i was in my room crying because i believed i did n't have the chance to play in @entity26 , " he told reporters
" two weeks later i am here in the finals , so it is a dream for me because i had very bad expectations 24 hours before the first match , and now two weeks later i am playing well
i am in the final
" it 's a fantastic victory for me
i 'm very , very happy playing against the greatest in history in semifinals , in a big match on @entity45
it 's one of the victories that 's going to stay in my mind forever
" @entity4 has not beaten @entity1 at a grand slam tournament since @entity50 in 2007 but the @entity17 took the opening set on a tiebreak
@entity1 , who lost six finals to @entity10 last year and his no. 1 ranking , responded with a determination that he seems to reserve for matches against his friend and longtime foe
" we have had good matches over the years , " @entity4 said
" i enjoy playing him
the crowd really gets into it , which is nice
we have a lot of respect for each other , which is good , too , i think
" we also play well against each other
i always think he plays a bit better against me than against other players , but that 's good for him
" even an extended break for @entity75 fireworks in the second set could not halt the 25 - year - old @entity1 's momentum , as he won 11 points in a row
" it 's not helpful , that 's for sure , " @entity4 said
" i probably do n't want to say i would have lost the set anyway , but i was down in the score
" but they told us before , so it was n't a surprise for us
