-- ever wonder how actresses like @entity2 look stunning 24/7 ? good genes , sure
but they also get a little help from their friends @entity2 and favorite hairstylist @entity7 : " if i worried what people thought about my look , i 'd get it all wrong
" @entity2 and hairstylist @entity7 try to talk coifs with @entity2 and she 'll cut you off at the pass
" i do n't even own a hairbrush ! " she insists
" i 'm really not too attached to my hair
she gamely lopped off about 10 inches to play @entity20 in factory girl
but the actress is much less keen to part with her hairstylist @entity7 , for whom she has been known to cook dinner at her @entity27 home
" @entity7 gets me , " says @entity2
" he knows i never like to look too done or polished
" her biggest challenge ? " i 've got quite a lot of hair , but i like it flat , so @entity7 squashes it down for me
" to create @entity2 's ideal look , @entity7 flatirons her roots and combats bulkiness with @entity39 cream
" @entity41 feels most like herself when her hair is soft and airy versus set and stylized , " he says
still , it takes effort to appear this artfully undone
it may seem like she rolls out of bed looking glamorous , but @entity2 says it is not that easy : " i 'm very much involved in how i want to look
" eve and makeup artist @entity50 she dyed her hair platinum as a @entity53 teenager , rose to fame as a hip - hop biker chick , and cavorted with a tiger -- and later @entity57 -- on @entity58
it seems like @entity60 was born edgy
but until recently the rapper - singer - actress clung religiously to her signature look of cat eyes , dewy skin and pale pink lips , aided by the habitual application of @entity67 in @entity68 ( she 's also a company spokeswoman )
it was on the @entity71 set of @entity60 's candy - colored video for " @entity73 " ( the hit single off her fall album @entity75 ) that makeup artist @entity50 motivated the star to test a new image
" @entity50 recently said to me , ' thank you for letting me experiment , ' " says @entity60 , referring to a @entity78 -- inspired look that involved electric - blue eye shadow
" i have definitely opened up a lot more
" says @entity50 : " we were so used to seeing her in nude lips , bronze skin and comfortable colors
i push eve to get out of that box
" the star has lately sported hot - pink lips , chartreuse highlighter on her browbones , and blue mascara with newfound confidence
" at first @entity60 was like , ' @entity96 , ' " says @entity50 of such intense shades
" i was like , ' listen , trust me
i 'm going to make you look gorgeous
' " @entity98 and hairstylist @entity99 during the last three years , hairstylist @entity99 has seen all shades of actress @entity98
" when i met her , she had beachy [ sandy ] highlights , " says @entity99 , who brightened up @entity98 's @entity103 -- era color so she looked " more movie star , like a young @entity106
" @entity99 's platinum touch sent his number straight to @entity98 's speed dial
" it 's a little secret , " she says of his closet coloring abilities ( he 's known primarily as a haircutter )
" i call him months in advance ! " naturally , she also uses him as her stylist -- it was @entity99 who gave her the sleek bob that solidified her status as a hair icon last year
" she was the first one to have it , " he says
" and then everybody did the bob
" for someone whose biggest struggle is building volume ( @entity98 has " baby angel hair , " says @entity99 ) the bob was perfect ; her hair looked thicker , and it practically styled itself
" i could jump out of the shower , give it a tousle and leave , " says @entity98
her next experiment ? " i want to be a redhead -- a deep , @entity137 redhead
just to go there once
" @entity140 and makeup artist @entity139 when @entity140 first settled into @entity139 's makeup chair in 2004 , she felt like she had found a soul mate
" it was really instant , " says @entity143 , who fell head over heels for the @entity147 artist 's ability to create high cheekbones , luxe lashes and pale lips
but never mind the makeovers for movie premières and music videos for her latest album , @entity156 ; for @entity158 , the real test was meeting @entity143 's family
" my mom [ @entity160 ] did makeup for @entity162 , so she knows what looks good and what does n't , " says @entity143
luckily , @entity158 wowed the ' rents
" that 's when i knew it was ok -- when @entity160 was like , ' this is good work , ' " laughs @entity158 , who now pushes the boundaries with blue shadows and white eyeliner
" i have really big eyes , " says @entity143 , " and for the longest time i would use black eyeliner to make them look smaller
@entity139 actually made them look bigger by lining them with white
i love how she makes me see myself differently
" now when the two get together , they share more than makeup tricks
" we see each other a couple of times a week for hours , " says @entity143
" we talk about boys , life and work
we know each other so well
it 's like a big therapy session every time
" @entity189 and hairstylist @entity190 she may be an @entity191 winner , but @entity189 has little in common with her gilded statuette
" in real life i 'm very unpolished , " says the mother of 17 - month - old @entity194
" dressing for the red carpet is fantasy time , but in my day - to - day life , i 'm very grungy
" this low - maintenance attitude has served her hair well
" it 's in great shape , " says @entity202 hairstylist @entity190
" @entity139 's hair matches her personality : it 's not overdone , not super-fussed - over
and she 's incredibly approachable and sweet
" fearless too : in 2005 the @entity209 actress sheared her locks to a half inch to play a dying woman in @entity213
while growing out her hair , she often donned extensions
but a year later , when @entity190 suggested she wear a thicket of curly , waist - length tresses to the @entity191 , the eight - months - pregnant star did n't feel so brave
" are you sure we need this much hair ? " @entity189 asked
but @entity190 soldiered on , confident in his vision
" i wanted fullness in the back to balance out her silhouette , " he says of the baby bump / hair bump symmetry
the romantic updo proved lucky -- and prophetic
" now i 'm growing my hair out , " she says
" i 've come to like it really long and unruly
