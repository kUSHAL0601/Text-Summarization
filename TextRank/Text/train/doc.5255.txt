@entity0 , @entity1 -- a 92 - year - old woman with cocaine strapped to her body flew all the way from @entity7 to @entity1 before police arrested her , in a wheelchair , at @entity0 's airport
a @entity11 spokeswoman says the 92 - year old was apprehended at @entity0 's @entity13
they found 4.3 kilos , or nearly 9.5 pounds , of cocaine packets strapped to her legs and torso , and also arrested a 44 - year - old female companion , who tried to escape on another plane , a @entity11 spokeswoman told @entity2 tuesday
the two women , both from @entity21 , were arrested friday after arriving in @entity0 on a flight from @entity23 , @entity7
but officials did not release details about the case until this week , after a judge had arraigned the two on drug trafficking charges
the judge ordered the younger woman to prison but sent the 92 - year - old to a senior citizens ' home in @entity0
due to her advanced age , " it 's practically impossible " that she would be tried or face jail time , said the @entity11 spokeswoman , who by custom is not identified
police did not identify the two women
civil guards became suspicious when the younger woman repeatedly told the older woman -- who had asked for an airport wheelchair in @entity0 to traverse the terminal -- that if they rushed , they would make their connecting flight to @entity1 's @entity47
the @entity41 , who run customs controls at the airport , stopped the woman in the wheelchair
the younger woman immediately fled , first trying to make the connecting flight , which by then had closed its doors , and then attempting to leave the airport terminal for the street
but she was stuck in the " satellite , " or second building , of @entity59 , which is connected to the main building and the street by an underground train
police caught up with her before she left the satellite terminal
the two would - be smugglers probably expected a cash payment and return flight tickets to @entity7 from their drug trafficking contacts , the @entity11 spokeswoman said .
