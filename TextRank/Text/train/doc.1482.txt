-- " real photographers do n't take photographs , they make photographs , " says @entity1 , who is widely regarded as one of the world 's great yachting photographers
the feisty 96 - year - old @entity8 should know
a pioneer in her field , she is credited with being the first yachting photographer to shun the safety of the tripod and compose her pictures while dangling off the side of a boat -- all in quest for the ultimate action shot
" other photographers would stand in the middle of their boats taking pictures of big yachts with plate cameras , so i developed my own style -- taking my pictures as close to the water as possible , " recalls @entity1
water - level photography , now an industry standard , quickly became her signature shot , but it was neither easy nor cheap
while adamant that she never dropped one of her @entity36 - made @entity35 cameras overboard , the saltwater took its toll on her equipment nonetheless
" i used to make sure i shielded the camera under my buttoned - up anorak , but the saltwater would still get to it
even though i cleaned them after each session , they would quickly get stiff because of all the salt , " says @entity1 , whose career has been immortalized in a new book by fellow photo - journalist and @entity8 @entity45

" it only took so long because @entity56 was so prolific
she kept immaculate records of her work and she remembers every photograph she 's ever taken , which meant that she would immediately pick up on things if i did n't get it right , " says @entity45 , a former yachting correspondent who now runs a photo agency that specializes in nautical photography
drawn to picture - taking from a young age , @entity1 began her professional career in 1937 as a 22 - year - old receptionist at a photography studio outside @entity70
but as war clouds gathered across @entity74 and the call to arms began , the owner of the studio discovered that his personal services would be required to record the impending conflict , so he gave each of his staff a camera and told them to go out and take some " interesting " photographs
the one to come back with the best pictures would take over the studio in his absence during the war
" i did n't know anything about cameras then , but my pictures were judged the best and i got the job , " says @entity1 , who spent the war years honing her skills in portrait photography by taking pictures of soldiers and their girlfriends
after the war she decided to go at it alone and set up her own studio in @entity70 , taking on any commissions that came her way from magazines and newspapers
in 1953 , she and her boyfriend decided to move closer to the ocean , and after purchasing a 28 foot ( 8.5 meter ) ex-royal air force boat that they moored at the end of their garden , she set out to make her mark in the nautical world
@entity116 enjoyed a post-war explosion in @entity118 , and it was during the 1950s and 60s that @entity1 's yachting photography career really took off
it 's this period that @entity45 has tried to capture in his book

her early pictures of our sailing pioneers have great significance when recording @entity118 's sailing history , " says @entity45 , adding that grown men were " moved to tears " at the sight of her original photos , which he brought to a boat exhibition last year
" all these people were gobsmacked , they could n't believe these photos existed
they kept spotting themselves as children as they flicked through her albums , " says @entity45
as for @entity1 , she is not fazed by her new moniker as the " @entity54 "
" i knew i was original back then , " she says bluntly , before adding : " you know , when you are 96 years of age , nothing can really faze you
