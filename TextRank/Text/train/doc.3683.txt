-- the man in the picture has his back to the camera
he 's desperately clawing at a subway platform , looking right at the train that 's bearing down on him as he stands on the tracks
it 's a terrifying , heart - wrenching image , and it 's generating a lot of criticism for the newspaper that used it on its front page -- the salty , sensational @entity15
why did n't the photographer help ? why did the newspaper publish the photo ? " @entity15 should be ashamed of its misuse of humanity for its cover photo of a man about to be killed by a subway train , " one person wrote on @entity20
" when does cruelty end
" " snuff porn , " another user labeled it
opinion : why the outrage over subway death photo a freelance photographer captured the image monday after someone shoved the man , 58 - year - old @entity36 , from a subway platform near @entity38
seconds after photographer @entity40 captured the images , the train fatally struck @entity36
he died at a @entity43 , leaving behind a wife and daughter
a man officers were questioning " implicated himself " in the incident , police said tuesday night
police gave no other information on the suspect and this news may do nothing to quell the ongoing debate about the controversial photo
" doomed , " the headline read
" pushed on the subway track , this man is about to die
" in its story on the incident tuesday , the @entity15 reported @entity40 was waiting on the platform when he saw the man fall onto the tracks
he said he ran towards the oncoming train , firing his camera 's flash to warn the driver
" i just started running , running , hoping that the driver could see my flash , " the newspaper quoted him as saying
" in that moment , i just wanted to warn the train -- to try and save a life , " the @entity15 quoted him as saying
some critics , however , questioned @entity40 's motives
one @entity20 user questioned why someones first instinct would be not to help the man , but instead to " snap a photo of him about to die and sell it to the @entity15
" reached by @entity0 , @entity40 was adamant that he would talk to the network only for pay
the @entity15 declined to comment
media observers wondered tuesday if the newspaper had gone too far this time
" even if you accept that that photographer and other bystanders did everything they could to try to save the man , it 's a separate question of what the @entity15 should have done with that photo , " @entity85 , a fellow at journalism think tank the @entity87 , wrote on the organization 's website
" all journalists we 've seen talking about it online concluded the @entity15 was wrong to use the photo , especially on its front page
" @entity104 , @entity87 's senior faculty member for visual journalism and diversity programs , said what the paper did was n't necessarily wrong
" it was not illegal or unethical given that ethical guidelines and recommendations are not absolute , " he said in an e-mail
but he also thought the @entity15 could have used another photo because this one crossed the line of dignity
" this moment was such for me -- it was too private in my view , " he wrote
" i am all for maximizing truth telling , while minimizing harm , which can be done by fully vetting the alternatives available and publishing with a sense of compassion and respect
" the @entity15 is no stranger to walking up to the lines of journalistic ethics , and sometimes crossing them , with its pithy , often lurid , coverage of crime and other news in the @entity132
" @entity15 , " the newspaper once famously shouted from its cover
the @entity15 shot is hardly the first news photo to generate ethics concerns
an @entity139 photo that won the 2012 @entity140 generated controversy for its depiction of a girl in @entity144 crying amid a number of bloody bodies
also this year , the @entity147 published a graphic image showing blood streaming from the body of a victim following a fatal august shooting at the @entity153
at the time , @entity154 quoted a @entity147 spokeswoman as saying the image was " a newsworthy photograph that shows the result and impact of a public act of violence
" @entity0 's @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report .
