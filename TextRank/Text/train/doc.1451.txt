@entity0 -- @entity3 sen. @entity2 of @entity4 announced tuesday she will retire rather than seek re-election this year , surprising colleagues and perhaps casting the future of her seat in doubt
the decision was made " after an extraordinary amount of reflection and consideration , " she said in a statement
@entity2 , who turned 65 last week , was first elected to the @entity15 in 1978 and then to the @entity16 in 1994
she is the first woman to serve in both chambers of a state legislature and the @entity19
@entity2 was known as a moderate who sometimes sided with @entity21 in the increasingly partisan environment of @entity0 politics
her statement cited the partisan divide
" i have no doubt i would have won re-election , " @entity2 said , describing her political service in @entity4 and @entity0 as " an indescribable honor and immeasurable privilege
" while her motivation and sense of responsibility remain , she continued , " i do find it frustrating , however , that an atmosphere of polarization and ' my way or the highway ' ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions
" " unfortunately , i do not realistically expect the partisanship of recent years in the @entity16 to change over the short term , " @entity2 said
" so at this stage of my tenure in public service , i have concluded that i am not prepared to commit myself to an additional six years in the @entity16
" the @entity49 released a statement praising @entity2 's bipartisan efforts
" for almost four decades , @entity2 has served the people of the great state of @entity4
... from her unwavering support for our troops , to her efforts to reform @entity60 , to fighting for @entity4 's small businesses , sen. @entity2 's career demonstrates how much can be accomplished when leaders from both parties come together to do the right thing for the @entity66 people
" initial reaction from colleagues indicated @entity2 's decision was unexpected
i know that she 's been quite frustrated with the lack of civility in @entity0 and the fact that she 's a bridge builder -- and it was more and more difficult to do that
but we were all surprised here in @entity4 that she would make the decision , " said @entity78 chairman @entity77
" it 's going to shake things up in @entity4 politics
" @entity4 sen. @entity86 , a moderate @entity3 , said she was " devastated " to learn of @entity2 's decision not to seek re-election
" i know this was an incredibly difficult decision for @entity93 , " said @entity88 , who lauded @entity2 as " a leader who sought solutions , not political advantage
" @entity95 sen. @entity94 of @entity96 expressed surprise at the news when told by @entity1
" we 'll miss her , " @entity94 said
" she 's a good , good lady and an example of ... sometimes how the roughness of the political world can affect things
she 's great , and she 'll be missed by people on both sides of the aisle
" with @entity2 in the race , two of the top political handicappers -- the @entity109 and the @entity110 -- had considered the seat " safe @entity3 " in the november election
@entity21 hold a 53 - 47 majority in the @entity16 but are defending 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs in november , including those of two independents who caucus with the @entity21
@entity119 , executive director of the @entity120 , called @entity2 's departure an " unexpected opportunity
" " @entity4 is now a top pick - up opportunity for @entity21 , " @entity119 said in a statement
" if there is one place in the country that is likely to reject the extreme , anti-middle class , divisive @entity3 agenda it is @entity4
@entity21 not only hold a strong registration advantage in the state , but this is a state that the president won by 17 points in 2008 and will likely win by a significant margin this year , as well
" however , @entity137 sen. @entity136 , the chairman of the @entity138 , said his party remains " well - positioned to win back a @entity16 majority in november
" " @entity4 has a proud history of electing independent leaders , including a @entity3 governor in 2010 , and while this will be a key battleground in the fall , i am confident it will remain in @entity3 hands , " @entity136 said in a statement
the @entity78 chairman said it 's too early to tell yet whether @entity21 could potentially pick up the seat
" we 've got a number of qualified people that could run , " said @entity77
two @entity3 candidates already announced primary challenges to @entity2 -- former @entity157 and tea party activist @entity158
in addition , two @entity21 being mentioned as potential candidates were businesswoman and 2010 gubernatorial candidate @entity163 and state rep. @entity164
@entity66 rep. @entity165 , @entity166 , was also hailed as a possible candidate
the @entity168 launched a campaign shortly after @entity2 's announcement to draft the @entity95 representative into running
the group , which claims 6,000 members in @entity4 and close to a million nationwide , praised @entity165 for having a " bold progressive voice
" @entity1 's @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .
