@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 headed to the polls friday in a parliamentary election , marking the first nationwide balloting since a disputed vote triggered massive protests nearly three years ago
in ornate mosques that serve as polling centers , voters waited patiently in long lines to cast their ballots
some of the centers were decorated with huge banners celebrating the achievements of the @entity1
" elections protect the country , " read one slogan
" the capture of the drone was another slap in the face of the enemies of the @entity28 , " declared another poster , above a photo of the @entity22 spy drone that was captured by @entity1 late last year
" i have voted in every election in @entity1 , " said a retired university professor named @entity30 , who brandished an ink - stained finger in a " victory " sign after he cast his ballot
" the fundamentalists ... the group that are now governing this country will win this election , " he predicted
not all @entity1 were enthusiastic about the election , though
" i 'm not voting , " said a mustachioed man in a small @entity0 tailor shop , who asked not to be named because of the plain - clothed security officer who stood conspicuously outside listening in on the conversation
" i voted for @entity43 before , and i regret it because he 's not doing a good job , " he said , referring to @entity1 president @entity43
about 3,400 candidates are vying for 290 seats in the parliamentary election
the @entity51 nation faces an escalating international outcry and @entity54 sanctions over its nuclear program , prompting leaders to call for a higher voter turnout to establish legitimacy
days before the vote , campaigning intensified as workers distributed leaflets and plastered candidate posters along tree - lined streets in @entity0
state television broadcast wall - to - wall programming encouraging voters to cast their ballots
" our progress in science and economics depends on your vote , " slogans read in the publicity campaign that included a quote from the late founder of the nation , ayatollah @entity71 , saying " the measure of a nation is its vote
" in @entity1 , elections are heralded by the revolutionary regime as a popular demonstration that it enjoys the overwhelming support of the population
the @entity88 predicted voter turnout of about 60 % , the state - run @entity86 reported
results from smaller precincts could be available in 48 hours , but larger cities may not have complete results until 72 hours , the news agency said
but the poll marks the first time @entity1 are voting since allegations of rigging in the 2009 elections triggered mass street protests against @entity43 's re-election
security forces used deadly force to crack down on the opposition @entity105 and presidential candidates @entity107 and @entity108 were placed under house arrest , where they remain
but at a campaign rally for candidates from the conservative @entity115 on wednesday , one lawmaker running for re-election offered a different account of the aftermath of the 2009 vote
" during the 2009 elections , attempts were made to use cheating in the elections as an excuse to plot against the regime , " said @entity119
" attempts were made to show the world that there is no democracy in @entity1 and that the people are not the ones who have the power to elect their leaders , " she said
" that 's why the friday elections represent the people 's will to participate in determining their own future and their country 's fate
" there are no candidates from the @entity105 in this year 's parliamentary election
@entity1 political analysts describe the vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government
" the underlying issue is whether or not you support @entity43 , " said @entity150 , a political scientist at @entity151
" it 's a rivalry between @entity43 on the one hand and the supreme leader on the other ... not overtly , and not directly of course
" @entity1 supreme leader ayatollah @entity159 publicly supported @entity43 's controversial re-election victory during the dispute over the 2009 ballot results
but tensions have flared between the two leaders over the last year , with @entity43 disappearing from public view for 11 days after the supreme leader overruled his decision to fire an intelligence minister
several of @entity43 's top political allies have also been subjected to lawsuits and investigations
in the run - up to this week 's vote , the supreme leader urged factions to overcome previous divisions and repeatedly called for unity
he accused the @entity22 and its allies of trying to stop @entity1 from voting , saying a high turnout would be " another firm slap in the face of world arrogance , " according to @entity184
" vigorous participation of the @entity1 nation in the election will send a message to hegemonic powers and will be beneficial for the country 's future , " he said
on @entity0 streets , some @entity1 blamed increasingly harsh @entity22 economic sanctions for the precipitous drop in the value of the nation 's currency over the last several months
at polling stations , some voters seemed to suggest there were few ideological differences between the candidates
" i 'm just going to vote out of chance
they 're all good , " a voter named @entity206 said
" it does n't make any difference
they 're all the same
all @entity211 , religious , very nice kind people
" " to be honest , most of the [ candidate ] groups are very similar , " said dr. @entity213 , a former health minister and current parliament member running for re-election
he said the group of candidates he was running alongside , called the @entity222 , campaigned on the platform of " @entity224
" some opposition activists from the @entity105 expressed despair about the election in conversations with @entity2
" what you see on @entity1 tv is all propaganda
all the voters are saying , ' see , this is democracy , we are voting , ' but we all know it 's rigged , " said an art student from the city of @entity235 in a phone conversation with @entity2
" these elections have been rigged since 1979 and always will be until the mullahs stop running this country into the ground
i am not voting today because my vote does not count and never has counted
" " @entity107 and @entity108 are under house arrest , my friends and family have been arrested , jailed , falsely accused , and beaten , " said an engineer , speaking by phone with @entity2 from @entity0
" i feel like a coward that i can not go on tv and tell the world what is happening in @entity1 , but what good am i to the future of this country if i am dead
" about 48 million people are eligible to vote , according to state - run @entity184
@entity1 officials announced the polling stations would remain open an additional three hours friday night
@entity260 and @entity261 contributed to this report .
