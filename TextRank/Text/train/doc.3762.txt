@entity0 @entity3 's announcement that she would step down from her @entity5 seat is the golden opportunity that many of @entity10 's @entity9 stars have waited years for , and it 's touching off one of the most unpredictable and expensive scrambles for federal office in the @entity14 in years
with @entity10 's two @entity5 seats locked down for more than two decades by @entity3 and sen. @entity16 , @entity3 's announcement thursday -- via a video with her grandson -- set up a key test of the state 's top - two primary system
given the shallow @entity25 bench in @entity10 , many political observers predicted a fierce runoff in november 2016 between two of the state 's top democrats , depending on who emerges from the june primary
top @entity9 contenders weigh @entity34 run " there 's an entire generation of @entity9 politicians who have been waiting for an opportunity like this one , " said @entity35 , executive director of the @entity37 at the @entity38
" that 's a lot of pent up energy and ambition
" three of the strongest potential @entity9 contenders for the seat — attorney general @entity50 , lt. gov. @entity51 and billionaire environmentalist @entity52 — have been coy about their plans , praising @entity3 's long tenure as a champion for progressive causes , but staying mum on their own ambitions
former @entity0 mayor @entity61 released a statement saturday expressing his interest : " too many @entity64 are struggling to make ends meet , pay the bills , and send their kids to college
they are looking for progressive leaders in @entity72 who will fight for them , like @entity3 has done for over 20 years , " the former @entity0 mayor said in a statement
" the urgency of the needs of the people of this great state have convinced me to seriously consider looking at running for @entity10 's open @entity5 seat
" @entity52 is expected to make a decision within days
for the others , there was a political chess match underway behind the scenes
@entity3 's vacancy could be just the first of three statewide openings in @entity10 in the next few years
the governor 's office will be vacant in 2018 and that 's when @entity16 's current term expires
she could step down , though the 81 - year - old senator has given no indication that she will retire
@entity93 on @entity3 retirement : ' what ? ' @entity96 , @entity51 and @entity61 have all expressed interest to confidantes in running both for @entity5 and @entity100 's race over the years
@entity96 and @entity51 share the same @entity10 - based strategists , including @entity102 , raising the possibility they could strike a pact where @entity96 runs for @entity3 's seat and @entity51 waits to run for @entity100 after his two terms as lieutenant governor
( @entity102 , who also advised @entity61 before the former @entity0 mayor returned to the private sector , is often mentioned as potential top strategist for @entity111 's 2016 campaign )
the two @entity10 politicians have an amicable , if not close , relationship
if pitted against one another , they could split that region of the state between them -- clearing a path for a strong @entity120 candidate like @entity61 , who has won prior races with strong support from @entity123
increasing speculation about a deal this week , @entity96 and @entity51 sent a message of unity on monday when @entity51 chose the attorney general to administer his oath of office at his swearing in for his second term as lieutenant governor
another wild card are the future plans of gov. @entity136 , who faces term limits in 2018 after his fourth term as governor
@entity51 , who has had a fraught relationship with @entity136 over the years , withdrew from his first bid for governor in 2009 after struggling to raise money with the specter of @entity136 entering the race
@entity136 , who barely campaigned in his re-election race last year and won overwhelmingly , has said little about what he would do after the governor 's office
beyond those big names -- which rose to the top because of their strong fundraising potential in @entity10 , and @entity52 's ability to self - fund -- the list of potential candidates seemed almost endless thursday
more than a half - dozen members of @entity157 are weighing whether to jump into the race , as well as a number of state lawmakers and treasurer @entity161 , who is widely talked about as an underestimated candidate
but federal limits on fundraising are far more restrictive than state limits — setting up steep challenges for any of the contenders
further complicating matters for @entity9 , many well funded labor groups who have played an active role in other state races will be wary of choosing sides between high profile @entity9
while @entity25 @entity177 would be the most formidable candidate on the @entity25 side , he is unlikely to leave his post as @entity180
@entity3 's opponent in 2010 , former @entity182 ceo @entity181 , now resides in @entity183 and is weighing a run for president
" i do n't think there 's an obvious ( @entity25 ) contender , " said longtime @entity25 strategist @entity186 , who advised @entity181 in her run against @entity3 in 2010
" @entity10 has become a very , very difficult state
it 's going to be somewhat easier not to have to run against an incumbent , but 2016 will be a presidential year -- so the result is that there will be a lot heavier @entity9 turnout , which makes it an even bigger hill to climb for a @entity25
" other republicans who could throw their hat in the ring include @entity201 , who ran unsuccessfully for governor against @entity136 last year , as well as @entity204 mayor @entity203
but few @entity25 aspirants are thought to have a chance against the top tier @entity9 contenders
" this race is going to cost $ 20 million just to get to the starting gate , " said longtime @entity10 political analyst @entity209
" there is nobody who would be likely to run as a @entity25 who could come up with that kind of money
" ( @entity3 , in conjunction with party committees raised more than $ 35 million for her 2010 re-election bid )
rep. @entity220 , who could have funded his own campaign , withdrew his name from consideration
democrat @entity224 was among the first to step aside , saying he was focused on his new job as @entity0 mayor
@entity3 , who is 74 and was elected with @entity16 in the so - called " year of the woman " in 1992 , did not reveal her leanings toward a potential successor during a call with reporters thursday afternoon
if faced with a competitive @entity9 race for her seat , she could very well opt not to endorse given how many people underestimated her in her own @entity5 race in 1992
when she ran in that cycle against two formidable @entity9 , then - lt. gov. @entity237 and rep. @entity238 , @entity3 was pressured to drop out , but pulled off a surprise victory : " i was an asterisk , " she mused thursday
she said discussions of an endorsement were premature : " i do n't know if one person will come forward or if 15 will come forward , " @entity3 told reporters on a call thursday
she said she made her decision over the holidays to be fair to the contenders
" i am doing it this early , " @entity3 said , " because i think it 's important for the field -- give them plenty of time to look at this ; do n't give any one person the advantage , and just send the message out loud and clear
" @entity16 similarly did not tip her hand on who she would favor in the race , but she noted that the candidates would need to get off to a fast start given the enormous expense of running a statewide campaign in @entity10
" most candidates do n't realize , until they 've run , how big the state is and how you have to reach people , " @entity16 said during a press gaggle on @entity267 thursday
" you have to figure : ' how many hands can i shake in two years
100,000 ? 200,000 ? ' ( you 've ) got 38 million people
so it really comes down to media , unfortunately
" @entity1 's @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report
