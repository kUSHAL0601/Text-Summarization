the word alone can put a room of new or expecting moms on high alert
after all , those pesky little microbes can be a big worry for parents trying to safeguard their tiny babies from sniffles , runny noses , fevers and worse
but not all germs ( bacteria , viruses , fungi and parasites ) cause disease
in fact , all of us have a bouquet of normal bacteria on our skin , in our mouths and in our bellies that help us stay healthy ( sounds gross , but it 's true )
they aid with digestion and building immunities , and , believe it or not , keeping them is as important as avoiding their disease - causing germ cousins
the story of the germ is one of good versus bad , and the happy ending results from finding a balance in the approach to both
despite herculean efforts to keep baby 's environment clean , germs happen
most infants will have between six and eight respiratory infections ( colds , ear infections , bronchitis ) each year
the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) does n't think a child 's environment can be " too clean , " so do the best you can to police your collective space
@entity56 in the icky , dirty woods tips to keep your newborn germ - free since newborns have immature immune systems , every effort should be made to minimize their contact with bacteria and viruses that cause diseases
the big bad wolf has many friends , including respiratory syncytial virus , influenza , rotavirus , pertussis ( whooping cough ) and group b streptococcus
even though it is impossible to completely control a newborn 's environment , there are a few things that parents can do to limit a new baby 's exposure without making themselves nutty in the process
8 @entity82 hold all calls tell @entity84 with the runny nose to stay away ! it 's important to keep a young infant from anyone with symptoms of infection : fevers , sore throats , coughs , sniffles and sneezes
remind excited relatives and friends that the gift of keeping their germs to themselves trumps any teddy bear or romper set
clean team wash your hands
a 20 - second scrub with warm water and soap is the best prevention of spreading germs
it 's also the single most important thing a person caring for a newborn can do
so , scrub your hands every time before scooping up your little one ; ask others to always do the same
it 's especially important whenever you 've handled raw vegetables or meat , played with your pet , visited the bathroom or shaken someone 's hand
10 @entity121 smarter smooch - free zone we know , your baby is just so darn kissable
but for the love of germ prevention , keep the smooches away from her face
saliva and mucus are two hotbeds for germs , and avoiding big wet ones on the cheek is another defense in protecting her health
house arrest avoid grocery stores , restaurants , malls , festivals and other large crowds for the first few weeks
bypassing the adoring , baby - loving masses and their host of pathogens will help keep your little one sniffle - free
everything parents need to know about immunizations open mouth , insert germs the truth about toys , pets and play groups by the time baby 's immune system has strengthened ( with the help of recommended vaccines ) your kid has discovered his mouth
sadly , baby 's cravings for mommy 's keys do n't disappear quickly
in fact , putting things , including his soiled hands , in his mouth will continue into toddlerhood and is a normal way for baby to explore and learn about his world
however , it 's best to keep your little one from tasting too many dirty doodads , especially when they 've previously hit the pavement , another child 's mouth or @entity181 's doghouse
we know this is n't easy , especially since baby 's world has grown to include playgrounds , play dates and trips to grocery stores , banks and other germy wonderlands
so keep these guidelines in mind to help minimize the guesswork and baby 's overall germ exposure
10 @entity198 - tested hand - washing tricks wash up ! at about 8 to 12 months , teach your tot how to wash his hands
regular soap and water does the trick ( antibacterial types have not proven more effective )
get in the habit of washing baby 's hands before he eats ( including snacks ) and after diaper changes , visits to the playground , petting an animal or coughing , sneezing or wiping his nose
if soap and water are not available , alcohol - based gels or wipes will suffice
the trouble with toys to clean or not to clean ? most of the time , washing toys with soap and water and letting them air - dry every couple weeks is fine
but when there is a gaggle of kids manhandling baby 's toys ( or a play date with another drooly baby ) , the risk for bacteria rises
these times call for a regular household bleach wash ( one - quarter cup of household bleach to one gallon of water or one tablespoon of household bleach to one quart of water )
@entity242 , rinse thoroughly and air - dry the goods
@entity245 toys are germ magnets and are harder to clean , so you might want to put these away during the next play date
et tu , fido ? the @entity51 does not recommend pets for families with children under the age of 5 because of germs and a child 's immature judgment
but if @entity258 or @entity259 are already members of your crew , make sure their areas and toys are separate from where baby plays
( since reptiles and snakes frequently have salmonella , it 's best they not be anywhere near children
) shot in the arm ( or leg ) vaccinations are not just important for baby
make sure both parents and caregivers are up - to - date on their immunizations as well
most important are the influenza vaccine , which everyone older than 6 months should receive each fall , and the @entity283 ( tetanus , diphtheria and pertussis ) vaccine , which is given to adults as a booster every 10 years
consult your physician about when you 're due
@entity289 at night make - it - fun tip ! sing the alphabet song while you help baby wash his hands
the song is just long enough to get his tiny mitts squeaky clean
@entity297 the dirtiest places in a baby 's world ( from least to most ) * bed linens * @entity302 * shopping cart handles * playgrounds * carpets * @entity306 @entity297 magnet disinfect bath toys frequently or avoid buying ones that collect water and breed mold and bacteria
the five - second rule is a myth bacteria and salmonella can live up to a month on surfaces , and it takes less than five seconds for them to adhere to that juicy piece of peach that fell on the floor
so , sorry to say , it 's time to put the peach , and the five - second rule , in the trash
