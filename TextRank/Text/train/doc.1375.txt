-- truly , '' @entity1 '' is the gift that keeps on giving for the @entity3 , the nom de fake rap of " @entity6 " star @entity7 and his bffs , " snl " writer - directors @entity10 and @entity11
@entity0 : @entity7 to host @entity12
can he top @entity13 ? since that brilliant , indisputably instructive @entity21 satire first appeared in 2006 , the trio -- along with featured players like @entity16 , @entity17 , and a very game @entity19 -- has had remarkable success in the notoriously difficult genre of '' funny music , '' hitting a neat balance of parody and sweet - natured homage ( peppered with plenty of references to their respective junk )
now , two years after " @entity32 , " a debut that collected many of the group 's greatest , previously televised hits , comes " @entity38 , " a perfectly acceptibad follow - up
@entity0 : ' snl ' skit men @entity3 reveal new album cover , guests @entity19 , @entity16 , @entity42 and more on '' motherlover , '' honorary @entity43 returns for a deeply filthy , proudly @entity46 - y ode to '' pushing that way where you came out as a baby , '' while the triumphantly goofy '' @entity50 , '' with @entity51 , manages to be both outrageous and entirely plausible radio bait
@entity0 : @entity53 returns to ' snl ' after 20 years : best thing he did in between appearances ? @entity16 , @entity42 , a sleepy , maybe - not - in - on - the - joke @entity56 , and '' major cinephile '' @entity53 ( ! ) all make appearances -- but it 's the chameleonic core trio that truly surprises
at one point , over a classic , adrenalized hip - hop beat , @entity7 and @entity62 trade fierce criminology rhymes with a swagger that 's downright serious
until , of course , one notices the title : '' trouble on @entity68
