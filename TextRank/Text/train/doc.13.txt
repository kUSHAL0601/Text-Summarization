-- the outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness has spread to more passengers on a @entity6 cruise ship , with nearly 450 falling sick while at sea , the cruise company said tuesday
the @entity9 ship @entity10 departed @entity11 , @entity12 , february 15 and headed for the eastern @entity13 , according to a @entity9 statement
on the way , 419 of the 1,838 passengers fell ill , along with 27 of the 849 crew members , the cruise line said
the number of affected passengers increased from the 353 reported the day before
their symptoms included upset stomach , vomiting and diarrhea , @entity9 spokeswoman @entity21 said
guests who were in isolation while ill will receive compensation , she said
the sickened passengers and crew have been administered over-the - counter medicine and are responding well , @entity9 said
but it is still unclear how they became sick , @entity21 said
medical samples will be sent to a lab for testing tuesday , she added
the ship 's medical facility first started treating guests sunday , @entity21 said , and by monday , hundreds of others were sick , too , @entity9 reported
a doctor and two nurses joined the cruise medical staff monday to help with the overload of patients when the ship stopped in @entity47 , @entity48 , according to the statement
the ship does not return to @entity11 until friday and will be at sea until then , @entity21 said
to control the outbreak , the crew has stepped up cleaning of the ship , which is advised by the @entity55 when an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurs
@entity58 commonly causes viral gastrointestinal illness outbreaks on cruise ships , the @entity55 says
it can spread from contact with contaminated food or drink , by touching objects infected by people who are already sickened , or through close contact with people who are infected , according to the @entity55
so far this year , three gastrointestinal illness outbreaks have occurred on cruise ships that docked at a @entity6 port , according to the @entity55
norovirus was the cause of two outbreaks on the @entity10 in 2009 , the @entity55 reported
the outbreaks reported and investigated by the @entity55 infected at least 3 percent of the people onboard the cruises carrying at least 100 passengers for anytime between three days to three weeks .
