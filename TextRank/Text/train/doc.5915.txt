read more : behind the islands dispute @entity7 news agency @entity34 said that up to 100 fishing boats , escorted by 10 coast guard ships , were making the voyage to assert local fishermen 's rights to operate in the waters
it said the fishing boats came as close as three nautical miles to the islands before turning away
@entity43 , head of @entity7 's @entity44 , was quoted as saying the flotilla was " the biggest ever action " to support @entity7 's sovereignty over the islands
@entity34 said the island chain lies 100 nautical miles northeast of @entity7
earlier this month , the @entity3 government bought the disputed islands -- known as @entity52 in @entity3 and @entity52 in @entity22 and @entity7 -- from the @entity3 family that owned them for 2.05 billion yen ( us $ 26.2 million )
protests erupted across dozens of @entity22 cities , forcing the closure of a number of @entity3 businesses and factories as residents railed against anything representative of @entity3 or its people
interactive : disputed islands : who claims what ? while @entity7 , which @entity71 regards as a breakaway province , has long been a claimant in the @entity52 / @entity52 dispute , the self - governing island has seldom rigorously advanced its claims because of an unwillingness to risk its good relationship with @entity3 , said @entity78 , a strategic analyst at the @entity79 in @entity80
he said @entity7 's decision to become more assertive was a response to recent action taken by @entity22 and @entity3 , as well as concerns over access to fishing and marine resources
" under the @entity89 , you have to demonstrate an ongoing interest in the islands over a period of time
it rewards countries that assert their claims , " he said
@entity22 says its claim to the islands goes back hundreds of years
@entity3 says it saw no trace of @entity22 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity3 sovereign territory in 1895
@entity3 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers
the @entity3 surrender at the end of @entity111 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further
the islands were administered by the @entity115 occupation force after the war
but in 1972 , @entity117 returned them to @entity3 as part of its withdrawal from @entity121
@entity71 and @entity123 both claim they inherit @entity22 's historic sovereignty over the island
@entity7 is governed by the nationalist @entity127 party that fled to @entity7 after losing to @entity22 's communists in 1949
" the islands get subsumed in the long - running dialogue about reunification , " said @entity78
" it is one situation where strategic objectives are in sync
" @entity78 also said @entity7 's protest would be an unwanted complication for the @entity115 as it tries to strengthen its relationships in @entity139 to counter @entity22 's rising power
" it has two of its allies involved in disputes not only with @entity22 but also with each other over the same rock
" dangerous rocks : can both sides back off peacefully ?
