-- on wednesday , july 23 , the @entity1 executed @entity2 in the fourth visibly bungled execution this year
the execution began at 1:52 p.m. according to eyewitness @entity5 , " @entity2 was unconscious by 1:57 p.m. at about 2:05 , he started gasping
" he continued to gasp for over 90 minutes
afterward , eyewitness @entity6 reported , " @entity7 is dead , but it took him two hours to die
to watch a man lay there for an hour and 40 minutes gulping air , i can liken it to , if you catch a fish and throw it on the shore , the way the fish opens and closes its mouth
" @entity5 counted more than 640 gasps
@entity1 engaged in a failed experiment
its new execution protocol called for administration of two drugs , midazolam and hydromorphone
the only other time this drug combination had been used was the prolonged and similarly disturbing @entity29 execution of @entity30 , who took 24 minutes to die and struggled for air for 10 to 13 minutes
eyewitness @entity32 reported that @entity33 " gasped deeply
it was kind of a rattling , guttural sound
there was kind of a snorting through his nose
a couple of times , he definitely appeared to be choking
" faced with these well - documented problems , @entity1 adopted @entity29 's procedure but increased the amount of each drug ( from 10 milligrams to 50 milligrams for midazolam and from 40mg to 50mg for hydromorphone )
the state refused to reveal , however , its process for selecting the new doses or whether it conducted due diligence to determine that its protocol would be more effective
notwithstanding the changes @entity1 made to the drug formula , @entity2 's execution went even worse than @entity33 's
despite requests from @entity2 's lawyers , @entity1 also refused to reveal the source of its drugs -- including the manufacturer , lot number and expiration date -- and the qualifications of its execution team members
nothing about this information would compromise the identity of those participating in executions , but it would allow the courts and the public to analyze whether the execution procedures will work as intended and bring about death in a way that meets the requirements of the @entity79
@entity80 : are death penalty delays ' cruel and unusual ' ? four men -- @entity83 , @entity33 , @entity84 and @entity2 -- have been subjected to bungled executions this year
although the drugs , doses and other details of the procedures differed in each execution , the commonality between them is that the departments of corrections used experimental drug combinations and shielded crucial aspects of their practices in secrecy
even in the aftermath of the executions , the lack of transparency continues
while governors in both @entity105 and @entity1 have called for reviews of the problematic executions , no outside authorities have been brought in to conduct the investigations
@entity110 investigations are insufficient to the task
departments of corrections can not be allowed to provide pat explanations that leave central questions unanswered , minimize errors and hide relevant information about what went wrong
instead , there must be independent investigations of each execution that goes awry and thorough , public reporting of the results
without truly independent investigations , it will be impossible to make meaningful conclusions about what went wrong or to determine if changes can be made to ensure that the same errors do not happen again
chemical mix and human error lead to controversial executions the botched executions in @entity1 , @entity29 and @entity105 show us that when states are allowed to devise novel , untested execution protocols without judicial scrutiny or public oversight , the resulting procedures are unreliable
and when the unreliable procedures are implemented , the consequences are gruesome and horrific
states can not be allowed to continue carrying out death sentences without judicial review of their execution procedures
the courts must require departments of corrections to disclose key aspects of these procedures , particularly with respect to the provenance of the drugs used and the qualifications of the execution personnel
without this oversight , botched executions will become the new norm
no additional executions should proceed until the states act with transparency , and the courts scrutinize execution procedures to ensure that they comport with the @entity164 @entity163
join us on @entity167 / @entity166 .
