@entity2 @entity0 secretary of state @entity3 is threatening to ask courts to stop @entity7 @entity6 from running for the @entity7 presidential nomination and re-election to the @entity10 at the same time
" the law is clear
you ca n't be on the ballot twice for two offices , " @entity3 , the @entity12 who challenged soon - to - be senate majority leader @entity13 this fall , told @entity14 in @entity15
her comments came in @entity3 ' first interview after losing by 15 percentage points to @entity22
republicans in @entity0 are pushing to change the state law to allow @entity6 to appear on the ballot twice , but @entity26 who control the statehouse have objected
@entity3 said as the state 's chief election officer , she wo n't be " bullied " by @entity6
" we 'll look to the court for any guidance that is needed , " @entity3 said
" and at the end of the day , we 're not going to be bullied
i 've done my job as secretary of state for the people of @entity0 and i 'll continue to do that
" to challenge @entity6 in court , though , @entity3 would need to run for re-election as secretary of state in 2015 -- a decision she said she has n't made yet
@entity0 has several statewide offices on the ballot next year
state attorney general @entity45 is the only @entity12 who 's entered the race to replace outgoing gov. @entity47 , and @entity47 's son , @entity48 , is running for attorney general
@entity3 was coy in the interview with @entity14 when asked about her own future
" i 'm taking time to reflect with family and friends on what has been an amazing journey , " @entity3 said , " and , my hope is that i will continue to remain committed to the causes that i committed myself to over the course of this past year
