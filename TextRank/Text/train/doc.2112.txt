-- behind every great woman -- is another great woman
@entity4 ' success at last year 's @entity5 catapulted her to fame , fortune and glory
the first black woman of any nationality to win gold in the individual all - around gymnastics event , the teenager was hailed as the face of progress , an all - american star and the nation 's newest celebrity
but that is just the tip of a story which takes in divorce , financial peril , racism and a mother 's fight to give her daughter the opportunity she so badly craved
fighter @entity30 may not be as limber and supple as her teenage daughter , but nobody can doubt her strength
" my mom has influenced me so much , " @entity34 told @entity0 's " @entity36 " documentary
" she 's taught me how to be a fighter and i love her so much
i do n't know if this journey could be possible without her by my side supporting me
" @entity34 ' battle to become an @entity44 champion began at the age of six when she began to copy the moves of her older sister , @entity47
inspired by watching @entity48 , the first @entity49 gymnast to ever qualify and compete in an @entity44 , @entity34 set her heart on emulating her heroine
along with her mother , @entity48 provided another strong role model during a difficult childhood where @entity34 ' parents divorced and money was scarce
" i loved @entity48 , " @entity34 said of the 1996 @entity58 gold medalist
" we did a couple of events together and she 's just a such a joy to be around
she inspired me to do bigger and better things
" i find that funny now because i remember when i was younger and i looked up to my role models
but now the tables have turned and i 'm the role model
" i love girls , parents , whoever it may be , coming up to me and saying , ' you inspire my daughter
' " struggle the 17 - year - old is aware that life will never be the same following her performances in @entity77 -- having overcome difficult circumstances , she is now a bankable star
one of four children at home , her gymnastics was at the heart of the family , with her mom supporting her financially at every opportunity
even when @entity30 suffered a negative reaction to prescription medication and was forced to leave her job at a bank in 2009 , she managed to find a way to support her daughter
while @entity34 ' father @entity92 remained a stranger for much of her childhood , @entity30 was there when it mattered , especially once her daughter became a global superstar
but protecting @entity4 -- nicknamed " the @entity4 " due to her acrobatics -- from wider attention was quite a different proposition
in a world where social media presents an instant opportunity for people to make a judgment , @entity34 found out the hard way when @entity107 went berserk with criticism of her hair style
it was an episode which infuriated @entity30 , who was left bewildered by the abuse at her daughter
what it did do , however , was add further backing to @entity34 ' assertion that female gymnasts are at a far higher risk of criticism than their male counterparts every time they wander into the arena
strength " @entity125 women have to do a lot more than the men , " said @entity34 reflecting on the criticism
" we 've got our hair and makeup to do
the men can just go out there but we have to get ready
" when we 're looking spot - on nobody even notices
they just say , ' oh , she looks good , ' but when you look horrible then everyone is like , ' whoosh
' " you just handle it and be yourself
you do n't want to let people tear you down
you just kind of make a joke out of it , laugh at it
" there 's always the next time , always another awards show red carpet that we can look fabulous at
you 've just got to learn from it and be yourself ; do n't focus on the negative comments
i want to just focus on the positive
" the gold medals soon silenced those trolling @entity34 online , with her achievements transforming her from a potential star to a global superstar
but her journey to the very top was a long and often arduous route , taking @entity34 away from the comforts of home and family
from the age of eight , she trained at @entity165 in @entity166 -- a club which had provided the @entity125 national team with 10 members since 1995
so intense was her schedule that she was forced to undergo home schooling while her mother worked nights to provide extra funds for the tuition
it was there that she began to blossom , winning national titles and competing on the international stage as she began to show glimpses of what was to come
but @entity34 ' relationship with her coaches began to deteriorate following a wrist injury in 2009
mocked it was a tough time for the teenager , who in the past has spoken about how she was mercilessly mocked both for her appearance and her race by fellow teammates
the combination proved too much for both @entity34 and @entity30 , who decided that the future lay away from @entity166 and in @entity192 , @entity193
for the first time , @entity34 would be away from the woman who had inspired her and fought for her opportunity to pursue her dream
it was a difficult time for the youngster , who moved in with a host family in @entity193 -- the @entity203
" at first i was really excited , " @entity34 recalled
" i was ready to take on the journey but my mom and sister came with me for a week and when they left i was just miserable
" i was so sad leaving my family
i had a time where i said that i needed to suck it up and put on my big girl pants
" this was my decision
i knew i had to go to the gym and work very hard , because i think in the gym i was kind of giving up a little too
i decided to push myself
" dreams and push she did -- both mentally and physically , @entity34 began to reach the heights of which she had only dreamed years earlier
working under the gaze of @entity221 coach @entity220 , the man who helped @entity222 win gold at @entity224 in 2008 , @entity34 spent four to five hours in the gym every day
it was a grueling workload , with @entity34 adapting to the @entity221 method of coaching rather than the technique she picked up in her formative years in @entity166
" it is a bit different , but i love @entity220 's style , " she said
" he corrected my technique and the quality of my gymnastics , and him and his wife @entity238 have shaped me up into this amazing gymnast in a year and a half
" champion the hard work has certainly paid off
gold on the uneven bars at the 2010 @entity245 catapulted @entity34 into the limelight before she took silver in the beam at the @entity125 junior nationals
she was part of the @entity125 team which won gold at the @entity253 before a stellar 2012 placed her at the forefront of the national consciousness
four gold medals , one silver and one bronze all arrived within 12 months before @entity34 produced a magnificent exhibition at the @entity125 @entity261 to win the all - around competition
alongside @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 , @entity34 helped the @entity125 women 's team win gold in @entity77 -- the first time the nation had triumphed in female gymnastics since that team including @entity48 in 1996
the team , dubbed the " @entity273 , " brought a zest and flair to the @entity44 which captured the imagination of gymnastics fans not just in @entity77 but across the world
" we had this girl power , " @entity34 recalls
" we just said , ' let 's be sassy , ' and we bonded really well , meshed together and it was amazing
" i think people should definitely be paying attention to women 's sport because we can do a lot of things
" we 're very powerful , strong minded and whenever we want something , we go out there and fight
i definitely think people should pay more attention
" celebrity @entity34 has had no shortage of attention following those triumphs
now she is one of the most instantly recognizable figures in @entity125 sport , hosting awards nights , speaking at events for kids and modeling on the catwalk
sponsors have quickly realized the value of @entity34 ' success -- @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity309 are among the firms to have signed deals with her
" it 's very fun , " said @entity34 about her new - found lifestyle in front of the camera
" i love doing photo shoots and commercials , it 's really fun
they like to keep it exciting with a lot of energy
i have a blast doing all this stuff
" but with the whole fame thing , i just try to take it one step at a time
it can be difficult to handle everything at once with celebrity , the gym and school
" so when i 'm at school i think about school , when i 'm at the gym i think about the gym and when i 'm outside and traveling i think about that
i do n't like to cram myself with everything
" role model young she might be , but @entity34 is wise beyond her years
aware of her influence on her peers and younger following , she is as keen as ever to inspire those who seek to replicate her success
whether it be by hosting kids ' awards , motivational speaking or just taking time to sign autographs , this is one woman who is desperate to make a difference
" i have this platform and i love using it , " she added
" some girls or moms come up to me and say , ' you inspire my daughter , ' or ' @entity4 , you 've inspired me to do great things
' " i just want to help them believe in themselves and i want them to know that anything is possible if you set your mind to it
