@entity0 -- @entity5 leaders , the @entity6 and congressional @entity7 have agreed to limit the reach of a tax on high - end health insurance plans that would help pay for a proposed overhaul of the @entity14 health care system , union leaders involved in the talks said thursday
the proposed thresholds for taxing health plans will be raised from $ 23,000 to $ 24,000 for families and from $ 8,500 to $ 8,900 for individuals , @entity16 president @entity15 told reporters
dental and vision benefits wo n't be counted toward that amount after 2014 , he said
health plans covered by union contracts would not be subject to the 40 percent tax until 2018 -- a transition period union leaders said is comparable to those offered to other private insurers
the threshold for taxing other plans will be adjusted by 1 percent above the annual rate of inflation , and plans involving large numbers of women or the elderly will get breaks as well , @entity15 said
the changes will reduce the $ 150 billion expected to be raised over 10 years by about $ 60 billion , he said
and union plans would be able to enter the health care exchanges set up under the bill in 2017 , he said
the tax on what have been dubbed " @entity48 " health care plans is a key feature of the @entity51 health care bill , but it has drawn opposition from @entity7 in the @entity53 and from unions
president @entity55 , who has made health care his top priority in @entity58 , supports the excise tax as a way to contain the rise of health - care costs
@entity15 and other top union officials have held a series of talks at the @entity6 for the past three days as congressional negotiators tried to merge the two bills together
he warned earlier this week that congressional @entity7 candidates could risk losing labor 's support if the final bill included a tax on high - cost health plans
but he said that despite all - but - total @entity77 opposition in both houses of @entity58 , supporters of health care reform stood " on the threshold of a milestone
" " we do n't look at this as the end of our fight for real reform , but another step along the way in the quest for real reform , " @entity15 said
labor leaders said the changes they negotiated would help not only union members , who make up about 12 percent of the @entity14 work force , but all working families
but @entity94 , a spokesman for @entity51 @entity77 leader @entity95 , dismissed the plan as " a sweetheart deal
" " @entity14 are overwhelmingly opposed to this bill , " he said
" another sweetheart deal is n't going to turn that around
" a @entity102 poll released thursday found much stronger support for the financing plan in the @entity6 bill , which would impose a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on incomes higher than $ 500,000 for individuals or $ 1 million for couples
the survey found 61 percent of the public favors the @entity6 provision , while the @entity51 bill drew 29 percent support
@entity15 told reporters that leading @entity7 were behind the compromise
but house speaker @entity117 , @entity118 , said she had not seen anything in writing thursday evening
rep. @entity120 , @entity121 , a leading opponent of the excise tax , said the proposal was more fair than the current @entity51 bill
" however , the devil is in the details , and i will reserve judgment on any compromise until i have had the time to review the proposal , " he said in a written statement
@entity55 did not directly address the plan as he addressed reporters ahead of a @entity135 meeting thursday night
but he dared @entity77 to run in the november midterm elections on a platform of rolling back " something that @entity0 has been talking about since @entity139 was president
" " if @entity77 want to campaign against what we 've done by standing up for the status quo and for insurance companies over @entity14 families and businesses , that is a fight i want to have
if their best idea is to return to the bad policies and the bad ideas of yesterday , they are going to lose that argument
" @entity7 negotiators planned to return to the @entity6 late thursday
a senior leadership aide said @entity7 leaders and @entity6 officials want to send the bulk of the health care package to the nonpartisan @entity157 for a cost estimate soon -- even as soon as the end of this week
the aide said the controversial issues of abortion and immigration are not likely to be resolved by then , but because they would have no impact on the cost of the bill , negotiators could work out those details separately
@entity6 majority leader @entity168 , @entity169 , said negotiators are working to get agreement on the overall health care package by the end of this week
" that 's been the goal
but it 's a goal , it 's not a deadline , " @entity168 said
@entity1 's @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .
