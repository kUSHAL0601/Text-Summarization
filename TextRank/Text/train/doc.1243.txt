@entity0 -- the top @entity3 @entity2 on tuesday laid out a hard - line negotiating stance on upcoming budget battles , rejecting any tax increases and demanding " significant " reforms in exchange for his vote to raise the debt ceiling
" we 're going to require as a condition for raising the debt ceiling something really important about the debt , " senate minority leader @entity12 , @entity13 , told reporters
without providing specifics , @entity19 said it would take " something the markets would view as significant , something the @entity24 people would view as significant , something foreign countries would view as significant " in order for him to vote to increase how much the @entity24 can borrow
@entity30 must reach an agreement on the debt ceiling before the @entity24 reaches its legal borrowing limit of $ 14.29 trillion
@entity19 said the @entity33 has indicated the nation would reach its debt ceiling " sometime between @entity36 and the @entity37
" he called for " something real , something measurable " that will begin to reduce the national debt
@entity19 also made clear that he opposes generating more revenue through higher taxes to tackle the deficit and debt problems
" from my point of view , taxes are not on the table because we do n't have a revenue problem , we have a spending problem , " @entity19 said
@entity54 majority leader @entity53 , @entity55 , suggested mandatory caps on government spending and a balanced budget amendment as possible reforms to accompany a measure raising the debt ceiling
" we 're only talking about doing this if we can be assured there are guarantees in place that spending does n't get out of control again , " @entity53 said of allowing more borrowing by the federal government
a few minutes after @entity19 spoke , senate majority leader @entity70 , @entity71 , noted that @entity2 and @entity72 have widely differing views on how best to strengthen the nation 's fiscal situation
@entity70 accused republicans -- including @entity78 chairman @entity77 , @entity79 , who has released a 2012 budget proposal -- of seeking to protect the wealthy and their special interests
" the only thing @entity2 fought to protect were the richest of the rich , " @entity70 said of last week 's budget negotiations on a spending plan for the rest of the current fiscal year
" it is clear once again that the two parties ' priorities are significantly different , " @entity70 said of @entity77 's proposal , adding it would provide no help for the middle class
@entity94 , who is presenting his long - term debt reduction plan on wednesday , should address inequities in the tax code that benefit moneyed interests , @entity70 said , calling for a halt to subsidies for oil companies and deductions for companies that transfer jobs overseas
@entity70 also said additional revenue must be part of any long - range fiscal solution
he did n't give specifics , but @entity72 generally favor increasing the tax rate for families earning more than $ 250,000 a year to the levels of the 1990s , before tax cuts implemented by the @entity114 administration
in addition , @entity70 rejected the contention that reforming @entity117 must be part of deficit reduction strategy , saying : " that has nothing to do with the deficit
@entity117 has not contributed one penny to the deficit
" as @entity0 battles over spending cuts , the @entity33 reported tuesday that the deficit for the first six months of the 2011 fiscal year has reached $ 829.4 billion
according to the latest monthly figures from @entity33 , in march the federal government took in $ 150.9 billion , but outlays were $ 339 billion , for a monthly deficit of $ 188.2 billion
that 's slightly better than the $ 222.5 billion deficit in february , probably because the looming tax filing deadline increased receipts
sen. @entity136 , an independent from @entity137 who is part of the @entity72 caucus , said the deficit issue requires a comprehensive approach in which " everyone is going to have to take some loss
" " we ca n't keep spending a trillion and a half more every year than we 're bringing in , even though it 's hard now to say we have to cut these programs , " @entity136 said
" if we do n't begin to do that , and at some point think about raising taxes , the whole @entity24 economy will come close to collapse
" @entity1 's @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this story .
