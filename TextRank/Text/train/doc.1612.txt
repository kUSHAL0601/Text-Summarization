-- about 1,000 @entity2 soldiers will report for duty saturday in @entity4 , activated by the governor this week to help fight a drug - fueled crime tsunami that has flooded the @entity8 island
the military personnel will repair police cruisers and join local authorities on patrols in the most crime - ridden areas of @entity4 , mainly in poor parts of the commonwealth 's largest cities
one soldier will accompany a police officer on each patrol , said the @entity2 chief , maj. gen. @entity2
" the problem that exists now is that the police are short of personnel , " @entity2 said
" what we are going to do solely is to help them
first , we are going to help them with mechanics , provide them with more than 100 mechanics so that their fleet of patrol cars can go out on the street
once we have that , we are going to have joint preventive patrols
" you wo n't see military vehicles on the street
what you 'll see are police patrols on the street
" the soldiers will be deployed in @entity42 , the territory 's capital , and the cities of @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48
gov. @entity49 announced the call - up in his annual state of @entity4 speech monday night , saying the help is needed until more officers can be trained
he did not set a timetable
in a separate development , @entity49 announced tuesday that @entity58 attorney @entity57 had reached an agreement with the commonwealth 's @entity60 and @entity62 for federal prosecutors to have jurisdiction over a series of major crimes
@entity4 is an unincorporated territory of the @entity58 and more stringent federal @entity58 laws can apply
" to those who commit carjackings , " @entity49 said , " to those who provoke shootouts on our roads ... to sexual offenders who rob our children of our innocence , our message is clear : we 're going to impose on them the full weight of the federal law
we 're going to look for them , and we 're going to bring them to justice
" @entity84 said the agreement will streamline the prosecution of cases and allow federal agents immediate access to some crime scenes
" we feel very strongly about fighting crime , " she said thursday
" it 's much better to fight crime together
this is an additional crime - fighting measure
" by all measures , there 's much crime to fight
a 2010 threat assessment by a 15 - agency task force notes there were 68,738 violent crimes reported in 2008 , a 9.3 percent increase over the previous year
of the 13 major police areas in @entity4 , the municipality of @entity47 was the worst , with 16,590 violent crimes
homicides also showed a significant increase , with 807 killings reported in 2008 , the latest year for which statistics were available
that was a 10.5 percent increase over the previous year
homicides had already increased by 9.2 percent in 2007
@entity42 had the highest homicide rate in 2008 , with 177 slayings
@entity47 was second - highest , with 154 killings
as in many other parts of the world , authorities tie the crime jump to drugs
it 's very strong , " @entity84 told @entity0
a recent @entity62 report documented that more than 60 percent of the slayings on the island were directly related to drug trafficking
" drug - related violence is endemic in @entity4 , " said a 2009 analysis by the @entity60 's @entity125
" homicide rates typically rank among the highest in the @entity58 , and law enforcement officials report that most of these homicides are related to drug trafficking
[ drug - trafficking organizations ] and gangs frequently use intimidation , violence and murder to gain and retain control of retail drug markets in the region
" the largest gangs predominantly operate in public housing projects scattered throughout @entity42 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity48 , the 15 - agency threat assessment said
drug gangs also operate in lower - income neighborhoods where they feel less vulnerable to law enforcement
cocaine , crack - cocaine , marijuana , heroin and @entity151 are the drugs most widely trafficked , officials say
@entity4 is particularly vulnerable because of its location
" the @entity8 region remains a major transshipment area for cocaine and heroin shipments originating from @entity158 , transiting through @entity159 and destined to the @entity58 , @entity160 and @entity161 , " the multiagency report said
the criminals are well - financed and well - armed
" large - caliber assault type rifles such as @entity165 , m - 16s and various types of military carbines are the weapons of choice , " the report said
" in some instances , rifles recovered in the streets have been converted to fire in the fully automatic mode
the handguns of choice are glocks and @entity180 pistols converted to fire in the fully automatic mode , thus providing added fire power
" the @entity125 also notes that @entity4 " is a major money - laundering center for drug traffickers operating in the region
" although @entity4 officials did not mention it this week , there 's another reason for the @entity2 deployment
" public confidence in the [ @entity62 's ] ability to protect the citizenry remains low because of continued corruption within the department , " the @entity125 analysis said
" this situation has resulted in decreased cooperation between the public and the police department and has made it more difficult for police officers to deter crime and enforce the law
" consequently , it is likely that the crime rate in @entity4 will remain high and the drug situation will worsen in the next year as traffickers take advantage of a perceived law enforcement weakness
" @entity2 , the @entity2 general in charge , believes the military can help change that
" we are the beneficiaries of a [ good ] reputation and confidence on the part of the public , " he said in a published interview this week
" when we act , we act professionally
that will help us accomplish our objectives
" some @entity4 wonder whether the military can solve the problem
" it might help , " said @entity223 , owner of @entity224 in @entity225
he questioned whether some of the guard members are up to the task
" what do they do for a living , " he asked
" maybe they do n't have the knowledge to handle the situation like a policeman would
" no one seems to question that there 's a problem and that something needs to be done about it
@entity244 and her husband own @entity243 , a vacation rental cottage 45 minutes east of @entity42
" it does n't affect us personally because we live up in the mountains , " she said
" it 's mostly in the cities
" nonetheless , she and some neighbors are starting a crime - watch group
" is there crime ? yes , sure
that 's gone up , " @entity244 said
and the governor feels he has to act , she said
" i think @entity49 realizes that something has to get done about the violent crime , drug problems , and the police do n't seem to be able to get the problem under control , " said @entity244 , a @entity258 native who has lived in @entity4 for six years
" so if the @entity2 can help , i am happy he is trying something
" a few minutes later , she was not so sure
" i do n't think the @entity2 troops activation is the answer to the problem , but i guess it ca n't hurt , " she said @entity58 attorney @entity84 , a 32 - year veteran of the justice system , believes her office 's new powers will make a difference
" i have much hope , " she said
and if anything can make the situation better , she said , it 's intervention by federal authorities
" i am rich in satisfaction , " the prosecutor said
" the @entity58 has always taken care of @entity4
it 's a good father
