-- @entity2 security forces have been accused by a rights group of " systematically " torturing civilians from an ethnic minority in the conflict - stricken state of @entity8
@entity10 - based @entity9 released its report on the alleged torture of @entity8 civilians on monday , the third anniversary of the resumption of hostilities between government forces and ethnic @entity8 insurgents following a 17 year ceasefire
the report gathered testimony from 78 survivors and witnesses relating to the alleged torture of more than 60 victims by @entity2 's army , police and military intelligence service , since the resumption of fighting
@entity9 ' executive director @entity31 said the alleged victims were perceived to be aligned with the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , the ethnic rebel guerrilla force that has battled @entity2 's army for decades
the alleged abuse appeared to have been carried out with the consent of senior officers , he said
" the torture that we 've documented is not a secret practice , " he said
" when the police , the army or military intelligence are torturing @entity45 civilians , they 're not attempting to conceal it
they 're sending a very loud and clear message to the @entity8 population that any sort of sympathy for the @entity33 , or any activities with the @entity33 , will be dealt with very severely
" the report said torture was most often committed by government troops trying to obtain information on the strength and movements of @entity33 fighters
alleged victims reported being stabbed , beaten and having wire tied around their necks , hands and feet
other claims included that security forces had placed bamboo over their victims ' heads or shins , and jumped or stood on it
some were told to dig their own graves before being released , while others were made to lick their own blood off the ground following prolonged beatings , the report claimed
other alleged victims said they had been sexually abused while detained
@entity31 said the alleged abuses , which his group believed constituted war crimes , seemed to be being committed with impunity
" we 've documented such consistent practices across many different areas that would indicate that it is certainly a systematic practice and a widespread practice

" you are @entity45 , and we will kill all the @entity45 , " one victim claimed to have been told
many @entity8 are @entity99 , while @entity2 is a majority @entity104 country
@entity106 , a spokesman for @entity2 president @entity107 , said he had not seen that report , but rejected the allegations of torture , accusing @entity9 of " one - sided allegations
" " their report is not concrete evidence , " he said
" if they have concrete evidence , they can send it to the government and the government will investigate thoroughly and punish ( offenders ) if we find they 've committed these crimes
we 'll take action according to our laws
" he said @entity2 security forces would " never use torture as a weapon in the conflict areas , " and stressed that any individuals who did so would be in breach of government policy
" there may be some individuals who commit this crime , but it is not the policy of the military or the government , " he said
" you can not apply the individual action to the government policy
some @entity144 soldiers are making wrongdoing in @entity146 and @entity147 , but we should not say it is the policy of the @entity144 military or government

" if it 's not state policy , then they should demonstrate that by credibly investigating and prosecuting those that are responsible for these abuses , " he said
" but we 're not seeing that , and this has been going on for three years now
" @entity9 said it shared the concerns expressed by the @entity171 's @entity170 on human rights in @entity2 , @entity173 , over allegations the @entity33 uses child soldiers , forced labor and landmines
but the report 's authors had found no evidence of the @entity33 using torture
@entity2 has been wracked with internal conflict , with ethnic minorities seeking greater autonomy , since shortly after the country , then known as @entity2 , gained independence from @entity187 in 1948
the country 's quasi-civilian government , which replaced the military junta following sweeping reforms in 2011 , has been seeking a national ceasefire with 16 ethnic guerrilla forces
since the 17 - year ceasefire between the military and @entity33 forces crumbled in june 2011 , the two sides have held numerous peace talks , but fighting continues
the @entity171 says that more than 100,000 people have been displaced in @entity45 and the north of neighboring @entity202 , home to many @entity45 , since the violence resumed

@entity2 's civil society groups have also reported sexual violence against women in @entity45 areas since the resumption of fighting
the @entity236 said in a statement that recent attacks by the @entity2 army in @entity45 areas threw " strong doubt on the government 's sincerity towards the peace process
" citing recent cases of alleged rape by military forces , it called for tackling military sexual violence to be made a matter of priority during peace negotiations
