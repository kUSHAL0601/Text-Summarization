-- it has been a good week for @entity3 's @entity2
he netted a hat - trick against @entity5 in the @entity6 and got both goals saturday as @entity3 -- still without @entity8 -- beat @entity9 2 - 1 to move three points clear of idle @entity11 and five clear of arch - rival @entity12 in @entity13
@entity2 , who will be counted on by @entity14 at next year 's @entity15 on home soil , opened the scoring at the @entity18 from the penalty spot in the 30th minute and tapped home the close - range winner in the 69th against the @entity22
he was teed up by @entity23 , who latched on to @entity25 ' sumptuous chipped ball
@entity9 , promoted last season , stunned the locals when it leveled in the 48th minute through @entity29 's header from a corner
having clawed to within three points of @entity3 , @entity12 earlier slipped up when it drew 2 - 2 at @entity32
yet it could have been worse for @entity12 , who had defender @entity34 sent off for two bookable offenses before halftime and trailed 2 - 0
with blockbuster summer signing @entity38 substituted in the second half and @entity41 held in check -- he failed to score for the first time since the end of october -- @entity45 began the @entity12 comeback in first - half injury time
@entity48 headed home the equalizer in the 80th minute seconds after @entity52 's red card for the host
" the first 20 minutes were very good and it is incredible that we went 2 - 0 down and had 10 men , " @entity12 manager @entity54 told reporters
" we responded well but we suffered a lot
" we were showing quality and rhythm and we lost control after the first goal but we did show character and the right attitude to battle back
" @entity11 will move level on points with @entity3 if it beats @entity68 at home sunday
@entity70 increases lead @entity70 's 18 - match winning streak at home ended in midweek when it was upset by @entity75 in the @entity6 but @entity70 bounced back by beating @entity76 3 - 1 at the @entity77 on saturday
@entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 accounted for the @entity70 goals , although manager @entity82 was n't fully satisfied with the performance ahead of the @entity84 in @entity85
" the players had perhaps their holidays and @entity85 in their heads , " said @entity82
" we had a few problems in the second half , like we did against @entity91
we simply gave away too many balls
we have good players , but we have to stop such things happening
" @entity70 , which will conclude 2013 unbeaten in the @entity95 , went seven points ahead of @entity97 -- which plays fourth - last @entity98 on sunday -- and 12 ahead of @entity99
a late goal against @entity101 ensured @entity99 's progress to the second round of the @entity6 but challenging @entity70 in @entity104 now looks unlikely after a 2 - 2 draw at @entity106
@entity107 and @entity108 rescued a point for injury - hit @entity99 , which trailed 2 - 0 within 40 minutes
@entity110 remains the lone side in the division without a victory after it blew a three - goal lead and drew 3 - 3 at @entity116
in @entity120 , the big two of @entity118 and @entity119 both registered two - goal victories on the road -- over @entity123 and @entity124 , respectively
@entity118 leads @entity119 by two points atop the table
@entity70 's semifinal opponent at the @entity84 on tuesday will be @entity130 champion @entity128 , which beat @entity132 's @entity131 2 - 0
" we will now play against one of the best teams in the world , " said @entity134 manager @entity133
" you can lose 99 times every 100 times you play them , but you could win one
