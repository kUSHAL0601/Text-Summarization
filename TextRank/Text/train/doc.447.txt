-- for nearly three years , the hit @entity2 show " @entity7 " has captured the drama behind the scenes in the world of child beauty pageants
the tantrums were extreme , and the pre-show prep of spray tanning and eyebrow waxing seemed perhaps premature for little kids
but in the last few weeks , as footage of 3 - and 4 - year - olds dressed in overly adult costumes ( like @entity16 , complete with padded breasts , or @entity19 's streetwalker from " @entity20 " ) hit the airwaves , viewers and pageant skeptics have been expressing horror at an industry that is now accused of " sexualizing " young girls
" little girls are supposed to play with dolls , not be dolls , " @entity28 - based licensed clinical social worker @entity27 tells people in its new issue
he adds that the extremes parents go to in order to prepare their children for competition -- using padding , fake hair , flippers ( faux teeth ) and spray tans -- " causes the children tremendous confusion , wondering why they are not okay without those things
" now devoted pageant moms are speaking out in their own defense
@entity49 , who dressed her daughter @entity50 , 3 , as @entity19 , tells people the look was " tasteful and funny
" still , " if i knew there would be a reaction like this , i never would have used it , " @entity52 says
" next time , she 'll be dressed as an angel
" and @entity59 , whose daughter @entity60 has been featured on @entity61 , says unfair scrutiny has been placed on the pageant industry
" if this were a sport , no one would question it , " she says
" this is her sport
