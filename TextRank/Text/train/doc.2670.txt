-- on thursday in @entity4 , @entity3 secretary of defense @entity1 presided over a change of command ceremony during which adm. @entity7 handed over the reins of @entity9 to his successor , gen. @entity10
as @entity7 stepped down he observed , " we are in perilous times
" he pointed out that @entity12 are helping to fight the fast - growing @entity13 in @entity14 ; the @entity16 - linked @entity15 in the @entity17 ; the militant group @entity19 in @entity20 , and @entity16 and the @entity21 in the @entity24 - @entity23 region
@entity7 also said , " we are in the golden age of @entity26 " in which elements of the 67,000 men and women under his command have deployed to 92 countries
now , after more than 3Â½ decades working in the world of special operations , @entity7 , 58 , is retiring
in his next incarnation he will become chancellor of the @entity37
as @entity39 pointed out in his speech on thursday that celebrated @entity7 's storied career , no one has written @entity44 's full history , but if it ever was to be written it " would need to be heavily redacted " because so much of it took place in the " black " ( secret ) arena
" @entity52 " is the word you often hear about @entity44 in the special operations community
that 's in part because even as a three - star admiral , about once a month in @entity24 , @entity7 went out with his teams on risky snatch - and - grab missions
( his predecessor as the commander of @entity60 , gen. @entity61 , also went out regularly on such missions and is similarly held in the highest regard
) the book @entity39 pointed out in his thursday speech that @entity7 also has " literally written the book on @entity26
" indeed , @entity68 's 1995 book , " @entity69 , " is the standard text on the subject
it features lucid dissections of eight decisive special operations actions , ranging from the @entity76 forces who used midget submarines to badly damage the @entity79 , a key @entity81 battleship , in 1943 ; to the @entity81 rescue the same year of the @entity83 dictator @entity82 from his anti-fascist captors ; to the raid at @entity86 in 1976 that freed @entity89 hostages held in @entity90 by @entity92 terrorists
for his book , @entity7 interviewed many of the key participants in the raids that he examined , and he traveled to the sites of the operations
after a careful investigation of each raid , he identified six common principles that had made these operations a success : repetition , surprise , security , speed , simplicity and purpose
-- repetition meant frequent and realistic rehearsals so that the " friction " of actual battle was reduced
-- @entity113 meant catching the enemy entirely off guard ; for example , the @entity81 rescuers of @entity82 crash - landed gliders on a mountain near the hotel where the @entity122 leader was being held and rescued him without a shot being fired
-- @entity126 meant confining the knowledge of the operation to a small circle
-- @entity130 meant that " relative superiority " over the enemy needed to be achieved in the first few minutes of the attack , and that the entire mission should be completed in no more than a half - hour
-- @entity135 ensured that the goal of the operation was well understood by each of the soldiers involved -- " release the hostages " at @entity86
-- @entity141 meant that the soldiers were completely committed to the mission
but @entity7 's influence on " spec ops " goes far beyond just the book he wrote
@entity7 helped establish a curriculum at the @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity150
and after taking up a job in the @entity152 just weeks after 9/11 , he became one of the principal authors of the @entity157 administration 's counterterrorism strategy
during the @entity158 , @entity7 led the shadowy @entity159 , which tracked down @entity160 in december 2003
much of the public credit for @entity160 's capture went to conventional army units , but it was , in fact , the @entity26 forces under @entity7 's command who did much of the work to find the @entity14 dictator
rescue of @entity171 from the beginning of the @entity174 presidency , @entity7 has been the key to some of the most sensitive @entity3 military operations
on the sweltering evening of april 13 , 2009 , several hundred miles off the coast of @entity180 , as dusk deepened over the @entity182 , three shots rang out
all the bullets found their targets : three @entity180 pirates in a small , enclosed lifeboat bobbing on the darkening sea
for the previous five days the pirates had held hostage @entity171 , the @entity3 captain of the @entity191 container ship
president @entity174 had authorized the use of deadly force if @entity171 ' life was in danger
unbeknownst to the pirates , the @entity197 warship was shadowing them , and days earlier a contingent of @entity200 had parachuted at night into the ocean near the @entity197
the @entity200 had taken up positions on the fantail of the @entity197 and were carefully monitoring @entity171 and his captors
one of the pirates had just pointed his @entity206 at the @entity3 captain as if he were going to shoot him
that 's when the seal team commander on the @entity197 ordered his men to take out the pirates
three @entity200 sharpshooters fired simultaneously at the pirates from a distance of 30 yards in heaving seas at nightfall , killing them all
@entity174 called @entity7 , then the leader of @entity60 , to tell him , " great job
" the flawless rescue of capt. @entity219 was the first time that @entity174 -- only three months into his new job -- had been personally exposed to the capabilities of @entity3 's secretive @entity26 counterterrorism units , whose skills @entity174 would come to rely upon increasingly with each year of his presidency
how @entity226 was found it is , of course , the raid that killed @entity226 on may 2 , 2011 , that has ensured @entity44 's place in the history books as the architect of the operation
during the spring of 2011 @entity7 formulated the plan for the assault on the compound in @entity238 , @entity23 where @entity226 was believed to be hiding
the planning for the raid was deeply informed by the key principles he had laid out in " @entity69
" @entity7 explained , " it was a simple plan , carefully concealed , repeatedly rehearsed , and exercised with surprise , speed , and purpose
" following extensive realistic rehearsals of the raid in both @entity248 and @entity249 that included a full - scale model of the compound @entity226 was believed to be hiding in , @entity7 went to the @entity152 to give @entity174 his assessment of the plausibility of the mission
when he was outlining to the president and his war cabinet the planned @entity238 helicopter raid , @entity7 said , " in terms of difficulty , compared to what we 're doing on a nightly basis in @entity24 , what we 're doing in @entity14 , this is not among the most difficult missions technically
the difficult part is the sovereignty issue with @entity23 and flying for a long stretch of time over @entity23 airspace
" @entity174 knew that the intelligence regarding @entity226 's presence at the compound was always circumstantial , but the president had confidence that @entity7 and his men would be able to execute the mission successfully , whether the @entity16 leader was in fact at the @entity238 compound , or not
the night of the raid , when one of the stealth helicopters carrying a seal team crashed inside @entity226 's compound , @entity44 -- who was narrating the progress of the operation from his command post in @entity24 to the @entity152 -- did n't skip a beat , saying without altering his tone : " we will now be amending the mission
" around 15 minutes after the helicopter had crashed , on his audio feed , @entity7 heard a seal team member give the code word " @entity296
" each step of the operation had been labeled with a letter of the alphabet , and @entity301 meant that @entity226 was " secured
" @entity44 relayed the " @entity296 " to the @entity152
he assumed that meant @entity226 was now dead , but suddenly thought , " what if we captured him ? " so @entity7 asked the @entity200 ground force commander , " is he @entity308 [ enemy killed in action ] ? " a few seconds later , the answer came back : " @entity311 , @entity312
" then @entity44 announced to the @entity152 , " @entity312
" there were gasps in the situation room , but no whoops or high fives
the president quietly said , " we got him , we got him
" what 's next for special operations on thursday , @entity7 gave his final speech as the leader of @entity3 special operations
in his dress whites , the famously unflappable four - star admiral concluded , his voice quavering with emotion , " it has been the greatest honor of my life to lead the men and women of @entity9
" the @entity3 owes a real debt to @entity44 and to his wife , @entity334 , who , like many other military spouses , has also served her country stoically as her husband deployed repeatedly to war zones after 9/11
@entity7 's successor @entity340 , previously led the military 's elite and secretive @entity60 , which comprises units such as @entity344 and the @entity346 's @entity345
as a colonel , @entity10 led the unit that five weeks after the 9/11 attacks established the first @entity3 military base in @entity24 and is widely viewed as the right officer to succeed @entity7
as the @entity3 and its allies pivot away from the post- 9/11 conventional wars but still face threats from jihadist militants in countries in the @entity358 , @entity359 and @entity360 , @entity12 working " by , with and through " local militaries will be a key part of future @entity3 military operations
among his other legacies , @entity44 has put in place a @entity366 network , which in practice mean a small presence of @entity3 special operations and @entity371 personnel in dozens of countries around the world
the goal of that network is twofold : to be better positioned to respond to an immediate crisis , such as the attack on the @entity3 facility in @entity379 in 2012 , and also to build up the capacity of local militaries so they can keep the peace themselves .
