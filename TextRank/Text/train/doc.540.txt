-- it can not be denied that african - americans have made tremendous progress -- and one of the most significant factors that contributed to black success and survival has been our faith in @entity10
the manifestation of that faith is the religious community , which consists mostly of @entity15 churches that have produced positive spiritual , social , economic and political results for black @entity17
the question is whether black churches can continue to be the instruments of empowerment that they historically have been
perhaps an understanding of the emergence and prominence of the @entity26 church will offer some insight to the potential that these churches still possess
eighty - seven percent of african - americans report they are affiliated with a particular religious group , and 95 percent of those claim to be @entity33 , according to the 2007 @entity35 @entity34 conducted by the @entity36
belief in @entity10 , regular prayer , worship attendance and belief in life after death are some of the core beliefs of a large majority of african - americans
although the expressions of faith and religious practices might differ , religious faith itself is a constant in black @entity17
the @entity26 religious experience is a result of a convergence of @entity26 culture , biblical hermeneutic and social resistance , woven into institutions
the common threads among the culturally diverse @entity26 slaves in @entity17 were communal living , extended families , cultural leadership and a deeply rooted appreciation for spirituality
enslaved @entity66 were exposed to the literature of the @entity68 , and they found comfort and direction in the same book that was used to justify their enslavement
slaves met the indignities and injustices that denied them their humanity with the same resistance that humans throughout history have shown oppression
religion in general and @entity15 in particular became an answer to the mysteries of the cosmos and a way to cope : only a belief in an unseen power and a faith in a divine advocate could sustain a people who faced such daunting circumstances
when the highest court in the land relegates one 's race to subhuman status as a matter of law -- which the @entity99 did in the @entity101 decision of 1857 -- people need a source of authenticity for their identity
that source for african - americans was the @entity68 , who had sent @entity107 to lead the slaves out of slavery and who had sent his son to preach " good news to the poor and set the captives free
" but that cultural background within @entity15 translated into an ecclesiology that not only nurtured the development of the black churches , but also conferred upon black clergy a status that has been akin to royalty
although the role of professional clergy in the @entity125 church at large was viewed as a vocation , @entity26 - @entity35 tended to treat their clergy as more than just employees of the church -- they were royal tribal leaders for the community
so the separation between the sacred and the secular , the religious and the political , has not been as distinct among african - americans
the clergy had to be advocates for justice , arbiters of internal disputes within the community and managers of sacramental affairs , all in one
and the churches themselves had to be more than places to learn about and worship @entity10
in a segregated society , church was the place where people fulfilled their human potential , developed their @entity10 - given talents , made corporate decisions , voted for their officers , owned property , created benevolent societies , raised money for schools and scholarships , celebrated their marriages , blessed their babies , mourned their loved ones ' deaths and even learned how to read
when states passed laws making it illegal to teach black people to read , many learned in church
even people with little faith had great respect and admiration for the church , if for no other reason than it was a " surrogate world " for black people , as @entity175 noted in his book , " @entity177 in @entity17 , " in 1963
the worship styles , doctrinal distinctions and organizational structures are so diverse that it is really a misnomer to refer to " the " black church
many black churches make up the black religious experience
what is irrefutable is that without a deep and authentic faith and a passion for the institutional development of that faith , @entity26 - @entity35 could have never sustained the fortitude necessary to survive and succeed in the @entity26 experience
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the rev. @entity196 , @entity197
