@entity1 's prime minister @entity0 is betting that the snap elections that he has called this month will bolster support for the sweeping economic reforms he has introduced since taking power in 2012
but if the gripes of small business owners like vegetable seller @entity8 are any gauge , @entity0 will have his work cut out
@entity8 has turned off some of the lights in his @entity14 store to save on electricity after his bills rose 30 % in a year , and he says his customers are in no mood to spend
" the money will trickle down from big corporations , according to prime minister @entity0 , " he says
" where is it ? it has not reached to the people who work hard every day on the ground
" economic woes @entity0 is painting the december 14 election as a referendum on his economic policies , the much - vaunted " three arrows " of " @entity32 , " the stimulus and economic reform package upon which the leader has staked his reputation
an unexpected dip into recession has dealt his flagship economic policies a blow , however , prompting the snap election
almost half of voters polled for two recent opinion surveys said that the economy and jobs were the main issues for them
" the election will be held to ask the public whether we will ( move ) forward with @entity32 or end it , " @entity0 said when announcing the closure of parliament
campaigning for the 475 seats of the lower house of parliament that are up for grabs starts on tuesday and polls put support for the ruling @entity59 ( @entity59 ) around 30 % , and between 10 % and 13 % for the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , the main opposition party
the @entity59 has been enormously successful in the postwar years , essentially having remained in power since 1955
during this period , the @entity60 have only governed twice , briefly in the 1990s and again from 2009 to 2012
strange timing an election was n't required until late 2016 , which has led to considerable speculation as to why @entity0 , with a sizable majority in the lower house -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early
@entity73 @entity72 , analyst and founder of @entity75 , a @entity76 - based government policy consultancy , told @entity77 he found the timing " puzzling
" " why call an election when you have such a dominant position ? " indeed , polls suggest that a majority of the public do n't understand why @entity0 is calling an election at this time , and are critical of the cost during another period of recession
voter turnout is expected to be low
" there is a mental malaise in @entity1 which is responsible for the economic malaise ( of the post-economic bubble years ) , " @entity72 said
one rationale for the election is that @entity0 is simply consolidating his position before " news gets worse , " says @entity97 , director of @entity98 at @entity99
the opposition is weak , and in disarray , he says , and now is an ideal opportunity to " lock in a two year extension " to the prime minister 's majority in the @entity1 's parliament
" there 's no great time ( to hold an election ) , " @entity97 told @entity77
" this is the least - worst time
" @entity111 : @entity1 voters to give verdict on @entity32 place in the world while the election is being framed largely in economic terms , @entity1 voters have plenty of other concerns , including the country 's energy policy
the ruling party is in favor of restarting the country 's nuclear reactors -- which were mothballed in the wake of the @entity127 nuclear disaster
local city assemblymen voted in october to fire up two reactors at the @entity131 power plant in @entity132 in @entity1 's south
and @entity1 are reflecting on their place in the world after @entity0 earlier this year issued a re-interpretation of @entity1 's pacifist constitution to allow for a greater degree of self - defence
hardline approaches toward @entity141 traditionally appeal to @entity1 's voters , and tensions over maritime territorial disputes with neighbor @entity141 have intensified in recent years
the role of women in public and corporate life is also under scrutiny
the @entity150 , a conservative newspaper , estimates that only 184 female candidates will run in the december 14 election , about 16 % of the total
@entity0 says that he has long championed women in the workplace , but as traditions die hard in conservative @entity1 , the number of married women with children and jobs remains low
@entity161 ultimately , @entity0 's election gamble will only pay off if he can convince the average salaryman or woman that his economic policies will benefit ordinary @entity1
while a key component of @entity32 has been extra government spending , a sales tax hike this year and rising costs have taken their toll on small businesses and their customers
in a bit to boost his election fortunes , @entity0 delayed a sales tax hike planned for october 2015
his special adviser on economic affairs @entity176 , has called for a further $ 25 billion in cash handouts and tax cuts to kickstart the economy
but it 's not clear whether this will be enough to satisfy voters
" @entity32 is no good at all , " said @entity184 , the fourth - generation owner of a 100 year - old tofu shop owner in @entity76 , who is finding recent economic conditions a threat to his livelihood
" our life is getting tough
