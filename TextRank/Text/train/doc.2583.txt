-- the former head of intelligence of @entity3 was shot dead in the capital late sunday , hours after the peaceful conclusion of the country 's presidential elections
col. @entity9 was shot seven times , officials said
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack , and authorities did not have a motive , said interior minister @entity16
@entity9 served as the country 's intelligence chief during a time when many key political figures were assassinated , including a high - ranking parliamentarian and an independent presidential candidate
he was overthrown along with then - army chief of staff @entity23 in a mutiny in april 2010
both were jailed briefly but later released , and no charges were filed
meanwhile , elections were held without incident sunday in the west @entity30 nation , with nine candidates vying for the seat of the president
about 180 international observers oversaw the voting
the elections were triggered by the january death of president @entity37 at age 64 after a long illness
@entity37 became president in september 2009 , months after the assassination of president @entity42
@entity3 's history has been marked by military coups and attempted coups since the nation of 1.6 million gained independence from @entity48 in 1974
those conflicts ravaged the nation 's infrastructure and economy and left it among the poorest in the world
despite @entity56 's coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election , his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country 's military and political leadership
to date , no democratically - elected president has served a full , five - year term
@entity3 will announce the results of sunday 's elections in about a week .
