-- a candidate for the @entity3 chairmanship said friday the cd he sent committee members for @entity6 -- which included a song titled " @entity8 " -- was clearly intended as a joke
the title of the song about president - elect @entity12 was drawn from a @entity14 column
" i think most people recognize political satire when they see it , " @entity17 @entity16 @entity15 told @entity0
" i think @entity3 members understand that
" the song , set to the tune of " @entity24 , " was first played on conservative political commentator @entity26 's radio show in 2007
its title was drawn from a @entity14 column that suggested president - elect @entity12 appealed to those who feel guilty about the nation 's history of mistreatment of @entity34
@entity15 said the song , penned by his longtime friend @entity36 , should be easily recognized as satire directed at the @entity14
the cd sent to @entity3 members , first reported by @entity38 on friday , is titled " we hate the @entity43 " and also includes songs referencing former presidential candidate @entity40 and the rev. @entity41 , among other targets
according to @entity38 , other song titles , some of which were in bold font , were : " @entity48 , " " @entity41 place , wrong pastor , " " @entity51 # 9 , " " @entity52 and @entity53 " and " @entity54
" @entity15 was national campaign manager for former @entity57 gov. @entity56 's presidential bid in 2007 and 2008
before that , he held a variety of posts , including a number of positions under former sen. @entity63 of @entity17 .
