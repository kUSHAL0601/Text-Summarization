@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 and secretary of state @entity4 declared the @entity3 leader 's visit to the @entity7 this week a success , saying on thursday that it had helped strengthen the partnership between @entity0 and @entity11 at a critical point in the war against @entity15 and @entity16 extremists
they also stressed that president @entity19 's july 2011 deadline to start withdrawing @entity7 forces from @entity3 did not represent a weakening of @entity7 's commitment to the war - torn @entity24 republic
the two leaders spoke at the @entity27 in @entity0 -- part of what became a week of playing down tensions between @entity7 and @entity3 officials
" from our side , this was a highly successful visit [ that ] took our relationship to an even higher level , " @entity32 said
" we are building a very strong partnership that links together all levels of our governments
" @entity32 said there is no contradiction between the july 2011 withdrawal date and @entity19 administration promises of an " enduring partnership
" @entity11 residents : @entity2 needs to make jobs , not war the date is meant to be " the beginning of the security transition , " she said
but " we 're not going anywhere
" the @entity7 government will be supporting @entity3 's war against extremist elements " far into the future , " she said
@entity2 said his highly anticipated @entity7 trip had been " meaningful , substantive , and had all the right tones and objectives
" the july 2011 date does n't pose a problem , he said , because " we know the @entity7 will not abandon the cause
" on another topic , @entity32 said the expected @entity67 offensive in the southern @entity3 province of @entity69 this summer would not be a " massive assault
" " @entity76 is not coming to @entity69 , " @entity32 said , adding that " @entity69 is not @entity71 , " the area of the last major @entity67 offensive that rooted out the @entity15 from the area to empower a government presence
@entity69 , @entity32 said , is an active area where " people are getting on with their lives
" therefore , she said , the goal of the upcoming operation is to " weed out " members of the @entity15 who are intimidating the people who live there
" they do n't pose a threat , " @entity32 said of the @entity15 presence in the province
" they are not going to take over @entity69 , but their presence has a chilling effect
" @entity2 acknowledged there had been a misunderstanding among the @entity3 people about the operation , which was clarified this week during his talks in @entity0
@entity2 also spoke of his plan for reintegration of thousands of @entity15 , whom he called " country boys " who are " ideologically not against us " and do n't hate the @entity7
on the other hand , he said , political reconciliation with @entity15 leadership would be much more difficult and far off in the future , requiring @entity108 's involvement because many @entity15 live there
@entity2 also said he raised the issue of his brother , @entity111 , with president @entity19 , amid reports that @entity111 was heavily involved in the drug trade
@entity2 said he lacked the authority to fire his brother , who is an elected official , but added without elaborating that the issue was resolved to @entity0 's satisfaction
@entity32 declined to comment about @entity118
earlier in the day , @entity2 paid tribute to @entity7 military members killed in the nearly nine - year @entity7 war in his nation , visiting the grave sites of @entity3 war veterans at @entity125 in @entity126
@entity2 slowly walked past several markers -- part of what has been called the " saddest acre in @entity7 " -- under a cloudy sky
he was joined by secretary of defense @entity132 , @entity134 chairman adm. @entity133 and gen. @entity135 , commander of the @entity7 forces in @entity3
the group visited @entity138 of the cemetery , the burial ground for personnel killed in @entity3 and @entity142
more than 500 veterans are buried there
@entity2 stopped at the grave site of @entity146
@entity147 , who was killed in june 2006
he also paused at the graves of army specialist @entity149 , killed in december 2006 , and @entity151 capt. @entity150 , killed in august 2009
@entity2 has repeatedly expressed thanks this week to the @entity7 people for the sacrifices they have made in his country
he has said @entity3 will remain a dependable partner with the @entity7 and its allies in the global war on terrorism
the two governments have been using the week to portray their sometimes tempestuous relationship as a largely friendly one , paving the way for greater progress in the war against the @entity15 and other extremists
after meeting with @entity2 on tuesday , @entity32 conceded that " we will have disagreements time to time , but that is a sign of a mature relationship and a steady relationship
" @entity32 said it is unrealistic to expect the two nations to see eye - to - eye on every issue
" president @entity19 and president @entity2 both understand that the ability to disagree on issues of importance is not an obstacle to achieving our shared objectives , but rather it reflects a level of trust , " she said
sandwiched between sessions with @entity32 , @entity2 huddled with @entity19 at the @entity188 on wednesday
@entity19 said he is confident his administration will meet the 2011 withdrawal date , but warned that there is " going to be some hard fighting " in the months ahead
he stressed that the @entity7 is in @entity3 for the long haul
" this is a long - term partnership , " he said
" we are not suddenly , as of july 2011 , finished with @entity3
" meanwhile , @entity2 defended his recent meeting with @entity198 president @entity197 , noting that while @entity3 is " a partner and friend " of the @entity7 , it also wants to " remain friendly " with its neighbors
the @entity0 meeting -- @entity2 's first visit to @entity0 after his re-election -- came after some recent well - publicized spats between @entity0 and @entity11
@entity2 's win in last august 's national vote was marred by irregularities that forced a runoff
since then , the @entity19 administration has publicly pressured @entity2 to rid his government of graft and improve delivery of services to the @entity3 people
@entity2 irritated @entity7 officials when he blamed election fraud on foreigners who want a " puppet government " in @entity3
he further aggravated his most powerful ally when he told tribal leaders that the @entity7 - led military alliance would not move against @entity15 fighters in @entity69 " until you say we can
" media reports have also included harsh criticism of @entity2 by a former @entity229 diplomat as well as claims that @entity2 said he would consider joining the @entity15 insurgency
at one point , the @entity188 indicated it would call off this week 's visit
but in recent weeks , the two governments have sought to play down their differences , rejecting the idea of any dispute between their leaders
@entity19 said wednesday that reports of heightened tensions between the @entity7 and @entity3 governments " were simply overstated
" tensions are virtually inevitable in " such a complicated and difficult environment , " he said
but " our job is to be a good friend and to be frank with president @entity2
" @entity2 's role , in turn , is partly to ensure @entity3 sovereignty is respected , he said
" i am very comfortable with the strong effort that president @entity2 has made so far , " @entity19 said
" there are going to be setbacks " and disagreements , but " we share a broad strategy " that can hopefully be set out " in a declaration by the end of this year
" @entity2 , in turn , said the @entity7 - @entity3 relationship is " strong and well - rooted
" there are moments that " we speak frankly to each other , " but those exchanges only strengthen the relationship , he said
@entity19 and @entity2 said they discussed , among other things , the need for greater protection of @entity3 civilians in light of the stronger @entity7 military campaign
@entity2 said a recent decision to transfer local detention centers to @entity3 government control was a " major point of progress
" @entity1 's @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .
