-- people traveling early for @entity2 in the center of the country will be dashing through the snow and the rain and the wind
the first major storm of the season has prompted the @entity10 to issue a blizzard warning for a huge swath of the @entity13 stretching from eastern @entity14 to @entity17 's @entity16 shoreline , including virtually all of @entity18
the declaration warns of snow accumulations of up to 12 inches , complemented by 25 - to 35 - mph winds that will occasionally gust to 45 to 50 mph
a 156 - mile stretch of @entity23 between @entity24 and the @entity26 state line was closed in both directions for a time wednesday
the westbound side reopened about 7 p.m. mt , but the eastbound lanes remained closed
@entity31 , in east - central @entity14 , reported a 67 - mph wind gust with zero visibility just after 2 p.m. mt , @entity0 meteorologist @entity30 said
@entity35 was closed for 65 miles in the @entity31 region , @entity14 's @entity34 reported
" most of the storm is on its way out across the state , except for the @entity44 , where there are still high winds , blizzard conditions , and highway closures , " the department 's @entity38 page said
" whiteout conditions are likely and travel could become impossible " wednesday night and into thursday , the service 's @entity50 , @entity51 , office warned
is the storm hitting you ? send images to @entity57 " far southeast @entity51 and extreme southwest @entity18 could see rain or a wintry mix for several hours yet this evening , so blizzard conditions may not develop over that area until mid-evening or later , " the service said
airlines were reporting relatively few cancellations or delays in areas affected by the storm wednesday night , but that could change overnight
the storm will race into western @entity70 , the weather service said
rain will quickly change over to snow as the storm advances northeast , with the heaviest snow occurring overnight
" @entity77 drifts several feet deep will be possible given the strong winds , " the blizzard warning states
at least 17 people were sent to hospitals near @entity82 , @entity83 , after a 23 - vehicle chain - reaction crash on @entity23 27 north of @entity85 , @entity83 , state safety officials told @entity0
there was at least one fatality , said @entity88 , emergency management coordinator of @entity89
a stretch of the freeway in @entity89 remains closed indefinitely
wrapping around the blizzard warning on the north , south and east is a winter storm warning , which will be no picnic either
the winds wo n't be quite as strong , but residents should expect a strong dose of rain , sleet and snow , with a few hail - packing thunderstorms thrown in for good measure
a winter weather advisory is in effect for the @entity107 - @entity106 - @entity16 tri-state area , as well as central @entity108 and @entity26
the " intense cyclone " will crawl across the @entity110 region thursday and slog into northern @entity111 by friday evening , the @entity10 predicted
dodging the heavy precipitation but not the high winds is an area from western @entity83 and eastern @entity116 through the @entity117 and into southwest @entity26
much of the @entity119 and @entity118 is extremely dry , and the high winds have kicked up blinding dust near @entity82 , @entity83
@entity0 's @entity122 and @entity123 contributed to this report .
