-- if masculinity could take the form of a 2 - inch frosted cupcake , @entity1 would have the recipe
his @entity7 cupcake company , @entity6 , is an anomaly in a world seemingly dominated by all things dainty and cute
@entity1 refuses to serve the " frilly , pink - frosted , sprinkles - and - unicorns " variety
instead , customers can proclaim their machismo with cakes made with beer , whiskey , bacon and crushed pretzels
" it was born out of necessity and a love of buttercream , " @entity1 said of his 9 - month - old business
each @entity26 cupcake sits under a generous layer of frosting and a chocolate disc with a camouflage , wood grain , plaid , houndstooth or other " manly " pattern
like a mixed - martial arts fight , @entity1 's cupcakes can pack a serious punch
six of his 12 varieties feature alcohol -- and customers feel the hit
" the ones with alcohol are actually pretty potent , " said @entity43 , who ordered @entity44 as a joke for the men and women in his advertising agency
" the first one i tried ... it had wood grain on it
it definitely had whiskey in it , " @entity43 said
" i think we all got a buzz from these -- it was pretty strong ! " but can whiskey - infused cupcakes disguised in camo really transform cupcakes into macho fare ? " i think if you try them , you would n't have to ask , " @entity43 said
@entity1 said he does n't think the average man would necessarily turn down a pastel , ladylike cupcake
" men like to eat , " he said
" i 'm not saying i 'm not going to go for a cupcake with a peony on it
" but , if given the option , " a guy is going to go for the one that has camo or plaid on it
" the flour - and - frosting world seems a far cry from @entity82 , home to a major law firm where @entity1 worked as an asset - backed securities attorney
but like many in 2007 and 2008 , @entity1 's career caved unexpectedly
" i was laid off
i did n't know what i was going to do , " he said
" i 'm 40 years old , i have student loans out the wazoo
what am i going to do ? " as @entity1 looked around the streets of @entity7 and mulled his options , he marveled how the city 's vast array of bakeries and cupcake shops kept growing and making money during a recession
but all the cupcakes seemed too cookie - cutter
" there 's been a vacancy in the market with marketing toward men , " he noticed
that 's when the epiphany hit
@entity1 liquidated his 401 ( k ) and gambled $ 25,000 on the macho bakery of his dreams
@entity6 went from selling 40 cupcakes a week to 400 cupcakes a week -- all without a storefront
the bakery operates out of a commercial kitchen shared with other businesses and sells its manly confections online
while most cupcakes are , stereotypically , feminine or frilly , @entity1 is keenly aware that he himself is playing on stereotypes with his use of bacon , beer and in - your - face manly advertising
" it 's so tongue - in - cheek , " @entity1 said
ironically , 95 percent of @entity6 's customers are women
@entity1 said many are searching for creative gifts after exhausting cliche ideas such as neckties
@entity1 has received order requests from around the world , including from troops in @entity136 and @entity137
@entity138 tried to place an order for her husband , who is stationed in @entity141
@entity138 said the @entity26 baked goods would be the perfect pick - me - up for soldiers overseas
" the stuff we send them , it means a lot to them , " @entity138 said
" we can send them care packages and everything , but something like that is so much more special because it 's so unique
we ca n't do the flavorings like rum and coke
we ca n't figure out how to make them taste like rum and coke
" @entity6 delivers to @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , but does not ship out - of - state
@entity1 said his growth is limited by storage and oven space , but he hopes to start shipping orders outside @entity7 by the end of this year
@entity1 does n't have a target date for setting up a storefront
but @entity43 , a loyal fan of the " tailgate " cupcake , says he can already forecast the entrepreneur 's future : " i think he would see a line of big , hairy men waiting in line for cupcakes
