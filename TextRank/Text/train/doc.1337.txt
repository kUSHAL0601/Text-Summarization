president @entity0 said wednesday that the world set a red line against chemical weapons use that he now seeks to apply to @entity4 , while a @entity6 committee approved a resolution authorizing the @entity9 military attack that he is planning
by a 10 - 7 vote , the @entity11 passed the resolution that authorizes a limited military response , giving @entity0 an initial victory in his push to win congressional approval
the measure now goes to the full @entity6 for debate next week
the @entity20 - led chamber is expected to pass it , but the outcome is less clear in the @entity24 - led @entity23 where top diplomatic and military officials made their case on wednesday for action
@entity31 , tea party libertarians and moderates from both sides questioned secretary of state @entity33 , defense secretary @entity34 and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity35 about whether limited military attacks can change anything and if they will lead to @entity9 involvement in another war
" what are the chances of escalation ? are different scenarios accounted for ? if our credibility is on the line now as is argued what about if @entity51 retaliates ? " asked @entity24 rep. @entity44 of @entity45 , the chairman of the @entity46
in @entity52 on the first of a three - day overseas trip that includes the @entity56 summit in @entity57 , @entity0 told reporters that the red line he spoke of last year regarding @entity4 's use of chemical weapons came from international treaties and past congressional action , rather than something he " made up
" @entity0 also insisted he had the authority to order attacks -- expected to be cruise missile strikes on @entity4 military command targets -- even if @entity69 rejects his request for authorization
@entity9 " recognizes that if the international community fails to maintain certain norms , standards , laws , governing how countries interact and how people are treated , that over time this world becomes less safe , " @entity0 said
" it becomes more dangerous not only for those people who are subjected to these horrible crimes , but to all of humanity
" he cited @entity83 as an example , saying " the people of @entity86 are certainly familiar with what happens when the international community finds excuses not to act
" at the same time , " as commander in chief , i always preserve the right and the responsibility to act on behalf of @entity9 's national security , " @entity0 said
conservative critics have said @entity0 painted himself into a corner with his statement last year that @entity4 's use of chemical weapons was a red line that would change his approach to its civil war
@entity0 : it is the world 's red line " a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized , " @entity0 said in august 2012
" that would change my calculus
" now , critics on the right say , he must respond to an alleged chemical weapons attack outside @entity113 by the @entity4 regime that @entity33 said killed more than 1,400 people or lose credibility
the administration and top congressional leaders attempted to blunt that criticism on tuesday during debate on @entity121
even @entity23 majority leader @entity122 , the chamber 's no. 2 @entity24 , said any president would have drawn that red line based on international norms
@entity0 made that same argument on wednesday , saying : " i did n't set a red line
the world set a red line
" " the world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world 's population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use , even when countries are engaged in war , " he said at a joint news conference with @entity52 prime minister @entity133 on the first day of a four - day trip that includes the @entity56 summit in @entity57
" @entity69 set a red line when it ratified that treaty , " @entity0 continued
" @entity69 set a red line when it indicated that in a piece of legislation entitled the ' @entity152 ' that some of the horrendous things that are happening on the ground there need to be answered for
" sounding exasperated , @entity0 added : " that was n't something i just kind of made up
i did n't pluck it out of thin air
there 's a reason for it
" @entity0 prods international community to act asked about whether he was seeking to save face , @entity0 insisted that " my credibility is not on the line -- the international community 's credibility is on the line
" he framed the question for the @entity173 and the global community at large as : " are we going to try to find a reason not to act ? and if that 's the case , then i think the ( world ) community should admit it
" opposition by @entity57 , a @entity4 ally , has scuttled @entity9 and @entity183 efforts to get the @entity184 to authorize a military response against @entity4 president @entity51 's regime
@entity173 inspectors returned from @entity4 last week from their mission to confirm if chemical weapons were used , but @entity33 said wednesday it would take three weeks for samples collected to analyzed and results announced
" i respect the @entity173 process , " @entity0 said while standing next to @entity133 , who opposes military intervention without @entity173 approval
" we agree that the international community can not be silent , " @entity0 added , saying also that the @entity173 investigators had done " heroic work
" noting the @entity173 team 's mandate was only to determine the use of chemical weapons , and not identify who used them , @entity0 repeated past statements that @entity9 intelligence has confirmed chemical weapons use beyond any reasonable doubt and has further confirmed that @entity51 's regime " was the source
" " i do think that we have to act , because if we do n't , we are effectively saying that even though we may condemn it and issue resolutions and so forth and so on , somebody who is not shamed by resolutions can continue to act with impunity , " @entity0 said
international norms then " begin to erode , " he added , and " other despots and authoritarian regimes can start looking and say , ' that 's something we can get away with
' " he described the intended @entity9 response as " limited in time and in scope , targeted at the specific task of degrading ( @entity51 's ) capabilities , and deterring the use of those weapons , again
" more than 100,000 killed in @entity4 conflict the @entity173 has said more than 100,000 people -- including many civilians -- have been killed since the popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011
in @entity233 , the resolution passed by the @entity11 set a 60 - day deadline for use of force in @entity4 , with an option for an additional 30 days
an amendment accepted by the panel from @entity24 sen. @entity240 of @entity241 and @entity20 sen. @entity242 of @entity243 added language to say the military response was intended to reverse @entity51 's battlefield momentum , a stronger objective than degrading the @entity4 regime 's chemical weapons capabilities as @entity250 told the committee on tuesday
if @entity51 " remains in an advantageous position , he will never leave @entity4 , " said @entity240 , who has been pushing for a more robust @entity9 response
" he has to know that he is losing and that way you get a negotiated settlement for his departure
" the resolution also makes clear there would be no @entity9 boots on the ground as part of a response in @entity4
a @entity23 statement welcomed the panel 's vote , saying " the military action authorized in the resolution would uphold @entity9 's national security interests by degrading @entity51 's chemical weapons capability and deterring the future use of these weapons , even as we pursue a broader strategy of strengthening the opposition to hasten a political transition in @entity4
" after the vote , senators on the panel made statements that explained their thinking , with some calling for more efforts to build an international coalition before any attack takes place
" @entity286 started with @entity9 advisers and a limited @entity289 presence
it led to an all - out war , " noted @entity20 sen. @entity290 of @entity291 , who opposed the resolution
@entity33 , @entity250 and @entity35 appeared before the @entity6 panel on tuesday to press for approval of authorization
tough questioning by @entity23 panel the same trio then faced questions on wednesday before the @entity46 , with @entity44 saying the administration 's @entity4 policy had been adrift for two years
at the same time , @entity44 acknowledged there were " no easy answers " on @entity4 , and attempting to deter chemical weapons use was worth considering despite public skepticism for @entity9 military involvement
@entity33 said @entity0 sought authorization for a response to the use of banned weapons , not a full military intervention
" we are not asking @entity9 to go to war , " he said
" we all agree , there will be no @entity9 boots on the ground
" in response to a question , @entity250 put the cost of the limited response under consideration at " tens of millions " of dollars
most of the focus of administration lobbying has been on the @entity23 , where opposition by @entity31 and libertarian conservatives , as well as the bitterly partisan political environment of the @entity24 - led chamber , make passage of @entity0 's authorization proposal uncertain
house speaker @entity333 and @entity122 , the no. 2 @entity24 , both have endorsed a @entity9 military response , but wednesday 's hearing showed widespread concerns and outside opposition from across the political spectrum
polls also show that a majority of @entity9 oppose a @entity9 military strike on @entity4
in the @entity6 , a @entity20 source familiar with majority leader @entity346 's thinking told @entity347 that @entity346 is confident any authorization measure will pass his chamber
the source said it is likely 60 votes will be needed to overcome a filibuster , and @entity346 thinks the votes are there
before that , however , lawmakers will hear from the @entity57 government , which is moving ahead with its efforts to lobby @entity69 in an attempt to undercut @entity0 on @entity4
@entity360 has sent an official request to congressional leaders to meet with them
" we 're planning the visit , " a @entity57 @entity364 spokesman told @entity347 , " we ca n't tell you the exact time but it will be next week
" @entity333 will not meet with the @entity57 , his spokesman said .
