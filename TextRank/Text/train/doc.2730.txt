@entity2 rep. @entity0 announced late monday night plans to resign from @entity3 , after pleading guilty to a felony tax evasion charge last week
the announcement came just hours after a source familiar with @entity0 's thinking told @entity1 he would resign " sooner rather than later , " after the @entity8 broke the news of @entity0 's plans to step down
" after much thought and prayer , i have made the very difficult decision to step down from @entity3 effective january 5th , 2015
this decision is made with a heavy heart , as i have enjoyed a very special relationship and closeness with my constituents , whom i care about deeply , " @entity0 said in a statement issued shortly before midnight by his office
the @entity22 congressman was indicted in april on 20 counts relating to his health food restaurant , @entity25 , including charges that he filed false tax returns ; engaged in mail fraud , wire fraud and perjury ; and knowingly hired undocumented workers
house speaker @entity32 called @entity0 's decision to step down " honorable " in a statement on tuesday
" i know it was made with the best interests of his constituents and the institution in mind , and i appreciate his years of service in the @entity42 , " @entity32 said
a @entity44 congressional source said @entity32 and @entity0 spoke monday before @entity0 announced his plans to resign
during last tuesday 's hearing , @entity0 pleaded guilty to one count of aiding in the filing of a false tax return , a plea that 's expected to bring him months of jail time
in the statement announcing his plans to resign , @entity0 said that " the events which led to this day did not break my spirit , nor the will of the voters , " but that he feels he wo n't be able to serve effectively in the new @entity3
" however , i do not believe that i can continue to be 100 % effective in the next @entity3 , and therefore , out of respect for the @entity60 and the people i so proudly represent , it is time for me to start the next chapter of my life , " he said
the decision to resign marks a change of heart for the @entity22 @entity44 , who rejected calls to step down after he entered his guilty plea
he apologized for his actions and took responsibility , and said that the unpaid taxes from a @entity74 restaurant he once owned were a mistake
" as long as i 'm able to serve i 'm going to serve , " he said
@entity0 was re-elected in november and was to be sworn in to a new term in january
while there 's nothing in the @entity80 or @entity81 barring felons from serving in @entity3 , the situation created an unwanted headache and negative attention for @entity32 as he seeks to head into the new @entity3 starting with a clean slate
while he gave up his seat on the @entity87 after he was charged , @entity0 repeatedly insisted he would be " fully exonerated
" according to the @entity8 , however , @entity0 admitted to the conduct alleged in his 20 - count indictment in a document to the court
the indictment came down just months before what was already expected to be a tough re-election fight for the perennial @entity96 target
his @entity22 - area district went for president @entity98 in 2012 , but despite the cloud of the indictment hanging over his head , @entity0 pulled out an easy win over his @entity96 challenger in november
his re-election and subsequent guilty plea created problems for @entity32 , who — along with then - majority leader @entity107 — in 2010 promised to institute a " zero tolerance " policy for ethics violations within the @entity44 caucus , which had dogged the party and contributed to its steep losses in the 2006 and 2008 elections
indeed , in previous situations where @entity42 @entity44 admitted to criminal or personal ethical lapses , @entity32 has worked privately to encourage those members to step aside on their own
but @entity0 's guilty plea was n't the only headache he 's caused @entity32 over the past year
he drew negative headlines last january when he was caught on camera threatening to throw a reporter off a balcony and break him in half " like a boy , " after the reporter asked about an investigation into his campaign finances
@entity0 's resignation will spark a competitive special election for his seat , and potential contenders have already begun lining up
former @entity96 rep. @entity132 , who narrowly lost to @entity0 in 2010 , has reportedly expressed interest in a bid for his old seat
@entity44 candidates , according to the @entity8 , could include @entity22 district attorney @entity137 , assemblywoman @entity138 and state sen. @entity139
