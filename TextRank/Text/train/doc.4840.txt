-- @entity3 has until monday to overturn the decision to ban the national soccer team from all competitions for two years , the sport 's governing body @entity1 said on friday
failure to do so will result in the @entity9 being suspended from all @entity1 - related actitives , @entity1 's communications director @entity7 told a news conference
" @entity1 will today send a letter to the @entity3 football federation indicating that the government of @entity3 has until monday 6 p.m. ( 1600 gmt ) to cancel its decision to withdraw @entity3 's participation in all @entity1 and @entity19 organized football competitions , " @entity7 told a news briefing on friday
@entity3 's president @entity21 suspended the " @entity26 " from international competition on wednesday after their first round exit at the @entity24 in @entity25
the team finished bottom of @entity29 after failing to win a single game
@entity21 's government also announced the expulsion of the @entity9 , with an interim board put in place
@entity3 's sports minister @entity35 confirmed @entity21 's decision in an interview with @entity0
" the government has taken a decision we believe is in the interests of @entity3 that we should for now , withdraw from international competition because our football since 1996 seems not to be growing , " he said
" the president @entity21 has endorsed this decision and the @entity3 people are excited about it
" however , @entity1 rules prevent governments from interfering in the running of national football federations
should @entity3 fail to resolve the situation , the country will be banned from competitive games including @entity25 competitions , and will also lose vital financial help from @entity1
" a suspension goes beyond the suspension of the national team , it also involves the freezing of the financial help and no referees can participate in international competition , " said @entity7
@entity1 president @entity64 had earlier warned @entity65 that they would face a possible suspension following a similar issue involving an investigation by @entity65 president @entity69 into the national team 's infamous @entity24 exit
@entity72 , @entity1 's general secretary , said @entity21 's decision puts soccer 's world governing body into jeopardy
" you ca n't allow a government to say all national teams ca n't play anymore in any international tournaments , " @entity72 told @entity25 radio station 702
" why should we be so strong on @entity65 when they did what they did and we say nothing about @entity3
" we have 208 members ... if you have one country going against our statute , going against the football system , the pyramid of football ... all is destroyed
