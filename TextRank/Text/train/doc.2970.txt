-- @entity1 is looking to the familiarity of home as he continues his search for a first full - field tournament win in over two years
the former world no. 1 has announced he will play three @entity9 events in the next month , including the @entity10 in @entity11 for the first time in his professional career
the tournament is held in @entity15 , which is near the 14 - time major champion 's home on @entity18 -- where he moved last year after his 2010 breakup with ex-wife @entity20 following the scandal about his extramarital affairs
" i 've heard great things about the @entity10 , " @entity1 told his website
" now that i live there , i want to play whenever possible
" he missed the cut as a 17 - year - old amateur in 1993 when the tournament -- which since 2007 has benefited the children 's charity of golf legend @entity31 -- was played at the @entity33 course
" @entity31 's involvement in the tournament and the benefits to the local community are also important , " @entity1 said of the march 1 - 4 event
its current venue , the @entity41 , is rated as one of the toughest courses on the @entity45 circuit
" we obviously are thrilled to have @entity1 play , " tournament director @entity46 told the tour 's website
" we have worked hard for five years to make this one of the premier events on the @entity9
" this is a testament to where the tournament has come , and a testament to @entity10 's 31 years as the longest - standing sponsor on the @entity9
" world no. 18 @entity56 , who slipped out of the top 50 last year , will also line up at next week 's @entity58 in @entity59 next week -- an event he has won three times
after the @entity10 , @entity56 will stay in @entity11 for the @entity63 a week later , where he has tasted victory on a record eight occasions
@entity56 will be in illustrious company at @entity68 , with world no. 1 @entity70 and 2011 @entity72 winner @entity71 both confirming their attendance on tuesday
the @entity45 has shown signs of returning to form in recent times , finishing tied for third at the @entity77 last month and winning the @entity79 event he hosts in december
" i 'm excited about my start and look forward to keep building , " said the 36 - year - old , whose last tour - sanctioned win was in @entity84 in november 2009
" i 've made great strides from last year and hopefully all my hard work will pay off with a victory soon
