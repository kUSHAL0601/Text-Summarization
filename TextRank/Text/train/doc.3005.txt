-- told by a different storyteller -- perhaps in a movie with subtitles and scenes in a @entity5 © -- " @entity1 " would qualify as a tragedy , a horror story , an upsetting drama of child abuse
here 's the cautionary tale of an overworked teenaged girl ( @entity11 ) , neglected by her self - absorbed , single , working - class mother ( @entity12 ) , who embarks on a self - destructive plan to speed up her journey to adulthood and escape her mother 's chaotic house
were this movie given the @entity19 narrative treatment , it might win a prize
' @entity21 ' cast near deals to return but spiced up with commercial - grade @entity27 - @entity26 content ( including a scene or two of warm , @entity32 - speaking familia time ) and starring the glamorous , likable , and marketable @entity33 in a pretend attempt at looking haggard , this inauthentic teen tale , with its cosmetically softened edges , serves neither the young people nor the @entity37 fans for whom it might be intended
there 's a particularly bum message about the lives of blue - collar women in the subplot involving @entity45 's affair with the husband ( @entity46 ) of a woman whose house she cleans
' @entity49 ' saved by @entity50 apparently , marital betrayal is the price of employing someone so pretty in the low , if honorable , job of cleaning toilets
