-- a @entity4 middle school student , with the backing of the @entity2 , is suing her school district over a search of her @entity8 and e-mail accounts by school employees
the 12 - year - old sixth grade student , identified in court documents only as @entity12 , was on two occasions punished for statements she made on her @entity8 account , and was also pressured to divulge her password to school officials , the complaint states
" @entity12 was intimidated , frightened , humiliated and sobbing while she was detained in the small school room " as she watched a counselor , a deputy , and another school employee pore over her private communications
the lawsuit claims that her first amendment rights were violated by employees at @entity29 , in west - central @entity4 , as well as her @entity31 rights regarding unreasonable search and seizure
the @entity34 denies any wrongdoing
" the district did not violate @entity12 's civil rights , and disputes the one - sided version of events set forth in the complaint written by the @entity2 , " according to a district statement
according to the complaint , @entity12 felt that one of the school 's adult hall monitors was picking on her , so she wrote on her @entity8 " wall " that she hated that person because she was mean
the message was not posted from school property or using any school equipment or connections , the lawsuit states
somehow , the school principal got a hold of a screenshot of the message , and punished @entity12 with detention and made her apologize to the hall monitor , the complaint says
she was in trouble again shortly thereafter for another @entity8 post , which asked who turned her in , using an expletive for effect , the lawsuit says
she was given in school suspension and missed a class ski trip
in the third incident , according to the complaint , @entity12 was called in by school officials after the guardian of another student complained that @entity12 had had a conversation about sex on @entity8
the girl was called to a meeting with a deputy sheriff , school counselor and an unidentified school employee , the court documents states
there , she was " intimidated " into giving up her login and passwords to her @entity8 and e-mail accounts , the lawsuit says
" @entity12 was extremely nervous and being called out of class and being interrogated , " the lawsuit says
the officials did not have permission from @entity12 's mother to view her private communications , and they gave the girl a hard time about some of the material they discovered , the lawsuit states
" students do not shed their first amendment rights at the school house gate , " @entity96 , executive director for the @entity2 in @entity4 , said in a statement
" the @entity101 ruled on that in the 1970s , yet schools like @entity29 seem to have no regard for the standard
" the school district maintains that such searches did not cross any boundaries
" the district is confident that once all facts come to light , the district 's conduct will be found to be reasonable and appropriate , " the district said .
