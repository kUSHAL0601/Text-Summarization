@entity0 -- thousands of people in @entity0 rallied for and against @entity3 in separate rallies monday after official election results showed the @entity7 prime minister handily winning back the presidency
international observers blasted the sunday election , saying the outcome was never in doubt
some foreign governments pledged to work with the new leader despite concerns about electoral violations
" the election has not been exemplary , to say the least , " said @entity18 foreign minister @entity17
with more than 99 % of the votes counted , @entity3 received 63.75 % of the vote , easily avoiding a runoff in a field of five candidates
@entity3 's closest challenger , @entity25 leader @entity25 , got slightly more than 17 % , and the other three candidates -- including @entity27 , the owner of the @entity29 basketball team -- were in the single digits
the result was still considered preliminary , however ; the state - run @entity33 news agency reported final results may come next week
@entity3 , 59 , declared victory before thousands of cheering supporters near @entity38 on sunday night , and a similar crowd returned monday to celebrate his victory , @entity33 reported
the news agency said about 10,000 people were at @entity42 , where sports figures and celebrities congratulated @entity3 and denounced the opposition 's claims that the voting was unfair and rigged
other @entity49 rallies took place around the country , @entity33 said
thousands of @entity3 opponents also turned out in central @entity0 on monday , and police arrested 250 people
among them were opposition activists @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , the @entity0 branch of the @entity61 reported
police detained 16 nationalists in central @entity0 because they were attempting to create unrest , the ministry said , and roughly 50 supporters of the banned @entity67 were detained for attempting to hold an unauthorized rally
" all those arrested were taken to a police station for their actions to be processed , and for the authorities to decide whether to press charges , " the @entity0 branch of the ministry said
international observers blasted @entity7 's presidential election monday and expressed disappointment and frustration with the way @entity3 won
" the point of an election is that the outcome should be uncertain
this was not the case in @entity7 , " said @entity85 , the head of an observer mission from the @entity87 ( @entity87 )
observers said they observed ballot stuffing and other irregularities in about a third of polling stations they monitored , and an uneven playing field in the run - up to the election
sounding somewhat exasperated , the @entity100 's @entity99 urged @entity7 " to have a fair election , " saying " it 's not that difficult
" ambassador @entity104 of the @entity87 was particularly critical of irregularities in vote counting because " what matters in an election is the counting , " she said
she declined to say whether the irregularities affected the outcome of the vote -- a landslide for @entity3 by international standards , if not @entity7 ones
and she praised incremental improvements such as web cameras in polling stations and transparent ballot boxes , as well as the " massive mobilization of civil society demanding fair elections
" the @entity123 urged the @entity7 government to conduct an independent , credible investigation of all reported electoral violations , but it also noted steps , like webcams installed at polling places , intended to make the voting process more transparent
some 90,000 webcams at polling places around the country allowed people around the world to watch live as @entity7 cast their ballots on election day
@entity3 called for unity sunday night as he appeared headed for his third term as president , declaring he had won an " open and honest fight
" but chess champion - turned - opposition - activist @entity143 accused @entity3 's supporters of " massive fraud , " saying early monday they packed the polls with additional voters
@entity143 , who served as a poll watcher in his @entity0 neighborhood , said @entity3 's supporters " simply added new voters to the register using so - called supplementary voter rolls
" " at one of the polling stations , the number of extra voters even exceeded the number of registered voters , " he said
a former @entity162 officer , @entity3 served two straight terms in the @entity164 before term limits forced him to step down in 2008
but he served as prime minister under his successor , @entity167 , and continued to dominate @entity7 politics
presidents @entity169 of @entity170 and @entity171 of @entity172 on monday congratulated @entity3 on his win
@entity1 's @entity174 contributed to this report .
