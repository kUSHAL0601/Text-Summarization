-- @entity1 has been hit with a $ 1,500 fine for swearing at the umpire during his shock @entity4 final defeat to @entity6
@entity1 argues with umpire @entity7 during his five - set defeat to @entity6
the world number one became embroiled in an argument with @entity7 at the end of the second set after complaining @entity6 was taking too long to decide whether or not to make challenges
the @entity14 successfully overturned an " out " call shortly before @entity1 's outburst , a point that led to him breaking serve and eventually taking the set
during the exchange @entity1 was picked up on microphones telling @entity7 : " do n't tell me when to be quiet , okay ? when i want to talk , i 'll talk
" @entity6 went on to claim his first grand slam , ending @entity1 's five - year unbeaten run at @entity22 and denying the @entity24 maestro a 16th grand slam title
@entity1 's fine pales in comparison to the one meted out to @entity29 , who was docked $ 10,000 for an altercation with a line judge at the climax of her semifinal with eventual winner @entity34
@entity29 reacted angrily after being called for a foot fault , and unleashed a torrent of abuse at the official , who reported the exchange to umpire @entity40
the resulting penalty point for a code violation handed the match to @entity34
@entity29 later apologized for the incident
she was also fined $ 500 for racket abuse in the same encounter
over $ 31,000 in fines were handed out in the final grand slam of the season with @entity50 , from @entity51 , forced to pay $ 5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct towards a fan he confronted
@entity55 of @entity56 and @entity58 's @entity57 were also fined $ 1,500 for audible obscenities
@entity1 will get an early chance to put his @entity4 disappointment behind him when he plays for @entity24 in a @entity63 playoff tie against @entity64 this weekend in @entity65 .
