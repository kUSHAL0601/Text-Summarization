-- a federal appeals court ruled late friday that about 1,300 gay and lesbian marriages performed earlier this year must be recognized by @entity5
however , the judges stayed their order until july 21 to give the state time to file an appeal to the @entity11 @entity10 for emergency action
the justices would be asked to delay recognition of those same - sex marriages until the overall constitutional issue is fully decided by the high court , a process that may not happen for a year or more
the same appeals court late last month ruled @entity5 's voter approved @entity21 violated the equal protection rights of same - sex couples
the law currently defines marriage only between one man and one woman
a group of plaintiffs then asked the court to order the state to recognize those marriage licenses already issued in december and january
about 1,300 same - sex couples obtained marriage licenses in the 17 days after a federal judge ruled on december 20 that @entity5 's ban was unconstitutional
those marriages were stopped after a temporary stay was put in place by the @entity10
that was the issue in friday 's court action
@entity43 's same - sex marriage ban should n't stand , judge rules
