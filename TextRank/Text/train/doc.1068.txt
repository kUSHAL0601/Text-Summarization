-- last time around , humanity 's savior came in the form of a human messiah
this time , if technology analysts , bankers and venture capitalists are to be believed , it will take the form of a handheld computer otherwise known as a smartphone
that 's right , the new @entity12 announced wednesday is already being credited with saving the @entity15 economy
according to @entity18 , sales of the new device should boost our nation 's gdp by as much as 0.5 % in the fourth quarter of this year alone
that 's not a misprint , but half a percent of the nation 's economic activity , or $ 3.2 billion
it 's hard to know whether such proclamations - even if true - say as much about the power of smartphones as they do about the weakness of the rest of the economy
in either case , however , i ca n't help but fear yet another hyper - inflated bubble in the making
maybe smartphones make us ' @entity39 ' ? first off , most of the projected $ 3.2 billion wo n't be from consumers to @entity43 , but from wireless carriers subsidizing their subscriber 's purchases in return for contract extensions
that 's not really " growth " the way we used to define it in economics class
but that does n't stop us from mistaking wireless as a pure growth industry , and far too many from placing their bets accordingly
working as i do in @entity61 's @entity60 , it 's hard not to bump into an @entity12 app builder or investor everywhere i go
labs , incubators and angel investing groups are quite focused - some might argue obsessed - with launching the next monster @entity12 hit , and then selling before it crashes
top - ranked @entity12 app draw something , for example , peaked at around 50 million downloads this spring
this was just in time for its developer to be bought by @entity77 for $ 200 million , and then start its descent into obscurity the very next day
even the students at the graduate digital programs where i teach have shifted from building for computer or the web to developing for the @entity12
like garage bands of yesterday , they toil away in the hope of getting the next big hit
yes , we 've been here before
first time , for me anyway , was the cd - rom craze
@entity94 interactivity , new authoring tools and seemingly infinite storage space led many media publishers to believe that cd - roms would be to the digital era what books were to that of text
they obsolesced themselves as a viable format ( mostly by being slow and boring ) even before networking speeds made disks irrelevant
the dotcom boom appeared just as infinite to those in the know
while @entity114 has been left standing , @entity112 and @entity113 crashed as quickly as they rose
the vast majority of online retailers surprised the @entity119 analysts betting on them
social media was supposed to solve that problem for the tech industry and @entity123 alike , but climaxed in the ipo of @entity125 , a disappointment so far - reaching it has dragged dozens of social media companies along with it , and sent investors and entrepreneurs looking for greener pastures
the choreography of an @entity43 event like wireless handheld devices and the apps running on them
everywhere i turn , every conference i attend , every magazine story i read seems to be based on one aspect of these technologies or another
everyone is hard at work on an @entity12 app that lists , maps , or socializes some data set in some new visual way
pictures over text , text over maps , restaurants close to subways , or apps showing subways with @entity155 to download more apps
do n't get me wrong : wireless is big , and these devices are here to stay , at least until we get comfortable with apps being embedded in objects and technology being implanted in our bodies
and while the opportunity for corporations to make billions on these apps may be overstated , we may still see a new peer - to - peer marketplace emerge between independent developers and the users of their bounty of applications
but the extent to which entrepreneurs , developers , and even columns like this one depend on @entity43 and the rest of the wireless computing industry for new grist far exceeds their true impact or potential
so go , get an @entity12
but find something or someone else to save you
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .
