-- @entity1 was rejected by @entity2 as a youth player , and @entity4 claims he does n't even remember the player 's time at @entity7
but the 24 - year - old made a point to the veteran manager on saturday , scoring the only goal as his @entity13 team knocked @entity2 off the top of the @entity15
@entity13 's 1 - 0 home win left @entity2 a point behind rivals @entity18 , who earlier thrashed @entity20 5 - 0
" we 've been a bit more ruthless and we 're putting our chances away ; maybe we could have had another one at the end to make it a bit more comfortable , " said @entity1 , whose 60th - minute header inflicted @entity2 's third league defeat in 12 matches and lifted @entity13 up to 13th
" it 's a great day for @entity13 and it 's a massive win for us
we 've been performing well over the last couple of weeks and we showed today that we could beat the team that is probably the best in the league
" @entity2 went into the match without @entity37 striker @entity36 , who was ill , and could not continue a remarkable run of come - from - behind victories
" they deserved the win just because they worked so hard for it , " @entity4 said
" the players are used to making comebacks and we 're always a threat in the last minutes of matches
we had a lot of half - chances but it just was n't our night
" @entity18 face an early @entity49 exit if wednesday 's home clash with @entity51 ends in anything but victory , but the @entity15 champions picked up a morale - boosting win as @entity59 forwards @entity57 and @entity60 scored twice each against a @entity20 side who dropped into the relegation zone
@entity65 opened the scoring before halftime , while @entity60 and @entity57 both netted from the penalty spot once as @entity18 remained the only unbeaten team in the division
" for us it is very important we start to play well and in the last two games we have scored six goals with our strikers , " said manager @entity71
" i think we have been missing their goals
" third - placed @entity79 's title hopes continued to fade with a 2 - 1 defeat at this season 's surprise team , @entity81
@entity84 's side have now failed to win in four league games , and this setback came in the @entity88 's first return to the club that sacked him in 2009
@entity79 's defeat at the same ground in march ended the reign of manager @entity94 , and his assistant @entity95 stepped up to take charge and preside over a historic first @entity98 title
the @entity101 club 's chances of progressing to the last 16 of this season 's @entity49 competition could hinge on getting a result from tuesday 's trip to @entity106 in the penultimate match of the group stage
@entity81 moved up to fourth to continue the fine start made by new manager @entity110 , who spent four years at @entity79 as assistant manager to first @entity112 and then @entity113
@entity79 , missing injured captain @entity114 , went behind to @entity116 's 10th - minute header but midfielder @entity117 leveled six minutes before halftime
however , @entity120 forward @entity119 nodded the home team ahead just five minutes after the break from a cross by @entity124 striker @entity116 as @entity81 held on for a sixth win from seven at the @entity126
@entity127 dropped to fifth after a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity129 that lifted the promoted team out of the bottom three on goal difference
striker @entity132 scored both goals in @entity129 's first top - flight win since may 2008 , after @entity127 led through @entity135 forward @entity136
@entity127 went into the match without influential veteran @entity138 , who has been ruled out for up to two months following knee surgery
@entity140 closed on the top four with a dramatic 5 - 2 north @entity142 win against @entity143 , who had @entity145 sent off after giving the visitors the lead against his former club
the @entity150 striker netted his first goal for @entity143 this season from close range but then saw red after a two - footed lunge on @entity155
@entity140 took full advantage as defender @entity159 headed in , fellow @entity157 @entity156 scrambled a second and @entity161 forward @entity160 also scored before halftime
@entity163 midfielder @entity155 made it 4 - 1 before @entity164 reduced the deficit but @entity37 international @entity166 boosted his hopes of a new contract as he ensured a repeat of last season 's scoreline
spurs dropped to eighth , two points behind their rivals and one behind seventh - placed @entity175 -- who host @entity177 on monday
@entity178 claimed 10th place with a 2 - 1 win over @entity181 , who went into the match threatening legal action against @entity186 's national federation after @entity187 was refused permission to play
the striker did not travel to @entity190 for a midweek friendly due to a back injury , so @entity186 invoked @entity193 's five - day rule that stops players from missing internationals and returning immediately to play for their clubs
" i love playing for my country and would only withdraw from a squad -- for either a friendly or competitive game -- for a genuine reason , " @entity187 said
" i am fully supportive of the position my club has adopted in this matter and am sorry that the @entity205 seem to doubt my honesty and integrity
i will now consider if i wish to continue to captain my country
" @entity210 striker @entity209 and @entity212 @entity211 put @entity178 ahead before a late consolation from @entity187 's compatriot @entity214 -- the forward 's eighth league goal this season
@entity218 moved up to 11th with a 3 - 0 win over @entity220 as @entity221 continued his goalscoring run -- and again ran into controversy
the @entity225 striker netted a double to move to the top of the @entity15 charts with 10 , but was accused by @entity220 manager @entity229 of stamping on @entity230
" the first finish is probably the real clinical one and a sign of a top player , " @entity229 said
" he was very fortunate because it was a stamp which the referee did n't see , and that was n't the sign of a top player
" @entity239 lost 3 - 1 at home to second - bottom @entity241 , leaving @entity243 ' team four points adrift at the foot of the table as the @entity248 battles to save his job .
