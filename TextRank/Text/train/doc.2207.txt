the @entity2 classic painting " @entity4 " sold wednesday at @entity5 in @entity6 for more than $ 37 million , the auction house said
with commission , the sale price of $ 33 million totaled $ 37,042,500 , short of the $ 50 million that @entity5 's had predicted it might fetch
the piece ( silkscreen ink and spray paint on canvas ) shows @entity13 in a gunslinger pose
first exhibited in 1963 at the @entity15 in @entity16 , the work " epitomizes the artist 's obsessions with fame , stardom , and the public image , " @entity5 's said in a release
" @entity2 's signature style , coupled with the instantly recognizable faces of his subjects , creates a blurred boundary between artist and sitter
" @entity2 made 22 versions of the " @entity4 , " nine of which are held in museums
the painting brings together two iconic figures in @entity36 culture , said @entity37 , curator of modern and contemporary art at the @entity39 , which has a " @entity4 " on display
" it 's @entity2 at his very best
he gives you the celebrity playing a role within cinematic culture and asking us as viewer to confront that head - on , " @entity37 said
" it 's @entity4 with the gun drawn
it 's a confrontational moment
" the work is among the most famous of @entity2 's paintings of celebrities , which included @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57
also @entity59 's " @entity58 " was sold wednesday for $ 44.9 million
that was an auction record for a @entity59 piece , @entity5 's said
observers say the market for contemporary and modern art has been set ablaze in recent months
a version of @entity67 's " @entity66 " brought an auction record of $ 119 million at @entity5 on may 2 , and a @entity70 painting " @entity72 " sold tuesday at @entity71 for nearly $ 87 million
art dealers say the stratospheric rise in art prices is being propelled by wealthy investors from abroad
wednesday night 's winning bid for the @entity2 painting came in over the phone ; the buyer 's name was not divulged
still , the buy set no records
the top price for a @entity2 painting is $ 71,720,000
as for @entity2 , who famously said , " making money is art and working is art , and good business is the best art , " the prices his works are commanding would have been thrilling , @entity37 said
" he would be amazed and excited to see what 's happening , " she added
alas , @entity2 died in 1987 after undergoing routine gallbladder surgery at what was then known as @entity98 , three blocks south of @entity5 's on @entity6 's @entity100
