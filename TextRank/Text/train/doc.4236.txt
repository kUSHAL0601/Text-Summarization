-- former president @entity1 is visiting @entity2 to promote a health initiative that focuses on cervical and breast cancer prevention and treatment
in the city of @entity7 , @entity1 worked with local residents saturday to refurbish a clinic used to screen , diagnose and treat cervical cancer
@entity1 heads to the capital of @entity12 , where he will designate a cancer center at a university teaching hospital and meet with governmental and health care leaders
he will then travel to @entity16 to launch a similar program aimed at combating cancer
the trip to both nations -- which ends thursday -- is part of the @entity23 initiative spearheaded by his foundation that seeks to expand cervical and breast cancer screening , and treatment in @entity28
cancer in @entity28 is an emerging global concern
the continent has an acute shortage of experts such as oncologists , and lacks infrastructure and data to combat the disease , exacerbating the concern
@entity1 and former first lady @entity39 have previously visited the continent as part of his foundation 's health initiative
in a 2008 trip to @entity46 , they highlighted @entity48 initiatives to combat @entity50 , malaria and poverty during a trip to five @entity54 nations that included @entity55 and @entity56
" different people may have different views about you and your administration and your legacy , " @entity46 president @entity57 said at the time
" you , mr. president , and your administration , have been good friends of our country and have been good friends of @entity28
" as president , @entity1 introduced an emergency aids program that saved millions of lives in @entity28 by providing antiretroviral drugs
analysts have said that his health initiatives offer a chance to make the case that his legacy on foreign policy should not be judged on the @entity82 war alone .
