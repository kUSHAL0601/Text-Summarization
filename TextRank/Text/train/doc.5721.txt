@entity0 -- @entity3 ' former trainer was freed friday from the prison where he 's been held since he refused to testify in the baseball legend 's perjury trial two weeks ago
with the jury now deliberating the perjury and obstruction of justice case against @entity12 , @entity8 district judge @entity7 ordered @entity13 to be released
@entity7 found @entity13 in contempt of court on the first day of trial testimony when his lawyer informed her that he would not take the stand to answer questions about @entity12 ' steroid use
it was the third time @entity13 chose jail time over testimony
he was sent to prison for several weeks twice before when he refused to appear before a federal grand jury investigating @entity12
the absence of the trainer 's testimony hampered the government 's case against @entity12 , who is charged with lying under oath when he testified about his steroids use in 2003 before the grand jury that was investigating an alleged sports doping scandal involving @entity13 of the @entity34
@entity3 , 46 , allegedly lied about knowingly taking performance - enhancing drugs and about being injected by anyone but his doctors
the jury of eight women and four men are deciding @entity12 ' fate in a @entity0 federal courthouse less than two miles from the ballpark where @entity12 broke @entity45 's major league home run record in august 2007
the three perjury counts and one count of obstruction of justice could each carry a 10 - year prison sentence upon conviction
a fourth perjury charge was dropped by prosecutors wednesday
a prosecutor argued thursday that @entity12 lied because he knew the truth about his steroids use would " tinge his accomplishments " and hurt his career
" his secret was so powerful that he could n't admit it , would n't admit it , " assistant u.s. attorney @entity60 said in his closing arguments
@entity3 ' defense lawyer , during his closing arguments thursday , asked jurors to acquit him because of a technical oversight by prosecutors -- an argument the government quickly rebutted
the judge 's instructions to the jury say @entity12 can found be found guilty only if his lies could have affected the grand jury 's decisions and that @entity12 knew it , defense lawyer @entity72 said
but none of the 25 prosecution witnesses presented evidence about what decisions the grand jury made or what they might have made , @entity79 said
" who told us about the grand jury at all ? " the @entity90 agent who started the federal investigation into the distribution of performance - enhancing drugs testified that @entity12 ' false testimony affected his work , but agent @entity96 was not part of the grand jury , @entity79 said
" i know that this is a little technical , " @entity79 said
" i do n't apologize for that
every word of the law matters
" the judge also instructed jurors to rely only what they heard from witnesses in the trial and not use their prior knowledge of the grand jury process , he said
" the government is trusting you to do what you are forbidden to do , and fill in the gaps , " @entity79 said
prosecutor @entity117 , in his rebuttal , said @entity96 's investigation and the grand jury probe were " one and the same
" the jury can also read the indictments the grand jury issued in 2004 and the grand jury transcript in which " the issues are fleshed out , " @entity117 said
@entity79 told jurors that @entity12 acknowledged to the grand jury that he used the substances known as " the clear and the cream , " but at the time of his testimony , even investigators did n't know what was in them
bonds told the grand jury he thought @entity13 was giving him flaxseed oil , @entity79 said
@entity60 , in his closing , said it was " implausible " that @entity12 would take drugs " and really not know what they were
" a urine sample given by @entity12 in the summer of 2003 , just months before his grand jury testimony , tested positive for anabolic steroids , he said
the defense argued there was another sample taken weeks earlier that tested negative for the drugs
defense lawyer @entity152 , in her part of closing arguments , accused prosecutors of ignoring crimes by witnesses in exchange for their testimony against @entity3
" they will forgive it if that person will say something bad about @entity3 , " @entity152 said
@entity12 ' former girlfriend , @entity162 , testified for the prosecution that she witnessed physical and emotional changes in @entity12 that the government argued were indications of steroids use
@entity162 testified during the trial that she had committed perjury when she told the same grand jury in 2003 that she had not noticed @entity12 ' shrunken testicles
@entity162 also admitted she had committed mortgage fraud by lying on a home loan application , @entity152 said
during court testimony last month , @entity12 ' childhood friend @entity174 , who worked for a decade as his assistant , said he tried to persuade @entity12 to stop using anabolic steroids in 2000 and 2003
@entity3 ' defense lawyer argued that @entity174 ' cooperation with the government was motivated by bitterness over @entity12 firing him and by a desire for protection from prosecution for allegedly stealing money from @entity3
prosecutors played an audio recording that @entity174 secretly made in the @entity189 locker room of a conversation with @entity13 about the hazards of steroid usage
@entity3 ' defense attorney suggested that @entity174 made the recording only after @entity12 dismissed him in march 2003
@entity174 acknowledged that he leaked the details of the recording to investigative reporter @entity197 , who included it in his book about the scandal , " @entity201
" while he never witnessed @entity3 being injected with anabolic steroids , @entity174 said he saw @entity12 and @entity13 emerge from a bedroom with a syringe during spring training in 2000
bonds complained to him that year that steroid injections " were making his butt sore , " @entity174 said
in his 21 - year major league career , @entity12 also set the record for most home runs in a single season in 2001 , when he hit 73
he did not officially retire after he was indicted , but he never played another game .
