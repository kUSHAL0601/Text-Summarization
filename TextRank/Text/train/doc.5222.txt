-- i 've always lived in a world of letters and alphabets
one of my earliest recollections is memorizing every line and curve of the @entity8 's on a baby blanket my grandparents gave me
i learned to read at an early age , but my favorite books were dictionaries
i wanted no plot , no narrative , just the onrush of one word after another
this obsessive attention to letters and orthography led me to victory at the 1986 @entity23
my winning word : odontalgia , which means toothache
winning the @entity23 can lead to all kinds of aches -- headaches , stomachaches , growing pains
but it can also be the time of a young kid 's life
if you were to ask me whether the @entity23 leads to obsessive levels of competition , i would say " absolutely
" but that 's not necessarily a bad thing
the same obsessions that lead a child to win a spelling bee are not much different from the obsessions that might someday lead a scientist to the cure for cancer
the agony and ecstasy of the @entity23 what is great about the @entity23 is that it provides a safe space for prepubescent kids to meet peers with a similar obsession for words
when i was in junior high , public schools tolerated a much higher background level of bullying than they do in the post-columbine era , but when i was at the @entity23 , i fit in
yes , i won the championship , and i am always grateful for that , but ironically , the downside to being champion is that it gives you a lot less time to socialize with your fellow word nerds
people ask me what it was like to win the @entity23 , but i mostly remember the lights and flashbulbs of the press that followed my victory
they were so blindingly bright to me i eventually borrowed my mother 's tinted sunglasses to cut down on the glare
i was flown from @entity79 to @entity80 to appear on " @entity81 , " then flown back almost as quickly to shake hands with president @entity83 in the @entity84
then it was on to " @entity86 " with @entity87
( for those of you younger folk , @entity87 is the late night tv guy before the other late night tv guy before @entity92
) @entity87 was extremely personable to me and seemed to prefer hosting " ordinary " guests like a spelling bee winner or some farmer who won a @entity97 for growing the world 's largest pumpkin instead of going through yet another interview with a movie star trying to plug his or her latest film
@entity105 after appearing on " @entity86 , " i talked less and less about winning the @entity23
i would occasionally get ribbed for it at school ( or asked to spell an off - color word or two ) , but generally , it was less of a bother to let it fade into the background
i barely told anybody about it in college
in fact , a schoolmate only found out after finding my name listed as a spelling bee champion in an old copy of the @entity120
when i watch the telecasts of the @entity23 today , i 'm impressed at the increasing level of competition that the kids bring to the bee each year
i won the over 25 years ago , but today , i 'm not sure i could break out of the top 50
one of these days , a kid will memorize every single word in @entity130 's @entity129 , and the judges may be forced to coin new words on the spot to declare a champion
until then , i 'm not only astounded by the quality of competition , but also uplifted by the spirit of fair play and mutual support that the spellers display to each other
tonight one competitor will be crowned the @entity144 victor and embark on a similar journey to the one i did 27 years ago
if i could impart any wisdom to the winner , it would be this : life does n't begin or end with the spelling bee
it just gives you some wonderful tales to tell along the way
were you a bee kid ? how far did you go ? share your story in the comments below .
