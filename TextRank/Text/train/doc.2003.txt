it was a boat owner 's obsession with perfection , making sure his " baby " was stowed just right in his backyard , that led him to discover the surviving suspect in the @entity8 bombings
contrary to police reports , @entity10 said the discovery of blood had nothing to do with the inspection of his boat , the @entity9 , he told @entity18 affiliate @entity17
during the inspection , he found a bloodied @entity20 , 19 , hiding in the boat , he said
@entity10 said he had been obsessing over how two pads had fallen out of the shrink - wrap protecting his boat for the winter
he had put the pads under the shrink - wrap to prevent chafing , he told the station
it took two visits tending to the boat before he finally saw @entity32 and his trail of blood
" it was really windy , so i did n't think twice about it , " he said of the dislodged pads
neighbor photographs shootout with police he could n't address the problem until authorities lifted a " shelter - in - place " order for residents of @entity44 , @entity45 , about 6 p.m. friday
then he went outside to get some air , he told the affiliate
" i am just going to put the pads back
they were bugging me all day
so i went out in the yard and felt the freedom that everyone in @entity44 was feeling
when i pulled the strap , it was a lot looser than it usually is
but again , the wind could have loosened things up , " he said
at this point , he did n't see blood on the exterior tarp , despite what police have said
" no indication of anything
i know people say i saw blood on the boat , ' he saw blood on the boat
' not true , " he said
5 key questions in @entity72 bombing " i said ' ok , everything is fine
' there are no visible signs of blood outside the boat
i went inside , " he said
but in a fit of obsession , he returned to the boat , climbed a ladder and inspected the @entity9 again
" i got three steps up the ladder and rolled the shrink - wrap
i did n't expect to see anything , but i saw blood on the floor of the boat
a good amount of blood , " he told the affiliate
" and i said ' wow , did i cut myself last time ? ' i thought
i was in the boat a couple of weeks ago
then i just look over there , and there is more blood , " he continued
a look at @entity32 's past the blood led to a revelation that would end a two - day manhunt for @entity32
" and i looked back and forth a couple of times and my eyes went to the engine block and there was a body , " he told the station
he did n't immediately connect the body to @entity32
" i think maybe ( i knew ) , but i did n't want to think that
it 's fast , " he said
he recounted how the person was hidden
" i see him lying there just like you see on the film ( from the @entity116 's infrared camera )
he was just lying there by the engine block and the floor
i could n't see his face
i 'm glad i did n't see his face
i did n't see his face
he did n't move , " he told @entity17
responding quickly , @entity10 did n't even remember climbing down the ladder and running to the phone to dial 911
@entity123 takes heat over @entity72 bombing suspect " i did n't waste any time
i did n't ask him if he wanted a cup of coffee
i was off that ladder
that is all i remember , " he told the affiliate
@entity133 later escorted @entity10 and his wife to a neighbor 's home
@entity133 then surrounded the @entity10 's house
" i am lucky i am alive , " @entity10 said
" these other people were killed
sometimes , i just sit and say , ' wow
' " many on social media want to buy him another boat
but @entity10 wants nothing of it
he calls himself an " incidental hero
" " it makes me feel wonderful that people that are thinking like that , but it is my boat
people lost lives and lost limbs
i 'd rather that ( the money ) go to the one fund @entity72
to buy me a new boat is a wonderful thing , i do n't want that , really
i would wish that they donate it to the one fund @entity72
i lost a boat , " he told the affiliate
" @entity9 is slipping away
but i say it did its job
it held a bad guy and is going away like a viking ship
