-- it is one of the painful ironies of our time that in the same season @entity9 's memory is finally honored with a memorial in our nation 's capital , the state where he began to lead the civil rights movement is once more the center of an ugly conflict over racial injustice
the passage of @entity19 's anti-immigrant legislation , @entity20 56 , invokes inhumanity reminiscent of the @entity22
and the police state it has created is equally cruel
if the law stands , children will be denied admission to public schools if they ca n't prove their citizenship , and schools will be turned into enforcement operations
poor people of color will be ripped from their families if they are caught in public without their papers in order
samaritans and people of conscience who employ , harbor or help undocumented workers will be severely punished
already , opportunistic corrections firms are standing by to pocket money off prejudice and terrified families are selling off their meager possessions and fleeing the state
our immigration system is broken , but our answer as a nation can not be to terrorize and criminalize families
our immigration policy must be consistent with our core values and our moral obligation to treat all people with dignity and respect
for all the differences that divide us , we are in this together
in these harsh economic times , we are more than ever wearing the " single garment of destiny " of which @entity9 wrote in his " @entity65
" when communities suffer discrimination and degradation , we all suffer
when some citizens are denied fair treatment , we are all denied
when any group of workers can be underpaid and overworked , all workers are victimized
when families are threatened if they dare organize or speak out , @entity74 is threatened
" sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application , " @entity9 also wrote in " @entity65 , " where he was imprisoned for nonviolent civil disobedience
much about our nation 's immigration practices echoes that observation
we call on president @entity84 to oppose and terminate all programs -- including collaboration between state and local law enforcement and the @entity89 -- that result in racial profiling and target immigrant communities
our focus should be on comprehensive immigration reform
and we must focus simultaneously on fixing our broken economy , an economy that is forcing 99 % of the people to compete for a smaller and smaller piece of the receding @entity98
we also hope the good and righteous people of @entity19 will rise up , oppose and repeal the abomination that is @entity20
theirs is the state where our historic civil rights movement began , where @entity9 and his followers developed a model of nonviolent activism that changed not only @entity107 and @entity19 and the @entity22 , but our entire nation
this week , a delegation of @entity112 labor and civil rights leaders are visiting @entity19 to support @entity114 families who face hostilities all too familiar to what @entity9 saw in 1963
perhaps the ugly problems in @entity19 can once again play a part in building a new understanding about the strains of division that weaken the fabric of society for all of us
