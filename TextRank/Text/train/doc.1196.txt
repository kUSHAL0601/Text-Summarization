@entity1 province , @entity2 -- it 's after 10 p.m. when we see a light in the distance
we 've traveled for more than three hours up a windy , icy road in western @entity2
our hope is to get to the @entity12 autonomous zone , in the mountainous region of @entity1 province , an area reportedly locked in an ever - growing spiral of violence
we 're so close , only an hour or so away
within minutes , we grind to a halt
a policeman is flashing a flashlight in my face
our @entity2 driver is already outside the car
we wo n't be going any farther tonight
roadblocks like this are strewn across the back roads of this province
for weeks , ethnic tibetans and @entity2 security forces have been locked in conflict
@entity33 nuns and monks have been carrying out ritual self - immolation
it is a gruesome protest against what they claim is the ongoing oppression by @entity2 authorities
timeline of @entity12 protests in @entity2 as our car turns back , our driver calls a @entity12 contact
something serious is going down
the @entity12 says his village is crawling with police and the military
later , local news reports tell of two @entity12 killed in protests
but many of the villages that straddle the mountains are inhabited by @entity57 , the dominant ethnic group in @entity2
inside the houses , lights are on , as people eat , watch tv and talk
we ask what they 're hearing
they tell us they have little time for the @entity12
they call them lazy and accuse them of living off government handouts
one woman claims the @entity57 are being targeted by violent @entity12 gangs
local media reports say more than a dozen people have already been killed
there is hysteria , bigotry and fear here
it is fueled by government secrecy and a constant stream of military and police vehicles
much of the province is in lockdown
in the capital city of @entity90 , police vehicles are seen moving into position at dawn
soon , they are on every corner , armed police patrolling the streets
they are tightening their grip on this heavily @entity12 populated neighborhood
it 's hard to get people to talk here
we see a group of young monks on a corner and wave them over
they agree to take us to their living quarters
here in a tiny one bedroom apartment , four beds crammed against the walls and their food tied in sacks , the monks tell us they are verbally abused and harassed by police , pushed to breaking point
" i can not bear it any longer - any more , " says one
they are far from their home in the mountains ; cut off they say , they can not even make contact by phone
" we want to go but we can not , you can see all the security out there
wherever you go , they see you
we can not go anywhere , " he says
we ask if he 's afraid , but he just looks at a picture of the @entity133 , a smile on his face
" i ca n't explain , " he says , " but i 'm not afraid
" in their pouch , the monks hold a keepsake of their spiritual leader the @entity140 , too sacred to even show us
this pouch , they say , carries a dream
" we wish what all @entity12 wish for the most : for the @entity140 to return to the palace in @entity145
" they know about the self - immolation of other @entity147 ; they say they support them and vow it will continue until @entity2 leaves @entity145
for the @entity2 government , though , these are dangerous men -- part of what they call a " splittist " element , determined to tear @entity145 from @entity2
throughout our interview , we have been watched
later , our vehicle is followed
our driver says his family has received threatening phone calls
on our way to the airport , a car , rather suspiciously , rams into the back of our taxi
as we make our way to the service counters , we are followed by plainclothes security talking constantly on mobile phones
eventually trying to clear airport security , we 're grabbed by police
we are marched to an airport police station and detained and questioned for five hours
police keep some of our video
they want to know who we spoke to , what we are doing here , where we 've been and why we want to cover this story
we have our own questions -- questions authorities are answering only with roadblocks and police
later , @entity2 authorities black out @entity185 when our report airs about the situation in the ethnically @entity12 area
there are claims and counter-claims in this dark conflict
all of it is being played out behind a veil of secrecy in the mountains of western @entity2 .
