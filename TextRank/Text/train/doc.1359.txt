@entity0 -- men taking any of three erectile dysfunction drugs -- @entity4 , @entity5 or @entity6 -- may be at increased risk for sudden hearing loss , prompting @entity10 officials to require label changes for the medications
the @entity10 is requiring label changes for drugs that may increase the risk of sudden hearing loss
the @entity10 said manufacturers must change the labels " to display more prominently the potential risk of sudden hearing loss , " according to the agency 's web site
labeling must also be changed for the blood pressure medication @entity4 , which has the same active ingredient as the other drugs
men taking any of the @entity28 drugs and experiencing hearing loss should immediately stop taking the drug and see their physician , the @entity10 said
patients taking @entity4 and experiencing hearing loss should not discontinue taking the drug because it is used to treat a potentially life - threatening condition , the @entity10 said
those patients are urged to see their physicians immediately
the @entity10 is requiring the label change for the entire class of drugs -- called @entity41 , or @entity43 - 5 inhibitors
the @entity10 says all manufacturers have agreed to the change their labels
" this is basically a public health announcement to let people decide if they want to take the drug , " dr. @entity47 said
@entity47 is an ear , nose and throat specialist for the @entity10 who reviewed reports of sudden hearing loss in patients taking these drugs
the @entity10 began investigating the possible link between hearing loss and ed drugs after the publication of an article for ear , nose and throat specialists in last april 's @entity67 , according to @entity10 spokeswoman @entity68
the study reported on a man taking @entity4 who had experienced sudden hearing loss
this prompted the @entity10 to look for other reports of sudden hearing loss
the @entity10 found a total of 29 reports , which involved patients experiencing ringing in their ears , vertigo and / or dizziness
in most cases , the hearing loss only occurred in one ear , and for about one third of patients , the hearing loss was temporary
@entity47 said " these 29 adverse event reports date back to 1996 , when @entity4 , the first impotence drug , was approved
" " so , we 're only talking about a couple cases per year , " he said
he said 40 million prescriptions of all four drugs have been filled worldwide so far
" this is a very small number of cases , but because we 're talking about a person 's ability to hear , we thought it was important to make the label clear that this is a possible event , " @entity68 said
there are about 4,000 new cases of sudden hearing loss in the @entity100 each year , according to the @entity101
hearing loss can be caused by blood flow blockage as a result of diabetes or other illness , smoking , age and antibiotics
@entity110 manufactures @entity4 and @entity4 and @entity111 manufactures @entity6
@entity5 , developed by @entity112 and @entity113 , is jointly promoted in the @entity100 by @entity112 and @entity114
representatives from @entity110 and @entity111 stressed that this is a " class label change " for all such drugs
in separate statements , @entity110 and @entity111 representatives said " the @entity10 is making this change in the interests of patients so that patients can make informed decisions regarding @entity43 - 5 medications
" @entity112 did not return calls , but @entity114 noted that " based on patient reports , all occurrences of sudden hearing loss in patients taking @entity5 were temporary
" e-mail to a friend @entity1 's @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .
