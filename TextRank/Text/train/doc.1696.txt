-- goals from @entity2 and , who else , @entity3 helped @entity4 claim their first trophy of the season on wednesday night against arch rivals @entity7 , who had to play for more than an hour with ten men after @entity10 was shown a straight red card in the 27th minute
@entity7 had won the first leg 3 - 2 , but @entity4 's pair of away goals proved vital as their 2 - 1 win at the @entity16 handed them the title on away goals
the @entity20 side have won the last three supercups
@entity4 showed they had recovered from their poor start to the league season with an incredible opening spell that overwhelmed their opponents
@entity2 got the stadium rocking with a goal in the 11th minute , as he latched on to a hopeful long ball that @entity7 defender @entity30 completely misjudged , and fired past a helpless @entity31
barely seven minutes later @entity4 doubled their lead
another long ball caused panic among the @entity7 defence - this time the normally impeccable @entity36 was at fault -- and @entity3 was perfectly placed to make the most of the chaos
the @entity41 striker flicked a delightful ball over @entity36 before dispatching the ball into @entity31 ' bottom corner to leave the @entity7 defense in shell shock
ten minutes later , @entity7 's capitulation was complete as @entity10 , playing out of position at left back after a pre match injury to @entity50 forced @entity51 to switch flanks with the @entity53 , was shown a deserved red card for hauling down @entity3 as he broke through on goal
on the stroke of half time , @entity56 hauled his side back in to the tie with an incredible 28 yard free kick that whistled past @entity61 on its way into the top corner
@entity7 improved in the second half , but could n't find a way through a resolute @entity4 defense
even when they did break through the back four , @entity67 captain @entity61 showed why he is one of the most respected goalkeepers in the world with a series of outstanding saves
with ten minutes to go , @entity4 manager introduced $ 50m signing @entity74 for his debut following his move from @entity77 .
