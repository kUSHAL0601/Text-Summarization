-- @entity1 , the digital assistant contained within the @entity3 , and ask : " why is it so hard to find good help these days ? " " i do n't know what you mean , " answers the robotic female voice
despite all of the quirky , saucy and entertaining responses to oddball remarks -- like " i 'm drunk " ( @entity1 returns a list of taxi services ) or " what do you look like ? " ( " @entity14 " ) -- @entity1 is unable to deliver on many basic commands
for example , the voice - command service refuses to launch applications
( " i ca n't do that for you , @entity21
i 'm sorry to let you down
" ) the @entity3 has an improved camera and a button on the lock screen to quickly access it , but @entity1 is not a photographer
( " i ca n't take your pictures for you
" ) @entity28 is embedded in the new version of @entity31 's mobile software , but ask @entity1 to tweet , and it says , " sorry @entity21 , i ca n't help you with @entity28
" a glaring omission , which would happen to be a major technical undertaking for @entity31 , is the inability for third - party developers to tie their apps into @entity1
at launch , @entity31 included data from @entity39 for restaurant and retail recommendations , and the @entity43 search engine for a wide swath of data queries such as city populations and currency conversions
however , the other 500,000 or so programs on the @entity49 ca n't interact with @entity1
@entity50 , who organizes technology conferences in the @entity52 , said he 'd like to be able to call up @entity1 to identify songs with @entity54 , get food delivered or order a product on @entity57
but this would be possible only if @entity1 's functions were unlocked in the same way a developer can access the phone 's camera or gyroscope
" my concern is that @entity1 will be more constrained by ' biz dev ' than by technology , " @entity50 said , basing his worries on @entity31 favoring @entity39 over @entity66 for local business reviews
what 's more frustrating is that the original @entity1 app , which @entity31 shut down after the @entity3 was released , was able to accomplish tasks through other services
it could order movie or concert tickets , book restaurant reservations using @entity79 , and call a cab via @entity81
perhaps an open framework is coming
@entity31 typically does not discuss future releases , and the @entity1 reborn for the @entity3 is less than a week old
on its website , @entity31 lists 18 apps that @entity1 works with , two of which , @entity87 and @entity39 , are @entity89 - only
the company says it is still working to add new features to the service
" @entity1 is currently in beta , and we 'll continue to improve it over time , " @entity31 's website says
for the things @entity1 can do , it ( she ? ) does them well
it can pull up directions , transcribe written notes , create calendar appointments , and remind me to take out the trash at 9 p.m. or whenever i arrive home @entity1 's voice recognition technology is adept at interpreting my mumbles and whispers
( it 's still awkward to talk to a gadget in public
) and whether i say " text " or " message " or " send an sms , " @entity1 knows what i mean
but as i turn to @entity1 more frequently , i have run into some walls
i can dictate text messages and e-mails , which can then be read back to me , but @entity1 wo n't read me my e-mail messages aloud , which would be useful for when i 'm driving
and @entity1 ca n't record audio to @entity31 's own app. " i have n't yet learned dictation , @entity21
you 'll have to use the @entity122 app for that , " @entity1 says
while @entity1 ca n't access songs contained within @entity126 , @entity127 or @entity128 , it can play an album from @entity31 's own music app , much like the old @entity132 feature
yet it ca n't start a movie stored in @entity31 's videos app. using @entity132 instead of @entity1 remains an option , which is convenient because @entity1 requires an internet connection
but when the phone does n't have web access , say in the subway , the system does not automatically switch from @entity1 to @entity132
customers around the world have complained that @entity1 can only operate in @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145
@entity31 says more languages , including @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 , will be integrated next year
maybe demanding an assistant be quadrilingual is asking too much
comedian @entity153 poked fun at the high expectations for @entity1 on his show , jokingly asking his phone to write lines for him
but as users get accustomed to shouting demands at their phones and having them fulfilled , @entity31 -- like its competitors in @entity164 's @entity163 or @entity66 's voice search -- has more work to do to translate into voice commands all of the functions that are currently just a few taps away .
