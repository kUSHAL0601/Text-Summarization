-- when the comedian @entity3 reportedly singled out a woman in his audience and suggested , according to a blog post that recounted the incident , it would be " funny " if she " got raped by , like , five guys , right now , " the online reaction was swift , heated and often split down gender lines
many men wanted to explain free speech or heckling etiquette
many women ( and virtually all feminists ) said these topics were distractions , at best , from the sheer offensiveness of @entity3 's attack
as we at the @entity20 watched hundreds of users comment on our @entity23 post about the incident , we saw the same disconnect
quite a few of the women who shared our post said they were doing so in hopes that a husband or boyfriend would " finally understand why i wo n't watch @entity3 's show with him
" some even tagged their husbands or boyfriends , to be sure the message would reach its destination
in the aggregate , these comments gave us a glimpse into the ongoing , low - grade conflicts between women who have been trying to articulate their discomfort with @entity3 's lazy , cruel and misogynistic humor , and the men who share their lives but just do n't get it
at the center of these disagreements is the rape - joke empathy gap
the problem is n't a failure of men to see rape as horrific
it 's that many of them do not perceive that rape itself lies on the far end of a broad spectrum of ways in which the idea of rape , the invocation of rape or the threat of rape is used to intimidate women or to regulate their behavior
when women are told that they should n't drink too much or walk alone at night or wear a revealing top , they are being given a guided tour of the boundaries of acceptable female conduct
women are supposed to understand that these boundaries are policed by rapists
we cross the line at our own risk
and if we are caught , the brutal punishment is one we have earned
@entity83 : if you do n't want to hear an edgy joke , do n't listen a comedian who shoots down an audience member who objects to his rape jokes by joking about her being gang - raped on the spot is n't being funny
he 's using rape to shut up a woman who crossed a boundary by speaking out of turn
@entity3 was free to say what he said , of course
but that does n't mean it was n't morally repugnant
what about rape jokes with less vicious punch lines ? here is the gray area where the empathy gap thrives best
there is absolutely room in both comedy and in feminism for discussions about rape jokes that highlight rape as a social ill vs. those that perpetuate that injustice
that 's why we joined with other feminist media critics and activists to produce a @entity121 " supercut " of rape jokes -- some insightful and some far less so
still , the presence of rape in women 's lives is too real and pervasive for many to laugh at all the same jokes that many men can
it 's not that women never enjoy crude humor -- a lesbian journalist friend recently confided in us her amazement that her wife is a fan of @entity3 's show , if not some of its more brutal misogyny
and it 's not that no man knows with terrible certainty what it 's like to be a rape victim -- one in five females and one in 71 males in the @entity150 are the victims of rape , to say nothing of atrocities around the world such as those described in our new report on rape as a weapon of war in @entity162
nonetheless , the significant overlap between the gender divide and the rape - joke empathy gap is real , and it seems inevitable when media coverage of rape so often focuses on what a victim should have done differently to try harder not to get raped
such shoddy framing creates a fictional image that there 's a certain type of woman who gets raped
women know that 's a lie , because they live the truth , but men may never have occasion to question that image , and so when they laugh at rape jokes , they 're laughing at an abstraction that 's all too real for many women
@entity3 and all those with the privilege to hold a microphone have a responsibility to shine a light on the reality behind the abstraction -- not to perpetuate it , and certainly not to silence those who bear its burden
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 and @entity196 .
