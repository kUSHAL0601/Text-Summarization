@entity1 , @entity0 -- clashes broke out between citizens and anti-riot police during a visit by @entity7 to southern @entity0 on monday
according to eyewitnesses , festivities welcoming the monarch in the southern city of @entity12 , 180 kilometers ( 111 miles ) south of @entity1 , turned violent when pro-reform activists were denied access to a royal event to launch a development initiative
youths threw stones at security services who responded with force , according to eyewitnesses in the city , home to anti-government protests in recent weeks
@entity27 , @entity0 minister of communications and government spokesman , downplayed the clashes , denying media reports that the king 's motorcade came under attack
" a group of citizens attempted to greet the king and started shoving security personnel who responded back
this is something you would find at any event , " @entity27 said
the incident comes a day after @entity7 's royal address to the nation announcing sweeping political reforms that political observers see as steps to place the country on the path to a constitutional monarchy
in a speech designated to mark the anniversary of the @entity53 , the monarch announced a number of reforms , including relinquishing his power to form a government to the parliament , a greater separation of powers and further constitutional amendments
@entity7 's monday visit came to announce $ 21.1 million worth of development projects in @entity12 , where protesters have recently called for the government 's dismissal , the dissolution of parliament and greater efforts to combat corruption
unlike other @entity72 states witnessing popular uprisings , weekly demonstrations that have taken place in @entity0 -- a moderate state and key @entity77 ally -- have called for regime reform , not regime change .
