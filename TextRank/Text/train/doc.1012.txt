@entity0 , @entity1 -- bad weather hampered recovery efforts friday as rescue teams combed a forbidding slope of an @entity1 mountain where a @entity9 jetliner crashed on a demonstration flight this week
rescuers found 12 bodies early in the day , according to vice marshal @entity13 , head of the @entity14 , who like many @entity1 uses only one name
it will take at least two weeks to identify the victims through dna tests , @entity1 authorities said
all 45 on board the @entity20 are feared dead
the @entity20 100 , @entity9 's newest passenger plane , slammed into @entity22 , a volcano south of @entity0 , after disappearing from radar screens wednesday
most of the wreckage is on a steep slope about 6,000 feet high , making it difficult to reach
the cause of the crash remained unclear
the @entity9 @entity30 said it has launched a criminal probe into possible safety violations
" we can understand how the families are feeling right now , and we want to do this evacuation as fast as we can , but the problem is the crash site terrain is unreachable by parachute , " @entity13 said at a news conference friday
@entity1 president @entity40 announced a joint investigation friday after a phone call with his @entity9 counterpart , @entity43
" i welcome the offer from @entity9 president @entity43 because the goal is to investigate what could have caused the plane crash , " @entity40 said
the @entity9 @entity30 had said 48 people were on board the plane , including eight @entity9 crew members
but the @entity9 state - run news agency @entity52 said the number was 45 , citing @entity56 president @entity55 as saying three of the people on the passenger list did not board the flight
the plane was on a demonstration flight for @entity1 @entity64 officials and representatives of @entity1 airlines , the @entity9 embassy in @entity0 said before the crash
@entity1 's @entity68 signed a $ 380 million deal in 2011 to buy 12 @entity20 100s , and press reports said a number of @entity68 employees were on the plane that went down
sukhoi employees are also among the missing
it was the first crash of a @entity20 , @entity52 said
the plane was on its second demonstration flight wednesday when it lost contact with air controllers at @entity0 's @entity80
the @entity20 jet arrived in @entity0 as part of a demonstration tour of six @entity85 countries
it had been to @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , and was scheduled to visit @entity90 and @entity91 after @entity1 , @entity52 said
@entity20 manufactures military aircraft and is known especially for its fighter jets
its civilian aircraft is narrow - bodied with a dual - class cabin that can transport 100 passengers over regional routes
it flew its maiden flight in 2008 and has had encountered problems in the past
in march , a @entity20 100 operated by @entity9 's @entity102 was forced to abandon its flight to @entity104 , @entity9 , and return to @entity105 because of problems with the undercarriage , according to @entity52
a similar defect in another @entity102 - operated @entity20 plane had to be fixed in @entity110 in december
however , @entity9 's state - run @entity111 said the defect did not affect passenger safety
@entity2 's @entity113 in @entity0 and @entity114 in @entity105 contributed to this report .
