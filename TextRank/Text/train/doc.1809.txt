-- @entity2 is facing life - threatening food and water shortages leaving millions at risk for starvation , the @entity1 said wednesday
a growing percentage of @entity2 's population has become dependent on humanitarian aid
" the @entity2 people are going through unbearable hardship , " said @entity10 , head of the @entity1 's delegation for @entity2 , in a written statement
" we are witnessing the worst tragedy of the past decade in @entity2
" @entity2 's last severe famine , from 1991 to 1993 , devastated crops , killed between 240,000 and 280,000 people and displaced up to 2 million , according to the @entity19 high commissioner for refugees
humanitarian workers view @entity2 's food crisis as one of the worst in the world
with winds ripping though the country , hundreds of thousands of @entity2 are finding their crops as dry as the surrounding landscape , preventing harvests , killing livestock and leading to a mass risk of starvation
the continual armed conflicts in central and south @entity2 have aggravated the situation , hindering people from accessing shelter and medical attention
a growing percentage of the population has become dependent on humanitarian aid
the @entity1 , @entity41 and @entity42 plan to deliver four months worth of food to 435,000 @entity2 within the next few weeks
international donors are being asked by the @entity1 to provide some of the emergency money
aid includes giving blankets , kitchen sets and other shelter supplies to 150,000 people
the @entity41 will be increasing the amount it spends in @entity2 to $ 163 million in food assistance , the group said at a @entity19 conference in @entity55 wednesday
in addition to drought and armed conflict , high inflation on food and fuel have also exacerbated the situation
similar factors have affected other developing nations in @entity65 and other parts of the world
@entity69 's food crisis has affected 4.5 million people , said the @entity71
as a result of widespread food shortages and little rainfall , an estimated 126,000 children are in need of medical assistance to combat severe malnutrition , while the @entity41 projects $ 193 million will be needed for urgent food distributions .
