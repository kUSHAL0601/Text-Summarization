-- @entity1 , the gym teacher who inspired the name of the legendary southern rock band @entity3 , has died
the band announced his death on its website , saying @entity1 died in his sleep early monday morning
" coach @entity1 had such a profound impact on our youth that ultimately led us to naming the band , which you know as @entity3 , after him , " wrote @entity8 , guitarist and a founding member of the band
" looking back , i can not imagine it any other way
our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time
" band lore has it that @entity1 was a coach and gym teacher at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 -- and a stickler for the school 's policy against long hair

the band formed in the early 1970s and had a string of acclaimed songs , including " @entity43 " and " @entity44
" in october 1977 , a plane crash in @entity46 killed lead singer @entity47 ; guitarist @entity48 ; @entity48 's sister , vocalist @entity50 ; an assistant road manager ; and the pilot and copilot
