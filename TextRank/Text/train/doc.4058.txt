-- on tuesday , january 12 2010 , the world watched in horror as @entity3 was struck by a catastrophic earthquake
at least 100,000 people lost their lives in the devastation
in the aftermath , many people around the world sent financial aid to help support survivors
but one young entrepreneur was so affected by the tragedy that he sat down at his desk to try to lend his professional skills to future relief efforts
having watched the disaster unfold on tv , @entity17 , a graduate from @entity18 and the @entity19 , began working on a tool that could be used to help in emergency response situations around the world
" if you remember the 2010 earthquake in @entity3 , you saw hundreds of thousands of people buried under the rubble
after an earthquake most people die in the first 48 hours
people who are trapped tend to die in the first 48 hours
and the international rescue teams came with their very sophisticated equipment , and did a fantastic job when they got there , ( but ) they did n't get there for 48 hours
and their tools , their fiber optic scopes , and all the kinds of equipment that they have , cost $ 50,000 , and are very hard to use
so , despite their very valiant efforts , they pulled out a few hundred people , but most of the damage was already done , " @entity17 says
the device @entity17 invented is called the @entity47 -- a small black probe about the size of a baseball , fixed with an array of sensors and cameras that can be thrown or dropped into dangerous environments
" the initial thought was , how could we create something that was easy to use , that could allow a first responder , or even a volunteer , to easily look inside a space to determine whether it was safe to enter it , to see if there was a victim inside , " @entity17 says
" and that moved from search and rescue , to police who often face hostage situations : aggressive shooters , or terrorism
to fire fighting applications , where people often want to search different rooms in a complex , before having to enter or decide whether there is a fire or not
so there 's a common problem across first responders of having to decide whether to enter a house or a space
and we are trying to make it cheap and easy to get images while they are out of there
" to develop the product @entity17 partnered with @entity89 , an entrepreneur who spent four and a half years as a @entity91 infantry officer
the @entity47 's cameras and sensors can quickly take panoramic images after being thrown into an inaccessible space
the impact resistant shell can also house heat sensors , @entity99 counters , vibration antennae or smoke detectors to provide different information in different kinds of emergencies , such as natural distasters or @entity107 hostage rescues
the ball then broadcasts its findings back to a mobile device to give users information on whether there are hazards ( or indeed survivors ) around a corner , or buried beneath fallen debris
the company , @entity118 , won a gold award of $ 50,000 at @entity120 , and was named one of @entity123 's @entity122 of the year
@entity124 , ceo of design consultancy @entity125 , said : " i think that the concept is really great in its simplicity ... there 's a lot of potential there , and there 's a lot of potential for doing good with it , because if you think about , the dangerous world that we live in , we need simple , robust , usable ideas that are embedded in great products
" @entity17 hopes to begin producing the @entity47 next year , and says he aims to keep the cost between $ 500 and $ 1000 .
