thousands of @entity0 celebrated the release sunday night of 550 inmates from @entity4 prisons , part of the second phase of the deal that won the freedom of captured @entity4 soldier @entity9
the revelry in the @entity11 in @entity12 -- the long - timehome to the late @entity0 leader @entity13 -- ran late into the night
@entity14 , general - secretary in @entity0 president @entity16 ' office , was among those officials greeting the line of freed prisoners , as they all paid their respects at @entity13 's grave
@entity23 ' armed wing , the @entity22 , welcomed the news even as they , like @entity14 and other @entity0 leaders , continued to push for the release of others in @entity4 custody
" it 's a great accomplishment , but it 's not the end , " brigade spokesman @entity29 said sunday night
" we will work toward liberating all our prisoners
" the @entity34 said in a news release sunday night that the @entity36 assisted in the release process , which it noted at 10:30 p.m. had been " completed
" it all follows a deal , signed between @entity4 and @entity23 in october , that won @entity9 's release from @entity23 in exchange for allowing more than 1,000 @entity0 to leave @entity4 jails
a total of 477 prisoners were freed in october under the first stage of the swap
phase two happened late sunday night with the departure of ten buses from @entity48 , said @entity49 of the @entity4 @entity50
the majority of the prisoners to be released sunday -- 505 , including four women -- were sent to the @entity54 through the @entity56 crossing
forty - one others were transferred into @entity58 through the @entity60 crossing
two prisoners were sent to @entity62 via the @entity64 crossing and two others -- a man and a woman -- were sent to their homes in east @entity69 via the @entity71 base
@entity14 , the senior official in @entity16 ' office , thanked @entity74 officials for their role in the prisoner swap
he also said that @entity0 leaders are still seeking the release of others " including the old , children and the ill ones and also the members of the @entity0 legislative council
" " we insist that going back to the negotiation table will not happen without the immediate halt of all settlement activities ... and the recognition of the state borders , including @entity69 , and the release of all prisoners as agreed to with the previous @entity4 government , " @entity14 said
ahead of the expected release , @entity4 security forces and hundreds of @entity0 clashed at a @entity54 crossing near the internment facility where the prisoners were being held
at least 20 palestinians and one @entity4 soldier were injured in the sunday evening skirmishes at the @entity56 crossing , according to @entity0 and @entity4 officials
@entity102 , spokesman for the @entity0 medical relief services in @entity12 , told @entity104 that many of the @entity0 suffered injuries from inhaling tear gas and from rubber bullets fired by the @entity4 security forces at the families and friends of the soon - to - be - released prisoners
@entity0 independent lawmaker and political activist @entity113 , who was at the scene of the clashes , told @entity104 that he had been sprayed with foul - smelling water used to disperse crowds and had been overcome by tear gas
an @entity4 military spokesman said some 400 @entity0 were engaged in an " illegal riot " at the crossing point and were throwing rocks and burning tires
the spokesman said soldiers were using riot control methods to disperse the crowds
@entity9 was captured in june 2006 , and spent more than five years in captivity
while the first stage of the deal to release him provoked significant discontent among some @entity4 , with the families of terror victims claiming the price paid for one single soldier was too costly , sunday 's release prompted very little attention in @entity4 media
" the first group of prisoners released in october is immeasurably different from the one to be released today , " @entity140 , head of the paroles department at the @entity4 @entity142 , told @entity104
" all 550 freed today were not directly involved in the injuring or killing of @entity4 citizens and most of them are members of @entity150 , " @entity140 said
@entity150 , the ruling @entity0 party , is considered in @entity4 as the most moderate of all @entity0 political fractions
" the list in the first part of the deal was largely dictated by @entity23 and was composed mainly of prisoners with blood on their hands serving life imprisonments
most of them were members of @entity23 and other extremist organizations , " she added
many of the inmates who were released sunday would have finished serving their sentences before the end of 2012 , @entity140 said
but some criticized the terms of the swap agreement
" this deal is a formality that does n't meet our expectations
the second stage of this deal did n't include old , ill or handicapped prisoners
it also did n't include the remaining five female prisoners inside @entity4 jails
this deal was solely controlled by the @entity4 side , " @entity178 , the @entity179 minister of detainees and ex-detainees affairs , told @entity104
" we will welcome and celebrate the prisoners in the @entity11 upon their release
the fact that the release will take place during the night will not affect our celebrations
@entity4 decided to release them at night with the wrong assumption that this will affect the intensity of the celebrations
the celebrations will start tonight and will continue for several days in different districts and towns , each prisoner will be celebrated in his own hometown , " @entity178 said
the minister said @entity4 had launched a large arrest campaign after the initial prisoner release in october
" as long as the occupation continues , arrests will continue , " he said , adding that approximately 3,500 @entity0 prisoners remain behind bars in @entity4 prisons .
