@entity0 -- ad time for next sunday 's " @entity6 " episode is apparently sold out , despite @entity8 's decision to pull its commercials from the @entity3 reality series , a @entity3 network spokeswoman said
hip hop mogul @entity11 announced his intentions monday to buy up any unsold commercial time on the controversial show in response to the withdrawal of the home improvement giant
he would use the ads to promote his prepaid @entity19 , " he said
" he has tried to buy , " @entity3 's @entity20 told @entity1 in an e-mail tuesday
" we are checking inventory
still do n't know on that one
i do think it was already sold out , but still checking
" if any ad time is left , @entity11 said he was standing by to take it
@entity11 ' website posted a statement tuesday saying " @entity3 has announced that @entity30 will not be able to purchase the remaining ad space as they have all been sold out
" " @entity6 " is an eight - part series that follows five @entity6 families living in @entity35 , @entity36
" each episode offers an intimate look at the customs and celebrations , misconceptions and conflicts these families face outside and within their own community , " @entity3 said in the show 's description
the controversy , and @entity8 's decision to pull their spots , followed a complaint by the @entity51
the group warned @entity8 's in a letter that the show " is attempting to manipulate @entity54 into ignoring the threat of jihad and to influence them to believe that being concerned about the jihad threat would somehow victimize these nice people in this show
" @entity8 's , a national home improvement chain , defended its decision in a statement to @entity1 last saturday
" @entity65 has received a significant amount of communication on this program , from every perspective possible , " the company said
" individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic , and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views
as a result we did pull our advertising on this program
" @entity11 , who is an outspoken social activist , sent a series of @entity84 messages over the last several days urging @entity8 's to reverse its decision : " @entity87 , we got over 21k signatures standing up against ur poor decision
do right thing : apologize & put $ back in # @entity92 " @entity11 called the controversy " a press nightmare " for @entity8 's in an interview with @entity96
" this country is built on religious freedom , " he said
" this is the kind of hate that tears this country apart
" @entity1 's @entity103 contributed to this report .
