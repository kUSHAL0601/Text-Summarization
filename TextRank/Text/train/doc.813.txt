-- you can keep your @entity2 and your blackbeards
the most successful pirate of all time controlled a fleet of more than 1,500 ships and upwards of 80,000 sailors -- and she did it all without the help of facial hair
tall ships like the @entity13 used to face threats from pirates as they sailed around the world
when a @entity19 pirate captain named @entity20 married a beautiful prostitute in 1801 , he was n't just getting the girl of his dreams ; he was making the best financial investment of his career
his new bride , known to history as @entity28 , or " @entity29 , " agreed to the marriage on one condition -- that she would share equally in his power and would be given the opportunity to help him secure more wealth
sounded like a deal to @entity20 , and for the next six years , the husband and wife teamed up to grow their piracy business along the coast of the @entity42 , as far south as @entity43
but then , in 1807 , @entity20 passed away
instead of stepping aside like a " proper " widow , @entity28 promptly took the reins
thinking outside the treasure box although clearly ahead of her time , @entity28 was shrewd enough to realize that the pirate masses were n't likely as enlightened
so , her first act as leader was to make her husband 's second - in - command , @entity52 , official captain of the fleet
while @entity52 led the men into battle , @entity28 focused her attention on business , military strategy , and the enormous task of governing a growing body of ruffians
in the years following her husband 's death , she steadily brought more and more outlaws under the banner of her @entity67
in fact , @entity28 was eventually responsible for nearly all the piracy in the region and her fleet exceeded the size of many countries ' navies
she also expanded the scope of the business , branching out from simple attack - and - pillage jobs to protection schemes , blackmail , and extortion
@entity28 's reach also extended to the mainland , where she set up an extensive spy network and developed economic ties with farmers who would supply her men with food
if @entity28 's business practices were exemplary , then her system of pirate law was nothing short of revolutionary
the code of conduct she wrote for her men prescribed much harsher punishments than previous pirate laws had
a disobeyed order was cause for beheading ( as was stealing from the common plunder ) , and deserters stood to lose their ears
ironically , @entity28 's most famous laws applied to the taking of female prisoners
ugly women were returned to shore , free of charge
attractive captives were auctioned off to the crew , unless a pirate personally purchased the captive , in which case they were considered married
of course , if that pirate cheated on his new bride , @entity28 had him killed
the not - so - bitter end murder , thievery , and intricate crime syndicates will eventually garner the full attention of the law , and @entity28 certainly had the authorities on her tail
but , here again , she proved more successful than her male counterparts
@entity28 repelled attack after attack by both the @entity19 navy and the many @entity129 and @entity130 bounty hunters brought in to help capture her
then , in 1810 , the @entity19 government tried a different tactic -- they offered her universal pirate amnesty in exchange for peace
@entity28 jumped at the opportunity and headed for the negotiating table
there , the pirate queen arranged what was , all told , a killer deal
fewer than 400 of her men received any punishment , and a mere 126 were executed
the remaining pirates got to keep their booty and were offered military jobs
as for @entity28 , she retired with her loot and her new husband ( former righthand man , @entity52 ) and opened a gambling house
she died peacefully in 1844 , a 69 - year - old grandmother
