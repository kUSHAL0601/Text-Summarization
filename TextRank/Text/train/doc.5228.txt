-- the @entity2 judge presiding over the @entity4 murder trial ruled monday that @entity4 's attorneys will be able to present evidence about how @entity7 may have been high on marijuana the night he was shot to death
@entity7 's toxicology report indicates that @entity11 , the active drug in marijuana , was in his blood at the time of his death on february 26 , 2012
@entity4 , a former neighborhood watch captain , is charged with second - degree murder for killing 17 - year - old @entity7 in @entity18 , @entity2
he told police that night that the teenager looked suspicious and that there had been several break - ins in the neighborhood
the two got into a physical altercation , and @entity4 said he was forced to draw his gun and kill @entity7
@entity4 's attorneys argued monday that the report shows @entity7 's judgment may have been impaired the night of the shooting and that it may have affected his decision - making
prosecutors fought hard against the admission of @entity7 's @entity11 levels , accusing @entity4 's attorneys of trying to get bad - character evidence in through the backdoor
judge @entity36 told prosecutors they could cross-examine expert defense witness who testify about the effects of @entity11
prosecutors can also call their own expert to contradict the defense 's case during their rebuttal
@entity4 's drug use has also come up in the case
@entity47 , @entity7 's family 's attorney , says @entity4 should have been tested for drugs the night of the shooting
a fire and @entity53 report says @entity4 was on the @entity54 and @entity55 at the time of the incident
@entity58 says @entity54 is a combination of two drugs , one that reduces stomach cramping and another drug that reduces anxiety
@entity55 , according to @entity58 , is a sleep medication that is used for the short - term treatment of insomnia
it is not clear whether @entity4 's drug use the night of the shooting will be admissible at trial .
