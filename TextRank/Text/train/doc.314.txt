-- there 's a pretty good chance that you missed @entity5 's first film as writer - director , the low budget @entity8 comedy " @entity9
" her second will be harder to avoid -- it 's a handsomely produced @entity11 heritage picture with @entity12 as @entity13 and @entity14 as @entity15 -- but nevertheless you should make every effort to do so
this flimsy vanity project cruelly exposes the @entity19 's limitations
it 's a tedious , vapid , threadbare movie that only a superstar could get made -- or would want to
for reasons we can only guess at , @entity5 evidently identifies with mrs. @entity15 , the @entity24 divorcee vilified by the @entity11 press in the late 1930s when she stole the heart of the world 's most eligible bachelor , @entity29 , the @entity13 and heir to the @entity11 throne
( despite his laddish demeanor , @entity5 's second ex-husband , " @entity33 " director @entity32 , came from a line of blue - bloods and baronets
) the @entity38 had no shortage of reasons to dislike @entity15 ; some valid , some pure snobbery
not only was this foreigner married when the affair got started , and already a divorcee , she was also rather unattractive by conventional standards
a plain @entity47 with mannish features who was inappropriately frank about her social - climbing aspirations
as if that was n't enough she was also on chummy terms with members of @entity55 's inner circle and , salacious gossip suggests , an expert in the @entity59 arts of lovemaking ( though @entity5 's having none of that , the movie is perversely sexless )
a less suitable match was hard to imagine , and in the constitutional crisis that followed , @entity29 was forced to abdicate in favor of his stammering sibling , @entity67
in other words , mrs @entity15 's hardly your typical " cause @entity69 Â© @entity68 , " though that does n't stop @entity5 from painting her as a feminist heroine in " the greatest love story of the 20th century
" in this high - gloss version of events , @entity15 is an abused woman ( viciously beaten by her boorish first husband ) , who compensates for her physical shortcomings with her sense of style , quick feet on the dance floor and candid @entity24 wit ( not that we hear any )
as for @entity29 , history 's @entity86 , racist and foolhardy womanizer is recast as a debonair sophisticate and improbable champion of the working classes
in the film 's most egregious line , @entity15 greets her royal suitor with an oh - so - casual , " i 've been reading that book you recommended about social reform
" @entity97 , and they dedicated the rest of their days to helping the orphans in @entity101 too
in a parallel modern - day story that manages to be even more dramatically suspect , @entity102 is @entity104 , the neglected wife of a handsome , philanthropic doctor ( @entity106 ) who wo n't sleep with her and drives her to futile in - vitro fertilization injections ( filmed in wobbly shlock - horror close - ups )
obsessed with her namesake , @entity104 spends several eons wandering through a @entity112 's exhibition of the @entity113 and @entity115 ' artifacts , catching the eye of a studly security guard ( @entity117 ) , an @entity118 intellectual who borrows the royals ' dinner service for an impromptu date dressed in a kilt and a bearskin hat
in superstar circles this is what passes for romance
despite these absurdities , " @entity129 " is nicely packaged and photographed
@entity14 miraculously makes @entity15 more interesting than this hagiography allows , especially when she starts to regret her great conquest as the trappings of wealth turn claustrophobic
there are inklings of a real movie in this somber coda , but the interminable modern scenes remain desperately trite , and just because @entity5 thinks it 's ok to turn a blind eye to fascism , there 's no reason to follow suit
as queen @entity146 is supposed to have said , " we are not amused
