-- five suspected pirates went on trial tuesday in the @entity3 in what is thought to be the first trial in @entity6 of pirate suspects
the trial of the five @entity10 men opened in @entity11 and is expected to last five days , said @entity12 , a spokesman for @entity13
the five were captured by the @entity15 in january 2009 in the @entity16 , off @entity10 , after a cargo ship with @entity19 flag was attacked , @entity12 said
" the ship of the pirates was destroyed by the @entity22 , and the pirates were captured and handed to the @entity19 authority
they 're being tried for sea robbery , and if convicted the maximum sentence will be 9 to 12 years , " he said
the men are @entity29 , 25 , @entity30 , 45 , @entity31 , 33 , @entity32 , 39 , and @entity33 , 32 , he said
a different suspected @entity10 pirate is awaiting sentencing in the @entity36 , where he pleaded guilty earlier this month to hijacking and kidnapping
prosecutors say @entity40 led an attack on a @entity36 - flagged vessel , the @entity43 , off the coast of @entity45 last year
he pleaded guilty may 19 in a @entity47 federal court to felony counts of hijacking maritime vessels , kidnapping and hostage taking , for his role in the hijacking of the @entity43 in the @entity54 on april 8 , 2009
@entity40 faces a maximum sentence of almost 34 years behind bars when he is sentenced october 19
the suspects being tried in the @entity3 spent four weeks aboard the @entity60 navy ship after their capture before being taken to the @entity3 , the spokesman said
they were held in pre-trial custody while the court interviewed witnesses from the @entity22 and seamen on the @entity19 cargo ship that was under attack , he said
five @entity19 defense lawyers are representing the suspects , he said
he did not know what plea , if any , the suspects had entered
@entity71 will soon try 10 suspected pirates who were captured in the @entity16 earlier this year
they were arrested after their attempt to board a @entity71 cargo vessel , but the @entity60 @entity15 ended the hijacking and handed them over to the @entity19 authorities , @entity12 said
they have since been held in the @entity3 , and @entity71 requested their extradition about two months ago
@entity0 's @entity80 contributed to this report .
