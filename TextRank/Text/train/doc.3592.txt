-- a killer whale at @entity3 died sunday while giving birth , the theme park said
the father of the calf was @entity8 -- the killer whale involved in death of a trainer in february
@entity12 canceled two shows on sunday , but all shows were expected to resume monday
" we are very saddened by this loss , " said @entity15 , vice president of veterinary services for @entity16
" although we understand that complications with pregnancy can occur here , just as they do in the wild , the loss of any animal affects all of us at @entity12
" @entity25 , a 20 - year - old killer whale , died from complications associated with the birthing process , @entity12 said
@entity25 had successfully given birth to three calves previously
" preliminary indications suggest that her death was caused by a condition in which the placenta is delivered before the fetus , as well as an unusual position of the fetus in the birthing canal , " @entity12 said
" she was not able to deliver the stillborn fetus naturally ; @entity12 's veterinarians attempted to assist , but her complications were too severe
" @entity12 has had 26 successful births of killer whale calves in captivity , according to @entity15 , who said the birthing success rate is about 50 percent in the wild and 85 percent in a " zoological situation
" a necropsy has been scheduled to determine the cause of death .
