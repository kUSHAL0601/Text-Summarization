-- the spread of the potentially fatal @entity4 respiratory syndrome has become more serious and urgent , the @entity1 said wednesday
at the same time , @entity1 said that -- for now , at least -- the illness known as @entity6 does not constitute a global health emergency declaring an emergency is " a major act " that can " raise anxieties , " said dr. @entity11 , the organization 's assistant director - general for health security
despite concerns about the syndrome , researchers have not found " any increasing evidence of person - to - person transmissibility , " he said
there have been 571 confirmed cases of @entity6 , including 171 deaths , according to the @entity1
the number of countries with confirmed cases expanded to 18 , with a case in the @entity26 , @entity1 reported wednesday
many of the cases are in @entity29 and the @entity30
even without any official worldwide alert , @entity31 , the head of the @entity33 's @entity32 , acknowledges that " this is a relatively new virus that does have a high fatality rate , " ample reason to pay attention
authorities have n't pinned down all the details about how exactly it arose and how it spreads , though @entity31 said , " we do n't have evidence right now that this is airborne ... the way the measles virus is
" " we do n't know as much as we would like so far , " the @entity33 official and assistant surgeon general in the @entity47 told @entity0 's @entity48 on wednesday
" ... but we 're tracking it and trying to understand
" @entity51 health care workers test negative two cases have been confirmed in the @entity53
both patients are health care providers who were working in @entity29
the first is in @entity57 ; the second in @entity51
two health care workers who came in contact with the @entity51 patient later went to an emergency room with flu - like symptoms
but they tested negative for @entity6 in a state test , the @entity33 said wednesday
the @entity51 @entity6 patient , specifically , was fever - free and continuing to improve wednesday while undergoing treatment at @entity70 's @entity69 , the state 's health department said
given the virus ' apparent roots in the @entity73 , @entity31 said it 's important that health care workers ask anyone who has suspicious " respiratory symptoms " where they have been in recent weeks
" more and more people are going to be traveling the next couple of months , so we really want clinicians to be on the lookout , " she said
commercial airlines are on guard as well , including efforts to make sure those who might have come into contact with the two @entity6 patients in the @entity53 did n't come down with the virus
@entity91 said in a statement that it is " working very closely with the @entity33 , and contacted our flight crew as soon as we learned of ( one such ) diagnosis
the @entity33 is in the process of contacting passengers to advise them of any necessary precautions
" " we are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring the good health of our employees and customers , " the airline said
and @entity104 said that , like all carriers , it " has a long - standing protocol for working with the @entity33 , as we are in this instance
the safety of our customers and employees is @entity104 's top priority
" one traveler who was on one possibly affected flight told @entity0 affiliate @entity114 that the call she got about one confirmed case of @entity6 left her " really scared
" twelve days after her flight , she said , her state health department called and sent her a note asking whether she had symptoms such as fever or cough , and also saying she should record her temperature for two weeks
" i was in shock that i could actually contract it , " she said
the woman , who did not want to be identified , said she and her husband so far had no symptoms
another traveler , @entity129 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity130 that the @entity33 called him twice in two days , saying he was on a flight from @entity132 to @entity133 with someone who had @entity6
he said officials would not disclose how close he was to the patient
four people -- each from different families -- have been tested in @entity139 for @entity6 because they were on a plane with one of the two confirmed @entity53 patients , said @entity139 health department spokeswoman @entity143
none of those four had any suspicious symptoms , she added
tests for two of them have come back negative for @entity6 , while the other results are expected in the next couple of days
@entity6 does n't spread like flu @entity6 , first found in the @entity73 in 2012 , is a coronavirus -- the same group of viruses as the common cold
it attacks the respiratory system
symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure
there is no vaccine or special treatment
besides those who contract the virus by coming into " very close contact " with someone suffering , @entity31 cited " a lot of interesting studies ... about camels and whether some sort of exposure to camels or their products might be important " in explaining @entity6 origins
while little is known definitively , " fortunately , so far , it has n't shown itself easily to spread from person to person , " she added
dr. @entity180 , head of preventive medicine of @entity182 explained wednesday on @entity0 's " @entity183 " that @entity6 can " spread in the context of providing health care
" that 's very important
and it has occasionally spread in @entity29 from one family member to another
it requires close , constant , over time exposure
" people who go to a doctor or hospital with respiratory symptoms should be asked immediately whether they 've traveled to the @entity4 or been in contact with someone who did
" if the answer is yes , you put that person in isolation , " @entity180 said
specimens are then taken and sent to the @entity33 for further testing
" that system is working , " he said
@entity51 's health secretary , dr. @entity206 , said wednesday that the case in his state " is contained
" " there is no broad threat to the general public , " @entity206 said
5 things to know about @entity6 @entity214 , others checked for fever representatives of 13 countries made up the @entity1 emergency committee that convened tuesday through a phone conference , the @entity1 said
affected countries need to take immediate steps to improve infection prevention and control , the @entity1 said
the majority of infections have taken place inside hospitals
defense secretary @entity228 got a firsthand brush wednesday with fear of the disease in the land of its likely origin
before a meeting in @entity29 with crown prince @entity236 in @entity237 , everyone entering the room with @entity214 unwittingly passed by a device screening for fever
its operators told reporters that they were checking for people who might be infected with the virus that causes @entity4 respiratory syndrome
they found no one with a raised temperature
who does not recommend such a tactic in general , @entity11 said
some @entity6 patients do n't have fevers , so just checking temperatures could " create a false sense of security , " he said
the @entity33 is not recommending that anyone change travel plans
the @entity259 has instructed its embassies and consulates in @entity29 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , and the @entity30 to provide @entity53 citizens with @entity33 's general guidance for infection control , a @entity259 official said
@entity0 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 contributed to this report .
