editor 's note : @entity2 is an associate professor of international relations at @entity4 , directs the university 's @entity5 and @entity7 , and is a research fellow at the @entity9 at @entity10
she is the co-author , along with @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , of " @entity14 : lessons from @entity16 and @entity17
" @entity18 says the @entity19 recognizes the predominant power of the @entity21
( @entity22 ) -- as an @entity21 of @entity25 descent , i swelled with pride when i heard that the @entity27 selected president @entity28 to receive the @entity29
the award further validates what the 2008 presidential election demonstrated : the @entity21 is the most mature and fully functioning multi-ethnic democracy in the world
despite its emphasis on multilateralism , the @entity27 's statement also recognizes the predominant power of the @entity21
the accepted wisdom among diplomats is that the international system is multipolar because of the increasingly multilateral governance structure of the world 's numerous international institutions
in reality , however , the @entity21 is by far the single greatest economic , military and political power on earth
furthermore , many international institutions are dependent upon the @entity21 for their survival
announcing the award , the @entity27 said " multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position , with emphasis on the role that the @entity55 and other international institutions can play
" the @entity19 thus joins a chorus of international forums that contend that multilateralism is the hallmark of the international system
today there are more formal and informal international institutions than ever before , and they share a common theme
leaders attending the @entity66 summit in @entity67 , @entity68 , on september 24 - 25 declared that the @entity66 , a collection of advanced economies and fast - growing developing economies , would replace the @entity72 - 8 , the long - standing group of advanced economies , as the " premier forum for our international economic cooperation
" this decision is seen in no small measure as bowing to pressure from states such as @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 that have powerhouse economies but have been left out of key international economic meetings such as the @entity86 , which includes the @entity87 , the @entity21 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93
the @entity66 leaders also agreed to increase the voting power of developing countries in the @entity97 by at least 3 percent and to shift the quota share in the @entity99 from developed countries to countries in economic transition by at least 5 percent
the @entity19 's sentiment was expressed at the @entity86 in @entity104 , @entity91 , in july when the @entity86 countries joined with the @entity106 ( @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity107 , and @entity108 ) , @entity109 and the @entity110 to declare : " our purpose is to foster a genuine partnership , in the context of a strengthened multilateralism
" that is similar to what @entity116 -- @entity81 , @entity93 , @entity83 , and @entity82 -- stated at its first summit on june 16 in @entity118 , @entity93 : " we underline our support for a more democratic and just multipolar world order based on the rule of international law , equality , mutual respect , cooperation , coordinated action and collective decision - making of all states
... we express our strong commitment to multilateral diplomacy with the @entity55 playing the central role in dealing with global challenges and threats
" the very next day , the members of the @entity136 ( @entity82 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity93 , @entity139 , and @entity140 ) put the matter more starkly as they concluded their summit : " the tendency towards true multipolarity is irreversible
" an increasing number of regional and international institutions with evolving memberships and leadership are multilateral
the world , however , is not multipolar
consider some important facts : the @entity21 has the largest gross domestic product defined in terms of purchasing power parity of any single state in the world ; it is surpassed in @entity155 only by the @entity110 , a collection of states ; and its gdp is twice that of @entity82 , its nearest competitor
the @entity21 accounts for approximately half of the world 's defense spending and it provides extended military deterrent cover for many of its allies , especially @entity166
whether it is the subject of positive or negative international public opinion , the @entity21 is a major source of cultural , political and social power in the world
in its recently released @entity172 , the @entity171 placed the @entity21 just behind top - ranked @entity173 , hardly a nation best positioned to lead the global economy
it is reasonable to expect that the @entity21 will soon regain the number - one position it held in earlier @entity171 competitiveness reports
international political , economic and military realities are not changed merely by declaring that they are something different from what they are
i believe the @entity19 knows this better than those writing communiqu√©s for the various international institutions
the @entity19 asserts that president @entity28 has " created a new climate in international politics
" in other words , it recognizes the @entity21 ' predominant global power -- power that does not appear to be diminishing and that is capable of shaping many of the multilateral institutions that depend on it
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
