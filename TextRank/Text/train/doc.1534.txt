@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 said wednesday that it had conducted a test launch of a medium - range ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead , just days after its arch - rival @entity6 tested a longer - range missile
the @entity1 military said in a statement that the launch of the improved version of the @entity14 missile was successful and that its impact point was at sea
the new version of the missile " will further consolidate and strengthen @entity1 's deterrence abilities , " the statement said , citing lt. gen. @entity17 , head of the military 's @entity18
@entity6 said last week that it had successfully carried out the maiden test flight of its longest - range nuclear - capable missile , which can apparently travel more than 5,000 kilometers ( 3,100 miles )
the @entity1 military 's statement did not give details on the range of the missile that it fired wednesday
the @entity14 missile that it tested in 2010 was able to hit a target about 650 kilometers ( 403 miles ) away
there have been positive signs in the relationship between @entity0 and @entity37 recently
president @entity38 of @entity1 met with prime minister @entity39 of @entity6 during a private trip to @entity6 earlier this month
it was the first visit to @entity6 by a @entity1 head of state in seven years , and @entity39 said at the time that he would be willing to make a reciprocal trip to @entity1 in the future
but distrust remains deep between the two nations
the @entity48 neighbors have fought three wars , two of them over the @entity57 territory of @entity58 , since the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into @entity52 @entity1 and @entity53 - majority , secular @entity6 after independence from @entity55
last year , both countries pledged not to let their fragile peace process unravel again over the range of thorny issues that put them at odds
in 2004 , they agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues , including @entity58 , terrorism and @entity1 's concerns over river dams on the @entity6 side of the border , which it sees as a threat to its water supplies
after that , successive governments held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony
but engagements were suspended in november 2008 after the terrorist assault on @entity83 , which left more than 160 people dead
@entity6 said @entity1 - based groups were behind that attack
over the past two years , @entity6 and @entity1 have held a series of high - level meetings in their bid to put their peace dialogue back on track , a process considered crucial to regional stability ahead of the withdrawal of @entity96 troops from @entity97
in 2011 , @entity37 and @entity0 agreed to resume talks
the two nations ' possession of nuclear weapons adds a worrying dimension to the tensions between them
the @entity105 on wednesday laid out a hypothetical scenario of what a nuclear conflict between two countries like @entity6 and @entity1 would mean for the world
" a limited regional nuclear weapons exchange " between two such countries " would cause major worldwide climate disruption , driving down food production in @entity118 , the @entity96 and other nations , " the physicians group said in a statement previewing a new report on the subject
that scenario would leave more than one billion people around the world facing starvation , according to the group , which was awarded the @entity126 in 1985 @entity2 's @entity127 and @entity128 contributed to this report .
