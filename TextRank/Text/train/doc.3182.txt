-- what 's to become of me ? @entity3 asks in " @entity4 , " one of the most successful and popular musicals of all time
that same question is fitting when it comes to @entity9
because like @entity3 , @entity9 has and is undergoing quite a transformation before our very eyes
@entity3 's metamorphosis happens on a @entity15 stage
@entity9 's on a political one
and as the plot thickens the audience is captive , wondering if either @entity20 Â© nue will meet the challenge : flower girl or presidential candidate ? but unlike @entity3 , who was a malleable and willing subject , in the ongoing musical that is @entity9 , the student has become the teacher
instead of ruing her lot as an outsider , she embraced it
and by doing so , in just a few years @entity9 has outmaneuvered , even leapfrogged her professor @entity31 , @entity32
so , regardless of her decision about a presidential run , @entity9 has positioned herself as the kingmaker of conservative politics
how did she do it ? perhaps by sheer shrewdness or sheer luck , @entity9 spotted an opportunity early on with a growing chorus of other self - proclaimed outsiders , the tea party , and seized on it
now , while the @entity46 straw polls , caucuses and debates play out , @entity9 simply orbits around it all , eclipsing her show 's extras , the supposed front - runners
in fact , it can be argued that some of the front - runners ascended to their current positions because @entity9 helped them get there
because of @entity9 's celebrity billing , her raising money and campaigning for @entity60 's congressional re-election in 2010 helped to elevate @entity60 's national profile
just before @entity9 joined her on the campaign trail last year , @entity60 wrote , " there is absolutely no one more in tune with the hearts and minds of everyday @entity69 than @entity9
" around that same time , when a politician with barely any name recognition above the @entity74 line needed a big name endorsement and some publicity to help get him re-elected , he called on @entity9 and she responded
@entity78 gov. @entity77 said then of @entity9 , " if there 's a bigger endorsement in the @entity46 universe , i do n't know who it is than @entity9
" that same year , in a stunning display of role reversal , when her former presidential running mate , @entity32 , faced an unexpectedly tough senatorial re-election bid , @entity9 once again became his leading lady
after @entity9 accepted @entity32 's invitation , he wrote , " i 'm looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail with my former running mate
" he went on to say @entity9 " energized our nation and remains a leading voice in the @entity46
" @entity60 , @entity77 and @entity32 are n't the only current or former presidential hopefuls to lavish praise on the former @entity99 governor
in what some call a cringe - worthy moment , in 2008 at the @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity100 nominated @entity9 as his party 's vice-presidential nominee
on the verge of losing his voice from speaking over a crowd yelling , ' @entity9 , @entity108 , @entity109 , ' @entity100 said , " hockey moms of the world unite
history will be made tonight and her name is @entity9
" ( @entity121 ) " we are looking for a beacon of light to show us the way
we are looking for an @entity69 who represents every one of us , who can relate to the needs of our families and the struggles of our country
we are looking for @entity9
" that was quite a ringing endorsement
in fact , all of them are
with her accolades caught on video , @entity9 need n't toil in creating campaign ads against most of the current @entity46 presidential candidates
" just roll the tape , " could make for another simple yet effective @entity9 catch phrase -- one of her specialties and let 's not leave @entity139 or @entity140 out of this cast
while a bit more muted in his praise of @entity9 , @entity139 has supported her in the past
in a 2008 @entity146 interview , @entity139 told @entity147 , " she 's been a positive addition to the ticket
i think she 's fired up the base and is drawing out volunteers
" and that same year @entity140 told @entity152 , " she has a stronger resume than @entity154
she 's been a real mayor
she 's been a real governor
" that was just the beginning of his supportive monologue about @entity9 live on cable television
it will be hard for the current field of @entity46 hopefuls to walk back what came out of their own mouths
they said it but @entity9 is using it to write her own script and lyrics in just what might turn out to be the presidential campaign of the future
how does it all end ? will she run ? only she knows
but one thing is for sure : @entity9 loves the drama and the spotlight
and they appear to love her , too
so , the finale of this musical depends on none other than the star , the writer , the producer and the director of the show , @entity9
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .
