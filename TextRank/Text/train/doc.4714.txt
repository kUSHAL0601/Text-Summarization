@entity0 -- @entity10 's @entity11 " love nest , " where her romance with @entity13 started , was trashed while it was on loan for filming of @entity7 's " @entity8 , " the owner of the dressing room trailer said
@entity14 spent more than $ 75,000 in 1963 , about a half million in today 's dollars , to create an environment fit for the queen @entity10 was playing
she rested away from the set between roman columns with walls and ceilings handpainted in the style of @entity11 's era
@entity25 , a @entity10 fan , bought the pink , lavishly - decorated 38 - foot travel trailer for $ 50,000 , her life savings , in june
but she only had two days to enjoy it before it was delivered to @entity30
it was a condition of the sale since the seller had contracted to rent it to the producers for a week of filming
" i was specifically told that it would come back in pristine condition and in even better condition than it was at that time , " @entity37 said
when she saw it again in july , she was devastated to see damage she estimated to be at least $ 100,000
photos show cigarette burns on fabric , furniture and even a portrait of @entity10
dishes , mirror and glass were broken
what 's worse is what 's missing , @entity37 said
an exquisite antique @entity55 rocking chair that @entity10 sat in after filming every night was taken
" i did not get to enjoy using the lavish @entity57 phone that she used or even her personal hair brush that probably still had some of her hair in it , " she said
who trashed @entity10 's trailer ? " only a psychotic and rebellious person or people would steal irreplaceable museum belongings and leave it in this vandalized condition , " @entity37 said
@entity37 said she suspects it was @entity7 , based on a studio employee 's comment to her that the actress and her friends had access to it each night after filming
but she acknowledges she has no evidence to prove it
she collected the cigarette butts left in the trailer , which she said appeared to be special cigarettes
but @entity7 's publicist said there was no way @entity7 , who he said worshiped @entity10 , would ever destroy anything connected to her
" this has nothing to do with @entity7 , " @entity87 said
" you should ask the producers about it
" @entity37 said she would like more information from the studio to help solve the mystery
" @entity8 " executive producer @entity97 did not return several phone calls from @entity1 on wednesday
his assistant said he was busy editing the movie
an insurance representative from the studio met with @entity37 to tour the trashed trailer in early august , but she said since then her calls have been unreturned
she is hoping media attention to her story will change that
" i want these things back because , truly , there is not enough money to replace these one - of - a - kind items , " @entity37 said
" these have been taken from me and my family who would inherit them
maybe they are still in the studio somewhere ? i was told they would be looking for them
" she had plans to make money exhibiting the trailer in @entity0
with many irreplaceable furnishings missing and others broken or marred , those plans are on hold for now , she said
" @entity8 , " set to air on the @entity129 channel on november 3 , chronicles the relationship and two marriages of @entity10 and @entity13
@entity132 : @entity7 's not right for @entity10 role
