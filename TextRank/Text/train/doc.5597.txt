@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 opened the door to a presidential bid a little wider over the weekend at the @entity6 in @entity1
and now veterans from her 2008 campaign and @entity9 urging her to run in 2016 are calling for her to use the state 's first - in - the - nation caucus to slam the door shut on the @entity14 nomination
their message is simple : if you win in @entity1 , you will be the nominee
if you let someone hang around -- or win -- you could cost yourself the nomination
@entity3 returns to @entity1 : a fresh start or deja vu ? " i think that @entity3 can close the door in @entity1
it is going to take a lot of work , but it is out there to be done , " said @entity23 , @entity24 co-chairman for @entity3 's 2008 campaign
" i think if she wins ... it would be very difficult , very unlikely that anybody could mount a challenge after @entity1
" @entity23 , who also ran @entity35 's 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns in @entity1 , said he has expressed this sentiment to @entity3 's closest advisers and aides
there is a level of bluntness in those who advocate for @entity3 to run hard in @entity1 , and it stems largely from her history in the state
some of it is self - serving
the more active @entity3 is in @entity1 , the more other candidates will be forced to campaign in the state
that means money for @entity1 's economy -- some economists estimate that more than $ 51 million was spent in @entity1 in 2008 around the caucuses
and it raises @entity1 politicos ' profiles
the other reason has more to do with @entity3 's record in @entity1
most @entity3 supporters in the state feel that the nomination was hers to lose in 2008 and do n't want the same thing to happen in 2016
during @entity3 's failed 2008 bid , the former first lady finished a dismal third in @entity1
she blundered several times in the state , none more stinging than when a memo written by then - deputy campaign manager @entity70 about skipping @entity1 was leaked to the @entity71
" i propose skipping the @entity1 caucuses and dedicating more of senator @entity3 's time and financial resources " to other primary states , @entity70 wrote
the plan was considered and then rejected
@entity2 reached out to @entity70 for a comment , but the now - chief of staff to sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , was not available
the fallout was swift and added fuel to the fire that @entity3 was running a detached campaign in @entity1
she began to cool down in the state just as then - sens. @entity88 and @entity90 ( who would go on to finish second ) got hot
@entity3 has called the defeat " excruciating
" she went into @entity1 in 2008 with a shrinking lead over @entity88 and @entity90
she is better positioned now , with 53 % of all registered @entity14 contacted in @entity1 saying they would support her if the 2016 caucuses were held today , according to a recent @entity2 / @entity97 poll
that number is triple the nearest potential @entity14 candidate
others have landed in @entity1 while she played coy in the beginning , for the last few months @entity3 has regularly admitted the worst - kept secret in the @entity104 : she is thinking about running for president
vice president @entity107 is in @entity1 on wednesday to speak to a group of nuns on the steps of the @entity111
independent sen. @entity112 of @entity113 held three events in @entity1 over the weekend
and @entity116 gov. @entity115 has visited the state three times this year and has 11 staff members on the ground
@entity112 calls for " political revolution " in @entity1 they and others have said they are thinking about running in 2016
a call for competitive primaries not all longtime @entity3 organizers are convinced that slamming the door in @entity1 is the best strategy to be ready for the general election
@entity130 , a longtime @entity1 politician and @entity3 's campaign co-chairwoman in 2008 , thinks that competitive primaries will " make her stronger , both politically ... and as a candidate
" " if @entity3 can come here and compete with other candidates and put it away , i am all for that , " said @entity130 , who also chaired the @entity134 from 1987 to 1991
" but i think it is important to recognize that it is healthy , it is a healthy thing , to have different points of view offered and discuss and it also usually happens
" some @entity3 supporters in @entity1 have also been cautiously watching some of those other candidates , impressed with their operations and commitment to the @entity1
though they all said @entity3 would win if she ran , there is a clear concern that someone could organize effectively and get hot at the right time -- like @entity88 did in 2008
but even @entity153 , the chairman of the @entity134 , who remains neutral in nomination fights , sees an @entity1 win as a way @entity3 could lock down the nomination early
" it seems to me that it is reasonable to think that way , " he said at an interview in @entity0
" why give somebody that opportunity to get that national presence if in fact she is serious about running ? " @entity153 , who was party chairman during the caucuses in 2008 , said that while @entity3 finished third , it was n't because she did n't have a lot of support from state democrats
instead , he said , it was because she ran into @entity88 's force - of - nature campaign .
