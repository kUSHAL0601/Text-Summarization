-- using high - tech robotic cameras , a team of scientists is getting a rare first glimpse of marine life in the @entity6 that could shed light on the ocean 's ecosystem and climate to as far back as 1,000 years
images of tulip - shaped sponges , brightly colored corals , delicate pink stars and feathery organisms were among the breathtaking marine life beamed up by a submersible robot that scoured the ocean bed at a depth of some 9,800 feet [ 3,000 meters ] off the @entity6 coast of @entity21
the team , led by @entity23 , @entity24 and including scientists from three @entity24 universities and the @entity27 , is in the midst of a 20 - day expedition to study 11 areas under the protection of the @entity32
exploring these areas is important because they contain the " trees of the ocean , " said @entity37 , research scientist with the @entity38 of @entity24
she is among the lead scientists in the expedition
" it 's been really spectacular , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity40 from her office at the institute as pictures from the robot streamed on her computer
" it 's really changing our perception of the diversity that 's out there
... we 're seeing new species in deeper waters
" @entity37 told the @entity56 that scientists potentially can look at the coral 's chemical composition and determine the temperature of the water and other data from 1,000 years ago
" that 's how we are able to say if there is warming or a change in climate direction , " she said
" in order to understand the present , we need to put it into context
" corals have been a highly successful life form for 250 million years
they are tiny animals and polyps that exist as genetically identical individuals and can eat , defend themselves and kill plankton for food
in the process they also secrete calcium carbonate , which becomes the basis for an external skeleton on which they sit
these calcified deposits can grow to enormous sizes over a long period of time and form coral reefs
the reefs are among the world 's most productive ecosystems and can harbor more than 4,000 species of fish and many other marine life forms
some estimates have suggested 20 percent of the world 's coral reefs are already dead and an additional 24 percent are gravely threatened
in the week they have left in the expedition , @entity37 and her team hope to collect samples and video from the depths of the ocean to gain a new understanding of these corals as well as other marine life
the underwater robot , operated by crew aboard the @entity111 ship @entity112 , is enabling the crew to go about 500 meters deeper than they have before
@entity37 told @entity40 the research will also help them evaluate areas that are still too deep for current fishing technologies but could be accessible in years to come
" this will enable us to give advice in the future about what types of organisms are in these areas before they 're fished , " she said .
