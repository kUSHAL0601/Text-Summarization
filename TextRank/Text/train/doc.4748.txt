the artificially chilled halls of the @entity1 this week are a sort of an out - of - body experience
thoughts of the month - long august break from @entity6 permeate nearly every encounter and phone call
it is as if lawmakers have been strapped to their desks for months
but a @entity13 analysis shows @entity14 has spent less time on @entity15 so far this year than in any of the previous five years
@entity17 members have been in @entity6 for 56 % of all non-holiday weekdays -- essentially , fewer than three days a week
senators have walked into the @entity1 for 61 % of weekdays
the weeks are not just shorter , but consistently so
the @entity21 did not have a single five - day work week in @entity6 for the first seven months of the year
@entity23 juggles assault on @entity25 , avoiding shutdown @entity13 counted days that lawmakers were in @entity6 excluding " pro-forma " sessions , which are technically considered work days but last only a few minutes and are usually ignored by members
the number of congressional work days now is significantly less than the high point of 2009
that 's when the @entity21 met for 113 days before the @entity36 , which is 24 days more than the same period this year
the @entity17 met for 19 more days in 2009 compared to this year
at that time , @entity37 was just beginning his presidency and @entity39 led both chambers and pushed an aggressive agenda
the time spent by members in @entity6 dropped sharply the following year and has decreased nearly every year since with each party controlling one house and partisanship defining the political climate
@entity48 : @entity14 oks cheaper student loans so @entity14 is definitely in @entity6 less
but there is a debate over how much that matters
longtime congressman @entity53 takes one view
" they do n't spend enough time in @entity6 , " he said , frustrated , " they do n't get to know each other
when they do interact , they are often in confrontational settings
... legislation is a very complex process
it takes a lot of time , a lot of give - and - take and you can not force it
" @entity53 , a @entity70 who served in the @entity17 from 1965 to 1999 , now runs the @entity71 at @entity72
he believes the shorter window in @entity6 squeezes out the heavy lifting of lawmaking and that a lawmaker 's hours in the @entity1 are filled with meet - and - greets , fundraisers and receptions instead of legislative work
" it got to the point when i was there , " @entity53 recalled , " that i had 15 appointments on tuesdays
you ca n't get legislating done in that environment
" but others question whether more time in @entity6 would change anything
" i ca n't imagine that they 'd be anymore productive if they were here more , " said @entity89 , senior fellow at the libertarian - leaning @entity90
" it 's not like they do a lot when they 're here
" @entity89 stresses that most major legislation is currently worked out behind closed doors by a few leaders and members of each chamber
while some in @entity14 , like rep. @entity103 , @entity104 , want to cancel august recess and force a work session , @entity89 thinks such a move would achieve nothing
" sitting here in august while the leadership meets behind closed doors would n't do much , " he concluded
gamesmanship intensifies as @entity14 approaches august recess members of @entity14 themselves seem divided
" the real problem is that when we 're here , we 're not doing anything , " said rep. @entity113 , @entity114
" you 're actually better off back home because you can work with people , you can deal with the folks you represent , deal with their questions and gather more information ... for when people decide when we are going to get back to work
" but fellow @entity126 rep. @entity126 , @entity127 , when asked if @entity14 needs to be in @entity6 more replied , " yeah , i think it 's important we address the challenges we face as a country
the reason i came here was to tackle those challenges
" conservatives like @entity89 are happy for @entity14 to stay out of town , theorizing that a better government is one that does less
the office of @entity17 majority leader @entity138 , @entity104 , which schedules the calendar in that chamber , defended the time away from @entity6
" it 's critical for members to have district work periods to hear from their constituents on a variety of matters , " said @entity138 spokeswoman @entity142 , " including chronic unemployment , the next steps toward addressing immigration and our debt crisis
" @entity142 stressed that the @entity17 has been active , passing legislation on student loans , job training , the @entity158 pipeline , cybersecurity and other measures
the office of senate majority leader @entity162 did not respond to @entity13 's questions about that chamber 's schedule
whatever votes either chamber has taken , neither has found time to fully deal with two looming fiscal crises
treasury secretary @entity169 has indicated the nation could hit its borrowing limit as soon as @entity172
and funding for much of the federal government is due to run out on september 30 , raising the possibility of a government shutdown without a resolution
as @entity14 leaves for august recess , most funding bills remain in limbo and there is no outline or even talks over how to address the borrowing limit , or debt ceiling
@entity48 : debt ceiling awaits some say that when members return in september , the logistics of the calendar will make things harder
" ( the schedule ) is very poorly arranged to get things done , " said @entity191 , chair of the @entity193 's @entity192
" it 's a series of starts and stops , punctuated by flights to and from fundraisers and their districts
" @entity191 and a bipartisan organization he works with called " @entity203 " would rather see @entity14 stay in town for three consecutive weeks and then recess for a full week
that 's similar to what @entity17 @entity206 initially planned when they took over the chamber - two weeks in @entity6 and one week at home
instead , though , the 2013 @entity17 calendar is dotted with small clusters of time and , as @entity13 found , a rate of being in town of 56 percent
that is the average , for long spans of time it can be less
in january , for example , the @entity17 was in the capital just seven days
@entity221 hammers away at @entity222 in @entity206 infighting
