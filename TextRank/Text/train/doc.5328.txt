@entity0 , @entity1 -- wealthy @entity4 businessman @entity3 has run three times for statewide office in @entity1 over the past few decades and has never won
it was n't that long ago that most political observers here and in @entity10 thought his fourth campaign would be a losing battle too -- a @entity14 race against popular @entity16 gov. @entity15
but now , several public surveys as well as parties ' private polls show @entity3 within striking distance of snatching the seat of the late sen. @entity22 from @entity16 hands
in interview at his campaign headquarters , @entity3 , who joked that the @entity27 is to the left of him , said he believes voters are now more open to his anti-government views
" i 've been a conservative in @entity1 before that was popular , " said @entity3
" i 've seen a change in @entity1
" @entity3 's leading argument to voters fits neatly on a bumper sticker his campaign is distributing : " no rubber stamps
" in television and radio ads , and on the campaign trail , @entity3 is pounding @entity15 -- warning voters he would be a " rubber stamp " for president @entity44 and the @entity16 - controlled @entity45
those are stinging accusations in a conservative state that voted decisively for @entity48 over @entity44 , and where the president 's approval rating is extremely low
still , in any other election year , those charges might not resonate against @entity15 , who is incredibly popular in @entity1
but @entity16 strategists say their internal polling and focus groups show that tying @entity15 to @entity44 , @entity16 congressional leaders and their policies is dragging him down
it could be heard in @entity59 , @entity1 , along the @entity61 parade route
" i think he 's doing a great job here and i voted for him both times he 's run here in @entity1 , " said @entity62 , who had just waved to the governor going by , " but going to @entity10 , it scares me to death that he 's just going to be a rubber stamp
" it 's a dichotomy that speaks volumes about the frustration voters have with @entity10
@entity15 says he knows it 's a challenge for him
" yeah , they 're mad
" he said in an interview , " the democrats in @entity10 are in control and so absolutely it resonates to them
the bottom line here is that people do n't want government on their backs and they want them out of their pocket
" @entity15 also admits that the president 's unpopularity in @entity1 is a real issue
" it has made a difference in my race , " said @entity15 , but quickly noted , " president @entity44 is not on the ballot
he will not be a @entity96 senator
he 's definitely not on the ballot in @entity1
it 's me " the " me " @entity15 reminds people of is the governor they really like who has brought the state 's deficit down and kept unemployment lower than the national average
" our state is stronger now than ever
most states are struggling to survive , " he said
" we have not cut any services
we have not raised any taxes
we 're still cutting the taxes , you know , and we have not laid anybody off
" @entity15 also boasts about the broad coalition of support for his candidacy , from the @entity116 , to the @entity117 , to the @entity119 and coal miners associations
" i am fiercely independent , " @entity15 said
he is now working harder to reinforce that image and distance himself from his own party 's policies that are unpopular in his state
earlier this year , @entity15 said he supported the @entity16 's health care legislation
now he wants to repeal all but a handful of provisions , like no discrimination for pre-existing conditions
" that 's a pretty good start
why do n't you start with that ? kill the rest of it
start with what you agree on , " said @entity15
he also said in an interview that he now believes if the near $ 800 billion stimulus bill was before him as a senator , he would have voted no. " you know what ? the expansion of that , that 's not who i am , " said @entity15
the federal government allocated about $ 1.5 billion in stimulus money for @entity1 , but @entity15 said he would only take part of that , and insisted he would spend it slowly and judiciously
@entity15 and @entity16 here are hitting back against @entity3 by painting the wealthy miner and media magnate as out of touch with @entity1 voters
@entity16 strategists have been pushing the fact that @entity3 's family lives in @entity156 , not @entity1
the @entity4 candidate told @entity2 the reason for that is because his 12 - year - old daughter has special needs
" there are not a lot of services around for that special child , and so we picked out a school that would be a very good school for her , " said @entity3
" but we have houses here in @entity1
this is where i vote
this is where i 'm from
i 'm running for the @entity14 , but i 'll do anything i can to take care of my children , " he added
@entity16 are also sending around a photo of a pink marble driveway outside of @entity3 's @entity156 home
" i think it 's a good freedom of choice and the last time i checked here in @entity96 we are free , even to have a pink marble driveway , " he said
but @entity15 's television ad hits the @entity3 - is - not - like - you theme on an issue , not a personal preference : @entity3 wants to end the mimimum wage
" minimum wage is something @entity193 put in during the @entity194
it did n't work during the depression and it certainly has n't worked now , " @entity3 said
" the laws of supply and demand have to start working
we have to get back to free enterprise in this country
" he emphatically defended what he called his " conviction
" " minimum wage has never worked in this country
it 's something that hurts a lot of youth employment in this country , " he said
the @entity4 @entity14 candidate also wants to eliminate the @entity213 , which he calls redundant to what the states are doing , and get rid of the @entity216 too
" it costs us $ 32 billion a year to have the @entity216
they do n't drill wells and they do n't dig mines , " @entity3 said
if @entity3 makes it to the @entity14 , he says he 'll also vote to do away with the @entity223
" we spend millions of dollars every year just for the right to pay our taxes , but once again , do we really need to do that ? why do n't we simplify it ? " asked @entity3 , who says he is considering a " fair " or flat tax
it is unclear how much support @entity3 has for those views in @entity1
what is clear is that to beat the popular governor , he 's going to have to rely on a lot of voters like @entity236 , the manager at @entity238 diner in @entity239
@entity240 said in an interview that he does n't know a lot about @entity3 , and does n't much care
" i just know that the primary thing about him is that he 's going to oppose @entity44 , " said @entity240
" that 's what matters to me
