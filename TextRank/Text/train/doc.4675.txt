-- a rebel group now in control of a key city in eastern @entity4 announced wednesday that it plans to " liberate " the entire country
@entity6 : desperate situation as families flee , says charity a spokesman for the rebel @entity12 group said its successful operation to take @entity17 on tuesday , the culmination of several days of heavy fighting against government forces , was just the beginning
" we will push on to @entity26 , then @entity27 , and finally take @entity28 and overthrow the government , " lt. col. @entity19 said to enthusiastic cheers from a crowd of several hundred at @entity17 's stadium , according to a @entity4 reporter there
@entity19 said that once the rebels overthrow the government , they will call for elections
rebels seize control of @entity17 amid clashes in @entity4 @entity28 , the country 's capital , lies nearly 1,000 miles to the west of @entity17 , the capital of @entity39
on wednesday , @entity12 consolidated its control of @entity17 , calling on policemen and the remaining government soldiers in town to integrate with the rebel group
@entity45 started to return to normal , with shop owners restarting their businesses -- some after closing their doors for several days because of the tense situation
@entity12 has called on schools and banks to reopen as early as thursday
the front line , according to the rebel fighters , has moved to the west of @entity17 , to @entity54
the @entity56 special representative for @entity4 , @entity57 , briefed the @entity58 on the " extremely serious crisis " in @entity39 by video link from @entity28 on wednesday
" the security situation in @entity39 as well as in other areas in the east of @entity4 has seriously deteriorated over recent days , and this is compounded by a vast humanitarian crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of @entity4 citizens , " @entity57 said
he also warned that violent protests against the @entity4 authorities , as well as @entity56 facilities and its staff , might spread to other parts of the country
the @entity12 's occupation of @entity17 and another nearby town , @entity75 , had been in the face of " significant resistance " by the @entity4 army , supported by @entity79 , the @entity56 mission in @entity4 , he said
the rebels were initially held in check but were able to come back with " sophisticated tactics , " he said , with their capabilities apparently bolstered by " external support
" " as we have seen in other areas occupied by @entity12 , the occupation of @entity17 also poses a major risk of increased serious human rights violations , including killings and forced conscription of civilians , including minors , " @entity57 said
the @entity56 has already received numerous reports of targeted summary executions of those who try to stand in the rebels ' way , he said , and there is an increased threat of sexual violence
@entity57 said he believed it was possible to roll back the rebels ' gains and restore stability , but only with a strong commitment from the international community
the @entity58 backed a resolution tuesday calling for sanctions against the rebel leadership and " those providing external support to the @entity12
" the @entity56 and some donor countries have accused neighboring @entity115 of backing the @entity12 by providing it with arms , support and even soldiers
@entity115 president @entity118 has repeatedly denied the allegation
@entity0 ireporter @entity120 , an aid worker with humanitarian group @entity121 , told of her grief as renewed violence in @entity124 , just outside @entity17 , forced her to flee across the border to @entity115
" yesterday , when i heard the sounds of the bombs and mortar , i just got depressed
i could n't control myself
i had to leave home again , " she said
" like most of my @entity4 , i feel humiliated by everything that we are forced to go through
i feel disgusted to leave everything behind and flee ... we had a normal life ; we could face poverty and many other difficulties ; we could manage all with the hope that everything will be fine one day
" but now we must flee
parents and children have to hide under the bed , in the bushes or wherever they would feel safe
now thousands of parents ca n't even protect their children ... this makes me very sad
" @entity145 spokeswoman @entity144 said tuesday that the @entity146 was " gravely alarmed by the rapid deterioration of the security situation in eastern @entity4 " and that it supported the @entity58 's call for additional sanctions against the @entity12 and its backers
security analysts say the rebellion in eastern @entity4 has dangerous regional implications , including the risk that it could lead to renewed conflict with neighboring @entity115
civilians are also suffering , observers say
though 1,500 @entity56 peacekeeping troops are in @entity17 and have control of the airport there , a @entity56 spokesman said late tuesday that the situation is at a " critical stage
" " reports indicate that the @entity12 has wounded civilians , is continuing abductions of children and women , is destroying property and is intimidating journalists and those who have attempted to resist their control , " said @entity165 , the deputy spokesman for the @entity56 secretary - general
a total of 6,000 troops from @entity79 are in the wider region of @entity178 , patrolling areas of particular insecurity , @entity165 said
the @entity56 , the @entity181 and countries in the region are demanding that @entity12 immediately stop its attacks , @entity165 said
@entity185 and @entity186 also expressed their concerns tuesday
the @entity188 said its minister for @entity190 , @entity189 , was traveling to @entity115 , @entity4 and @entity191 to support efforts to end the crisis
the eastern part of @entity4 , which includes @entity17 , has been embroiled in violence since 1994 , when @entity197 forces crossed the border from @entity115 fearing reprisals following the genocide
soldiers from the @entity202 were part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009
they broke away from the @entity4 army in april , however , complaining of a lack of pay and poor conditions
tens of thousands of @entity4 , already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region , have fled camps around the edges of @entity17 , according to @entity216 and the medical charity @entity217
@entity0 's @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report .
