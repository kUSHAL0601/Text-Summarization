@entity0 , @entity1 -- students and professors at @entity5 are protesting @entity7 's appointment to a campus think tank , saying the former defense secretary does not uphold the " ethical values " of the school
@entity7 has been appointed to the @entity12 , a think tank at @entity5
shortly after @entity7 's appointment was announced in september , professor @entity13 began an online petition from faculty members opposed to bringing him to the @entity12
since then , the petition has gained more than 3,500 signatures , including nearly 300 faculty members from such diverse disciplines as law , computer science , electrical engineering and drama
" we view the appointment as fundamentally incompatible with the ethical values of truthfulness , tolerance , disinterested inquiry , respect for national and international laws , and care for the opinions , property and lives of others to which @entity5 is inalienably committed , " the petition reads
" as word of the letter got out , my inbox was flooded with messages from professors , students , staff and alumni asking to sign on , " said @entity40 , a professor of art history
the petition 's signers include hundreds of @entity5 students in addition to the faculty
" he 's a war criminal , " said @entity55 , one petitioner , who also created a @entity58 group called " @entity7 -- you are not welcome at @entity5 ! " " he 's not worthy as an established member of @entity5 , " @entity55 said
despite the protests , school officials say that it is well within the @entity12 's right to appoint @entity7
" there are lots of temporary appointments made around the university , " said @entity67 , special assistant to @entity5 president @entity68
" departments have the right to invite people to campus in a variety of capacities
" @entity7 's one - year appointment as @entity80 places him on a task force on terrorism and ideology
he will be joined by current @entity85 @entity84 , secretary of state under @entity86
despite being housed in a tower on the center of campus , @entity85 has only loose affiliation with the university
meanwhile , supporters of @entity7 's appointment say that his presence on campus will help foster academic dialogue and fuel positive political discourse
the outcry against @entity7 follows last april 's attempt by president @entity100 to visit campus
@entity100 planned to meet with fellows at the @entity12 but was blocked by protesters
his meeting was later moved to @entity106 's nearby house
" many of us believe that @entity7 , in his role as secretary of defense , has behaved in ways that are dishonorable , disgraceful and always disingenuous , " said dr. @entity107 , professor emeritus of psychology
" @entity7 authorized a list of interrogation methods that violated the @entity121 and the @entity122 used on detainees at @entity124 ... and @entity126 's @entity125 , " said @entity107 , whose most recent book , " @entity115 , " finds that given the right " situational " influences , anyone can be made to participate in violent and depraved acts
@entity40 said her position does not discourage debate or public exchange of ideas
" let me stress that the petition objects to @entity7 's appointment as @entity80 , an appointment we find without merit , " @entity40 said
" in fact , there is nothing in the language of the petition that says mr. @entity7 is forbidden to air his views at @entity5 or is not welcome for a public lecture or open forum
" but not everyone disagrees with the appointment
" personally i disagree with his politics , " said @entity147 , a political science major
" but at the same time , i 'm not sure i think it would be prudent for the university to refuse hiring him just because most students disagree with his politics
i know i would hate it if i went to school in @entity157 and the university refused to hire a prominent liberal politician just because most of the student body was conservative
