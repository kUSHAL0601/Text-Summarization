@entity0 , @entity1 -- the high school honor student and the @entity5 's highest - paid defensive back stroll down the destitute streets of @entity7
" i can sell you something right quick , " a drug dealer hisses
another shouts , " gon na whoop your ass ! " more expletives are hurled
seventeen - year - old @entity14 is giving a tour to @entity16 , showing the @entity5 star the streets that he and his sister used to walk to get to school while living in a @entity7 homeless shelter
prostitutes , addicts and drug dealers scatter
" camera ! camera ! " they shout
the two make it safely past the park , one of the roughest areas of @entity0
an orange soda whizzes through the air , nearly hitting the teen and the @entity35 ' all - pro cornerback worth $ 45 million
" wow , " the teen says
" i 'm sure they watch you every sunday , and they do n't even recognize who you are
" it is @entity14 's inner strength and his love for education that have brought together this high school class president and @entity5 star
" the thing i took away is how fearless he is , " @entity16 said later
" the things he 's been through are so big and so severe -- they were threatening our lives and throwing things at us on @entity7
but it does n't bother him
" his potential meter is at 1,000 right now
" escaping through education even while @entity14 lived on @entity7 , he dreamed of attending @entity57 to become a neurosurgeon
when @entity16 saw @entity14 's story on @entity2 , he wanted to help
he runs a foundation , the @entity60 , that takes talented inner - city kids on tours of college campuses they otherwise would never be able to see
he 's helped get 25 teens into college over the last four years
on this day , he 's come to tell @entity67 that he will be among the 16 students traveling in the spring to visit schools in @entity70 " i 'm thankful to be able to give back , " @entity16 said
hours before the @entity7 tour , @entity16 traveled to @entity73 's @entity72 , where @entity14 is a starting running back in his senior year
they met at the school 's football stadium , where @entity16 told @entity14 in person
" this smile on my face , " @entity14 said , " is a freaking good thing
this is awesome ! " @entity16 leaned closer
" you know who we 're working on now ? " " @entity86 ? " @entity14 asked nervously
" we have to , " the @entity5 star replied
@entity14 's fever - pitched excitement reached a crescendo , " oh my gosh ! " his father , @entity91 , joined in and handed a folded paper to @entity16
the proud dad did n't show off football awards or his son 's athletic achievements
instead , it 's @entity14 's latest report card , straight a 's
" he might overqualify for the tour , " @entity16 said as he studied the report card
" this shows someone with a lot of drive and ambition
these are some great grades
" " i 'm at a loss for words , " the teen said
" stuff like this does n't happen every day
" @entity16 came from a family where education was stressed from day one
he remembers asking his mom as a boy , " can i have some ice cream ? " " no , " she responded
" you have n't finished your homework
" " i 'd say , ' but i 'm 3 ! ' " @entity16 's sister is a pediatrician , his mother holds a doctorate
two other siblings have secondary degrees
" i am the least educated in my family , " @entity16 said
" i catch a lot of heat from my family
" the football star , who is the highest - paid defensive back in @entity5 history , has a degree in finance from the @entity131
" i 'm going to be the first one in my family to get a secondary education , " he told @entity16
" and everyone will follow you , " his father added
@entity14 spent his sixth - grade year living in a van with his mother and stepfather
his sister once was beaten up by someone who wanted her shirt
@entity14 was held up at gunpoint for his laptop
he refused to hand it over because his grandmother bought it for him
" if you 're going to shoot me , shoot me now , " he told the would - be thief
" he said , ' i ai n't gon na kill no little kid
' " mantra : always keep your head up from february to august of this year , @entity14 lived at the @entity155 homeless shelter along @entity7 with his father and sister
after the @entity2 piece aired , his friend invited him and his sister , @entity160 , to stay with his family , while @entity14 's father looked for work
outside @entity14 's earshot , the @entity5 star talked about how the teen is an inspiration , doing all the right things to achieve greatness in life
" you do n't hear about guys like @entity14 , " @entity16 said
" when you have your back against the wall and you 're trying to fight and there are so many things -- so many obstacles -- against you but you 're still keeping your head above the water like he 's doing ... the sky 's the limit
" @entity14 says he constantly thought about dropping out to get a job to help his father financially
his dad would have none of it
" your education will pay off in the long run , " his father always told him
on the tour at @entity7 , @entity14 took @entity16 to the shelter 's rooftop
it 's a million - dollar view of the @entity0 skyline
it 's where @entity14 studied
it 's also where he learned his biggest lesson : to always keep his head up
the student and the football player leaned over the building 's ledge
down below , drug deals were being made
" anytime you look down over the ledge , you start to see the negative , " @entity16 said
" when you keep your head up , you 're seeing all the positive
was that your mantra ? " the teen smiled
" that 's how you do it in life , " @entity14 said
" i just try to keep my head up , to look into the future
" five years from now , he 'll be graduating from college
the hell of @entity7 will be a distant memory
" once i succeed , " he said , " i will be able to help other people
" @entity2 's @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report .
