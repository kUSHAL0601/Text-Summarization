@entity0 said in a report on wednesday
@entity7 says @entity4 used white phosphorus shells over populated areas in @entity8
" in @entity8 , the @entity4 military did n't just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops , " said @entity14 , a @entity7 senior emergencies researcher
" it fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas , even when its troops were n't in the area and safer smoke shells were available
as a result , civilians needlessly suffered and died
" entitled " @entity27 : @entity4 's @entity28 of @entity29 in @entity8 , " the 71 - page report provides " witness accounts " and " presents ballistics evidence , photographs , and satellite imagery , as well as documents from the @entity4 military and government
" @entity7 is an independent international organization dedicated to defending and protecting human rights
the group urged @entity4 and the @entity40 to investigate the attacks
@entity4 should prosecute those who carried them out and the @entity40 government , which supplied @entity4 , should look into the issue
@entity7 said white phosphorous was a chemical substance dispersed in artillery shells , bombs and rockets , used primarily to obscure military operations
" ( while ) it is not considered a chemical weapon and is not banned per se , it ignites and burns on contact with oxygen and creates a smokescreen at night or during the day to mask the visual movement of troops
" it also interferes with infra - red optics and weapon - tracking systems , thus protecting military forces from guided weapons such as anti-tank missiles
when @entity29 comes into contact with people or objects , though , it creates an intense and persistent burn
it can also be used as a weapon against military targets , " the group said
in response , the @entity4 military said " smoke shells are not an incendiary weapon " and defended its actions
the @entity76 said it was close to completing its probe into " the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous
" " ( the invesitgation ) is dealing with the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous , including , among others , the 155mm smoke shells which were referred to in the @entity7 report
this type of ammunition disperses in the atmosphere and creates an effective smoke screen
it is used by many @entity98 armies
" it is already possible to conclude that the @entity76 's use of smoke shells was in accordance with international law
these shells were used for specific operational needs only and in accord with international humanitarian law
the claim that smoke shells were used indiscriminately , or to threaten the civilian population , is baseless , " the @entity76 said
it said " that weapons intended for screening are not classed as incendiary weapons
" but @entity14 said past @entity76 investigations into allegations of wrongdoing suggest their inquiry would be neither thorough nor impartial
" that 's why an international investigation is required into serious laws of war violations by all parties
" for the needless civilian deaths caused by white phosphorus , senior commanders should be held to account , " @entity14 said
the report said white phosphorus munitions were n't illegal when deployed properly in open areas , but it determined that the @entity76 repeatedly used them " unlawfully over populated neighborhoods , killing and wounding civilians and damaging civilian structures , including a school , a market , a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital
" " first , the repeated use of air - burst white phosphorus in populated areas until the last days of the operation reveals a pattern or policy of conduct rather than incidental or accidental usage
second , the @entity76 was well aware of the effects of white phosphorus and the dangers it poses to civilians
third , the @entity76 failed to use safer available alternatives for smokescreens , " the report said
a medical report prepared during the recent hostilities by the @entity156 said that white phosphorus " can cause serious injury and death when it comes into contact with the skin , is inhaled or is swallowed
" the report said that the @entity76 could have used a non-lethal smoke shells produced by an @entity4 company if it wanted to provide a " smokescreen " for its troops
@entity4 launched the offensive in late december to take on militants from @entity170 , who had been shelling southern @entity4 communities for months from @entity8
the offensive , called @entity173 , was launched december 27 and ended january 17 with a cease - fire
of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict , 1,440 were @entity179 , including 431 children and 114 women , a @entity176 report recently said
the 13 @entity4 killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by @entity170 , and four soldiers killed by friendly fire , it said
@entity7 also said it found no evidence that the @entity170 militants @entity4 was targeting in @entity8 were using human shields " in the vicinity at the time of the attacks
" @entity4 has said @entity170 militants used civilians as human shields and fought from civilian locations , @entity7 points out
" in some areas @entity179 fighters appear to have been present , but this does not justify the indiscriminate use of white phosphorus in a populated area
