add two more to what 's the possibly largest club in @entity2 : republicans who might seek their party 's 2016 nomination
on @entity11 's " @entity10 " on sunday , @entity7 sen. @entity6 , who just a won third term , sidestepped a question from chief political analyst @entity13 about whether he was thinking of running
" i 'm thinking of trying to fix illegal immigration and replacing sequestration
i will let you know if i think about running for president
it 's the hardest thing one could ever do
" you go through personal hell
you have got to raise a ton of money
i 'm nowhere near there
" @entity13 followed up : " is that a maybe , though ? it 's a maybe ? " @entity6 , however , would n't go any further , staring straight into the camera and answering , " it 's what i just said
" on the same program , former sen. @entity28 of @entity29 , who ran in 2012 with the strong backing of the social conservative wing of the party , told @entity13 he was seriously thinking about doing it again
" i 'm doing everything consistent with a run in 2016 , but i have n't made any final decisions
" @entity28 , who won the 2012 @entity39 caucuses , visited the state several times recently , including twice last month .
