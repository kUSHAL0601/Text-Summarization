-- the gunman showed that he was human
most of the others who stalked the lobby of @entity6 's @entity5 were young , brash , hostile @entity8 diehards
yet this man in his 50s , armed with a @entity11 , longed to see his children
his kids were out there somewhere in the @entity16 capital , he said , gunfire and explosions erupting around them
" i really miss my family , too , " @entity0 producer @entity19 told him in @entity20
" i really want to go out and see my family
they 're worried about me
" tears welled in the gunman 's eyes
rebels were taking over the @entity16 capital
and this man , who had known nothing but the @entity8 regime for 42 years , wanted to go home , too
it was in this moment that @entity19 knew she had a chance
if the three dozen journalists being held against their will inside the five - star hotel for five days had a shot of being freed , it was now
at 29 , @entity19 has a lifetime of experience in hostile regions
a native of @entity43 who is fluent in @entity20 and @entity44 , she 's a stalwart of @entity0 's @entity46 bureau and known for her professionalism , persistence and persuasiveness
if you encounter trouble , you want her at your side
she 'd come to @entity16 weeks before , meeting up with @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity53
she 'd built relationships with the government officials , media minders and security in the hotel , including this gunman
now she and an @entity20 - speaking cameraman from another news organization were negotiating to secure the journalists ' safe release
on her @entity65 page , @entity19 lists her favorite quote : " life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well - preserved body , but rather to skid in sideways , thoroughly used up , totally worn out , champagne in one hand ... strawberries in the other and screaming : ' @entity77 ! what a ride ! ' " in the @entity5 , @entity19 was n't ready for life 's wild ride to end
phoning home to say goodbye it had become apparent days earlier that the journalists -- from an array of news organizations , including @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity91 's @entity90 -- were prisoners of a dying @entity8 regime
the government officials and minders who 'd monitored the journalists abandoned the hotel august 21
about 15 gunmen loyal to the regime remained behind , roaming the halls with @entity101 assault rifles
they told the journalists they could not leave the hotel
most of the loyalists were irritable , young , reckless
they adorned their weapons with the green flag of @entity8 's regime
to avoid contact with this volatile bunch , the journalists moved to an upper floor
a hotel chef initially took care of the group
one 21 - year - old gunman -- a " nice guy , " @entity19 says -- ran through the hotel with his jeans covered in the blood of his cousin , killed in the fighting outside
by monday , tensions between the journalists and their captors escalated
gunfire erupted outside the hotel , and smoke could be seen coming from the direction of @entity8 's nearby compound
" @entity132 spies , " they shouted
" there are spies amongst the journalists ! " they walked amid the journalists , their guns drawn
they were angry , bitter
" this could really turn out terribly for us , " chance thought
the journalists tried not to antagonize
" we all had a calm panic , if there is such a thing , " he recalled
the gunmen 's belligerence sparked paranoia " about being taken hostage , about being held prisoner , about being executed
" " it dawned on us : if they 'd been given orders to take us as prisoners or to execute us , there was nothing we could do
" that loss of control -- the realization that their fate rested with the men holding guns -- led to the darkest thoughts : that they would n't make it out alive
chance phoned his mother and wife to tell them what to do with his remains
his wife put his 5 - year - old daughter on the line
if this was a final goodbye , his only child needed to hear daddy 's voice
the veteran correspondent who has covered conflicts in the @entity187 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 did n't tell his girl about the danger he faced
he spoke instead of the new school year
" you 're going to start school in two weeks , " he said
" promise me that you 'll work really hard at school
" " yes , poppa , i promise you
" " be a good girl for me and mommy
" " poppa , i will
he was 2,000 miles from his home in @entity198
he wanted nothing more than to see his girl on her first day of school
he just was n't sure if he 'd make it
snipers fired into the hotel , shattering windows and rattling nerves
chance and the others spent 36 hours face - down on the floor with little food or water
with frequent power outages , it was difficult to follow the events of @entity6 outside the walls of the hotel
but work kept @entity53 focused
he tweeted using his smartphone , used a satellite phone or called friends and dictated his thoughts
at one point tuesday , he leaned over a balcony overlooking the hotel 's interior courtyard , which the gunmen patrolled
" i suppose you 're happy now that @entity16 are killing @entity16 , " one shouted
connecting " as a human " the sound of artillery fire pierced the morning calm wednesday
the gunmen had grown increasingly hostile the day before
the group worried about what lay in store
about 6 a.m. , all of the gunmen except the older one left the hotel
@entity19 and the arabic - speaking cameraman approached him
a day earlier , she had overheard him telling the younger gunmen to remain calm and be good to the journalists : " we want them to go back to their countries and say good things about us -- how @entity16 are brave people
" now @entity19 and the cameraman told him what they understood : @entity8 's regime had fallen
when a man who called himself a soldier entered the hotel , the gunman asked about the situation outside
" you were out there
tell me , what 's really going on ? is it what they are telling us ? " yes , he was told
the rebels were indeed in control
@entity8 's rule of @entity16 was over
@entity19 seized the moment with an emotional plea
her family missed her , she told him , as did the families of the three dozen other journalists
" think about your kids , " she said
" you 're left here alone
" at first , the man defended @entity8 , saying that he had brought democracy to @entity16 , that the nation thrived under his leadership
earlier , he 'd told @entity19 that he was protecting the journalists
that he wanted his children to know that he 'd fight to the end
@entity19 and the cameraman reminded him that all the senior officials -- and now even his young comrades -- had abandoned him
it was time to give up
" slowly , he started to change
" the cameraman slowly stripped the soldier and gunman of their weapons
now unarmed , the man looked at the journalists and said , " you can go now
" @entity19 immediately began negotiating with the @entity299 to get cars to the hotel
before she left , she told the man goodbye
" @entity19 , get out of here , " he said
there will be a bloodbath for years to come
" chance watched nearby as his colleague talked with the guard
" i watched this transformation these guys made from being @entity8 hardliners to realizing that his regime was a historically past moment
that was a remarkable transition to witness
" i think it 's the most moving part of this whole crisis
" says @entity19 : " in the end , we 're all human
and that 's what this was about , connecting with him as a human
" stepping outside the @entity5 , the journalists worried about snipers
cars with the @entity87 and the @entity299 pulled up
all journalists are out ! " chance tweeted
in the car , he called @entity0
speeding through @entity6 , he described the end of their hellish ordeal
@entity19 sat next to him , tears streaming down her face , the weight of recent days crashing down
" we would n't be here if it were n't for her , " chance said later
but @entity19 praised the cameraman
" it was a team effort
" chance 's daughter will soon see her poppa
he plans to be home for her first day of school september 5
but first he stopped at the newly named @entity355 , where joyous @entity6 residents showered him with flowers
" they 're not celebrating my freedom , " he said
" they 're celebrating @entity16 's freedom
" @entity19 was struck by the disparate scene from a week ago , when @entity6 was filled with unhappy faces
today , she noted , everyone seemed to wear smiles
@entity8 's images have been torn down
" i came out to a new @entity16 , " she said
on thursday , the day after her release , she did the unthinkable
she returned to the hotel to gather her personal belongings
" i got a bit freaked out when we got close , " she said
" but the first thing i saw was a rebel flag hanging on the @entity5
" soon , she was back in a car , crossing the border into @entity376 , headed home
as she 'd told the gunman , she longs to see her loved ones
@entity0 's @entity380 contributed to this report .
