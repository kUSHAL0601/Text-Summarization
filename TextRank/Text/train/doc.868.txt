@entity0 , @entity1 -- their stunt - laden movies have put them among the biggest names in @entity7 -- and this was a stunt made to match the world 's most famous film festival
a who 's - who of action heroes stunned promenaders on the croisette by arriving in @entity0 on tanks ! @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 - and then those other stars whose cause is helped by the addition of a surname -- @entity26 ( @entity25 ) , @entity28 ( @entity27 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , @entity30 ( @entity29 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 ) and , er @entity35 ( @entity35 )
the muscular military parade came to a halt outside the @entity38 -- the grandest destination on @entity0 ' main boulevard -- where the assembled action force waved to hundreds of fans when they were n't posing for selfies

" but this was just too good to miss -- a cinematic guilty pleasure
it took two rows of seats to accommodate the cast members , with @entity18 and @entity19 back row , center stage with the newcomers arranged before them , including the only female member of the cast , @entity62
the quip-fest began and while @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity31 could n't resist a few jokey punches and strangleholds , the @entity65 crew mostly contented themselves with trading punchlines instead
talking about the franchise @entity18 said " we finally got it right on the third one -- kinda like marriage
" @entity75 accompanied his cheeky shrug
it continued when he was asked what makes the perfect action hero
" well you have to be incredibly intelligent , handsome , sexy , good teeth , high iq , a lot of hair
" but then , like an action hero suddenly remembering a fallen favorite comrade , he became suddenly wistful
" you know i 'm gon na tell you the truth , i think it 's the hardest thing in the world to find an action person because its an indefinable thing
what makes an audience like a person ? because it 's not about muscles , because a lot of good action guys are not very muscular , they 're not particularly good looking
there 's something almost intangible and i do n't know what it is , but i know it 's very rare because there 's only been about 15 action heroes -- i mean real serious ones -- in history

" i would like to thank you for characterizing me as one of the younger actors
i 'm new to action films and i feel my star is just rising
" @entity29 entered the fray , matching @entity18 's earlier wistfulness and raising the stakes with an earnest , poignant account of his early @entity7 career typecast as the baddy with the foreign accent , until 1998 's the " @entity138 " changed all that and suddenly he was here among the good guys
" for a @entity146 person like me to be invited to be part of this movie , which is kind of a hall of fame for action heroes , means a lot to my community and to me personally
" by the time he 'd finished he had transformed into the cute sad - eyed animated cat he personifies in 2011 animation " @entity151 " and the room was transfixed
but then the " elephant " in the room was spotted and cautiously approached
for men of a certain age , what precautions do you take to protect yourselves ? mock indignation ensued
once again it was sergeant - major @entity18 who put himself in the line of fire : " precautions ! i wish
precautions are not in the budget
seriously , everyone gets hurt
i 've had two back operations , neck fused and both shoulders done
we 're talking about hands - on action going all the way back to ' @entity174
' you did n't have @entity176 then you just did it
and we take pride in actually taking the bumps and bruises
" @entity32 concurred : " we have a battery of physicians like little elves who come in and fix us every night
" " yeah we have a whole wing in the hospital " added @entity18
" @entity19 joined the fun : " but i think that when you get older things do get easier
when @entity192 ( @entity191 ) picks me up and slams we into a wall it 's a padded wall and when @entity18 was hitting me in the face he was taking it easy a little bit and when @entity197 was shooting me with a gun he did n't use live ammo
" " you 're ruining the magic now ! " chipped in @entity35
when will you know when you 're too old to be an action hero ? @entity18 jumped straight in with an alertness which defied his years : " i think when you wake up in the morning and your a * * falls off it 's time to go
let me tell you something -- we are children with arthritis -- we are young forever
