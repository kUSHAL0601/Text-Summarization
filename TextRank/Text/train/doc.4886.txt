@entity1 , @entity0 -- football dignitaries gathered in @entity4 , northern @entity0 , on wednesday to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of @entity6 -- the sport 's oldest club
@entity10 chief @entity9 was among those in @entity4 to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of football 's oldest club
guests of honor at a service at @entity18 included @entity9 , president of football world governing body @entity10 , and @entity20 , president of @entity22 giants @entity21 who are scheduled to play a friendly against @entity6 next month
other guests attending a dinner in the club 's honor included @entity30 president @entity29 and @entity0 and @entity32 legend @entity31
@entity33 -- widely recognized as the greatest footballer ever to play the game -- is also due in town next month to attend @entity6 's clash with @entity21
@entity9 was unveiling a bust of the club 's co-founder @entity39 -- one of two cricket fans who founded @entity6 , then known simply as @entity6 , on october 24 , 1857 after deciding they needed a new sport to keep them active during the winter
many more football clubs soon sprung up and by 1862 there were said to be 15 in and around the @entity4 area
the @entity49 -- which codified the basic rules of the modern game -- was established in @entity1 the following year
@entity6 was instrumental in developing set rules for the game
the club studied existing rules and laid down a code of laws , which formed the foundation of the first commonly - accepted set of rules for the sport , according to the @entity6 web site
the team was also responsible for several innovations in the game -- including heading , which was unheard of until 1875 , when @entity6 traveled to @entity1 for a game
according to the team 's web site , the sight of the @entity4 players using their foreheads in addition to their feet reduced the @entity1 crowd to hysterics
other innovations attributed to the team include the solid crossbar on the goal , corner kicks , free kicks for fouls , and playing a match under floodlights
despite its celebrated place in the history of the world 's most popular sport , @entity6 has never played at a professional level
the club currently competes in the @entity92 's @entity91 , seven divisions beneath the @entity93
the city of @entity4 has two professional clubs -- @entity32 and wednesday -- who both currently play in @entity0 football 's second tier , the @entity99
@entity6 's proudest achievement on the pitch came in 1904 when the team beat @entity103 3 - 1 to win the @entity104 in front of 6,000 people
but 100 years later in 2004 , @entity9 presented @entity6 with @entity10 's " @entity107 " -- an honor previously awarded only to the nine - time @entity110 champions @entity30
