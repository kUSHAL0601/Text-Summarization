the family of a @entity2 national fatally shot by police in @entity4 , @entity5 , has filed a $ 25 million claim against the city alleging that three officers killed the unarmed man " execution style
" @entity12 , 35 , was shot by police tuesday after he allegedly hurled rocks at vehicles and @entity4 officers
the city and the police department were n't commenting on the claim , @entity4 city manager @entity17 said saturday
the case is attracting attention because a video posted on @entity24 shows @entity25 running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot
the shooting has sparked local protests and anger at what some say is another example of police brutality and excessive force against an unarmed man who is a minority
@entity12 ' widow , @entity38 , 32 , and the couple 's two minor daughters accused three @entity4 officers in " the murder " of @entity12 , according to the claim filed friday
one officer , @entity49 , " has a prior history of official misconduct in civil rights matters , " the claim alleges
the other two officers are @entity52 and @entity53 , the claim said
the three officers are on paid administrative leave ; @entity17 said the city would n't comment on the accusations against them
@entity49 is a nine - year veteran ; @entity52 , a firearms instructor with eight years ' experience ; and @entity53 , an officer with two years on the job , officials said
meanwhile , the @entity2 consul in @entity63 , @entity64 , wrote a letter thursday to police chief @entity66 expressing " deep concern over the unwarranted use of lethal force against an unarmed @entity2 national by police officers
" @entity64 asked for a thorough investigation " in accordance with the @entity74 on @entity76 provision , to which both @entity2 and the @entity77 are parties
" read consul 's letter on friday , @entity66 wrote a letter to @entity64 stating that the @entity4 department and other law agencies are investigating " the circumstances surrounding the incident
" when a @entity87 completes its inquiry , the report will be forwarded to the @entity89 , @entity66 wrote
police have alleged that @entity12 was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when he was confronted by officers
officers attempted " voice commands and low level force , " and used a @entity96 , police said , but those efforts were unsuccessful
read chief 's reply after two officers were struck with rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said the officers resorted to deadly force
@entity12 's family have told reporters he would n't have been able to understand the commands
" he did n't understand @entity113 and they were talking to him in @entity113 , " one cousin said
" why not get a @entity116 officer ? " the incident began , according to the claim , on tuesday about 5 p.m. when @entity12 was suspected of throwing rocks
a very brief encounter occurred between @entity12 and police , " during which the officers may have tried to taser " him , the claim said
@entity12 separated from the officer and walked away from them in the crosswalk , the claim said
" he had his back to the officers , " the claim said
" at this point , the officers started shooting at mr. @entity12
" after mr. @entity12 reached the other side of the street and got on the sidewalk , he continued to walk away from the officers with his hands out where they could be seen , again showing that he had no knife , no gun or nothing else in his hands that would cause a threat to the three officers who were then lined up on the sidewalk behind ... @entity148 , " the claim alleges
" as mr. @entity12 turned toward the officers , all three officers fired multiple rounds , killing @entity148 on the sidewalk in front of numerous businesses , " the claim alleges
" at the time that he was shot and killed , execution style , by the three officers named herein , in broad daylight , and with no knife or firearm in his hands , and for the conduct of throwing rocks at an earlier time , mr. @entity12 posed no danger to the three officers , such that they were justified in the use of deadly force ... " the claim said
the claim accuses the police of assault , battery , intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress , wrongful death and civil rights violations
the claim said the incident was the third fatal shooting by a @entity4 officer " in a very short period of time , " and accused the city of " retaining officers who had a proven history of violation of civil rights against the @entity189 " and " allowing and fostering overt racial ( animus ) towards the @entity191 within the @entity192
" @entity12 's shooting death was the fourth fatal officer - involved shooting in @entity4 in the past seven months , said city spokesman @entity196
one of those shootings , however , involved a deputy from @entity199 , although @entity4 is in @entity200 , @entity196 said
according to the @entity202 , officers were cleared in the other three shootings
the coroner said his office would conduct a separate inquest in the @entity12 case with six community members , once the law enforcement investigation is complete
the family 's attorney , @entity210 , said supporters were scheduled to march saturday from a park to @entity214 and the police department
on wednesday , about 100 protesters marched outside @entity218 , with some chanting " it was only a rock , " @entity6 affiliate @entity216 reported
the shooting comes in a period of strained police - community relations following the police - involved deaths last summer of @entity225 , 43 , on @entity226 in @entity227 and @entity228 , 18 , in @entity229 , @entity230
the medical examiner ruled @entity225 's july 17 death a homicide due to compression of his neck and chest when he was taken down by an officer using a chokehold
his death sparked street protests , a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation
a grand jury declined to prosecute officer @entity245 in the case
a few weeks later , @entity229 police officer @entity247 shot @entity228 after an altercation in the street
the death of @entity228 , who was unarmed , thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement 's use of deadly force
a grand jury declined to prosecute @entity247 , a decision that led to national demonstrations .
