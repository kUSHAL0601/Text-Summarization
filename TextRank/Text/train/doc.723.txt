-- investigators looking into the crash of a @entity4 jet over @entity5 face a series of unusual challenges
from access to the debris , to volatile militant activity in the area , here 's a look at some investigation concerns after the plane with 298 people aboard fell from the sky
who will lead the investigation ? the answer is not so clear - cut
but aviation experts say an investigation should not include parties involved in the conflict between @entity5 and @entity26 - backed separatists
@entity5 president @entity27 said experts from the @entity29 , an agency of the @entity30 , have joined the @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33 on a special commission
@entity32 prime minister @entity35 called for an international team to have full access to the crash site
what will happen to plane 's data recorders ? the families of people on board will demand a transparent international investigation , and so will the global community , @entity0 aviation analyst @entity42 said
finding and examining the plane 's data recorders will be key -- but the fact that the crash occurred in such a volatile region makes what comes next anything but certain , @entity0 aviation analyst @entity48 said
" the big question will be , in whose hands will they fall , and will this be a really objective , international investigation ? " he said
who will win the blame game ? @entity62 and @entity63 have said it was a surface - to - air missile that brought down the @entity65 , though the @entity33 could n't say who fired the weapon
@entity68 , adviser to the @entity69 , said in a @entity71 post that " terrorists " fired on the plane operating a @entity74 surface - to - air missile system
@entity32 's government said it was n't ready to say what happened
a spokesman for @entity26 president @entity79 said any talk of @entity26 being involved is " stupidity
" @entity79 said @entity5 's military campaign against the separatists was to blame , but he did n't accuse either side for the suspected shoot - down
what evidence do officials have so far ? @entity5 's state security chief accused two @entity26 military intelligence officers of involvement and said they must be punished
@entity91 said he based his allegation on intercepts of phone conversations between the two officers
" now you know who carried out this crime
we will do everything for the @entity26 military who carried out this crime to be punished , " he told reporters
@entity105 , a former senior official for the @entity106 and @entity107 , said that after an incident , people start to talk and intelligence agencies , like the @entity110 , will pick up on those conversations
how did officials conclude it was a missile attack ? the @entity33 came to the conclusion of a missile attack through radar data
a @entity33 radar system saw a surface - to - air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane was shot down , a senior @entity33 official told @entity0
a second system saw a heat signature -- which would indicate a missile rising from the ground into the air -- at the time the airliner was hit , the official explained
the wreckage path , @entity48 said , will also reveal a lot
if a plane breaks up in midair , which is likely what would happen in a missile strike , there would be a large swath of wreckage , he said , but if it breaks down due to mechanical failure , the debris field would be more concentrated
how long will it take to determine who was responsible ? @entity79 probably knew thursday what happened , according to @entity105 , who said @entity26 is one of a few countries with the capability to follow missiles
@entity147 will probably walk into the @entity148 on friday to find an assessment that gives a pretty clear picture on where the missile was launched
that report will be based on human and technical sources such as radar
are separatists giving investigators access to crash site ? the area where the plane crashed is n't under control of authorities in @entity63
@entity164 separatists were in control of the site thursday night , according to @entity167 , a freelance journalist on the scene
separatists were among the first to the crash site and some of them went through the wreckage
photos of the crash site show people standing on pieces of the wreckage
" the mere fact that this is not a secure , sterile site at the moment -- is of concern , " @entity42 said
@entity0 senior international correspondent @entity183 said that it was hours before five government rescue teams were allowed into the crash area and armed groups were getting in the way of their work
phone calls intercepted by @entity5 authorities indicate some of the debris was being looted and taken away
what role will the @entity33 play ? it certainly will get involved on the ground if any of the passengers are @entity33
and it likely will send a team from the @entity197 because the @entity198 was built in the @entity33
@entity197 officials said thursday they are waiting to see how they will be involved , but a senior administration official told @entity0 a team would go in an advisory capacity
the @entity106 would also send agents , the official said
there are complications , however , because the area where the plan crashed is n't under control of authorities in @entity63
and @entity33 authorities likely would n't be able to travel to territory controlled by separatists in eastern @entity5 who have declared themselves independent
@entity33 intelligence agencies are analyzing the trajectory of the missile to try to learn where the attack came from
it will also look through satellite images to pinpoint the launch spot
the @entity223 would assist in diplomatic discussions between @entity5 and @entity26
it would also help families of victims , if any of those on board had ties to the @entity33
@entity0 's @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .
