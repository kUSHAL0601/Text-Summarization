-- a small central @entity3 community has begun trucking in thousands of gallons of water to avoid running dry during the state 's historic drought , a water official said
two trucks filled with about 8,000 gallons of water reached @entity10 monday afternoon and the precious liquid was immediately pumped into community water tanks
" the community could be trucking for two weeks or two months , it just depends on the weather , " according to @entity18 spokeswoman @entity17
" it 's raining right now , though
" the town is under a stage 4 water emergency -- the most severe level -- and it wo n't ease until the town gets more rain over an extended period of time
" the water supply is dangerously low " in the community of 1,100 about 35 miles northwest of @entity29 , @entity17 said
the town sits on @entity31 and is popular among retirees and people who own lake houses or second homes
the water level in the @entity10 well has leveled out since the water emergency was declared last week
" all outdoor watering is now prohibited and customers are strongly urged to cut out all nonessential use of water immediately , " the company said in a news release on january 24
officials believe conservation by the community has helped
residents are only supposed to be using water for bathing , cooking and drinking
besides trucking in water , the @entity18 is looking at other alternatives for water , including digging another well , @entity17 said
the @entity55 is served by a single well after three other wells in the community were shut down in recent years
" we 're going to run out of water , " resident @entity59 told @entity0 affiliate @entity60
" something should have been done a long time ago ... they waited too long
now we 're in this predicament
" the dry spell began in 2010 and is the worst the state has seen since 1895 , @entity3 lt. gov. @entity66 has said
@entity0 's @entity69 contributed to this report .
