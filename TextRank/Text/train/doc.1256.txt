-- after divesting from luxury brands purchased in @entity3 , the @entity1 is revamping its @entity5 car line to try to recapture the prestige -- and market share -- of the past
" we had purchased @entity11 and @entity12 and @entity13 and @entity14 , and we had decreased our investment in @entity5 , " @entity1 ceo @entity9 told @entity0 's @entity10
" with our one @entity16 in 2006 , we decided to have a laser focus not only on the @entity1 brand but @entity5
we continued to invest in the toughest times and the mkz is our first proof point of a new line of luxury @entity5 vehicles
" @entity1 announced monday it is renaming its @entity5 division as the @entity5 is not being spun off into an altogether separate carmaker , notes @entity28 's @entity27 , but @entity1 wants to give it greater separation from the more mass market @entity1 " blue oval " brand
@entity32 have has its own product development team , designers and salespeople
the all - new mkz is due to hit the market soon
" as you know the @entity32 has been part of the @entity1 for nearly 90 years and its always been known for elegant styling and design , inside and out , and also very useful and exciting technology and innovation , " @entity9 told @entity37
@entity1 was able to avoid the bailouts required to keep @entity47 competitors @entity48 and @entity49 afloat after an aggressive restructuring that began in 2006 , before the financial crisis struck
but the carmaker has been hit of late by the slowdown in the eurozone
the company announced in october the closure of two plants in @entity58 and one in @entity60 in the next two years , which together employed 5,700 workers
" we are moving very decisively on our better plan to serve the @entity3 customers both with a more complete family of best in class vehicles that we describe , but also taking the actions on the productivity and the utilization of our facilities , " @entity9 said
" it 's going to take us a couple years to do that , we know how to do it , everybody watched us do it in the @entity47
" @entity9 , who has been among the @entity47 ceos who have met with president @entity77 on the looming @entity47 fiscal cliff , says he 's optimistic the talks will avert crisis
" the last few weeks has really centered on discussion about not only the fiscal cliff , which needs to deal with the revenue side but also the expense side , is what do we do to create the environment where businesses can grow , can be more competitive , to provide the economic expansion that we all want , " he said
" i might also add that we are very encouraged by the ongoing dialogue in @entity3 on the same subject , because clearly we 're in a recession in @entity3 and pulling together around a compelling vision to facilitate economic growth is what 's most important for all of us
