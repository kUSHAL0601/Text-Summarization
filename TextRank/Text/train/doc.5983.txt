@entity0 , @entity1 -- you can tell when @entity4 is stalking a major championship
the air gets thicker , the galleries larger and the bristle of excitement notably louder
especially in this part of the world , because @entity13 's love affair with @entity4 clearly has n't slowed in the eight years since he last walked the fairways at @entity0 and claimed the 2006 @entity16 title
but that exuberance might have frayed the edges of @entity4 's love for @entity13 , such was the determination of some of the thousands of fans who followed him around thursday to capture a memento
" there were a lot of cameras out there and we were backing off a lot of shots , " the 14 - time major champion told reporters after his opening round of three - under - par 69 , a further three behind clubhouse leader @entity28
unfortunately people just do n't put their phones on silent and some of the professional guys were getting on the trigger a little early
" i 've had numerous years of dealing with this
you 've just got to stay focused out there
" it might have been @entity4 ' first major for nearly a year , injuries taking their toll on his 38 - year - old body , but the surroundings were at least familiar
victory here was his first since the passing of his father
after tapping in on the 18th green , the then world @entity54 collapsed into tears
perhaps that is the reason @entity0 holds him in such affection , given it was a rare occasion when one of sport 's great stonewallers turned on the waterworks
" i was here that day when @entity4 won and then broke down , " says @entity66 , a native of @entity13 and one of many who tailed @entity4 for the entirety of his round on thursday
" we celebrated with him and cried with him
" the landscape is different eight years on -- @entity4 's walk is n't quite so tall
his last major title came barely 18 months after success at @entity0 , and the following years have been a litany of near misses , injuries and one off - course maelstrom of his own making
but the fascination for him remains undimmed , illustrated by the thousands that roared him off the first tee just after 9 a.m. on a still and sunny @entity85 day
while he still commands huge crowds , there seems a tangible shift in mood ; that people have come to see the man who once ruled supreme , rather than someone who can hit those heights again
there was still the odd unwitting sheep among a devout flock
one man who asked " who is this ? " as @entity4 strolled down the first fairway was met with a rather stinging response : " there 's 5,000 people following him , who do you think it is ? ! " though @entity4 ' gait might not have been entirely recognizable to all , the quality of his golf during thursday 's fledgling stages was in keeping with recent disappointments
two dropped shots on the first two holes elicited groans from the gallery , one man remarking to no - one in particular : " there 's always next year , @entity4
" as the world @entity118 reached the fourth green , faces pressed against the windows of a double - decker bus crawling past on the main road that flanks the eastern part of the course
a par there seemed to lift @entity4 , who birdied the next to energetic applause
chances came and went , one missed birdie putt on the 10th prompting a sigh as another patron opined : " he used to rattle those in for fun
" woods needed a spark from somewhere , and he got it on the back nine
a birdie from off the green at the 11th saw the first release of that famous @entity4 fist - pump , amid cheers from those who 'd scrambled up grassy banks to net a glimpse
it is n't just spectators who stick to @entity4 on his way around the course
after a fine shot on the par - four 12th , which would yield another birdie , @entity4 strode over the brow of the hill with a cavalcade of cameramen , photographers and reporters in tow
perhaps this is why he can appear emotionless and steely while walking the links -- it 's simply his method of blocking out the circus that follows his every move
a expertly - struck shot on 13 carved a path through the steadily building wind thrown up from the @entity169 and set up another opportunity
the bellow that communicated its success underscored the joy those present felt at capturing their own slice of @entity4 magic firsthand
a wayward approach to the 14th resulted in a dropped shot , reclaimed immediately at 15
and by the time a delicate chip on the 16th tiptoed towards the hole and offered a tap - in for birdie , @entity4 had made a blitz of five in six holes
pars followed on 17 and 18 , when he was clearly irritated again by an eager photographer 's trigger finger , but his final tally of three - under was more than had looked likely after that inauspicious beginning
" i did n't get off to the best of starts but i turned it round , " he said
" the forecast the next few days is supposed to be iffy -- guys are n't going to go over and above
" there 's a ton of players between two and four under par and that is the way i think this championship is going to unfold
" one brave journalist ventured that it had felt like " old times " as the @entity205 went on his run of five birdies in six , a statement that was met with a roll of the eyes and the reply : " it was n't that long ago
" but the signs are promising
not only did @entity214 turn things around , he also reported feeling fitter each day after the back surgery that sidelined him for four months
" i 'm getting stronger , i 'm getting faster , i 'm getting more explosive and the ball is starting to travel again -- those are all positive things , " he added
" it felt good to be out there competing again
" with that @entity214 left a crowded press tent and made a beeline for the practice range
" i thought he 'd be taller than that , " a punter said as @entity4 bustled past
give it a few days and he just might be .
