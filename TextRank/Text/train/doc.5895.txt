a @entity1 jihadist group appears to have pledged allegiance to @entity4 's leader -- but also stressed it can achieve a @entity1 @entity6 state only by working with other rebels , including secularists
the group , @entity9 , also denies an earlier claim that it has merged with @entity12 's @entity4 affiliate , according to an audio message purported to be from @entity9 general commander @entity14
the message was posted on various radical @entity17 websites known for posting similar statements by @entity4 figures
@entity21 's message comes after the leader of the @entity4 - affiliated @entity23 purportedly claimed this week in an audio statement that @entity9 is part of its network
opinion : @entity1 rebel group 's dangerous tie to @entity4 a speaker identifying himself as @entity23 leader @entity31 had said -- in a message posted to online jihadist forums -- that the two groups would combine their names and be known as " the @entity23 ( @entity1 )
" but @entity14 distanced himself from @entity37 's message , saying it took @entity9 off guard
" we would like to inform the public that we were not informed or consulted of the content of the announcement , " @entity14 said
despite denying a merger , @entity14 said that he is raising the bar higher by pledging allegiance to @entity4 leader @entity47

" @entity21 , acknowledging that @entity9 fought with jihadists in @entity12 before turning its attention to the @entity1 civil war , said he would delay consideration of a merger with @entity4 in @entity12 in part so his group can consult with various supporting groups

" @entity82 heads the @entity83 , which has leadership largely consisting of expatriates
he said that " there are those who want to impose themselves even on @entity9
" " we reject ownership of any of the rebel factions inside @entity1 , " he said
@entity21 's message comes a week after the @entity93 , according to @entity95 officials , signed off on new nonlethal aid for @entity1 rebels
officials said it is expected to include equipment such as body armor , night vision goggles and other military equipment that is defensive in nature , but could be used to aid in combat by @entity1 rebels battling forces loyal to president @entity106
