standing by a poster depicting in full detail the complex union of muscles that make up the human body , @entity0 works on a custom - made prosthetic leg inside @entity8 's @entity7 here , he has come up with a technology that could change the whole field of bionics , and improve the lives of amputees the world over
as a doctorate student in the @entity16 , which looks at how technology can be used to enhance human physical capability , @entity0 has taken on the challenge to design the perfect fit for every prosthetic socket -- the interface between the body and the prosthetic limb , and a major source of discomfort for amputees
@entity0 has found a way to load mri scans of a patient 's limbs onto a multilayer 3d computer to customize the socket design -- a development that could have a huge impact
" i think it will change the whole industry , " says @entity0 , who is from @entity36
" you just send us a minimum set of data and we will ship you a comfortable prosthetic socket , " he adds
" we are getting images , we are getting data that quantifies your body 's impedance , stiffness , how stiff each point is , and we can use that with the surface information that we have , and modeling that we do , to create you a perfect shape and a multi-material impedance prosthetic socket
" read this : innovation saving lives legacy of war his interest in improving the lives of amputees stems from his childhood in war - torn @entity36
from 1991 to 2002 , the country was caught in the grip of a vicious war that took thousands of lives
one of the most common atrocities committed during the war was to hack off people 's limbs , scarring them for life both physically and psychologically
" seeing people who had lost their limbs and whose lives were just kind of cut short was very , very traumatizing , " says @entity0 , who is from @entity75 , the @entity78 country 's second biggest city
" but it also opened this desire to engineer a solution
" read this : ' shooting became just like drinking a glass of water ' but the horrors of war did n't prevent @entity0 from thinking big
his intellectual prowess was evident from a young age as he got one of the highest scores for a standardized test in @entity36
in 2004 , he won a scholarship to study in @entity97
next , he got into @entity98 to study at its @entity99 and @entity101 , before joining @entity8 's @entity7 yet the lasting legacy of @entity36 's war has followed @entity0 all the way to the @entity105 , shaping his innovative work to this day
he had realized early on that many amputees in @entity36 opted not to use any prostheses because of the discomfort they were causing them
" it does n't matter if somebody gives you a pair of shoes that are worth $ 200 dollars -- if they 're two sizes too small for you , you will not wear it ; you will rather walk bare feet , " says @entity0
" this is the same thing -- the prostheses were absolutely uncomfortable for them and it does n't matter whether it was free or not , they would not wear it
" @entity0 now hopes that the custom - fitted , comfortable and affordable sockets he 's designing at @entity8 will be on the market within five years
fostering innovation but @entity0 is not only coming up with new creations that can impact lives and change industry
whilst studying at @entity98 he created his first ngo , called @entity133 , a group encouraging @entity135 to solve their own problems , starting with malaria in @entity36
read this : from war orphan to teen ballerina and in march last year , he launched @entity142 , a mentoring initiative aiming to inspire innovation and self - sufficiency in his native country
@entity142 uses a competition to fund education programs in @entity36 , covering everything from electronics to farming
one of the young students sengeh mentors through this initiative is @entity156 , a 15 - year - old boy who created a radio station from scrap materials and discarded electronics
@entity0 brought @entity156 to present his inventions at @entity8 , making him the youngest ever person to be invited to @entity8 's @entity162
read this : @entity164 - empowering a new @entity36 and @entity0 is now spreading his concept , branching out to find other young innovators across @entity164
" we do have the talent and young people within @entity36 , within @entity164 as a whole , to invent the future , " he says
" we do not need primary aid , we do not need money , we do not need solutions and products to come from the @entity78 to be given to people and train them how to use it
" that is not how you develop an economy -- the creative thinking , the ability to dare to dream and take the risk to develop a prototype
those are what 's instrumental
those are what 's needed to develop products that will change the world
that is what changes a country
