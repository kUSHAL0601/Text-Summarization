-- the @entity2 political party founded by @entity4 internet tycoon @entity3 has joined forces with a firebrand @entity7 activist , in what is being described as one of the world 's most unlikely political marriages of convenience
" it 's a very unusual alliance ... it 's like @entity15 getting into alliance with @entity17 , " political scientist @entity18 , of the @entity19 , told @entity0
" the individuals involved are larger than life and dynamic people , but their ideological backgrounds are pretty disparate
" the @entity25 alliance between @entity3 's @entity26 and the left - wing , indigenous - focused @entity25 was announced by @entity25 's leader , the controversial @entity7 nationalist mp @entity30
" it 's completely new ground , but politics is about the art of the possible and i 'm looking forward to what we can achieve , " @entity30 , seated next to the @entity26 's chief executive @entity31 , told reporters
@entity3 , the controversial founder of the shuttered file - sharing site @entity40 , can not personally run for office as he is not a citizen of his adopted home of @entity2
the wealthy web entrepreneur , who is battling extradition to the @entity46 on criminal digital piracy charges , launched his party in january , with a pledge to focus on internet privacy and government surveillance , and to make politics exciting
critics , including @entity2 prime minister @entity54 , have described @entity3 's political activities as part of an attempt to protect himself against @entity46 extradition efforts
but @entity30 said the issue of whether @entity61 would support @entity3 's efforts to remain in @entity2 had " not even come up once " in discussions
" it 's not a matter on the table at all
" ' gaming the system ' @entity18 said the alliance represented an attempt by the two political minnows " to game the electoral system and help each other get their politicians into parliament " at the general elections in september
under @entity2 's proportional voting system , a party must win either an electorate seat or at least 5 % of the nationwide vote to get into parliament -- a situation that hindered new parties , said @entity18 , because potential supporters feared their vote would be wasted
but if @entity86 retained his electorate seat , it would remove the need for the party to cross the 5 % threshold , and both parties could expect their share of the national vote to count towards a representative share of seats in the 120 - member parliament
@entity18 said he tipped the buzz around the alliance could see it fare well in the september vote
" @entity2 like to see outsiders having a go , " he said
" the sum of the whole is going to be greater than the two parts
" odd couple the two parties make strange bedfellows , apparently sharing little common ground beyond their opposition to the current center - right national government
" on the two issues these parties are principally known for , internet freedom and @entity7 nationalism , there does n't seem to be any crossover whatsoever , " said @entity18
" they 're quite different versions of anti-establishment
one 's an urban , middle - class , tech version , the other 's more traditional left - wing , almost anti-capitalist
" @entity30 , the son of a veteran @entity7 radical , has a long history of strident @entity7 activism and is seen as a figure of the far - left
he has been a polarizing presence in parliament since he was elected in a seat reserved for @entity7 voters in 2005 , criticized for remarks perceived as racist against white @entity2 , and for calling for an opposition leader to be shot
he eventually split with the @entity136 in 2011 over their support of the government
his new party , @entity25 , was established primarily as a vehicle to represent the interests of indigenous @entity2 but also attracted support from non-maori left - wing activists
@entity3 's political tendencies are less well - known
he has previously made a nz $ 50,000 ( $ 42,792 ) donation to a right - wing @entity2 politician at the opposite end of the political spectrum to @entity61 , but the yet - to - be announced leader of the @entity26 , who will be named on thursday , is somebody @entity30 says he can work with
@entity26 chief executive @entity31 said the two parties would retain their separate policies , and acknowledged his party was providing the bulk of the financial backing to the alliance
' big mistake ' @entity30 's decision to team with @entity3 's party has already drawn criticism
one of the @entity25 's founding members , the left - wing activist and former lawmaker @entity162 , quit the party over the move , which she labeled a " big mistake
" " sucking up to a @entity4 millionaire is not in my future , " she told reporters
" there 's no way i can continue to be in a party where we are all really just the political plaything of a millionaire internet mogul
" @entity30 's former party has also attacked the move , with @entity136 co-leader @entity178 telling @entity0 affiliate @entity179 that " utilizing @entity7 seats to drag in somebody who is questionable about their knowledge about things @entity7 ... it 's not on
