@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a forest of pines to the east of @entity0 , @entity6 and his seventy men were digging in thursday
a man in his late - fifties with a magnificent beard and four different weapons , @entity6 freely admitted he was not a local
but he was here -- he said -- to resist the " @entity1 fascists " in @entity14 , a nearby town just recaptured by government forces
he was dismissive of the group that had fled @entity18 -- " cossacks , " he sneered
he had already lost seven men , but his fighters were the bravest
they would not run away
@entity22 was revealing in several ways
pro-russian separatists working in eastern @entity1 are better organized , better armed ( @entity6 's group had a truck - mounted anti-aircraft gun that was clearly working ) , and more of them appear to come from beyond @entity1
and they are building a maze of roadblocks and defensive positions across the region
but a few kilometers beyond , in rolling countryside under a hot sun , a very different group was setting up camp : a substantial force of @entity1 paratroopers , with armored personnel carriers and artillery
above , a reconnaissance plane drifted in loops
both sides look -- at least militarily -- more competent than they did a few weeks ago
checkpoints used to be few and far between
now there is a maze of them -- more separatist than @entity1 -- dotted across both the @entity51 and @entity52 regions
the insignia of the " @entity54 " -- a group that includes both @entity56 and local fighters -- is common at the roadblocks that have sprung up on the main roads leading into @entity51
a few weeks ago , we watched the bedraggled remnants of the @entity1 army 's @entity61 surrounded and harangued by locals near @entity64
now there is a sense of purpose among the units newly deployed , and a greater readiness to use heavy armor
throughout an extensive tour of the @entity0 area , the crump of artillery and boom of tankfire sounded periodically
but the targeting is sometimes puzzling
@entity14 is a town of some 20,000 people and a major railway junction
but one of its two hospitals is in ruins , struck repeatedly by what appeared to have been mortars or shells
there was also evidence of strafing from the air
a tearful nurse approached us , saying that whoever had done this was not human
she -- and others -- thought @entity1 forces were responsible , but they could not be sure
patients had been evacuated , but one middle - aged man sat listlessly on a bench outside
he had nowhere to go , he told us ; a doctor came past once a day to give him an injection
the new mayor , installed thursday as @entity104 's local appointee , said he would investigate the bombing of the hospital
but for the government , recovering @entity14 is a rare victory -- and judging by the number of troops installed around the town , one it intends to protect
now @entity1 armor seems intent on squeezing separatist positions closer to @entity0
it seems like eastern @entity1 is half - way through a game of chess , pieces scattered across the board in threatening positions , with neither black nor white close to checkmate
@entity123 , whatever their allegiance , are suffering the consequences
the main highway that links @entity0 and the @entity56 border , a route crowded with trucks just a few weeks ago , is deserted
in places the tarmac is chewed up by the impact of mortar fire
but once in a while an ancient , battered car lurches onto the road from a farm - track
a family has escaped from @entity0 , where water and electricity supplies are faltering and fresh food is getting more difficult to find
the intentions of either side in this scattered war of attrition are hard to work out
some @entity1 analysts say that @entity56 president @entity147 has what he wants already , a simmering insurgency that can be stoked any time @entity1 's new leader , @entity150 , looks to deepen his country 's relationship with @entity153 and @entity154
there seems to be no attempt from the @entity56 side to stem the growing flow of fighters crossing into @entity1 , and border clashes have intensified
as for @entity104 's strategy , it 's unclear as of now whether it feel its " @entity168 " can overcome the separatists or at least redress the military balance as a precursor to negotiations
what seems unlikely is that @entity150 will accede to the demand of the prime minister of the self - declared @entity172 , @entity171 , who told @entity2 there would be no talks until @entity1 forces left the @entity51 and neighboring @entity52 regions
@entity150 's message to the east in his inauguration speech saturday will be closely scrutinized , but even ordinary people in @entity51 are suspicious of him , noting his support as a candidate for a hard line against the separatists and his threat to send the army into the city
the new president 's message to the outside world will be equally critical , as he walks the tightrope between making @entity1 part of @entity153 -- the dream , still unrealized , that brought thousands onto the streets of @entity104 in february -- and reassuring @entity56 that its interests in the neighborhood will be acknowledged
it is a reality he recognized when he told the @entity198 in april : " without a direct dialogue with @entity56 , it will be impossible to create security
" creating security seems a long way off
on thursday , a car raced out of @entity0 and emptied a mother and her three young children on the main highway to be ferried somewhere safer
drawing on a cigarette , the 30 - something driver called @entity147 said they were not his relatives
he was just helping them escape
" it 's hell down there , " he said , before jumping into his car to return .
