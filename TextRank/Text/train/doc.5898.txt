@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's incumbent leader appeared destined saturday to extend his 25 years in office but as results trickled in , the opposition front - runner charged fraud in the @entity10 nation 's presidential election
president @entity11 , who has led @entity1 since a rebel group he was aligned with seized power in 1986 , won 71 % with a fifth of the votes counted
challenger @entity16 had 22 %
" there have been widespread malpractices in the electoral process , " @entity16 said
he said voters had been bribed and that " huge amounts of money " landed in the hands of polling agents and candidates to pay off electoral officials
" local council officials and security agents have been threatening people with war if @entity11 does not win this election , and the purpose can only have been to intimidate and threaten the @entity1 people so that they were scared to express their desire for change , " @entity16 , who heads the @entity28
the government has dismissed the accusations and said the opposition is trying to undermine the election
a new term would give @entity11 five more years in power
final results will be released sunday

we have to have our own check mechanism , " said @entity62 , a spokeswoman for @entity64 's party
