-- deposed @entity2 president @entity1 will not be reinstated as head of state , an overwhelming majority of the @entity2 congress voted wednesday
in an hours - long process , 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return @entity1 to office
a majority of 65 votes in the 128 - member body was required to reject his reinstatement
@entity1 was removed from office in a military - led coup on june 28 and replaced by congressional leader @entity19
on wednesday , lawmakers voted one by one and addressed the chamber as they cast their vote , making for a slow process
the vote was a key part of a @entity28 - brokered pact that representatives for @entity1 and @entity19 signed october 29 , giving @entity30 the power to decide @entity1 's fate
the @entity28 expressed disappointment thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in @entity2
@entity28 assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs @entity37 continued to call on the @entity2 government to allow @entity1 's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month
" we are disappointed by this decision since the @entity28 had hoped the [ @entity2 ] @entity30 would have approved his return , " @entity37 said in a conference call with journalists in @entity46
" our policy since june 28 has been consistently principled
it has condemned the coup d'etat and continued to accept president @entity1 as the democratically elected and legitimate leader of @entity2 throughout this political crisis
" the @entity28 continues to call for @entity2 to engage in national reconciliation and creation of a truth commission to investigate the crisis , in addition to the unity government
" the absence of democratic , constitutional order is the unacceptable status quo , " a senior @entity28 administration official said on the conference call , remaining anonymous under the ground rules of the call and because of the sensitivity of the situation
" the election is a step toward a day where @entity2 will have an electorally legitimate government in place
" @entity1 , who says he does not recognize the election , also has said he would not accept the post even if @entity30 voted him back in
accepting the job , he said , would legitimize the coup
many nations said before the sunday 's election they would withhold recognition if @entity1 were not returned to power
some countries , such as the @entity28 , @entity84 and @entity85 , have said they will recognize @entity86
others , such as @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , have said they will not
despite the diplomatic pressure from abroad , lawmakers were voting the will of the people , congressman @entity91 said
" history will judge us , and i 'm certain it will judge us positively , " he said
" @entity30 did n't make this problem
the problem came to us
" those voting against @entity1 echoed those sentiments
after the coup , the same body voted to install @entity19 as interim president
wednesday vote only happened because the agreement between the two sides called for it , many lawmakers repeated
@entity1 's supporters argued that the coup was an illegal act that only restitution could heal
@entity30 sought opinions from the nation 's @entity115 and other bodies before holding the vote
the court ruled last week that @entity1 can not return to office without facing trial on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when he tried to hold a vote that could have led to the removal of presidential term limits
the @entity115 ruled before the coup that the vote was illegal and @entity30 had forbidden it
the coup came on the day the term - limits vote was to have been held
@entity19 and his supporters have insisted that @entity1 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power , not a coup
but the @entity137 , the @entity134 , the @entity135 and most nations -- including the @entity28 -- condemned the coup and demanded that @entity1 be reinstated immediately
@entity1 , who was flown out of the country while still in his pajamas on the day of the coup , has been staying at the @entity89 embassy in @entity2 ' capital since secretly returning to the country september 21 .
