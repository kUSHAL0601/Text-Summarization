the law on assisted suicide in @entity2 is n't clear , according to a paper published in the journal @entity5 on august 20
that 's why , the authors say , people from other countries are traveling to the state of @entity11 for the " sole purpose of committing suicide
" they 're called suicide tourists
between 2008 and 2012 , 611 " tourists " came to @entity2 for assisted suicide , according to the published analysis
they arrived from 31 countries around the world , though the majority were from @entity21 and the @entity22
" in the @entity22 , at least , ' going to @entity2 ' has become a euphemism for ( assisted suicide ) , " the study authors write
" six right - to - die organizations assist in approximately 600 cases of suicide per year ; some 150 - 200 of which are suicide tourists
" this published paper is the result of a pilot study completed for a larger project on assisted suicide in @entity2 being done by experts at the @entity35 in @entity11
of the 611 assisted suicides identified during the four - year study period , just over 58 % were women
the patients ' ages ranged from 23 to 97 , researchers found , but the average age was 69
close to half of the patients had a neurological disease
others stated they had cancer , rheumatic disease or cardiovascular disease
many had more than one condition
in all but four cases , the assisted suicides were done using sodium pentobarbital
a fatal dose of this drug causes the patient to slip into a deep coma , according to @entity59 , a @entity2 right - to - die organization that was involved in most of the identified @entity61 pentobarbital paralyzes the patient 's respiratory system , causing him or her to stop breathing
the total number of suicide tourism cases dropped from 123 in 2008 to 86 in 2009
but the number of cases doubled between 2009 and 2012 , to 172
assisted suicide laws around the globe are in flux as countries debate the pros and cons of allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients , or patients in a lot of pain , die
in @entity2 , the study authors write , there are no rules to regulate under which conditions someone can receive assisted suicide , though medical professional codes allow it in certain circumstances
in @entity21 , there is no formal legal language in the criminal code about assisted suicide , but doctors are not ethically allowed to help someone commit suicide -- and can be held criminally responsible for not helping a patient if they witness him or her going unconscious
in the @entity22 , @entity98 and @entity99 , assisted suicide is illegal , though recent cases have been presented to high courts
" if @entity2 is happy to continue providing the facility then , however intellectually dishonest it may be to allow her to siphon of all our own @entity111 pain , fear , angst and debate , is it likely to do less harm overall than introducing any conceivable assisted suicide law into @entity111 , " medical lawyer @entity102 wrote in a commentary accompanying the new journal study
an international survey of 12 @entity118 countries found the majority of people favor legalizing assisted suicide , according to the study authors
this seems to match opinion in the @entity124 , where four states -- @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 -- allow assisted suicide
opinion : suicide does n't set you free but others have argued that legalizing assisted suicide is not addressing the real issue , which is the need for better palliative care , and that assisted suicide laws would put vulnerable populations at risk
@entity140 of @entity141 , in an editorial accompanying the new study , writes that advocates for assisted suicide often have a friend or relative who experienced a long , painful death
" so the issue , " she writes , " may be a need to provide good end - of - life care
" " we need to start asking questions such as : is it appropriate to give antibiotics to a terminally ill patient who develops a chest infection ? it is possible that a tendency to carry on with curative treatment even in those clearly dying explains the general public 's support for ( assisted suicide )
" @entity140 cites data from @entity127 that suggests regulations put in place when assisted suicide was legalized are not always followed
" @entity165 is important , " she writes
" but it could be that , in matters of life and death , you can not create freedom for the few without taking away adequate safeguards for the many
