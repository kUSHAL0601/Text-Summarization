@entity0 -- @entity3 will pay $ 7.5 million to settle complaints that it flew unsafe aircraft , and the fine will double unless the airline completes additional safety measures within a year , federal regulators announced monday
the @entity9 found @entity3 operated jets on nearly 60,000 flights without performing certain mandatory inspections
the @entity9 originally recommended more than $ 10 million in civil penalties in 2008 after finding @entity3 operated 46 of its @entity15 jets on nearly 60,000 flights without performing mandatory inspections for fatigue cracks in their fuselages
@entity9 documents obtained by @entity1 found that in some cases , @entity3 aircraft flew for 30 months after government inspection deadlines had passed
a congressional panel concluded the planes were " not airworthy , " and two @entity9 whistle - blowers said agency managers let the airline conduct the safety checks on a slower schedule to avoid disrupting flights
the @entity32 , @entity33 - based airline said it was happy to have settled " all outstanding issues with the @entity9
" " this settlement with the @entity9 will allow us to focus on safety going forward , rather than on issues that are now behind us and that have already been addressed , " @entity3 said in a written statement
@entity1 's @entity42 contributed to this report .
