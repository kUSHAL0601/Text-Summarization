-- it all starts on the sixth floor of the five - star @entity3 , in the center of @entity6
after booking my place for @entity10 's @entity9 , i show up at the agency office at 7:45 on a chilly friday morning in december to begin my adventure
a model of a @entity15 soldier stands guard in front of a footbridge that dead - ends at the @entity19
our destination for the day is the @entity19 -- or the " heavily fortified " @entity22 between @entity23
passport and conservative attire are required on the day -- this is not a do - it - yourself tour
four kilometers ( 2.8 miles ) wide , 240 km long and roughly 55 km north of @entity6 , the @entity19 was created on july 27 , 1953 , following the @entity27 that ended three years of fighting , if not the war itself
half a century later , the untouched buffer zone between the @entity32 has evolved into a highly protected ecological sanctuary , home to several rare species of plant and wildlife , including whooper cranes and white herons
as the tour bus makes its way northward along the " @entity43 , " the guides brief us on the infiltration tunnels dug by the @entity47 army with the intention to covertly invade @entity6 and take over @entity23
since @entity51 's combat order to dig them in 1971 , four such tunnels have been discovered respectively in 1974 , 1975 , 1978 and 1990
the third tunnel , 75 meters deep and the closest to @entity6 , is the one we are scheduled to visit
our first stop is @entity55 , a small city bordering the @entity19 , full of ominous symbols that double as tourist distractions leading up to the heart of the border - line tension
a sheltered peace bell , a footbridge that dead - ends into a barbed - wire fence , an exhibition of military vehicles and missiles employed during the war , the trans - @entity47 " @entity63 " train stopped dead in its tracks and an abandoned amusement park are just some of the attractions that greet visitors to @entity55 on their way to the real danger zone
unfortunately , after our extended visit , we learn that the previous night 's snowfall has left the road to the @entity80 dangerously slippery and closed until further notice
in short , our @entity83 tour has been canceled
we thus proceed directly to the @entity84
@entity85 , where we are left in the hands of our new guide , @entity88
she proves to be a lively and knowledgeable lady , whose name reflects the well - known acronym used to refer to @entity23 's top three universities : @entity94 , @entity15 and @entity95
among other food - for - thought tidbits , she points out that there are many more @entity15 spies sent to the @entity23 than @entity47 spies sent to the @entity23 ( see also the movie " @entity102 " ) , which coincidentally puts the whole infiltration - tunnel propaganda into perspective
after a traditional @entity47 lunch of bulgogi ( grilled beef ) or bibimbap ( baked rice ) at a roadside restaurant and a short documentary screening at @entity113 , we finally arrive at our main destination of @entity115 , officially called @entity117 ( @entity116 ) ( see also the movie " @entity117 " )
building up excitement , we are greeted by a sign that reads : " @entity122 all weapons before entering compound
" after a careful passport check , we are instructed to " do n't read , just sign " a @entity125 ( later returned to us ) stating that " although incidents are not anticipated , the @entity126 , the @entity127 , and the @entity15 can not guarantee the safety of visitors and may not be held accountable in the event of a hostile enemy act
" as the bus progresses into the lot where we will transfer to a @entity136 vehicle , @entity88 warns us of previous tourist " incidents " resulting in a sudden tour cancellation for all participants , including one in which a man was carrying an unauthorized flask of newly purchased soju ( rice wine )
in another , much more serious breach , one " tourist " turned out to be an expelled @entity47 trying to get back across the border
in yet another incident , a @entity151 human - rights activist tried to backstep into the @entity23
these were n't the first time the tours have been considered as a potential penetration route by either side
both @entity23 and @entity47 offer tours of the @entity19 , while the tourists who take in the sight from the @entity23 are predominantly @entity161
in our tour group today are mostly @entity127 and @entity163 , including a few @entity164 and lots of @entity166
the @entity127 military 's @entity167 ( @entity167 ) also provides tours , as well as the official @entity117 dress code , which specifies no baggy pants , graffitied t - shirts , among others
not so long ago , even jeans were outruled , being perceived by the @entity23 as linked to @entity127 decadence
once we are seated inside the @entity136 vehicle , passports are examined a second time , along with a quick dress - code check
@entity181 skirts , heels and flip - flops are out , although sneakers seemed to be accepted -- " so you can run faster " in case of emergency , informs @entity88
we are led in an orderly single file into one of the small blue @entity136 conference rooms that straddles the @entity191 ( @entity191 ) , where heated scuffles have been known to break out between delegates of @entity23
the southern @entity15 ( @entity15 ) soldiers in particular are known to be exceptionally fit , running several kilometers each day , while many are certified taekwondo masters
only once inside is photography allowed , but no touching -- that includes our hosts , the hard - hatted @entity15 soldiers , whose dark glasses make eye - contact impossible
" i feel very comfortable today , " remarks @entity88 , referring to the visible absence of @entity205 ( @entity205 ) soldiers around the premises
indeed , there are no footprints in the untreaded snow north of the @entity191 just outside
more photo - taking is permitted from a designated outdoor observatory point , then it 's back into the bus for a final view of the @entity191 face - off from a close but safe distance
as we wait in the lot to transfer back onto our original tour bus , i dare to ask our guide a risque question : what exactly is inside the @entity15 soldiers ' pants ? it sounds as if heavy beads are shaking the beat to their every step as they walk
" ball bearings , " answers @entity88
" they put them in their trouser legs so that one soldier walking sounds like a whole troop marching , to scare the enemy
" the bus makes a final outdoor stop at the highest military checkpoint within the @entity117 , giving us a panoramic view of the naturally disguised minefields that stretch across to the @entity47 mountains
below in the vast stretch of bush , we see a small clearing on the side of the road , marked by a plaque
we are told it 's the site where two @entity136 command officers were killed by @entity47 guards in 1970 as they were axing down a yellow poplar tree that was blocking the view
here on the viewing platform , just 1 km away from the building where the @entity258 was signed 54 years ago , a pyramid - shaped stone reads : " ... from the initiation of hostilities on june 25 , 1950 , until the @entity258 the war cost the @entity47 people untold treasure , anguish and the lives of approximately 150,000 members of the @entity15 armed forces
@entity126 forces suffered approximately 40,000 casualties in the fight for liberty
thanks to these sacrifices the @entity15 is a ' free and democratic country ! ' " as people begin hopping back onto the bus to leave @entity115 , two @entity15 soldiers graciously agree to pose with a few tourists who ca n't get enough of this military field trip
as we wave good - bye , just before one soldier sees the group off with a dutifully stiff salute , i catch a glimpse of his comrade offering us a rare smile
