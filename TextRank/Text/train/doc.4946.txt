@entity0 , @entity1 -- the bitter standoff between government troops and @entity6 protesters in downtown @entity0 worsened friday , the day after the wounding of a key protest leader aggravated the already deep tensions permeating the @entity1 capital
hospital officials reported 16 people died in confrontations friday in @entity0 , an urban fortress under siege and beset by gunfire , tear gas and stone - throwing
that followed the death of one person thursday
the unrest boiled over after @entity1 authorities set a new deadline to seal off the @entity0 intersection where protesters have gathered by the thousands for the past month
in addition to the deaths , more than 140 people were wounded in the violence , including four @entity31 -- a @entity32 , a @entity33 , a @entity34 and a @entity35
a government official said @entity1 forces were slowly getting control of the downtown area , with video footage showing soldiers shooting rounds toward the area with protesters
among those wounded on friday was a journalist from a @entity47 television station who was shot in the leg
what are protests about ? the government said it was forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by prime minister @entity56 to vacate the intersection by wednesday
@entity58 , the acting government spokesman , said on friday security forces who have been the objects of attacks have no choice but to respond
he told reporters that forces have been dutifully following the rules of engagement , which allows them to use live ammunition to protect themselves and their comrades
he assured @entity0 residents and foreigners there that the forces have no intention of harming anyone
the government , he said , is " very confident " it will be able to " stabilize the situation " and get it " under control very soon
" also , he said the prime minister is looking forward to working with others in hammering out reforms
the @entity81 , the formal name of the @entity6 opposition , has been demanding that @entity56 dissolve the lower house of @entity85 and call new elections
the @entity87 support former prime minister @entity88 , who was ousted in a bloodless military coup
tensions ramped up when maj. gen. @entity91 -- a renegade general better known as @entity91 , which means red commander -- was shot and wounded by a sniper 's bullet on thursday , an action that left him in critical condition
@entity91 was shot in the head while being interviewed by journalists in makeshift barricades set up by protesters
@entity103 of the @entity104 told @entity2 that the opposition leader was looking at him and answering questions when " the bullet hit him in the forehead , from what i could tell
" reporter : bullet ' felt like it grazed my head ' " it looks like the bullet came over my head and struck him
i do n't have any way of confirming this beyond what i remember from the scene , but it felt like it grazed my head , " he said
@entity103 , who said bamboo pikes and rubber tire barricades have been formed as a makeshift encampment by the protesters , said the opposition figure was facing out of the barricades and into @entity0 's business district of tall office buildings
" he was standing in the same location for a while when i was talking to him but he was moving around , he was gesticulating , " @entity103 said
" he was n't standing still , he was bobbing his head
" @entity136 : are you there ? send your images , video @entity91 did not appear to be armed or have bodyguards , but was dressed in camouflage jacket and a floppy hat , @entity103 said
@entity91 is a controversial public figure , even within the protest movement , @entity103 said
some @entity1 opposition leaders see him as an impediment to a peaceful resolution to the political stalemate that has gripped @entity1 politics , the reporter said
" he 's a renegade in sort of all senses , " @entity103 said
" he 's a renegade from the army , a hardliner within the protest movement
he told me today he thought they ( other opposition leaders ) were being cowardly and he wanted to carry on
