@entity0 , the @entity1 political party , said sunday it will scrap a series of events to commemorate the death 10 years ago of @entity1 leader @entity5
the decision comes two days after a series of bombings at the homes of @entity0 leaders and highlights rising tensions between the rival political factions , despite their april agreement on a unity government
in a statement sunday announcing the decision to call off the @entity5 events -- which were set to begin this week -- @entity0 official @entity18 cited bomb attacks which he blamed on @entity20
a number of explosions rocked homes owned by @entity0 figures on friday , according to the @entity25
the explosions took place as @entity25 prime minister @entity29 was preparing to visit @entity30
the trip has been postponed indefinitely , the @entity25 said
@entity20 denounced the attacks , according to the @entity34 page of spokesman @entity35
but the @entity0 spokesman nevertheless accused @entity20 of " cheap lies " and said that @entity0 officials had " expected a united government to cater to the interests of our nation
" in april , @entity20 and @entity0 announced an agreement to form a unity government , a development that @entity1 lawmaker @entity46 hailed as the " end to the division between the @entity1 people
" the comity was not long - lasting , however
in september , @entity25 president @entity50 blasted @entity20 , claiming it was running a " shadow government " in @entity30 and rendering the unity government " helpless
" it also follows the conflict between @entity20 and @entity54 in july and august , in which more than 2,100 @entity1 died
and the enmity is n't just one - way : @entity20 - hired government workers in @entity30 have accused the @entity25 -- in which @entity0 is a dominant player -- of failing to pay them .
