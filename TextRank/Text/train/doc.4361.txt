@entity0 -- a top - secret court has renewed the authority of @entity5 national security officials to collect telephone data as part of an anti-terror surveillance program that was exposed by intelligence leaker @entity9
in an unprecedented disclosure , the @entity10 said it had decided to declassify and announce the program renewal , which occurs periodically but is never publicized
@entity9 leaked classified information about the @entity16 program to media outlets last month and then fled the country
he has been charged with espionage and remains in diplomatic limbo at the @entity22 airport after seeking temporary asylum
his detailing of the surveillance effort that required communications giant @entity25 to turn over caller information triggered outrage from civil libertarians , certain members of @entity30 and privacy groups concerned with the sweeping nature of the telephone snooping and a companion effort that monitors e-mails
@entity36 to feds : disclose your data requests officials have said metadata on overseas - related communications does not include content but provides information about numbers dialed and received as well as length , date and time of calls
president @entity48 says the government is not listening in on calls , and other officials have said said the massive collection program has helped to detect terror plots
the national intelligence office did not say when the periodic renewal order from the @entity56 was handed down , but @entity16 legal authority under the @entity58 to collect telephone metadata surveillance was due to expire on friday
the new transparency appears to be an effort by the @entity48 administration to be more forthcoming about the program , the administration of which was sharply criticized this week by members of the @entity67
opinion : your biggest secrets are up for grabs one influential @entity73 member of the panel , troubled by the sweeping nature of how the telephone surveillance had been carried out , questioned whether @entity30 would act when the surveillance program comes up for renewal in 2015
following the @entity9 leaks , certain information about telephone collection was declassified " in order to provide the public with a more thorough and balanced understanding of the program , " a statement from the national intelligence office said
privacy ? forget it , we 're all celebrities online now " consistent with his prior declassification decision and in light of the significant and continuing public interest " in the matter , the office decided to declassify and disclose publicly that it had filed an application to renew telephone metadata collection " in bulk " and that the court " renewed that authority
" " the administration is undertaking a careful and thorough review of whether and to what extent additional information or documents pertaining to this program may be declassified , consistent with the protection of national security , " the statement said
although @entity25 was singled out in the @entity9 leak on telephone surveillance , it is believed that the government obtains similar orders for other telecommunications providers
all must be periodically renewed by the @entity118 court
no communications companies were mentioned in the intelligence office statement on friday .
