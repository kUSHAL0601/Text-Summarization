@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 's thousands of stores went green wednesday , as amended ordinances on solid waste now outlaw businesses from giving out thin plastic bags that are not biodegradable
@entity0 stores , such as this supermarket , can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags
the law affects all stores , production facilities and service providers within the @entity15 , which encompasses the city limits
nearly 9 million people live inside the district and another 10 million reside in surrounding communities that make up greater @entity0
@entity0 becomes the second large metropolitan area in the @entity21 to outlaw the bags
@entity23 in march 2007 enacted an ordinance that gave supermarkets six months and large chain pharmacies about a year to phase out the bags
@entity28 is set to impose a ban if the state of @entity31 does not enact a statewide 25 - cent fee per bag by july
about 90 percent of the bags used in the @entity35 are not recycled
bans and other restrictions on plastic bags are in place in several countries
@entity41 has adopted a strict limit , reducing litter and eliminating the use of 40 billion bags , the @entity46 said , citing government estimates
although compliance has been spotty , violation of the law carries a possible fine of 10,000 yuan ( $ 1,463 ) , @entity46 said
in @entity53 , selling the bags carries a maximum six - month jail sentence and a fine of 1.5 million shilling ( $ 1,137 )
@entity57 , @entity58 , outlawed the bags in 2000 and cities in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 have imposed bans or surcharges
@entity67 reported cutting use of the bags by 90 percent after imposing a fee on each one
some leading environmentalists are calling for a global ban on the bags
@entity75 , executive director of the @entity76 , says plastic bags are the second - most - common form of litter , behind cigarette butts
the bags are the greatest form of litter on the globe 's oceans , the @entity82 agency said in a recent report
the bags are also a major threat to ocean wildlife , causing the deaths of 100,000 sea turtles and other marine animals that mistake them for food
" thin - film , single - use plastic bags , which choke marine life , should be banned or phased out rapidly everywhere , " @entity97 said in june
" there is simply zero justification for manufacturing them anymore , anywhere
" @entity0 , which has had some of the worst air pollution in the world , also is looking at improving its environment in other ways
the municipal government announced this month it will place more than 1,100 bicycles at 84 stations throughout the city for residents to use
officials said they hope to increase bicycle use as a form of transportation to 5 percent , up from the current 1.2 percent .
