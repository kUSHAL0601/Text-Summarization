-- a @entity2 educator arrested after a former student accused her in a @entity5 video of sexual abuse had her arraignment pushed back yet again friday , meaning she wo n't formally answer to the charges for another six weeks
@entity12 was charged in february with five counts of aggravated sexual assault on a child and 11 counts of lewd acts on a child , the the @entity11 district attorney 's office said
her arraignment , originally scheduled for thursday , was moved to 9 a.m. ( noon et ) friday
but , while @entity12 was in court , she was n't arraigned
according to @entity21 , a spokesman for the district attorney 's office , her arraignment was continued to april 18 at the defense 's request
@entity12 's lawyers also plan to ask to reduce her bail then , @entity21 said
the charges that @entity12 faces came after a former student , now 28 , posted a @entity5 video in which she accused the educator of abusing her at age 12
@entity12 faces possible life in prison if convicted of the aggravated sexual assault charges
@entity12 's lawyer , @entity35 , said in a written statement earlier this week that in the face of " very public claims of abuse , " it would be his task " to see that justice prevails in the midst of the media wildfire
" he added , " fortunately , our justice system requires more than a @entity5 video to determine the facts of a case
as we proceed , i am certain that evidence will shed new light on all charges filed by the @entity54 's office against my client
" @entity35 said @entity12 was grateful for the " outpouring of support from her family , friends , colleagues , and students during this difficult time
" earlier , he said @entity12 's legal team planned to challenge the filing against the statute of limitations and challenge the bail motion to reduce the amount from $ 5 million
but @entity21 , the district attorney 's office spokesman , said there is no statute of limitations in @entity2 on the most serious charge -- aggravated sexual assault on a child under 14
after the first woman posted a @entity5 video of her accusations in january , another woman came forward
the second alleged victim , now 18 , has filed a complaint accusing the @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity2 , of negligence
@entity86 , lawyer for the older accuser , said , " she is very gratified that the @entity54 has brought charges against this perpetrator
she hopes justice is done in the criminal case and that @entity12 admits to what she 's done , which she already admitted to in the phone call -- that she ruined her childhood
" @entity12 resigned january 17 from her most recent job as an administrator at @entity98 in @entity2 after the first accusation was uploaded on @entity5 , according to the school district
the video features the alleged victim on camera and what is said to be the teacher 's voice on a phone conversation
in the video , the teacher can be heard acknowledging the abuse claim
the first alleged victim said the abuse took place " off and on " for her between the ages of 12 and 18
she said she did n't come forward as a teenager because the teacher had brainwashed her
" she told me that my family did n't love me
she told me that nobody cared about me and that she was the only one that loved me and the only one that was there for me , " she said
" she made me believe that she was my only friend , and that i could trust her
" the alleged victim said she did n't want a physical relationship , but she said the teacher threatened her multiple times
" she said that she would kill herself if i ever left
and i believed that , " the alleged victim said @entity0 's @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this story .
