-- @entity1 and his @entity3 team have left their @entity5 rivals trailing in their wake during a three - year domination of the sport
but ahead of the 2013 season getting underway in @entity11 later this month , it is the triple world champion and his all - conquering team which has some catching up to do after a preseason which has not gone entirely to plan
@entity3 , and every other team , was left in @entity17 ' rear - view mirrors at the final preseason test in @entity19 last weekend , with @entity1 failing to top the charts at any of the offseason practice
@entity1 insists there is still time for @entity3 to turn it around ahead of 2013 's curtain raiser on march 17 , when he will begin his bid to become only the third driver to win four consecutive championships
" i would have loved to work more on the set - up , but i do n't think that this is only me
i think everybody struggled in that area , " the 25 - year - old told @entity5 's official website
" we can not be satisfied with the state of affairs right now ... there is still time before @entity36 to make some significant changes
" @entity1 has been left frustrated by the tires introduced by the sport 's official supplier @entity39 , which are softer than in 2012
pirelli claim the new tires will speed up races and promote overtaking
" it is extremely difficult to pinpoint any exact area we are not satisfied with because the tires are not consistent enough , " continued @entity1
" we need to have a good look at the data between now and @entity36 to have a better understanding of what to expect in @entity11 and the first few races of the season
in my opinion , lap times did n't matter all through the winter tests
" regardless of preseason statistics , @entity1 will be the man every driver on the grid will be targeting when the lights go out at @entity36 's @entity63
" i would say that we never had a winter that was less conclusive than this one : the tires last more or less , depending on how much temperature you are able to create , " added @entity1
" so i think it is impossible for all of us to read the pace of the cars and to make out any favorites
" @entity1 will now head back to the team 's @entity76 base in @entity78 before taking some time out ahead of the start of the campaign
" immediately into the simulator ! " said @entity1 when asked what was next on his agenda
" to continue where we left business on sunday
" we will then sit down and filter and interpret all the data that we have collected over the testing period to see what we can read out of it
" finally , before heading to @entity36 i will allow myself some final quiet days before the season starts with all its force
" @entity1 made a slow start to the 2012 as there were eight different winners in the first eight races , but a run of four straight victories in the autumn set him on the way to his title triple , while @entity3 retained the constructors ' title .
