@entity0 -- @entity2 won the @entity3 for the first time in 44 years to deny rivals @entity5 a 20th domestic championship in a gripping conclusion to the @entity9 season
defending champions @entity5 had looked on course to win the title after winning 1 - 0 at @entity13 thanks to @entity15 's first - half effort , but @entity2 scored two remarkable stoppage - time goals to fashion an improbable 3 - 2 home victory against @entity18
@entity2 had led the table on goal difference at the start of sunday and @entity23 's first - half goal suggested @entity25 's side would comfortably win their first title since 1968
but a mistake by @entity29 allowed @entity30 to level and following a red card for @entity18 midfielder @entity32 , @entity27 popped up to head in the visitors ' second goal to give @entity5 fans hope that their team might yet snatch the title from their city rivals
@entity2 bombarded the @entity18 penalty area and in stoppage time @entity41 headed home to give their fans hope , before @entity45 scored a stunning individual winner in a finale that no script writer would have dared pen
it was a goal that ensured @entity2 won the title on goal difference in the @entity9 's 20th season , arguably the most dramatic finish in its history given it was decided in the last three minutes
" to win it like this is incredible , " @entity25 , who at times during the second half gave the impression he could barely believe his side appeared to be doing all they could to throw away the title , told @entity60
" i do n't think i 've ever seen a finale like this
" we did n't deserve to lose , we had a lot of chances and we deserved to win the game and championship
" it 's fantastic for the club and the supporters after 44 years
it 's been a crazy season and a crazy last minute
" in 1999 @entity5 won the @entity75 final with two stoppage - time goals against @entity77 in @entity78 and sunday 's epic events bore parallel , though this time the @entity81 manager sir @entity80 had to suffer as victory was snatched away from him in those heart - palpitating final moments
" i would like to say on behalf of @entity5 congratulations to our neighbors , " said @entity80
" it 's a fantastic achievement to win the @entity9
it 's the hardest league in the world and anyone who wins it deserves it
" the rollercoaster game at the @entity93 that wrung every ounce of emotion out of both @entity2 and @entity18 fans had consequences at the other end of the table given a @entity18 defeat would have condemned them to relegation if @entity102 had beaten @entity103 away -- and at one stage @entity105 's side led 2 - 1 at the @entity107
but a 77th - minute @entity109 goal earned @entity103 a 2 - 2 draw to relegate @entity102 to the @entity111 and allow @entity18 -- managed by former @entity2 manager @entity112 -- to stay up in the @entity9
@entity113 finished third after a 3 - 2 win at @entity115 to secure their @entity75 place , while north @entity0 rivals @entity117 beat @entity118 2 - 0 to take fourth
spurs will join @entity113 in the @entity75 only if @entity120 lose to @entity77 in the @entity75 final on may 19
@entity123 's hopes of a @entity75 place evaporated after a 3 - 1 defeat at @entity126 , though @entity128 's team have the consolation of a @entity131 place
it is estimated that @entity2 's owner @entity133 from the ruling family of @entity135 in the @entity136 has invested close to $ 1.6 billion in securing this @entity9 title
the title gives @entity2 's owners huge kudos , though not necessarily immediate financial benefits
" it should be remembered that there is a price of success , namely bonus payments to players and managers , " financial blogger @entity142 , who writes the @entity144 blog , told @entity1
" in fact , it is entirely possible that the net financial result might be negative for a direct comparison between finishing first or second , though it might be different if the comparison is against coming , say , sixth the previous season
" it is a title that @entity2 probably should have wrapped up a long time ago
at one stage in december after their barnstorming start to the season -- notably a 6 - 1 win over the defending champions at @entity164 -- @entity2 were eight points of @entity5 after beating @entity166 5 - 1
however , a combination of @entity168 going awol after falling out with @entity25 , @entity170 's absence as he played for the @entity171 at the @entity172 , @entity174 's dip in form and @entity177 's ill - disciplined antics allowed the defending champions to claw back that deficit and go eight points clear
but a disastrous april for @entity5 -- including a 1 - 0 defeat by @entity2 at the @entity93 -- enabled @entity25 's team to move top on goal difference going into the final round of matches
sunday 's games were broadcast to 211 countries around the world -- testament to the @entity9 's global appeal
the remarkable end to the season could not have come at a better time for the league given it has recently announced the new tender for its next three - year broadcasting rights starting from the 2013 - 14 season
" games going down to the last game of the season will certainly increase interest and may in turn show the league as more valuable because of the unresolved title , @entity75 and relegation issues , " said lawyer @entity197 of @entity198
sunday 's 10 games also ensured this was the most prolific @entity9 season ever with 1,066 goals , beating last season 's record total of 1,063 .
