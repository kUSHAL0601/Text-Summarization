-- boxing world champion @entity1 has told @entity0 that @entity2 will become the 50th knockout victim of his career when the two face - off in july
the @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 heavyweight champion is set to face @entity10 champ @entity2 in @entity11 , @entity12 , on july 2 in a bid to unify four of the division 's five belts
the @entity16 recently pulled out of his scheduled april 30 fight with another @entity20 boxer , @entity19 , and boasts a formidable record during his 15 - year career , winning 55 of his 58 fights -- 49 coming via knockout
and he claims @entity2 is the perfect man to help him notch up a landmark half century
he told @entity0 : " i knocked out 49 fighters and @entity2 is going to be the 50th on my list
i am looking forward to it , i will get a great challenge in the ring
" he will try to get through with his strategy , psychological and physical game and i 'm ready for it because i 'm a true professional athlete and have been doing it for such a long time
i love to be challenged
" @entity38 can also point to an impressive record in the sport , having won 25 of his 26 fights , 23 coming via knockout
the 30 - year - old moved up from the @entity44 in 2008 and has made public his desire to fight @entity1 , and his older brother , the @entity47 heavyweight champion @entity46 , before he retires on his birthday -- october 13 this year
when @entity1 was asked what would happen if @entity2 was to win their july bout , he replied : " ( defeat ) is not an option -- myself and @entity46 are going to unify all the belts
" @entity2 is quick and his record speaks for itself
he won a lot of fights by knockout , so i will not underestimate his speed or his punching power
" i 've been in boxing for last 15 years and i 'm going to be close to 60 fights , i know exactly what to expect from every single opponent
" @entity1 also denied that he will enjoy any advantage from the fact that the contest will be staged in @entity12 -- the country that has hosted many of his title fights in the past
he explained : " it 's not really an advantage because the ring is the same everywhere -- it has four corners with a referee in between you and your opponent
" it 's all about the way you fight and how you follow through with your plan and tactics
