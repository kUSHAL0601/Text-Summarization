-- the pictures might be nsfw -- at least if you 're looking at them over lunch -- but @entity6 founder sir @entity5 was certainly working it on sunday

two years ago , @entity5 and @entity25 ceo @entity24 wagered on their @entity27 racing teams , each man betting his own team would finish ahead of the other 's in the 2010 @entity28 in @entity29
the loser would have to serve as a female flight attendant on the winner 's airline
on sunday , he honored the bet by serving on a special @entity17 charity flight
@entity5 wore heavy makeup , including fake eyelashes and bright red lipstick
at a cocktail event in @entity18 the night before the flight , he had his legs shaved , but managed to keep his mustache
" this has been a real first for me but i have enjoyed the experience and i have nothing but respect for what our fabulous flight attendants do every day to keep us safe , " said @entity5 after the flight
" he is an entrepreneur , visionary , knight and adventurer , sir @entity5 can now also add @entity17 flight attendant to his long list of credentials , " joked @entity24
during the five - and - a - half - hour flight , @entity5 poured coffee and tea , served meals , distributed merchandise , made in - flight announcements and entertained the passengers , according to an @entity17 statement
he also accidentally ( read : deliberately ) tipped a tray of drinks over @entity24 during the flight
the two are close friends
for each seat sold for the event , @entity17 is donating a $ 100 ( $ 100 ) to @entity73 , an @entity19 - based organization dedicated to seriously ill and hospitalized children and their families
the event raised approximately $ 200,000 for the charity .
