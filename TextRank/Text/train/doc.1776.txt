-- should the world 's best video game players -- those who earn six figures and play professionally -- be considered athletes ? are they on par with @entity8 ? people who read @entity0 's recent story on pro gaming and gaming addiction in @entity13 raised these questions in comments threads , on @entity16 and over e-mail
many criticized @entity0 for highlighting the dark side of video gaming in that country , instead of celebrating the achievements of the world 's best e-sports athletes
specifically at issue was the story of @entity27 , one of the world 's best " @entity33 " players who , in the past , worried his parents and teachers because he practiced sometimes for 20 hours a day
they flagged him as a potential gaming " addict , " but his parents now support his quest to be the world 's best at the strategy game he loves
furthermore , they regret having pushed back against their son 's passion
how do you draw the line between obsessive , unhealthy behavior and a drive to be the world 's best ? should pro gamers ( or chess players , for that matter ) be put in the same class as track - and - field stars and gymnasts , who also go to extreme lengths to get in shape for competition ? many pro gamers in @entity13 , for example , are required to run , swim and lift weights as part of their training
here 's a look at what some of you had to say
comments may be edited for brevity and clarity : on the training schedules of pro gamers vs @entity8 : " would you claim that @entity73 is addicted to swimming ? simply because someone works hard at something that is not what you view as a traditional sport does not mean their work is not real , and difficult
i dare you to compare top e-sport athlete 's training regimens to top @entity85 athletes training regimens
i would n't be surprised in the least if their schedules were similar
" -- @entity88 , 22 , from @entity89 , @entity90 on @entity27 as an athlete : " to me , @entity92 ( @entity27 ) represents many things
he represents dedication and skill and perseverance
he is one of the best in the world at one of the most difficult endeavors that has ever existed and he is beloved by his fans for good @entity103 to mention him in the same breath as something bizarre like addiction is to belittle everything he has worked for and everything we as a community value
" -- twitter user @ kevinflo , over e-mail on passion / love vs. addiction : " they make money doing something they love , which takes hard work , perseverance and sacrifice
" -- @entity0 commenter " @entity127 " on when that passion goes too far : " we all know that most pro gamers started because they became addicted to gaming , not because they played every now and then
and it was their addiction and their willingness to spend most of their time in front of a computer that made them so good and eligible to become pros
also , it 's not because you make money doing something that makes it ok ( just look at gambling )
you can rationalize it as much as you want but an addiction is an addiction , period
it means that your life is not balanced and therefore it means you have a problem
are there other ( more conventional ) professions in the world like that ? of course there are
but two wrongs do n't make one right
" -- @entity0 commenter " diiggas " on the skill required to be a pro gamer : " this article did not truly distinguish the difference between game addiction and professional gaming or even gaming as a hobby
i do no ( t ) believe the article shows the amount of skill needed to be one of the best in the world or how truly big professional gaming has become
" -- @entity177 , 24 , from @entity178 , @entity179 on " physicality " being an important part of athletics : " i would n't call them athletes
the one common denominator with all @entity8 is the physicality involved
even the word athlete refers to physical activity
i have no issues with video gaming , but the @entity85 just seems to be the wrong venue
" -- @entity0 commenter " t0of1y " on video games as physical challenges : " their reflexes ( physical ) approach the zenith of human capability
" -- @entity0 commenter " @entity199 " we would love to continue this conversation , so please let us know what you think in the comments section of this post , or message @entity207 on @entity16 or @entity209 .
