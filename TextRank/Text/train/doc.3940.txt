-- a @entity3 census worker who was found dead in september committed suicide and staged the scene to look like a homicide , authorities said tuesday
the body of @entity8 , 51 , was found september 12 near a cemetery in southeastern @entity3 's @entity10
he was wearing only socks
" a thorough examination of evidence from the scene , to include dna testing , as well as examination of his vehicle and his residence , resulted in the determination that mr. @entity8 , alone , handled the key pieces of evidence with no indications of any other persons involved , " @entity13 said
@entity8 's wrists were bound with duct tape , and a rope around his neck was tied to a tree , but his body was touching the ground , authorities said
he had " @entity37 " written on his chest in black ink
however , @entity8 's wrists were loosely bound in front of his body at shoulder width apart , allowing for " considerable mobility , " said @entity13 capt. @entity42
he was also in contact with the ground , " almost on his knees , " she said
" to survive , all mr. @entity8 had to do was stand up
" @entity47 on the body -- marks made as blood stops pumping and settles in areas of the body -- showed that @entity8 died in the same position , @entity42 said
his glasses were taped to his head , and that tape was underneath tape that held a rag in his mouth , she said
" mr. @entity8 had extremely poor eyesight " and so would have needed his glasses secured , @entity42 said
but the most compelling evidence came from the fact that @entity8 had obtained $ 600,000 in accidental - death insurance , which would not have paid in the event of a suicide , as late as may , she said
in addition , he told a " credible witness " of his plans to commit suicide and stage the scene to make it look like he was slain because he worked for the federal government
the details were consistent with how @entity8 died and was found , @entity42 said
the witness did not take action after @entity8 shared his plans out of a belief that he would not follow through , authorities said
" it was learned that mr. @entity8 had discussed recent federal investigations and the perceived negative attitudes toward federal entities by some residents of @entity10 , " @entity3 state police said in a statement
police believe that @entity8 's primary motive in staging the scene was to ensure that the insurance would be paid , @entity42 said
his motive for committing suicide or any secondary motives might never be known , she said , as @entity8 left no note
" we do n't know what mr. @entity8 was thinking or why he ultimately committed this act , " she said
autopsy results showed no evidence of any cancer or terminal illness , officials said , although it was reported that @entity8 had previously had lymphoma
police would not say who the beneficiary of the insurance was
forensic analysis of the writing on @entity8 's chest showed that he had written it himself , @entity42 said
analysts found ink dots , made by writers on completing a letter , at the top of the letters , rather than at the bottom -- as would be expected if someone had made the writing on @entity8
despite a search by authorities , the black felt pen used for the writing has not been found
police do not believe that anyone assisted @entity8 , she said
@entity8 had told the witness , whom police declined to name , that he intended to dispose of some of his personal effects , including his laptop computer and other items
police have not found those items , @entity42 said
toxicology tests showed that @entity8 was not drugged or under the influence of any substance , she said
the red rag removed from his mouth was similar to those found in his pocket and at the scene
dna testing of the rags and the rope used in creating a ligature on @entity8 's neck , as well as 7 feet of discarded rope discarded near his body , found only @entity8 's dna , she said
the police investigation is still open , and additional test results are expected in the next two to three weeks , authorities said
authorities met with @entity8 's son and told him of their findings before publicly releasing them
" our hearts go out to him , " @entity42 said
" he still lost his father at the end of the day
" she would not say whether his son accepted the findings , saying she did not want to speak for the family .
