-- @entity1 may not have had the hops of @entity3 , the strength of @entity5 or the touch of @entity7
but he 'll always be the first
@entity1 played a single season -- 1946 - 1947 -- with the @entity10 , but still managed to make his mark on the @entity12 by scoring what the league says is its first points
on tuesday , according to his former team , @entity1 died at age 94
" @entity1 was a true @entity12 pioneer , " @entity12 commissioner @entity18 said
the history was made november 1 , 1946 , when the @entity21 traveled to @entity22 to take on the @entity23
video from that game -- the first in what was then the @entity28 , which a few years later became the @entity12 -- shows him finishing a give - and - go with a layup
" they score a clean first basket , " the announcer says on the video
" by the time that shot went through the hoop , @entity1 had already made a name for himself on the court
the @entity21 native attended @entity40 in @entity41 , then went about 25 miles east to play at @entity42
there , he starred on two teams -- in 1939 and 1941 -- that won the @entity45 , then considered in many respects more prestigious than the @entity48 tourney
he earned first - team @entity50 honors after that second title , his university notes
after graduating college , @entity1 joined the @entity54 ( which stood for @entity54 ) of the @entity55
he would perhaps be most associated with that pro team if it were not for his time with the @entity21 , including the first points in its first game , which @entity21 won 68 - 66
his on - court prowess helped land him spots in the @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity66 @entity65
" what kind of player was @entity1 ? " asks a tweet on the official @entity12 history feed
" think ( @entity71 )
a relentless penetrator who would routinely set up his teammates
" @entity1 was accomplished outside basketball as well
as @entity42 noted in a profile upon granting @entity1 with its distinguished alumni award in 2013 , he served in the @entity79 @entity78 during @entity80 @entity1 had success in business as well , including more than three decades working in @entity84 's garment district before his retirement from @entity86 and @entity87
he and his wife , @entity88 , had two children and two grandchildren
still , it 's that one shot in the fall of 1946 , immortalized in the documentary film " @entity94 , " that many most associate him with , now and for decades to come
people we lost in 2013
