-- it is likely that radical cleric @entity2 -- who was found guilty on terror charges by a @entity5 federal jury this week --- will now spend the rest of his life in a @entity9 top security prison while his victims will gain some succor from the fact that he is finally behind bars
however , merely stopping high - profile extremist preachers is not enough if the threat they represent is to be confronted
much more needs to be done to challenge extremist narratives , ideas and propaganda if we are prevent the next generation of extremist preachers from emerging
there was a time , during the 1980s and early 1990s , when individuals would rarely become radicalized without direct contact with an extremist preacher of some description
in this context , preachers such as @entity2 became highly significant as recruiters and propagandists
their ability to tailor the @entity33 worldview to young and impressionable audiences in @entity35 and @entity36 allowed them to target a generation of @entity38 born and raised in the @entity39
however , even though many key extremist preachers have now been arrested or deported -- such as @entity42 and @entity43 -- extremist narratives are still being disseminated and reaching their target audiences
the likes of @entity2 have left a legacy which has now been taken on by some @entity39 - born recruits , using educational institutions , prisons and the @entity50 to spread extremist messages
the fact that an estimated 400 @entity54 citizens are believed to have traveled to @entity55 to join jihadist groups suggests their efforts are having some success
in tackling extremism we need to ensure universities and colleges are not hosting extremist preachers without providing a robust challenge to their views
we need to ensure prisoners are offered mentoring and support to turn their lives around , making them less susceptible to recruitment within prisons
online extremism also needs to be challenged with counter-arguments ; this could be done through websites and social media accounts that confront the extremist narrative
a recent @entity78 report further details how this can be done
arresting key individuals or shutting down extremist websites -- as some @entity35 governments propose -- are not long - term solutions to this problem
extremist narratives only lose their appeal when they are undermined and thoroughly discredited ; when the debate is opened up and won by their opponents , rather than being shut down and lost
we need to enter the realm of ideas and pitch more positive and enlightened values against extreme and regressive arguments
the extreme @entity95 narrative offers listeners a simplistic framework through which all geo - political developments are misconstrued
just as @entity99 view all activities as part of a class struggle , so extreme islamists rely on a @entity39 versus @entity105 framework or a @entity38 versus @entity107 rivalry
in the view of such extreme islamists , @entity38 are at war while non-muslim states and political entities form part of a broad struggle to undermine @entity105
conflict zones -- such as @entity55 , @entity116 or @entity117 -- are viewed not as localised or isolated conflicts but part of a grand conspiracy to undermine @entity105 and prevent the emergence of a utopian @entity95 super-power
undermining extreme @entity95 is about undermining the framework or narrative that is being used
this involves discrediting it and exposing its inaccuracies from a political , historical and theological point of view
it is also about revealing the true nature of the extremist narrative and presenting it in its unembellished form
extremists often rely on highlighting a select number of grievances , while ignoring other less convenient ones , in order to create moral outrage and garner sympathy
exposing this selective and agenda driven approach to conflict zones and political developments is key to discrediting their efforts
ultimately , extremism will stop appealing to young people when it becomes unfashionable and is regarded as yesterday 's news
however , or that to happen we need not only counter-narratives but also alternative narratives through which the world can be understood and appreciated
for this to happen we need more political literacy , more spaces in which young people can discuss political and social developments and a stronger sense of national and regional identity so that people feel a greater sense of rootedness and belonging
we undermine extremists by illustrating how our values are better than theirs and offering constructive answers in opposition to their destructive proposals .
