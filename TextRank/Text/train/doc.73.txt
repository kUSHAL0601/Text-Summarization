-- when we think about asylum , the picture that most people draw in their heads is of some persecuted person crossing a border to a safe country and pleading his or her case
@entity12 journalists who have walked across international bridges into the @entity14 , fearing drug cartel reprisals , come to mind
or the @entity18 athletes who during tournaments abroad decide to defect , and ask for asylum
this is the traditional , and most common way , to request asylum
but as the latest twist in the @entity24 case shows , there are rare times when asylum is granted to someone who has yet to reach their safe haven
@entity30 's decision this week to grant asylum to @entity24 was celebrated as a victory by his supporters , but the @entity36 founder 's conundrum remains unchanged
for the foreseeable future , he is stuck inside the @entity30 embassy in @entity40
@entity30 may have granted asylum to the man inside their embassy , but the @entity44 does n't recognize it
at issue are divergent views on the concept of diplomatic asylum -- a nation 's granting of asylum to someone not inside its territory
the concept of diplomatic asylum is as old as the practice of having permanent embassies in foreign countries
it is tied closely with the practice of diplomatic immunity , which is more well known
but controversies over countries using diplomatic asylum to protect people wanted for crimes led to the practice falling out of favor , according to a @entity68 report devoted to the subject in 1975
from the 19th century onward , the practice of diplomatic asylum virtually disappeared in @entity72 , while it continued to grow in @entity73
the result is that today , the view in most of world is that diplomatic asylum , in essence , does not exist
the exception is @entity73 , where some legal writers even grant diplomatic asylum the status of a human right , the @entity68 report says
one last tidbit of academic dryness before considering the @entity24 case : the prevailing view that diplomatic asylum is not part of accepted international law was settled in a case between @entity92 and @entity93 before the @entity94 in 1950
@entity95 , a @entity92 , led an unsuccessful rebellion in @entity92 and was wanted by authorities there
he hid in the @entity93 embassy in @entity99 and asked for , and received asylum from @entity93
@entity92 , however , refused to grant safe passage
sound familiar ? the court ruled that diplomatic asylum is not recognized unless treaties or other agreements are in place between countries
so today , " in general international law there is n't actually a right to grant diplomatic asylum , or at least other states are n't required to respect it , " said @entity108 , an international law expert at the @entity109
what it means for @entity24 is that @entity30 's declaration might not do anything to help him
in fact , @entity108 said , under international law , if the @entity44 officially requests @entity30 to hand over @entity24 , @entity30 would be legally obligated to do so
@entity44 has made it clear that it will not provide safe passage and intends to extradite @entity24 to @entity125 , but it is unclear if the government has sent a formal request for him
the @entity44 's position has been to negotiate a solution
a negotiated solution staved off a similar diplomatic drama between the @entity14 and @entity134 this year
the blind @entity134 activist @entity135 had escaped house arrest and sought refuge inside the @entity14 embassy
unlike the @entity24 case , however , @entity135 did not ask for asylum and none was granted
instead , @entity142 invited @entity135 to study there , and @entity134 agreed to let him go
with negotiations apparently deadlocked between @entity30 and @entity44 , it is uncertain how long @entity24 will remain holed up inside the embassy while @entity125 awaits to question him over claims of rape and sexual molestation
" these cases can go on for years if there is n't some settlement
it 's happened in the past , " @entity108 said
the @entity92 who sought asylum from the @entity93 embassy in 1950 lived there for five years
meanwhile , some experts questioned the validity of the arguments that @entity30 used to grant asylum
@entity30 's decision was based on the belief that @entity125 would eventually turn @entity24 over to the @entity14 , and that his life would be at risk once in @entity14 custody , former @entity30 foreign minister @entity165 told @entity0 en @entity166
" that is making a hypothesis on top of a hypothesis , and to justify a decision on that is not very strong , " he said
the purpose of an embassy is to maintain ties with other countries , but as long as @entity24 remains in limbo , " every day it will become a greater obstacle in their efforts toward good relations
