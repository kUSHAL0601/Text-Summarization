-- @entity1 landed a record extending ninth @entity4 title this year and also reached the final of the @entity6
but typical for the @entity8 in recent campaigns , those grand slam accomplishments mingled with further health woes
looking back on his 2014 , it 's no wonder , then , that @entity1 utters : " too many things ( happened ) to be happy during " the whole year
" that 's part of my life , though
it 's happened a few times in my career
and in keeping with @entity1 's approach during his recovery from an avalanche of afflictions in the past , he vows to " keep working hard
" " now i have a month to prepare for the 2015 season , and that 's my goal , " the 28 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity26 in late november shortly before the groundbreaking ceremony of the @entity28 and @entity29
" i 'm going to work as much as i can , hope to be healthy for that
if i am healthy , i am confident that i can come back strong again
" @entity33 , a former top - five player who made the semifinals at the @entity35 and quarterfinals at @entity1 's beloved @entity4 in the 1980s , is n't about to disagree
" ever since he came onto the tour , he had all the markings of a guy that would be done with tennis by 26 , 27 , because his game was such a grind mentally and physically , " @entity33 , now a tennis analyst for several networks , told @entity0
" he 's obviously outlasted that age
he 's made of sterner stuff than most of us because he 's able to keep coming back from injuries and long layoffs and continues to dominate
" now , you get the sense that he 's going to be as always -- if he 's physically fit
if @entity1 's body might be giving him a few problems , his mind remains as strong as ever
it 's his psychological strength that sets him apart from the rest , according to @entity33
" i would say he 's the greatest mental player in the history of the sport
not strategy , necessarily , but the ability to play every point as if that 's the most important one you 've ever played , and do it every match
" @entity1 is a veteran at coming back , having been slowed by , most notably , injuries to both knees
however , this year saw the 14 - time grand slam champion miss a chunk of time due to a back problem , wrist complaint and appendix surgery , in that order
it all began at the @entity6 in january , when @entity1 hurt his back while warming up in the final against @entity78
holding a 12 - 0 record without conceding a set to the @entity82 heading into the contest , a hampered @entity1 fell in four sets with the ordeal leaving him in tears
recently he has undergone stem - cell treatment to aid his back after the same therapy , he said , helped his problematic , famous knees
the back bothered @entity1 , he added , throughout 2014
" i repeated the treatment that worked very well for my knees at the end of last year , so i am doing that for my back now and i hope i have a good success on that , " he said
when the wrist sidelined @entity1 at the @entity35 , it ensured another year he skipped a major -- the last time he contested all four in a season came in 2011
contrast his attendance with @entity102 -- the only man ahead of @entity1 on the grand slam ladder with 17 titles
the smooth @entity102 has appeared in 60 consecutive grand slams , a men 's record
@entity1 subsequently underwent appendix surgery in early november , ruling him out of the prestigious year - end championships in @entity110
" i started this year believing that i was ready for everything again , " said @entity1 , looking back to the start of 2014
" i started well , playing the final in @entity114 , but during the final i injured my back
it was hard for me to accept that i did n't have the chance to compete in the final , " he added , referring to his defeat by @entity78 in the opening slam of the season
" then i went down for a while
takes a little bit of time to recover from that mentally and physically
i was coming back to my best again ... playing better and better every single week and arriving in @entity125 with a great level
" then i won there and i was fully confident again
it was the most beautiful part of the year for me
" @entity130 's grass has n't been as pleasant for @entity1 since he nabbed the last of his two titles in 2010
hindered by his knees in 2012 and 2013 , he was on the receiving end of two of the biggest upsets in @entity130 history , exiting to @entity138 and @entity139 , respectively
in the most recent edition , @entity1 succumbed to fearless young @entity114 @entity141 , who seemingly could do no wrong on his serve in the fourth - round tussle
@entity141 struck 37 aces and was broken once
there was , though , a positive for @entity1
" i felt the knees were more comfortable playing there , " he said
" that 's important for me
" i loved that match , but i could n't win that match
that can happen on grass but i was proud the way that i played this year
" next year @entity1 's chances at @entity130 should increase , since an extra week features between the @entity4 and the year 's third grand slam
@entity1 is n't thinking yet about winning a 10th @entity4 or triumphing at @entity130 , more preoccupied with being ready -- and competitive -- for the @entity6 next month
@entity1 won the @entity6 in 2009 , but lately his memories of @entity157 presumably have n't been as upbeat
aside from his back issue versus @entity78 , he retired in 2010 , injured his hamstring in 2011 as he sought a fourth straight grand slam title -- or the ' @entity161 ' -- and lost the longest grand slam final in history in 2012 to @entity164
" my main goal today is try to put my body and my tennis again in a competitive way , " said @entity1
" that 's what i 'm going to try to do during this december
i am thinking i am ( focused ) about @entity114 because i like a lot of years in @entity114 , and i felt that i was doing the right things there so many years during my career
" i have a special motivation for that
