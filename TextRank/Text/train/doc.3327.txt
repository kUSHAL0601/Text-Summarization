-- while hosting @entity0 's @entity2 this week , i said : " republicans are practically cheering for @entity4 today
he 's given them a new excuse to bash president @entity8
" i pointed out that @entity3 have been slamming @entity8 for his handling of the @entity11 crisis even though i have not heard a single , specific way in which they would handle the situation differently
no new ideas , just new insults
the howls came quickly , and my assertion has been repeatedly attacked and mischaracterized
but the evidence to support it is , troublingly , everywhere
i 'm not saying republicans are pro-putin or that they want him to invade @entity11
but they certainly have — conveniently , even gleefully -- found a good way to put @entity4 's actions to political use at home
just listen to former @entity26 mayor @entity25 on monday : " @entity4 decides what he wants to do and he does it in half a day ... he makes a decision and he executes it
that 's what you call a leader
" and @entity36 : " people are looking at @entity4 as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil ; they look at our president as one who wears mom jeans and equivocates and bloviates
" @entity3 leaders are not only bashing @entity8 , but appearing to praise @entity4
there 's more : sen. @entity49 , @entity50 , seemed to blame the @entity11 crisis on @entity8 , telling the @entity52 this week , " this is the ultimate result of a feckless foreign policy in which nobody believes in @entity57 's strength anymore
" sen. @entity60 , @entity62 - @entity61 , has weighed in : " we have a weak and indecisive president that invites aggression , " as did rep. @entity63 , @entity64 : " emboldened by president @entity8 's trembling inaction , @entity4 has invaded the @entity59 region of @entity11
" and on and on
opinion : 5 lessons for a new @entity72 listen , there 's nothing wrong with criticizing the president 's policy positions or actions
to hold a president 's feet to the fire over every aspect of government is the job not only of our elected leaders but of all citizens
substantive dissent is indeed patriotic
but substantive dissent is not what we have here
we have baseless , petty politics that are ultimately counterproductive to @entity57 's global standing
on saturday , sen. @entity91 , @entity92 , published a list of steps he thinks @entity8 should take to " punish @entity95
" they included calling @entity95 's actions an invasion — which , um , secretary of state @entity99 actually did the same day that @entity91 made his demand — and sending @entity99 to @entity101 , which was announced a day later
the ranking @entity3 on the @entity102 , sen. @entity103 , @entity104 , called for immediate sanctions against @entity95 -- but the @entity106 under @entity8 's direction was already drafting a package of stiff sanctions
@entity3 have also called for visa bans for @entity95 leaders and asset freezes
well , on sunday , @entity99 said , " there could even be , ultimately , asset freezes , visa bans
there could be certainly disruption of any of the normal trade routine
there could be business drawback on investment in the country
" he said the major world powers are " going to isolate @entity95 " and " all options are on the table
" @entity57 paves way for sanctions on @entity95 , @entity11 over @entity59 if the @entity8 administration is already acting on the initiatives that its @entity3 critics are demanding in response to the @entity11 crisis , why are they complaining ? because , they allege , it 's because @entity8 has been so weak for five years that @entity4 thought he could get away with invading @entity11
let 's look at that argument more closely
in august 2008 , @entity4 invaded the @entity139 while @entity140 was @entity141
where were the " weakness " complaints from @entity3 ? well , conservative columnist @entity145 — who has said that in the @entity11 situation @entity8 's " inaction created a vacuum " and who derided the president 's statements on @entity11 as " weak " — said of the @entity139 invasion back in 2008 , " well , obviously it 's beyond our control
there is nothing that will stop them
" conservative @entity160 national security staffer @entity159 exuded a similar calm in 2008 : " there 's no easy answer ; there 's only tough choices ... @entity95 is a tough nut to crack
" apparently when a @entity169 is president the situation is much simpler
last friday , @entity159 explained that the @entity95 invasion of @entity59 is proof that " this administration 's policy toward @entity95 has been a failure
there 's another aspect to this @entity3 hypocrisy
@entity49 recently called @entity8 " the most naïve president in history " because of his foreign policy tactics
and yet it was @entity140 who famously said , upon meeting @entity4 , " i looked the man in the eye
i found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy , and we had a very good dialogue
i was able to get a sense of his soul
" did @entity3 find him " weak " ? " @entity188 " ? contrast this with @entity8 , who , against considerable odds , wrangled @entity95 into a constructive role on @entity193 sanctions , @entity195 chemical weapons removal and a new start treaty
it is not merely laughable to call this president , who has unfortunately expanded the use of drone warfare and who also ordered the mission to kill @entity203 , " weak
" it is also self - destructive to our national interest , since absent any substantive disagreements , it reveals only national disunity in the face of a global crisis
it 's what @entity3 might call -- if the other party were doing it — poor leadership
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .
