@entity0 presses a key on the enormous @entity4 organ console in front of him and a police siren wails across the cinema stage
a second key brings the sound of tweeting birds , and another the clopping sound of horse hooves , as if someone is standing off - stage with a pair of coconut shells
then he flexes his fingers , leans in to the array of keyboards and launches into a cheery rendition of " @entity22
" the organ 's pipes throb , sing and trill with the power of a full orchestra
were if not for for the fact @entity0 is wearing jeans and a plaid shirt , we could be transported back to the early 1940s , when the @entity32 organ was in its heyday at the @entity34 -- an immaculately preserved art deco cinema in the heart of @entity37
the @entity34 was an opulent masterpiece when it opened in the 1920s -- its owner , @entity40 , took pains to equip it with the best organ his money could buy
a @entity46 immigrant originally from @entity47 , @entity40 was killed along with his family in a @entity50 concentration camp during the @entity51 and his cinema renamed the @entity53
after the war it reverted to its original name and in the 1980s benefited from an expensive restoration project that returned much of its original grandeur
fascination with insects today it 's a fully functioning three - screen film theater operated by @entity63 cinema chain @entity62
the @entity64 regularly rolls out the red carpet for movie stars as the location for most major premieres in the @entity69
the lushly decorated lobby and grand hall -- with elaborate fixtures and decorations said to be inspired by @entity40 's fascination with insects -- are impressive enough , but the cinema 's star attraction is its @entity4 organ
it 's still capable of producing rich sounds , largely thanks to the efforts of a team of volunteers from the @entity84 , who use mechanical ingenuity to keep the instrument going
" when we first took her apart , she was in a very bad condition , " said @entity88 , a 55 - year - old computer programmer who worked on a project to restore the organ with @entity0 , a 67 - year - old piano tuner , bookkeeper @entity92 , 76 , and other volunteers and technicians
" it 's taken us many , many years to fix her up and get her working properly again
we 're not professionals , but we 've learned by doing it every day
" as @entity0 continues playing , @entity88 and @entity92 take great pride in crossing the main stage ( once graced by visiting stars @entity104 and @entity106 ) and leading the way down to a series of cramped rooms where the organ 's innards vibrate to its mighty sounds
a mechanical wooden bellows wheezes to fill the musical pipes with rushing air
automated percussion instruments boom and clash
old boots springs and air tubes the organ is in immaculate order but , says @entity92 , some of the machinery has been cobbled together from odds and ends
" you can not go to any store to buy the things the organ needs , they 're not made any more , " he says
" instead , we have to produce them ourselves out of old boots , springs and air tubes
" @entity88 points to a series of glass - windowed wooden cabinets that house the organ 's main circuitry
it would 've been simpler to tear them out and replace them with a modern computer processor , he explains , but the team preferred to recreate the original electrics
" it was a challenge for us , " he says
" but in 100 years someone will easily be able to fix this , and they wo n't be able to find the microchips they need to mend the computers
" wanted : young helpers the volunteers still spend hours every week maintaining the organ , but time is limited because the cinema hosts a full program of movie screenings
although the enthusiasm of @entity165 and @entity0 is as strong as ever , their advancing age means they need to find and train a new generation volunteers to keep the organ sounding its best
the @entity4 still pulls in admirers
@entity0 gives regular performances to parties of schoolchildren and groups on the twice - daily guided tours of the @entity34 , as well as special cinema events including screenings of the silent films it was originally installed to accompany
the organ and theater also occasionally attract members of a dwindling group of @entity4 maestros -- including @entity184 and @entity185 and @entity187 's @entity186
" there 's always applause
it 's a great privilege for all of us to play , " says @entity92
" she 's an old lady
you have to be careful with her , but you also have to play her because if you do n't , she will start to fail
