@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 says it has approved the first ambassador to @entity0 from @entity4 , the country which occupied @entity1 for decades
the families of @entity1 prisoners held in @entity4 protest outside the @entity8 offices in @entity0 last year
@entity1 president @entity11 tuesday formally accepted @entity12 as the new @entity4 ambassador to @entity1 , his office said
he did not present his credentials in person , and it is not clear when he will take office , @entity11 's office said
@entity4 and @entity1 established diplomatic ties in october 2008
@entity1 opened its first embassy in @entity21 on march 16 , when @entity22 raised the @entity1 flag over the building in the @entity21 neighborhood of @entity26 , which is also home to the @entity28 embassy , @entity1 's official news agency said
@entity31 was named as @entity1 's ambassador to @entity4 earlier this year but has not filled his post yet , the president 's office said
@entity4 maintained tens of thousands of troops in @entity1 from the 1970s until they were forced out by massive popular protests in 2005
the protests were a response to the killing of former @entity1 prime minister @entity38 in a huge car bombing in february of that year
many @entity1 , as well as the @entity28 , accused @entity4 of orchestrating the assassination of @entity38 , an outspoken opponent of @entity4
the @entity8 opened a tribunal in december 2005 to look into the killing
the @entity28 is also exploring improved relations with @entity4
@entity45 sent a high - level envoy to @entity21 at the beginning of march , four years after it withdrew its ambassador over the killing of @entity38
the envoy , assistant secretary of state @entity50 , said the @entity28 and @entity4 found a lot of " common ground " on which to cooperate in the @entity53 , but warned to " keep expectations in check " as @entity45 and @entity21 re-engage after several years of strained relations
@entity2 's @entity57 contributed to this report .
