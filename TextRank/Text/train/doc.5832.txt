@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 has n't had an easy time of it
a decade ago , the capital of the @entity1 was a broken city , ravaged by years of war and infighting
of late , however , @entity0 has witnessed a resurgence , with many expatriated @entity1 returning to build a new city
" when i came back , people thought i was crazy
" [ they would ask ] , ' why would you go into a country where there is war ? where nothing is working ? why not stay in the @entity19 and make your life ? ' " says @entity18 , who returned to @entity0 in 1996 after studying in @entity19
today , @entity21 runs his own eponymous business , manufacturing plastic bottles for the pharmaceutical industry
" in the @entity19 , everything has been done -- everything
in @entity1 , there is still a way to make things right
if i 'm not going to make it , who 's going to ? " in agreement is @entity34 , who always planned on building his fortune in his homeland
like his elder brothers , he studied abroad in the hope of bringing back knowledge that could improve the family business : groceries
his father 's small store has now turned into a supermarket franchise called @entity45 , with four locations and more on the way
" it 's very exciting to be able to do things in a new environment , and do things you did n't think you 'd be able to do , " says @entity34
" the challenge is great , but it 's very exciting
" many agree that there are obstacles , but returnees often cite the exhilaration of starting with a clean slate
" come to @entity0 , you unlearn what you thought you knew
you take your @entity69 book , your business plan , put it in your pocket and start from scratch , " says @entity62 , who 12 years ago founded @entity63 , a holding company that has interests in communication and construction
@entity63 also produces one of the country 's most popular television shows : beauty queen
though the journey has been long , and there are still large portions of the country 's population living below the poverty line ( 70.5 % in 2011 , according @entity83 ) , @entity62 says @entity0 is starting to reap economic benefits
" when you are working really hard , at some time , you stop believing
but i think we are lucky , because we are seeing it 's progressing
not just us , not just our company , not just our industry , but we are seeing things move forward in every direction , " he says
to prove the point , @entity0 also seems to be experiencing a construction boom
buildings are going up at a ferocious rate
one of the largest -- and most controversial -- projects is @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , a floating - island complex that is expected to include thousands of flats , hotels and shopping centers
" everywhere [ you look ] , you can see new buildings and lots of construction , " says @entity104 , who set up @entity105 , one of the larger pr firms in the city
@entity113 also publishes @entity114 , a glossy @entity116 business quarterly aimed at giving the @entity1 diaspora information about their home country
" it 's not a @entity1 magazine ; it 's a magazine at the same level of other magazines produced in the @entity19 , @entity124 or @entity125 , " says @entity104
" we do n't have to be ashamed that we are in @entity125
you have to be proud to be @entity125 and to show your personality
as @entity1 , we have to be the first people involved in our development , " he says .
