-- a series of cities are in the grip of soaring temperatures this weekend
from @entity5 , to @entity6 , to @entity7 in @entity8 , which set a world - record high a century ago
@entity7 was the hottest spot saturday , reaching 127 degrees , and @entity11 and @entity12 continued in a record - setting heat wave that is forecast to last through tuesday
the heat may have led to the death of a man in his 80s in @entity6 , where the temperature saturday hit 115 degrees , tying a record set in 1994 , the @entity14 said
paramedics found the man dead in his home , which did not have air conditioning , said @entity27 spokesman @entity26
he died of cardiac arrest and the heat may have contributed to his death , although the coroner will make the final determination , he said
the heatwave comes just a couple weeks before the 100th anniversary of what the @entity14 calls the " highest reliably recorded air temperature on @entity36 " -- 134 degrees on july 10 , 1913 , in @entity7 's @entity37
at @entity38 , the heat will stay on full blast through tuesday , at least
at night , the mercury will drop to a relatively cool 96 degrees
" we have more work than we can handle , " said @entity41 of @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity8
" we 're running all over the place trying to do what we can
" the only time the technicians can have some cold air , @entity41 told @entity0 , is when they 're driving
fun aside , the heat wave scorching the @entity52 is dangerous , as 170 concertgoers found out friday evening in @entity6 , according to the fire department
ambulances plucked them out of 110 - degree heat in an open - air music venue and drove them to a shady spot , where they could sit down and drink water
another 30 people were treated for heat ailments in local hospitals
@entity66 hurts your insides too " i 'm not worried as much about the people who have lived here a while , " said sgt. @entity69 , police spokesman in the @entity71 , @entity11 , near the @entity8 state line
" it 's more the tourists coming into the area , even from @entity8 , who are n't used to this kind of heat
" a man driving from northern @entity12 to southern @entity11 stopped at a @entity6 highway exit saturday after his car 's air conditioning unit broke and he drove for several hours without it , @entity26 said
he stopped at the exit to call 911 , and when paramedics arrived , they found the man suffering from heat stroke
civic and emergency officials throughout the @entity52 say that if there was ever a time to worry , this would be it
the reason is n't just the oppressive heat that is plaguing the region : it 's the fact it is expected to hang around , and possibly even get worse , over the next few days
extended heat warnings the @entity14 issued an excessive heat warning for large parts of @entity8 , @entity12 and @entity11 , and a heat advisory for other parts of @entity12
many of the excessive heat warnings extend through tuesday night
starting wednesday , temperatures will drop by a couple of degrees , moving closer to normal temperatures
" it 'll still be hot , but not as intense as we 're seeing now , " said @entity111 , a meteorologist with the @entity14 in @entity6
forecasters say temperatures through the weekend could rival a 2005 heat wave that killed 17 people in the @entity6 area
the culprit is a high pressure dome that 's blocking cooler air coming down from the @entity122 , @entity0 meteorologist @entity123 said
that system wo n't begin to break up until early next week , she said
as a result , @entity5 residents saw a high of 119 degrees on saturday -- setting a new record for the day
temperatures should max out at 113 in the coming days in @entity44 , @entity8
it 's not like sunset will provide much respite , as temperatures may not drop below 90 degrees in many places , even in the middle of the night
some heat wave advice " the no. 1 thing is to absolutely know your limitations and to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water , " @entity111 advises those coping with the high temperatures
he recommends limiting time outdoors
for those who have to do any strenuous activity outside , he advises doing it in the early morning , evening or simply putting it off until the end of the week when the temperatures are lower
such high temperatures can put people at risk for heat exhaustion or heat stroke , which can be fatal
the elderly , infants , children and people with chronic medical conditions are the most prone to heat stress
heat exhaustion is the body 's response to an excessive loss of water and salt , usually through excessive sweating , according to the @entity168
symptoms of heat exhaustion include extreme weakness or fatigue , dizziness , nausea and fast and shallow breathing
heat stroke is even more serious and happens when the body becomes unable to cool down , the @entity168 says
it can cause death or permanent disability if untreated
heat stroke symptoms include hallucinations , chills , confusion and dizziness , along with slurred speech
to protect against heat stress , the @entity168 advises spending time in air - conditioned places , staying informed of heat warning and drinking lots of fluids
@entity0 's @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 contributed to this report .
