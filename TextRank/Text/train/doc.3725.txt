-- football superstar @entity1 has condemned controversial comments made by @entity3 , who is refusing to stand down as @entity6 president despite widespread criticism
the head of world soccer sparked fury when he told @entity11 that racism is not a problem on the football field , and that any issue could be resolved by " shaking hands " after a match
@entity1 , who was a leading figure in @entity20 's failed bid to host the 2018 @entity21 , said that the @entity23 administrator had made a big mistake
" something has to happen because those kind of remarks from a man who is so high up in the game is obviously not right , " the 36 - year - old told @entity0 ahead of sunday 's @entity27 final between his @entity29 team and @entity30
@entity36 : my crazy day with @entity3 " and , it 's obviously something that i do n't personally agree with , and i think everyone else does n't agree with
things ca n't be just sorted out by a handshake , simple as that
" what will happen with @entity3 in the future , i have no idea and obviously i have not control over that
but , all i care about is keeping racism out of soccer and out of sport , because it 's not just in sport , it 's in life in general
it needs to be stopped , and we hope we 're a part of that
" former @entity20 international @entity58 revealed on friday that he now can not host the prestigious @entity60 awards ceremony in january due to his anger at @entity3 's comments
" there is simply no way i feel i could stand on that stage in @entity66 , in front of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity1 , @entity70 and co. , feeling like it was a token gesture
and believe me , that 's how it would feel now , " he told @entity74 newspaper , for which is a columnist
" it would be like he was saying , ' i 'm no racist -- look , i like this black guy so much i 've got my arm around him , he 's doing my show
' it would be very , very uncomfortable in front of 140 countries watching
" @entity3 , in his fourth term as president after standing unopposed in july 's election , has apologized for offending people
but on friday he insisted he would not accept demands that he resign from anti-racism campaigners , @entity20 's players ' association chief @entity95 and @entity94 prime minister @entity93
" i can not resign
why should i ? " @entity3 told the @entity97
when you are faced with a problem you have to face the problem
to leave would be totally unfair and not compatible with my fighting spirit , my character , my energy
" when you have done something which was not totally correct , i can only say i am sorry for all those people affected by my declarations
" when asked by @entity0 's @entity36 if racism exists on the field of play , @entity3 said : " i would deny it
" there is no racism , there is maybe one of the players towards the other , he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one , but also the one who is affected by that , he should say it 's a game , we are in a game
" at the end of the game , we shake hands , this can happen , because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination
" the comments sparked outrage in the football world , and @entity3 released a statement on @entity6 's website soon after trying to clarify his stance
" i think the whole world is aware of the efforts we are making against racism and discrimination , " he said
" and , on the field of play sometimes you say something that is not very correct , but then at the end of the game , the game is over and you have the next game where you can behave better
" however , he was criticized on twitter by many contributors including @entity20 international @entity150 , whose younger brother @entity151 has accused @entity153 captain @entity152 of making racially abusive comments to him during a @entity156 match
" i feel stupid for thinking that football was taking a leading role against racism ...
. it seems it was just on mute for a while , " the @entity161 star wrote on the social networking website
@entity166 , a former @entity20 international , told @entity0 that @entity3 's comments had sent football back 40 years
" his remarks show he is completely out of touch
the longer he stays the weaker @entity6 become , " @entity166 said
" i think he has to step down very , very quickly
he should not wait to be sacked , he should have a little bit of honor and step down
