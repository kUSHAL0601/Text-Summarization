-- attackers firebombed three churches in the southeast @entity4 nation of @entity5 overnight , assaults that come amid widespread @entity8 ire over a court ruling that allowed @entity10 to use the word @entity12 as a term for @entity14
@entity5 news reports said no casualties have been reported , and police have promised to step up security for churches and other places of worship
but the acts stirred unease in the diverse society -- where 60 percent of the people are @entity8 , 19 percent are @entity26 , 9 percent are @entity10 and 6 percent are @entity27
" we regret the irresponsible actions of certain extremist elements for the recent spate of firebombs thrown into church premises
these actions display their immaturity and intolerance toward others within a multi-racial society , " the @entity34 of @entity5 said in a statement
the violence comes as @entity8 protest a recent court ruling that allowed a @entity44 newspaper to use the word " @entity12 " for @entity14
@entity8 believe @entity12 , an @entity47 word , should only be used by @entity8
a stay has been placed on the order on the grounds of national interest
@entity8 took to the streets friday to protest the use of the word by non-muslims , and authorities such as @entity5 prime minister @entity57 called for the matter to be resolved in court amicably and expressed hope the protests do n't deteriorate
" we should not raise the tension level in this country , " he said thursday , as quoted by @entity62 , the @entity62
@entity66 @entity65 , @entity5 's head of state , on friday called for calm and the spirit of unity , according to a @entity62 report
the three churches attacked were in the @entity73 region
they are the @entity75 , the @entity76 and the @entity77
the attacks occurred late thursday night and early friday
" it 's incumbent upon the @entity5 government to investigate the church bombings and to prosecute the perpetrators of this religiously motivated violence , " said @entity79 , chairman of the @entity80 , an independent federal agency that makes recommendations to @entity82 and the president regarding how to handle violations of religious freedom around the world
" there are many parts of the world where @entity10 do use the world ' @entity12 ' in their translations of the @entity98 , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview
" so the @entity5 @entity100 ruling that overturns the government 's ban on the use of the word is not inconsistent with what the practice would be elsewhere around the world
the @entity5 ban is what 's unusual , not the court 's ruling
