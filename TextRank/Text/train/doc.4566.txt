@entity0 says journalists do n't serve the public if they push rumors
( @entity2 ) -- two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the @entity15
one week before comedian @entity18 passed away , text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died
i was in @entity22 , and friends and colleagues from @entity25 , @entity26 , to @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 , @entity30 , were saying they knew for sure that the 50 - year - old comedian was dead
the rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead , which was subsequently published by the @entity37
what makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth , and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition
then there is the " rumor " of an affair by former @entity56 senator and two - time presidential candidate @entity57
the story was broken by the @entity58 after months of digging
ultimately , a source came forward and was ­ likely paid for the information ­ that blew the lid off of the story ; the tabloid 's editor said " you can assume " the @entity58 paid for it
the story exposed @entity57 as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened
there has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet was n't able to verify the story and run with it
the heated discussions even reached the point where @entity76 editor @entity75 told @entity79 ' " newshour with @entity78 " that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself , " when rumor arises , we 're going to need to address it
and , unfortunately , we may need to address it before we can determine whether it 's true or not because it 's having impact , as it was in this case
" sorry , @entity75 , i disagree
the most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we do n't traffic in rumor and innuendo
none of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control
running with such rumors has far - reaching implications
just check out this month 's @entity105 , where @entity106 has a great story on the collapse of @entity109
the investment bank 's demise , some conclude , was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems , even though it was sitting on $ 18 billion
the rumors kept going and going ­ and when the story hit the airwaves , it spread like wildfire
in one week , @entity109 was no more , and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the @entity123 behemoth
we should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story
the rules are simple : either you have the facts or you do n't
if you do , you run with the story
if you do n't , you leave it alone
the @entity58 got the story because its reporters were able to confront @entity57 as he was leaving the @entity134 hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair
then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 @entity142 vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the @entity58 said was the child of the mistress
with other major media outlets turning up the heat , @entity57 admitted the affair in an interview with @entity151 's @entity150
no media executive should be pulling his or her hair out , trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor
if they had , and the facts did n't support the rumor , then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more
we have an obligation to stick with the facts , and nothing else
and no matter what a blogger , web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with , the day we choose to alter our standards , our credibility and integrity will be shot
in the end , as former @entity174 anchor @entity173 said in 1988 , that 's all we 've got
nothing is worth losing that , even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over
