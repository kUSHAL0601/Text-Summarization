-- @entity1 , the former chief executive of @entity2 , was unhappy that the @entity3 reported a 0.3 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate on friday
in fact , he was sufficiently unhappy that he accused the @entity8 administration of using its control over the @entity3 to cook the numbers in a tweet just after the unemployment rate was reported
he even repeated the claim in a @entity15 opinion piece on wednesday
perhaps @entity1 could get away with this sort of temper tantrum nonsense when he was running one of the biggest companies in the world , but he will only get ridicule pushing this line in policy debates
@entity24 does n't have any clue about how the unemployment data are collected , or he is just a liar
first , it is important to understand that the @entity29 -- the division of the @entity3 that reports data on unemployment -- is run by career civil servants
ordinarily , the commissioner is a well - respected academic economist who is appointed by the president
however , since the previous commissioner left this year , @entity36 , a career civil servant , stepped up to fill the role of acting commissioner
this means the bureau does not have a single political appointee
@entity44 : @entity1 says he 's quitting it is also important to understand the way the data for the survey are compiled and published
the survey involves hundreds of people at various stages in the process of collecting and compiling the data
even if @entity36 or some other top official in the bureau wanted to lie about the numbers , they could n't possibly do it alone
suppose they just changed the unemployment rate from a " true " rate of 8.1 % to a bogus 7.8 % rate
they would have the problem that this 7.8 % number was inconsistent with the data on unemployment rates for whites and african - americans
or it would turn out to be inconsistent with the data on unemployment for young people and old people
if the perp just changed the overall unemployment rate , hundreds of experts would quickly find that numbers did not add up
the drop in the unemployment rate would not be consistent with other data in the survey
this would be easily detected
in order to successfully manipulate the data , it would be necessary to change hundreds of numbers that get reported each month
this would require the cooperation of dozens of top people at the @entity29
maybe in @entity1 's world , it is possible to go around with a big wad of money and buy off people at the drop of a hat , but the idea that someone from the @entity8 administration wandered through the top echelons of the @entity29 to buy their cooperation in fixing the unemployment numbers is absurd on its face
perhaps someone could be found who would be willing to be bought , but the rest would be singing their story on the national news
the other problem with @entity1 's charge is that he obviously has no knowledge of the unemployment series itself
in fact , it is common for the numbers to jump around
he found it incredible that the unemployment rate fell by 0.5 percentage points over two months when the economy appears to be growing slowly
how about when it fell by 0.7 percentage points from november 2010 to january 2011 , when growth was also very weak ? was this political manipulation of the data ? on the other side , the unemployment rate jumped by 0.2 percentage points in the summer of 1996 , when the economy was growing at a 7.1 % annual rate
if @entity1 knew the data at all or bothered to talk to someone who knew the data before he made his outlandish charges , he would realize that the unemployment rate is an erratic series
it moves around in unpredictable ways
i am on record as saying that friday 's drop in the unemployment rate was a statistical fluke
so was the 0.1 percentage point rise reported for july
but the economy has been adding 150,000 jobs per month , which is consistent with a declining unemployment rate
to get a full picture of the economy , you have to study the all the data and try to put together pieces of the puzzle
that may not fit @entity1 's political agenda , but that is the world we live in
the economists and statisticians at the @entity29 may not be the most exciting people in the world , but they are honest
and for that , we should be very grateful
when we get data from them , we know that it has not been doctored for political purposes
join us on @entity169 / @entity168 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .
