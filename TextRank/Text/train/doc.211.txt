@entity0 -- @entity4 border officers found a wire between two fences along the @entity4 - @entity8 border that , when stretched taut , could have seriously harmed or even decapitated @entity10 agents , @entity2 was told wednesday
the wire was about 4 feet high when pulled tight , or about neck level for an agent on an @entity15 , officials say
" it was configured in a way so that , if it was pulled , it would take off the head of a @entity10 agent riding in an open car , " homeland security secretary @entity16 said at a @entity18 budget hearing
the wire was discovered saturday when authorities monitoring a surveillance camera saw two people on the north side of the border east of the @entity31 , in the @entity33 sector
@entity10 agents sent to the area found a thick metal wire tied to a secondary fence
the wire stretched across the border road and led into @entity8 through a hole in the primary fence , according to @entity42
when pulled tight , the wire would be about 4 feet high -- about neck level for an agent riding on an all - terrain vehicle , @entity42 said
officials said they suspected that drug or illegal immigrant smugglers were involved
no arrests were made on either side of the border
the wire was removed , and no injuries or damage took place , @entity42 said
