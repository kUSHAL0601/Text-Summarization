the late - night tv talk war grows more competitive in january when @entity1 moves " @entity4 " to an 11:35 p.m. start , pushing the long - running " @entity3 " back an hour
@entity1 cited " increased revenue potential for entertainment programming " as a motive for moving @entity6 from the midnight timeslot he 's occupied since january 2003
the decision is " a strategic shift in its late - night strategy to better position the network for increased ratings and financial performance over the long term , " according to an @entity1 statement released tuesday
@entity6 , 44 , will go head - to - head with the older and more established hosts of @entity22 's " @entity20 with @entity21 " and @entity25 's " @entity23 with @entity24 " starting january 9
" given the passionate fan base ' @entity4 ' has built over the past decade and the show 's ratings and creative momentum this season , the time is right to make this move , " said @entity27 / @entity1 president @entity26
" there is the potential for far greater upside over the long term with this shift , given increased advertiser demand for competitive entertainment programming in the time slot
" although " @entity3 " is moved back to 12:35 a.m. , the show will get a friday night primetime hour at 9 p.m. starting march 1 to " ensure that the program has even more opportunities to continue its incredible , award - winning reporting , " @entity43 said
@entity1 boasted that " @entity4 " was the only late - night broadcast talk show to see growth in overall audience in the past year
@entity52 will host the @entity53 next month .
