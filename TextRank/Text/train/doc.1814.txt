@entity1 's parliament voted tuesday for @entity2 to serve a third term as the country 's chancellor , this time at the head of a grand coalition government
the coalition is made up of @entity2 's conservative bloc , her @entity10 and the allied @entity11 , and the center - left @entity12
@entity2 was re-elected by 462 votes in @entity1 's lower house , or @entity16 , with 150 votes against and nine abstentions , and was sworn in as chancellor soon afterward
her @entity20 is also due to be sworn in tuesday
the parliamentary vote came after members of the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) overwhelmingly approved the coalition deal in a postal ballot
@entity27 president @entity26 wrote to @entity2 to congratulate her on her re-election , saying it " constitutes both an endorsement of your past efforts and a signal of confidence for the coming years
" he added that he was looking forward to " constructive and fruitful cooperation " with the @entity1 government in the future , as the @entity38 continues its efforts to counter the effects of the global financial crisis
@entity2 's election to another four - year term brings to an end nearly three months of uncertainty for @entity1 , the eurozone 's economic powerhouse
@entity2 emerged from september elections with the @entity10 's biggest vote in 20 years
but the @entity10 and @entity11 did not win an outright victory , requiring them to form a coalition government
the pro-business @entity52 , @entity2 's previous coalition partner , failed to pass the 5 % threshold for getting into parliament , putting a grand coalition with the @entity23 , the @entity10 's chief election rival , in the frame
the coalition agreement , hammered out last month , includes a new nationwide minimum wage of 8.50 euros ( $ 11.50 ) an hour beginning january 2015 and other measures favored by the @entity23
@entity2 's third term will give the country consistent leadership at a time when the future of the euro has come under question amid the economic problems of some eurozone members
while @entity1 has emerged from the crisis with its economy relatively intact , nations such as @entity71 have entered deep recessions while unemployment has soared .
