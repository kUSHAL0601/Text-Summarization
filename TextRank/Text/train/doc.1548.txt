-- a @entity2 front - page article monday detailed a new phenomenon in news coverage of the presidential campaign : candidates insisting on " quote approval , " telling reporters what they can and can not use in some stories
and , stunningly , reporters agreeing to it
this , folks , is news
any way you look at it , this is a jaw - dropping turn in journalism , and it raises a lot of questions
among them : can you trust the reporters and news organizations who do this ? is it ever justified on the candidate 's side or on the reporter 's side ? where is this leading us ? as someone who 's been covering presidential campaigns since the 1950s , i have no delusions about political reporting
candidates bargaining access to get the kind of news coverage they want is nothing new
the thicket of attribution and disclosure deals is a deep maze reporters have been picking their way through even before my time
but this latest tactic by candidates revealed by the @entity2 gives me , to say the least , great pause
it should give every citizen pause
essentially , what the @entity2 described was the rapid rise of " quote approval " -- a strategy deployed by campaigns requiring reporters to send quotations they intend to use to candidates ' press officers , to be sliced , diced , edited and drained of color or unwanted consequences , and reporters going along , fearing that if they do n't , they wo n't get access
a look at media coverage of @entity71 's @entity70 pain here 's how it works : let 's say a reporter is granted an interview with a senior strategist of the @entity78 or @entity71 campaign
a condition for the interview would be that before the reporter could send the story to the editor , he or she would have to agree to submit for approval every quote intended to be used to the campaign press staff
let us mark well this faustian bargain
it is for the benefit of the politicians , at the expense of readers , listeners and viewers
it is not in the public interest ; it is designed to further the candidates ' interests
political operatives can not be blamed for wanting this
we , the press , should be held accountable for letting them have it
@entity108 said : " the only security of all is in a free press
" a free and truly independent press -- fiercely independent when necessary -- is the red beating heart of freedom and democracy
one of the most important roles of our journalists is to be watchdogs
submitting to these new tactics puts us more in the category of lapdogs
for many years , it has been typical journalistic practice for high - ranking officials on the campaign or in the @entity125 to demand that interviews be conducted " on background " -- meaning reporters agree to not use direct quotes or identify the person by name
hence , conventions such as " as one campaign official said ... " this , in many cases , is defensible
@entity137 's " @entity136 but the practice described in the @entity2 is something new and different
this is the officials or candidates regularly insisting that reporters essentially become an operative arm of the administration or campaign they are covering
" @entity153 approval " nullifies , or at least seriously dilutes , reporters ' ability and duty to be honest brokers of information
when the quotes are sanitized , then delivered intact with full attribution , the public has no way of knowing what the concealed deal was
please know that there is no joy in calling attention to these things
i respect and empathize with reporters and editors who must compete in today 's environment
and i know full well that when i 've been covering campaigns , which i still do , i 've made my mistakes and have been far from perfect
about all of us doing this line of work , i 'm often reminded of a sign in an old @entity176 cow town saloon that said , " please do n't shoot the piano player , he 's doing the best he can
" but we journalists can do better
@entity180 @entity181 , the excellent managing editor for news at the @entity2 , said in monday 's story , referring to quote approval : " we do n't like the practice
we encourage our reporters to push back
unfortunately , this practice is becoming increasingly common , and maybe we have to push back harder
the @entity2 , @entity188 , @entity189 and a few other newspapers , along with the major networks , are among the few news outlets that have the leverage to push back -- soon and hard
it 's action worthy of us
