-- @entity1 responded sarcastically when her mother brought up media accounts then circulating about the possibility that 2 - year - old @entity1 had drowned in the family pool , according to a recording of a jailhouse conversation shown to jurors on friday
" @entity16 , " @entity10 said of the rumor , which is now the primary defense theory in her capital murder trial in @entity14 , @entity15
in recordings of visits played friday for the jury , @entity10 frequently accused the media of failing to accurately report on the case
prosecutors say @entity10 used chloroform on her daughter and then put duct tape on her nose and mouth to suffocate her
the @entity14 woman 's attorneys say @entity1 drowned in the family pool on june 16 , 2008
they say @entity10 and her father panicked and covered up the death
@entity10 denied the claim during his testimony last week
the videotaped exchange , during which @entity10 became agitated with her parents as they pressed her for details of @entity1 's whereabouts , was one in a series shown to jurors the past two days
" we need to have something to go on , " @entity1 pleaded during the visit
" @entity48 , i 'm sorry
i do n't have anything , " @entity1 angrily replied
' i 've been here a month
do you understand how i feel ? " in the videos shown to jurors on friday , @entity10 repeatedly expresses frustration at being jailed and her inability to offer additional help in the search for her daughter
" i 'm not in control over any of this ' cause i do n't know what 's going on , " she said in one exchange
" my entire life has been taken from me
i do n't have any answers because i do n't know what 's going on
i ca n't even say anything to you guys
i want @entity1 and that 's not even getting put on the air , which it should be
" then @entity1 asks her daughter if searchers should be looking for anything in @entity75 , @entity15
that prompts @entity1 to threaten to hang up the phone
" this is the first time i 've truly been angry the entire time , " she said
" i 'm frustrated beyond belief
" she also complains about her isolation
" you guys still have each other to lean on , " @entity10 told her parents
" i do n't have anybody
" in another video that opened the day 's evidence , @entity10 praised her parents and said she just wanted to be home with them and her daughter
" i know we 're going to see @entity1
i know she 's coming home
i can feel it , " @entity10 said during the tearful visit recorded in 2008
@entity1 was reported missing on july 15 , a month after she was last seen by her family
her skeletal remains were found in december of 2008 not far from the @entity10 home
@entity10 , 25 , is charged with seven counts in @entity1 's death , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading police
if convicted , she could face the death penalty
she has pleaded not guilty and denied harming her daughter or having anything to do with the little girl 's disappearance
in testimony offered friday , an @entity108 sheriff 's detective and a missing persons investigator spoke about collecting evidence from the @entity10 home and an impound lot where @entity10 's @entity114 had been towed , and two crime scene investigators discussed mostly technical aspects of collecting evidence
but crime scene investigator @entity118 also said that when he opened the car 's door to begin documenting the evidence contained inside , " i immediately smelled the odor of decomposition
" @entity10 's father , mother and brother , as well as a tow - yard manager previously testified smelling that type of odor coming from the car
@entity131 later said the odor was , in his opinion , likely the smell of human decomposition , though during questioning from the defense he admitted it could also have been caused by an animal
according to evidence in the case , @entity10 once claimed the car had part of an animal lodged in the undercarriage
@entity131 said he found no animal carcasses on the underside of the car
" i know that smell from a decomposed body because that smell is unique
once you smell it , you will never forget , " @entity118 said
he also testified he found a human hair in the trunk
authorities have previously disclosed that a hair sample collected from the trunk showed evidence of decomposition
on thursday , jurors watched recordings of jailhouse visits during which @entity10 gave visitors information about the nanny she claimed kidnapped the girl
" if you can speak to the media directly , my concern for me is @entity1 , " a tearful @entity10 tells her brother , @entity170 , on july 25 , 2008 , from an @entity108 jail
they also heard a recording of a police interview in which she admitted misleading investigators while still maintaining her daughter had been kidnapped
in the interview , investigators pleaded with @entity10 to tell the truth about what happened to @entity1
" none of us are sitting here believing what you 're saying because everything that 's coming out of your mouth is a lie , " detective @entity181 told @entity10 during the interview
another investigator accused her of not telling the truth
" if the main thing you want to do is find your daughter , and you do n't think lying to us is going to help find her , why would you do that ? " investigator sgt. @entity193 asked on the tape
" because i 'm scared and i -- i know i 'm running out of options , " @entity10 said
" it 's been a month
... i 'm scared of not seeing my daughter ever again
" prosecutors allege @entity10 was not looking for her daughter during the month she was missing
instead , she was staying with her boyfriend , spending time in @entity14 with numerous friends , attending parties , going shopping and hitting nightclubs , including participating in a " hot body " contest , according to evidence in the case
her former boyfriend , friends and acquaintances have all testified that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time and that they noticed nothing different about her demeanor
@entity10 's defense team explains her behavior in the weeks following @entity1 's death by saying she had been sexually abused by her father and had taught to conceal her pain
@entity10 has denied abusing his daughter
