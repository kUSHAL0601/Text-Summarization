@entity0 -- president @entity2 said wednesday his administration will respond to new @entity5 cases " in a much more aggressive way , " taking charge of the issue after a second @entity9 health care worker was diagnosed with the disease
@entity2 scrapped plans to attend @entity14 fund - raisers in @entity15 and @entity16 on wednesday afternoon so that he could huddle with @entity18 members and officials who are leading the administration 's @entity5 response
the meeting came amid questions about how two health care workers could have contracted @entity5 in a country said to have strict protocols in place -- and with one of those @entity5 victims having flown on a commercial jet monday
afterward , the president sought to tamp down fears of of an outbreak of the disease within the @entity35 -- saying that he shook hands with , hugged and kissed nurses who 'd treated an @entity35 doctor who contracted @entity5 in @entity39 , and felt safe
@entity2 acknowledged that even foolproof plans do n't work when local health care providers do n't know how to carry them out -- and said his administration will make sure " certain local hospitals that may not have that experience are walked through that process as carefully as possible
" the @entity46 will have " swat teams " ready to send to hospitals where future cases are discovered , he said
@entity2 has spoken with the heads of @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 to prod them to pump more resources into combating the @entity5 outbreak in @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60
doing so , he said , " is an investment in our own public health
it 's not simply charity
" the heightened attention came as @entity67 pummeled the president
rep. @entity69 of @entity70 said the situation " is beginning to spiral out of control , " and said @entity46 director dr. @entity71 should resign
" @entity74 reports my colleagues and i have received are utterly unacceptable and the information provided to the public has been cryptic and in some cases misleading , " @entity69 said
" this has provided a false sense of security to many of our citizens
" sen. @entity85 of @entity86 and @entity88 chairman @entity87 of @entity70 said the @entity35 should ban people who live in or have visited @entity39 from entering the country
house speaker @entity91 said the @entity35 should consider a travel ban " along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow
" " the administration must be able to assure @entity35 that we will stop the spread here at home , " @entity91 , an @entity98 @entity67 , said in a statement
" we will continue to press the administration for better information about what steps will be taken to protect the @entity35 people , including our troops , from this deadly virus , " he said
" and we will work with the administration on appropriate policy options that will help stop the spread of this horrific disease both here in the @entity35 and around the globe
" state - level officials who 'd insisted they had the situation under control changed their plans , as well
@entity9 gov. @entity120 -- lambasted by @entity14 in his state for leaving on a trade mission to @entity123 this week -- decided to scrap the last three days of his trip and return to his state thursday to lead the state 's @entity5 response in person
@entity120 said wednesday that he speaks daily with dr. @entity129 , who heads an infectious disease task force that @entity120 formed earlier this month , and dr. @entity131 , commissioner of the @entity132
those two are helming the state 's efforts
" this is the first time that our nation has had to deal with a threat such as this
everyone working on this challenge -- from the medical professionals at the bedside to the public health officials addressing containment of the infection -- is working to end the threat posed by this disease , " @entity120 said in a statement
" these individuals are keeping the health and safety of @entity154 and the needs of the patients as their most critical tasks , " he said
" every relevant agency at the local , state and national levels is working to support these individuals
