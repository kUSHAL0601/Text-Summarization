@entity1 's @entity0 is the new women 's world number one after reaching the quarterfinals of the @entity5
the 20 - year - old overtook @entity7 in the @entity9 world rankings following her comfortable 6 - 3 6 - 2 success over @entity12 @entity11 on thursday
the top seed knew that reaching the last eight in @entity15 would ensure she becomes the first @entity16 to top the world rankings when the new list is released on monday
@entity7 missed the tournament because of the foot injury she suffered following her fourth @entity21 victory in july
the victory , @entity0 's 56th of an impressive season , means she becomes the 20th player in @entity9 history to hit the top spot and has been attained after tournament wins in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33
@entity9 chief @entity34 told reporters that @entity0 was a worthy world number one , despite never winning a grand slam title
" there are only two players this year that have reached the fourth round of all four grand slams events -- @entity0 and @entity43 , " @entity34 told reporters
" she has won more matches than any other player on tour this year and right now @entity0 is the most consistent player over this 12 - month period
" @entity0 will face @entity48 in the quarterfinals after the @entity50 continued her recent good form with a surprise 7 - 6 7 - 6 success over seventh seed @entity54
meanwhile , ninth seed @entity56 of @entity58 also booked her place in the last eight with a 6 - 2 6 - 0 crushing of @entity63 's @entity62 .
