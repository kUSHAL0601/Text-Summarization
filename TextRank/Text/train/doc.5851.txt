@entity0 -- the @entity2 on tuesday passed a resolution apologizing to african - americans for slavery and the era of @entity7
the @entity2 on tuesday evening passed a resolution apologizing for slavery and @entity7 laws
the nonbinding resolution , which passed on a voice vote , was introduced by rep. @entity13 , a white lawmaker who represents a majority black district in @entity15
while many states have apologized for slavery , it is the first time a branch of the federal government has done so , an aide to @entity13 said
in passing the resolution , the @entity2 also acknowledged the " injustice , cruelty , brutality and inhumanity of slavery and @entity7
" " @entity7 , " or @entity7 laws , were state and local laws enacted mostly in the @entity30 and border states of the @entity32 between the 1870s and 1965 , when @entity4 were denied the right to vote and other civil liberties and were legally segregated from whites
the name " @entity7 " came from a character played by @entity39 who portrayed a slave while in blackface during the mid- 1800s
the resolution states that " the vestiges of @entity7 continue to this day
" " african - americans continue to suffer from the consequences of slavery and @entity7 -- long after both systems were formally abolished -- through enormous damage and loss , both tangible and intangible , including the loss of human dignity and liberty , the frustration of careers and professional lives , and the long - term loss of income and opportunity , " the resolution states
the @entity2 also committed itself to stopping " the occurrence of human rights violations in the future
" the resolution does not address the controversial issue of reparations
some members of the @entity4 - @entity32 community have called on lawmakers to give cash payments or other financial benefits to descendents of slaves as compensation for the suffering caused by slavery
it is not the first time lawmakers have apologized to an ethnic group for injustices
in april , the @entity80 passed a resolution sponsored by sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , that apologized to @entity84 for " the many instances of violence , maltreatment and neglect
" in 1993 the @entity80 also passed a resolution apologizing for the " illegal overthrow " of the @entity91 in 1893
in 1988 , @entity92 passed and president @entity93 signed an act apologizing to the 120,000 @entity95 - @entity4 who were held in detention camps during @entity97 the 60,000 detainees who were alive at the time each received $ 20,000 from the government
@entity1 's @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report .
