as harried people everywhere will tell you , the pace of modern life seems to be constantly accelerating
it feels like we 're always rushing -- to our next appointment , our next business meeting , our next errand , our next plane
when we have a few precious minutes of downtime , we fill it on our phones , swiping from email to @entity15 to " @entity16 " and back
no wonder there 's a growing chorus of experts urging us to slow down and unplug
or even -- horrors ! -- to sit alone quietly with our thoughts
one of the leading proponents of this movement is essayist and travel writer @entity27 , whose recent @entity25 talk , " @entity26 , " has been viewed almost a million times
" my sense is that so many of us are racing around these days , from text to phone call to @entity34 to breaking - news update , that we never have time to collect ourselves , to direct ourselves towards what we love , " @entity27 told @entity4 in an email
stillness is a cousin of mindfulness , another fashionable concept that encourages people to live in the moment
but where mindfulness focuses mostly on calming stress , stillness , as defined by @entity27 , seeks to bring insight and perspective by stepping back from one 's daily existence
" it can restore our sanity and balance ; it can remind us of what we really want to be doing -- and what we care most about , " said @entity27 , who was inspired in part by a woman he sat next to on a plane who ignored her seatback screen and sat quietly for 12 hours without talking , reading , sleeping or listening to music
he recommends that people take a few minutes every day , or at least every week , to be alone without distractions and let their mind wander
of course , this can be difficult in 2015 , when digital devices are constantly competing for our attention
but @entity27 is not suggesting we give up our phones and laptops
" none of us would want to go backwards or uninvent all the machines that have made our lives so much brighter and healthier and more fun
" instead , he said , " it 's up to us to take conscious measures to make sure we 're not lost in the rush
" @entity27 's ideas may be catching on
tech workers are unplugging with " @entity78 , " companies are adding stress - reduction programs for their employees , and " mindful " practices such as yoga and meditation are flourishing
@entity27 believes his talk ( and related book ) have struck a chord with people who feel overwhelmed by the demands of the digital age
" people are drowning in information and running around so much that they get nothing done , " he said
" it 's only by stepping back , i feel , that you can ensure that you 're making a life as well as a living
