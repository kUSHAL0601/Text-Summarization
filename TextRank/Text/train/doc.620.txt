@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 ' push on health care legislation hit a snag thursday when a group of fiscally conservative @entity3 , known as " @entity8 , " put on the brakes , pressing the @entity3 leadership for significant changes to the draft bill
rep. @entity13 , @entity14 , is a leading negotiator for the @entity15 on health care
as the @entity3 leaders worked feverishly to finalize details of the legislation for a planned friday rollout , the @entity15 sent a letter late thursday night saying the bill " lacks a number of elements essential to preserving what works and fixing what is broken
" forty of the group 's 52 members of the group signed the letter , making it clear that a major block of the @entity32 wanted some concessions in order to get their votes
shortly after the letter 's release , a group of the @entity8 huddled in house speaker @entity42 's office with other leaders for nearly two hours
@entity14 @entity3 congressman @entity13 , a leading negotiator for the @entity8 on health care , told reporters he , rep. @entity46 , @entity47 , and rep. @entity48 , @entity49 , also met with @entity4 chief of staff @entity50 on wednesday to go over their concerns
" the message to him was the same as to the leadership -- that we could not support the current bill , " @entity13 said
@entity48 told @entity1 that no deals were struck thursday night , but that the group agreed to meet with @entity61 chairman @entity60 , @entity63 chairman @entity62 and @entity64 and @entity66 chairman @entity65 , on friday
@entity48 and other members representing rural areas pushed leaders to adjust the rates that rural doctors and hospitals are paid by @entity73 for health care services
" from a practical standpoint in terms of a timeline , a bill does n't come into the @entity4 chamber until you got the votes to pass it , and i do n't think they have the votes to pass it at this point
we 've got to try to get to point where we 're comfortable , " @entity48 said
@entity42 repeated her pledge earlier thursday that a government run health care plan would be included in the @entity4 bill
@entity13 said conservative democrats have major reservations about how a public option would work
in the letter and in the meeting , the conservative democrats stressed they did not want a " @entity73 - like " structure for a public option
" what we are saying is if there is a public option , it ca n't be based on @entity73 rates unless the regional disparity in @entity73 rates is fixed , " said @entity13 , who also planned to press for more controls on government spending on healthcare and more savings from changes to @entity73
@entity4 majority leader @entity113 waved off any suggestions that the development thursday night was a setback
" let me make it very clear that everybody in that room thinks we ought to pass health care , " @entity113 said
but he also acknowledged that they still need to work through the details .
