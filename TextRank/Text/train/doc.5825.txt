-- @entity2 supermodel @entity1 has graced the pages of glossy magazines and starred opposite 007 as a @entity5
face for change : @entity1 is a tireless campaigner against @entity7
but her glamorous appearances on catwalks and in magazines and films belies the personal battles @entity1 has had to overcome
@entity1 is a leading voice against forced circumcision and female genital mutilation ( @entity7 ) and struggled to overcome her own circumcision at the age of five
the forthcoming film , " @entity18 " , based on her biography , tells her story
yet it is through her charitable foundation that @entity1 hopes that the practice still common in traditions in parts of @entity26 , the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 will not create more cases similar to her own
growing up with a nomadic family in @entity2 she was one of 12 children
she fled to the @entity33 , where one of her uncles was working in the @entity2 embassy , to avoid an arranged marriage with an older man
she was just 13 - years - old at the time
after working as a housemaid and in a @entity41 's restaurant she was spotted by chance by fashion photographer @entity43 and became the covergirl for the 1987 @entity46 calendar
becoming the face of beauty products and design houses , her successful modeling career has given her a life far removed from her childhood
yet for @entity1 more importantly it has created a platform to campaign against @entity7
in 2002 she created the @entity55 and has been given a number of honors in recognition of her work .
