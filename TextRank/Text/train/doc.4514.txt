-- your mission , if you choose to accept it , is to seek out covert items at fast food chains around the country
be warned , this mission includes very real dangers such as hardening arteries and skyrocketing cholesterol
we 've compiled a list to get you started
if you 're at @entity13 and in need of just a little caffeine , do n't worry -- there 's a tiny option for you
it 's the @entity19 size , and they do n't advertise it
it 's like a little baby cup of coffee
it also comes in handy when you 're scrounging for change and do n't have enough for a tall ( not that that has ever happened to me )
it 's a good thing we do n't have @entity30 here in @entity32 , because i would be all over candy - based smoothies
because it 's considered a health - food chain , @entity30 does n't officially list these on their in - store menus , but the web site @entity40 assures us that the secret flavors exist
the ones they confirmed with the company 's headquarters include @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity50 flavors of @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54
other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist : chocolate @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , and now and later
this one might be my favorite
at @entity63 , you can order a @entity64 -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon
@entity68 has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available , they will make it for you
things that have been tested include nachos , quesadillas , taco salads and single tacos
some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item , however , so maybe someday soon you wo n't need a super-secret handshake to order one

if you 're at @entity90 and you 're really hungry -- like , three - patties - just - wo n't - cut - it hungry -- go ahead and order the @entity93 , which is four patties stacked on a bun
this option is only available at select @entity90 , and it 's also known as the @entity97
several places , including @entity99 , will serve you the @entity102 milkshake
it 's just what it sounds like -- chocolate , vanilla and strawberry shakes layered in a cup
@entity110 's " secret menu " is n't so secret these days -- in fact , they 've posted it on their web site
but in case you 're not in the habit of surfing fast food web sites , here 's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items : ordering something " @entity124 " at @entity99 means you 're going to get it with lettuce , tomato , a mustard - cooked beef patty , pickles , extra spread ( it 's sort of @entity131 ) and grilled onions
you can even get your fries @entity134
@entity0 : why is it called " @entity137 " dressing ? " @entity141 " is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun
a @entity142 is two slices of @entity145 cheese , lettuce , tomato and spread on a bun ( grilled onions if you so choose )
and you can get just about any combo of meat and cheese that you want if you order it like you 're ordering lumber : 3 × 3 gets you three beef patties and three slices of cheese , 4 × 4 gets you four of each , and so on
according to photos posted at @entity162 , one gluttonous patron requested and received a 100x100 at a @entity164 store a few years ago
one item not listed on the web site secret menu : the @entity168 , which is two slices of cheese sandwiched between two patties , hold the bun
feeling a little health - conscious at @entity174 's ? if you are , you really should have gone somewhere else
but there 's a little hope for you -- ordering " naked chicken " will get you breading - free poultry
the word is that this is on the menu at some @entity174 's , but not all of them , although it is an option at all of them
like @entity68 , @entity183 will make you just about anything within reason as long as they have the ingredients for it
since most of the food at @entity183 is made out of the same basic items , that means you can probably ask for most discontinued items and get them
one " secret , " though , is that they have a not - advertised green chili sauce at most locations , and apparently it 's excellent
some @entity199 will still make you the popular pizza sub from the 1990s
once the chain decided to make their focus healthy eating , the pizza sub disappeared from the menu in most places ( the word is that @entity208 and @entity209 @entity199 still offer them on a regular basis )
but if you ask , lots of places will still make it for you
be warned , though -- @entity215 would not approve of the nine slices of pepperoni and copious amounts of cheese slathered in marinara sauce
