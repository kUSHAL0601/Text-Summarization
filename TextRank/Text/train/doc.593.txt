-- ahh , summer -- a time of sun - drenched picnics where one partakes in three - legged races , whimsical games of croquet and copious pours of wine ( the sweet nectar sucked from the recesses of paper bags so as to avoid the long arm of @entity12 , of course )
and everyone knows that those picnics will fade into foggy , watercolor memories if not obsessively documented
while a lucky few of us have a trusty photog friend who 's always on hand to snap golden - hued pictures of our glorious glory days , others must rely on another , more mechanical companion for our photo - grabbing needs : one 's smartphone
thankfully , there are scads of photo - taking and sharing apps out there that are sure to get more play this summer than that chick over there in the @entity36 crop top
some are , shall we say , more exhibitionist than others ( like the aforementioned chick )
here 's our take on four apps for everyone from rabid shutterbugs to shut - ins
for storytellers are you one of those people who comes into work every monday with winding tales about driving out into the desert and communing with the cacti about fourth - dimensional time shifts as your friends dance in a daisy chain and the sun sets gorgeously in the background ? well , now you can document every leg of your spiritual journey with a new app for @entity62 and @entity63 called @entity64 , which allows you create stories with photo , video and audio
you can then share those multimedia tales via @entity71 , @entity72 and e-mail , so that your work friends can experience your transcendent weekend ( or laugh at your cactus convo ) right along with you
for voyeurs ever wonder what your neighbors are up to at those swingin ' hot tub party @entity79 they 're always throwing ? well , put down the binoculars and download color , a photo / video - sharing app for @entity62 ( and @entity84 , soon ) that allows you to see photos and videos from other users in your vicinity
there 's no " friending " on color -- you 're just shown pictures taken by people you hang out with on a regular basis ( determined via location technology )
we can see the app being a standby at many a festival this summer ( it was already featured at the @entity97 in @entity98 ) -- especially for those concert - goers crammed in the back behind lumbering show ogres
still , every pic on @entity82 is public , so if you plan on snapping some sexy shots of you and your honey behind the bandstand , uh , you might want to use a point - and - shoot
for socialites if every @entity71 notification sends a thrill shooting through your deepest core , @entity108 will likely bring you to crisis
@entity113 is basically a photo - sharing social network , which allows you to follow other users and comment on and " favorite " their snaps -- in which everyone is beautiful and ' 70sesque thanks to a cadre of flattering filters
yeah , that sunset is rad , but would n't it be radder if five people affirmed its beauty by tossing you a " like " ? do n't have an @entity62 ? @entity129 is pretty darn similar to @entity113
for @entity130 not everyone is big into sharing their lives with the whole block -- gossiping on front stoops as night falls , or finding out the latest neighborhood news from @entity137 at the diner
no , some of us would rather divulge our secrets to a particular group of friends -- you know , like your model train enthusiasts society , or your historical reenactment club
@entity148 , an @entity62 photo / video app that only allows you to share snaps with up to 50 friends ( within the app and on @entity71 ) , @entity153 the figure stems from the work of @entity157 psychologist @entity156 , who says that humans can only handle maintaining relationships with up to 150 people
because , let 's face it , you probably do n't have more than 50 pals who would be down to check out snaps from that recreation of the @entity165 you 're planning on staging down at @entity166 this summer .
