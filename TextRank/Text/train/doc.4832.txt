-- a @entity2 warship and helicopters are trailing a boat believed to be the one that was hijacked by @entity8 pirates over the weekend , a senior military source with knowledge of the operation told @entity0
four @entity12 were manning the boat
pirates boarded the @entity12 yacht off the coast of @entity17 last friday , three days after the boat 's owners split off from the relative safety of a sailing group traversing a dangerous section of the @entity23 , according to the group , the @entity24
@entity25 and @entity26 and two others , @entity28 and @entity29 , were aboard the yacht , the @entity31
@entity12 officials have made no further comment on the situation since rear adm. @entity35 , deputy commander of the @entity2 's @entity36 , said saturday that the government is evaluating its options
the @entity39 are experienced boaters , having started a world tour in 2004 , and were very much conscious of the threat from pirates , said a friend of the @entity39 , fellow boater @entity44
@entity26 said several weeks ago that he was concerned about pirate activity in the area , which he had never visited before , @entity44 said
but he said @entity26 was determined to traverse the world himself as opposed to shipping the boat -- as some other yacht owners have done .
