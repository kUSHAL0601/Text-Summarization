global media tycoon @entity0 spent hours wednesday downplaying his political influence , even as @entity3 prime minister @entity2 said politicians in his country had been too close to @entity0 over the years
@entity0 insisted that his newspapers did not lobby for his commercial interests and he had " never asked a prime minister for anything
" @entity0 was being grilled about his relationship with politicians at an independent @entity3 inquiry prompted by illegal eavesdropping by his @entity14 newspaper
@entity0 told the @entity15 he does not believe in journalists using phone hacking or private detectives , calling it " a lazy way of reporters doing their job
" the media baron , who owns the @entity24 and the @entity25 in @entity26 , as well as controlling the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , also denied using the power of his press for personal gain
at the same time , @entity2 was saying politicians from across the political spectrum had been too close to the powerful media baron
" i think we all , on both sides of this house , did a bit too much cozying up to mr. @entity0 , " he told the @entity36 as his government was battered over testimony @entity0 's son had given the day before
@entity44 testified tuesday that before @entity2 became prime minister , he had met the politician over drinks at a pub and told him the company 's @entity24 newspaper would support his conservative party in the next election
meanwhile , @entity0 was having a bitter falling out with then - prime minister @entity53 , the elder @entity0 said wednesday
he told @entity53 his papers would not support @entity53 's @entity55 in the 2010 election , prompting @entity53 to respond : " your company has ... declared war on my government and we have no alternative but to declare war on your company , " @entity0 quoted @entity53 as saying
" and i said , ' i 'm sorry about that @entity53 , thank you for calling
' end of subject , " @entity0 said
he earlier insisted strongly that there had been no quid pro quo with @entity69 as @entity0 's papers switched support from the conservative party to @entity69 's @entity55 in 1997 -- not long before @entity69 swept into power as prime minister
" i , in 10 years in his power there , never asked @entity69 for any favors and never received any , " @entity0 said , pounding his hand on the table for emphasis
on tuesday , @entity15 lawyer @entity82 pressed @entity44 over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full ownership of satellite broadcaster @entity88
that bid that collapsed because of the phone - hacking scandal
evidence published tuesday suggests that @entity93 was getting inside information from the office of the government minister with the power to approve or block the acquisition , culture secretary @entity96
@entity99 , an aide to @entity96 , resigned wednesday , saying his contacts with @entity0 representatives had gone beyond what the culture secretary had authorized
but @entity96 told the @entity36 he would not quit
e-mails released by @entity15 " have been alleged to indicate there was a back channel through which @entity93 were able to influence my decisions
this is categorically not the case , " @entity96 said
@entity44 insisted before the @entity15 tuesday that he knew little about the scale of phone hacking by people working for the @entity14 , as he continued his fight to limit the damage the scandal does to him and his family 's media empire
the scandal has led to dozens of arrests on suspicion of criminal activity and forced @entity93 to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking
@entity44 and @entity0 have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them
underlings did not tell @entity44 how pervasive the practice was when he took over @entity93 's @entity3 newspaper publishing arm , he testified tuesday
he agreed with a suggestion that the reason was because they knew he would put a stop to it
" i think that must be it , that i would say , ' cut out the cancer , ' and there was some desire to not do that , " he told the @entity15
former @entity0 employees testified earlier that they told him about the problem
the younger @entity0 has already been called twice to testify before @entity3 lawmakers and resigned from a number of top management positions at @entity3 subsidiaries of his father 's media empire
he and his father have always denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking , which police say could have affected thousands of people , ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans
dozens of people have been arrested in criminal investigations into phone and e-mail hacking and police bribery , and police asked prosecutors last week to charge at least eight people
the suspects include at least one journalist and a police officer , the @entity167 said , declining to name them
no charges have been filed , and the @entity167 said it did not know when a decision would be made about charges
in addition to the @entity15 and @entity26 's @entity176 , two parliamentary committees also are looking into media conduct
@entity93 shut down @entity14 , its @entity3 sunday tabloid , last summer after public outrage at the scale of illegal eavesdropping its journalists did in search of stories .
