@entity0 -- a man accused of killing his teenage daughter in @entity4 because of her " westernized " lifestyle denied the murder in court wednesday
@entity9 said it was " devastating " to be on trial for murdering his daughter @entity11 , @entity1 affiliate @entity8 reported
he was taking the stand for the first time in a case which has gripped @entity15 since the 17 - year - old disappeared in september 2003
the court case took a startling turn monday when @entity9 's wife @entity19 abruptly changed her long - standing story and said she had seen her husband attack their daughter on the night @entity11 died
both parents are accused of the murder
one of @entity11 's sisters testified that she saw her parents push @entity11 onto a couch , stuff a bag into her mouth , and hold her down until she suffocated
@entity9 and @entity33 have both pleaded not guilty at their trial in @entity35 , @entity4
newspapers , television and radio have all been reporting on the prosecution case that @entity11 's parents killed her because they felt her " western " lifestyle brought shame on the family
the teenager 's dismembered body was found on a riverbank months after she disappeared
she had been stripped of anything that would identify her , prosecutor @entity47 told the jury in may , according to @entity8
@entity11 's sister @entity50 testified last month that she saw her parents kill the girl
@entity52 does n't justify ' honor murders , ' experts insist she said her parents were angry that @entity11 was wearing a short - sleeved , v - neck top , and no sweater , on the night she was killed
" just end it here , " @entity19 said to @entity9 , according to their daughter
they pushed @entity11 down onto a sofa and suffocated her despite her struggles , @entity50 testified
prosecutor @entity47 called it " an act of suffocation by both parents acting together
" @entity66 did not tell police she had seen the killing until 2010 , after she was detained by police in connection with a robbery of the family 's home , @entity8 reported
she has pleaded guilty to robbery
prosecutors said she had not been offered any sort of deal in exchange for testifying against her parents
she has testified that both her parents physically abused @entity11 " every day " over the course of five years , and that her mother did it more " because she was at home more
" on monday , @entity19 unexpectedly said she had seen her husband attack @entity11
she said that she tried to intervene to protect the girl , but that her husband pushed her away and punched her , @entity8 reported
@entity88 police : man chops off daughter 's head , citing her ' indecent behavior ' " extremely scared , " she fled the room and stayed in a bedroom with other children until she heard a car leaving 20 minutes later
when her husband returned alone , she asked where their daughter was
" if you care for your dear life and that of your children , do n't ever ask me this question again , " he told her , @entity8 reported
@entity33 testified monday that only one of their children , @entity109 , was present when she saw her husband attacking @entity11
the jury was told that @entity11 had been taken to @entity111 for a hastily arranged marriage before her death , and drank bleach when her parents suggested she was staying there when the rest of the family returned to @entity4 , @entity8 reported
she was hospitalized for three months after the family came home because of the bleach incident , @entity50 testified
@entity50 testified in may that her parents were very strict with their daughters , @entity8 reported
@entity122 convicted in @entity124 ' honor murders ' " our family was very restricted
the @entity111 culture is more restrictive in terms of what you can wear or do , " she said
the trial began in may and is expected to last several more weeks , prosecutors say
reliable figures of the number of honor murders around the world are hard to come by , but the @entity138 has estimated there could be 5,000 per year
so - called honor murders are a significant enough problem in @entity15 that the country 's @entity142 has an expert specializing in cases in which members of a family kill relatives because of behavior that they say shames the family
the @entity142 began keeping statistics on honor violence in april 2010 and prosecuted 234 cases in the following year , just over half of which were successful
there is a perception that the crime is particularly common among @entity160 , but one vocal @entity15 campaigner says not all honor violence is perpetrated by @entity160
disappearance , then discovery , leads to ' honor killing ' outrage @entity167 , who was the victim of a forced marriage , is not @entity160 ; she is @entity169
" significant cases are happening within @entity172 communities , be it @entity111 , @entity88 , @entity169 , @entity160 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity177 communities , " she said
the killings take place in many parts of the world , experts say
@entity88 father accused of killing baby ' for being a girl ' " it 's definitely a problem that happens in many different places : the @entity177 , @entity111 , @entity193 and among immigrant communities in @entity195 , " said @entity186 , a researcher on women 's rights in the @entity189 world for @entity190
several @entity189 countries and territories , including @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and the @entity203 territories , have laws providing lesser sentences for honor murders than for other murders , @entity190 says
@entity209 and @entity210 also have laws that have been interpreted to allow reduced sentences for honor crimes , the group says
@entity1 's @entity214 contributed to this report .
