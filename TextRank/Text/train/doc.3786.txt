in an odd way , i sense calm as cars and buses whiz by at rush hour
it is a sign of normalcy
the snow has stopped falling and more people are out and about on this afternoon
@entity9 almost looks like it did before that august day when @entity10 was shot and killed
except the reminders that are hard to miss. the burned and looted @entity13 gas station
and on @entity15 , a block away , a memorial to @entity10
businesss owners covered up windows and doors with plywood after protesters clashed with police on @entity9
some had taken the plywood down but have put the boards back up , ahead of a grand jury decision on whether to indict police officer @entity26
it is as if they are readying for a storm
they scribbled the word " @entity32 " on the plywood
and neighborhood kids wasted no time making their mark with spray - painted graffiti
but on thursday , artist @entity37 was out covering up some of the scars , creating beauty amid the ugliness
i watch as he picks up a roller and applies a layer of glue on the plywood covering up a window to @entity47
he positions one of his photographs and sticks it on
" the plywood is so ugly , " he says
@entity37 was among those who took to the streets to demand accountability for @entity10 's death
what happened in @entity56 , he says , should never again happen anywhere in @entity58
it is personal for him
he is a 29 - year - old black man who was born and raised in impoverished @entity61
racial inequities have always been big in his artistic expressions
he took photos of the hands of the people around him at the @entity56 protests
old ones and young ones
and he made them into posters to display in public
" we have a lot of people from a lot of backgrounds coming together , " he says
" people look at the hands and kind of get it instantly
" hands have become a big symbol for @entity56 protesters who allege that @entity26 shot @entity10 even though he was unarmed and , they say , had his hands up in the air
some @entity26 supporters , however , say @entity10 was a thief and a thug who scuffled with the officer and provoked him into shooting
@entity37 ' art caught my eye instantly as i drove down @entity9 , past fast food shops , beauty stores , laundromats and convenience stores , all made ugly by the plywood
@entity102 and @entity103 help @entity37 put up his work
@entity37 is only 14 and in the eighth grade
but he says he wants to be out here , helping the cause
a local store donated a cooler full of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and milk
it is the only food the crew had eaten since morning
@entity37 is grateful that local businesses are supportive , especially since they paid a heavy price in lost revenues after the protests erupted
as a young artist , @entity37 hoped to retain a fascination and wonder for the process of storytelling
that 's what his web page statement says
but never did he expect to find himself walking @entity9 , plastering his art over boarded - up shops
now his hands stand as memorial
and , he says , as hope amid despair
he has many more sheets of plywood to cover as i leave him for the justice center in @entity136 where the grand jury decision is expected to be announced at any moment
in the rear view mirror , @entity9 fades , just for a minute , and i see only the prints of hands on paper .
