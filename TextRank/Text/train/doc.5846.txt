-- @entity2 troops and rebels clashed on wednesday in the violence - ridden eastern part of @entity6 , threatening to undermine an already fragile stability
hundreds of people in @entity9 fled toward the city of @entity11 by road trying to escape the fighting
the sound of heavy artillery echoed through the hills
the @entity6 army continued a second day offensive to recover the cities of @entity20 and @entity21 , and to takeover these positions held by the insurgency
" the situation is deteriorating because of the fighting between various groups , " said @entity25 , the @entity26 's provincial director for @entity27
as of january 2009 , an estimated 1.5 million people in @entity33 provinces have been internally displaced , and the number continues to rise , according to the @entity35
" people are losing their homes , their livelihoods and their hope , " @entity25 said
the massive displacement has also led to an increase in gender - based violence
according to @entity25 , reported cases have gone up by 75 % nationwide since april , and many go unreported in a nation that is already known as the rape capital of the world
in addition , this past week the @entity48 reported a sharp increase in the number of cholera cases in @entity9
" there is potential for this to turn into an epidemic if the situation continues to deteriorate , " said @entity25
the eastern part of @entity6 has been embroiled in violence since 1994 , when @entity61 forces crossed the border fearing reprisals following the genocide in neighboring @entity65
in 1998 the vast nation -- previously known as @entity6 -- became a battleground for eight @entity69 countries
more than 5 million people died in the war and its aftermath , making it the deadliest conflict since @entity75 despite the signing of peace accords in 2003 , fighting continues in the eastern part of @entity6 between various rebel groups and the @entity6 army , which is back by @entity35 peacekeepers
there are many different forces on the ground , all of whom are armed
" the fighting is like a view through a kaleidoscope , " said @entity88 , an @entity69 expert with the @entity89
amid growing concerns of an escalating conflict , the @entity93 government announced last week that it will cut military aid to @entity65
the @entity93 has accused @entity65 of supporting rebels in @entity6
" the @entity93 government is deeply concerned about the evidence that @entity65 is implicated in the provision of support to @entity6 rebel groups , including @entity105 , " said @entity98 , a @entity99 spokeswoman
the @entity105 -- named after a failed peace agreement signed on march 23 three years ago -- is a rebel group that split from the @entity6 army earlier this year
it has been accused of killing hundreds of people
one of the @entity105 commanders , @entity110 , is wanted by the @entity111 for alleged war crimes
in a report to the @entity115 in june , a @entity35 expert panel on @entity6 found " substantial evidence " attesting to support from @entity65 officials to armed groups operating in the eastern region
it documents a " systematic pattern of military and political support provided to the @entity123 by @entity65 authorities " in the form of recruits , weapons and military equipment
@entity65 has denied allegations that the @entity105 are backed by their country 's @entity131 leadership
" as we have made clear from the outset , @entity65 is neither the cause nor the enabler of instability in the eastern ( @entity6 ) , " said @entity133 , @entity65 's foreign minister
journalist @entity139 contributed to this report .
