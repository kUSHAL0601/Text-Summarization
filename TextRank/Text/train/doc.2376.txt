@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 officials have gone on high alert and have started evacuations as they warily monitor @entity6 , a volatile volcano in @entity7 that might erupt at any time
" the local government is coordinating to evacuate around 40,000 villagers to the pre-assigned shelters , " @entity9 of the national disaster coordination board said monday
seismic activity has intensified , signaling that an eruption is imminent , according to @entity1 volcanologists
the 3,000 - meter @entity6 is famously unpredictable , though
a pyroclastic flow -- a fast - moving burst of blistering gases and rock fragments -- is a key concern
one killed two people in 2006 and another killed more than 60 villagers in 1994
about 1,300 people died when @entity6 erupted in 1930 .
