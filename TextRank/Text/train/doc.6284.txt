all eyes were glued to the big guy in the gym
red - faced and sweaty , he must have been benching more than 300 pounds
but the weights were slipping
just as it looked as if he was going to get crushed by the immense burden dangling over his head , he tossed the weights up like it was no problem at all and popped up from the bench
he may have looked down for a minute , but he would not be defeated
but the thing i noticed most as he strutted around gasping for air was his @entity20 t - shirt
" that 's right , " i thought as i rode the elliptical machine at my local gym a few days ago
" that 's how we do
" it was the first time since 2011 , when the horrific @entity28 child abuse scandal was revealed , that i felt any pride or connection to my alma mater
in 2012 , @entity28 , the former assistant football coach , was sentenced to 30 - 60 years in prison for the sexual abuse of 10 boys after tearful testimony from his victims
since then , i 've wanted no association with the school or the culture that valued winning football games above protecting children from rape
and when my son was accepted to @entity20 that year , we tossed the acceptance letter in the trash
my own @entity20 sweatshirt was stuffed deep in the back of the closet
i am a @entity49 and i was ashamed
sadly , my new - found pride was short - lived
in an attempt to restore the university 's reputation , @entity52 state officials led by senate majority leader @entity56 and state treasurer @entity57 , filed a suit against the @entity59
they wanted all sanctions the @entity59 placed against the school be lifted
the @entity59 had reached beyond its authority in punishing @entity20 , they argued
in other words , their lawsuit had nothing to do with the boys who were raped or abused by @entity28
it had nothing to do with the fact that head football coach @entity72 , who died in 2012 , and others at the school had been alerted to this abuse as early as 1998 and did very little to make sure it stopped
nope , @entity56 and others wanted redemption for @entity20 , based on a loophole over the authority of the @entity59 to punish the football program
the @entity59 caved , ruling last week to restore @entity20 's 112 wins wiped out during the @entity28 scandal , including the 111 wins erased from the record of head football coach @entity72 -- all the victories after the first time police were called by a mother reporting that @entity28 had showered with her 10 - year - old son on the @entity20 campus back in 1998
and the $ 60 million dollar fine the @entity59 levied against the school ? well , now instead of the @entity59 collecting the fine and spending the dollars nationally , the ruling allows the university to keep the money but commit to spending the $ 60 million in @entity52 to fund in - state child abuse programs only
other sanctions lifted by the @entity59 ruling , include ending a five - year probation period and scholarship and transfer rules
we teach our kids when they do wrong to face up to it , take their punishment without complaint or excuses and move on
then , go out into the world and show everyone you are better than your lowest moments
it takes courage , integrity and leadership
that is what @entity20 needed to do
and so , for me , this is not a proud day for @entity20
we 've cheated the system , bullied our way back into the record books
and we 've told the world once again that in @entity124 winning is more important than anything
all those boys who were raped ? well , that 's not our problem
what 's important is making sure coach @entity72 's 409 - 136 - 3 is restored
" the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth , " said mister @entity130 , a @entity20 alum , and track coach for more than 11 years
" the @entity59 sanctions athletes for the smallest things -- you take a parent to lunch , it 's a violation
you help a student - athlete pay for airfare for their parent to see a game , it 's a violation
students lose eligibility , sports programs are punished
and now , the @entity59 is lifting sanctions after boys were molested and raped on his watch and he did little or nothing to stop it
this sends a terrible message , " said @entity130 , who was the first person in his family to graduate from college
this weekend , social media is abuzz with @entity20 fans applauding the @entity59 decision , feeling vindicated
for many others , me included , this ruling and the reaction from the @entity166 wipes away any bonhomie the university was gaining over the past three years
" it is hard to believe that the @entity59 and the school could take the most nauseating , the most horrifying , the most indefensible institutionalization of corruption in @entity176 sports -- the @entity177 -- and make it worse , but today they just did , " said @entity180 's @entity179 said on his show friday
it seemed that the university was trying to clean up its act
@entity72 and university president @entity186 had been fired
both of those things needed to happen
the board of trustees had ushered in changes
the @entity28 trial ended after months of testimony almost too unbearable to watch as abuse victim after abuse victim told their painful stories about being raped and molested by @entity28
a new coach was brought in and the team started winning
that 's how healing happens ; how forgiveness happens
one day at a time , trying to do better , be better than you were yesterday
there is no short cut on the road to redemption
even coach @entity72 knew that : " success without honor is an unseasoned dish ; it will satisfy your hunger , but it wo n't taste good
" -- @entity72 @entity72 may be back atop the record books as the " winningest coach ever , " but he was not an honorable man -- not when it came to putting the lives and safety of children above football
and no @entity59 ruling can change that history .
