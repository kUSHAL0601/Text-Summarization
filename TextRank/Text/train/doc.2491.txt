-- president @entity1 used the @entity3 address to outline an agenda for the coming year and , more importantly , to define what his goals would be should he be re-elected in november
as @entity8 presidential candidates engage in a bitter civil war for the nomination to oppose him , @entity1 has stepped up at this moment to offer a blueprint to strengthen the middle class , diminish inequality and revitalize the economy
@entity1 has attempted to turn his source of weakness , the laggard condition of the economy , into his strength by going on the offensive about how to make things better
whereas @entity24 and other republicans have defined @entity1 's policies as a form of @entity29 socialism , @entity1 has argued that protecting the middle class is the only way to reclaim @entity33 values
the final @entity3 for a first - term president is always a mix of policy and politics
tuesday night , the president brought together a number of themes that have been shaping his speeches since september
the speech blended some of president @entity45 's harsh realism with president @entity47 's endless optimism
@entity1 warned of the growing economic divide between the wealthy and the rest of the nation
he spoke about the challenges that middle - class @entity33 , the backbone of our economy , face every day
whereas he started his presidency focused on the stability of financial institutions , now he has turned his attention to the stability of @entity33 families
he is no longer just talking about economic recovery
the remainder of his time in office , we know now , will be about economic revitalization
" think about the @entity33 within our reach , " the president proclaimed , " a country that leads the world in educating its people
an @entity33 that attracts a new generation of high - tech manufacturing and high - paying jobs
a future where we 're in control of our own energy , and our security and prosperity are n't so tied to unstable parts of the world
an economy built to last , where hard work pays off , and responsibility is rewarded
" rather than running away from @entity87 , president @entity1 embraced the historical value of government
he said : " during the @entity90 , @entity33 built the @entity91 and the @entity92
after @entity93 , we connected our states with a system of highways
@entity98 and @entity8 administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody , from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today
" the speech is certainly a good start to his re-election effort
it comes at a time when @entity111 's attacks on @entity24 have ironically fueled a critical discussion that emerged from @entity113 about the damaging consequences certain kinds of economic behavior can have and about the inequity of the tax system enabling some @entity33 to enjoy growing riches when so many others are struggling to get by
tuesday night @entity1 put himself squarely on the side of the middle class and economic fairness
but the speech is not a game changer
the truth is that the @entity3 address is not what it used to be
the reality is that fewer americans are tuned in given the endless menu of cable stations and websites that offer voters something else to see
moreover , economic conditions are still poor
even with some signs of progress , unemployment remains extremely high and household security is fragile
if voters are going to make their decision based on the health of the economy , many might very well decide to move toward the @entity8
given how difficult it has been for @entity147 to handle the most routine decision , voters will be skeptical about president @entity1 's ability to handle the kinds of issues he discussed in his speech
how can a president and @entity147 transform the infrastructure of the economy if they ca n't even pass regular appropriations bills without a high - stakes showdown ? a speech about economy and promises of policy are not the same as improved economic conditions
finally , in our short - attention - span political culture , speeches this far away from the election only have limited effect
what matters will be what the president is saying , what events are taking place , and how the @entity8 are doing in september and october
notwithstanding these limits , the speech is a good start in terms of outlining the issues that president @entity1 needs to emphasize if he is to excite @entity98 and attract independents
rather than entering in a defensive posture , focusing just on crisis and conflict , president @entity1 has instead chosen to define the terms of the debate and to offer a positive vision for the future
he has argued that the values of his administration are as @entity33 as apple pie
when the @entity8 are done squabbling among themselves and select a nominee , they will face the burden of offering a vision of their own rather than simply being the @entity196 alternative
then we will find out whether the @entity1 presidency , like the economy he discussed tuesday night , is built to last
