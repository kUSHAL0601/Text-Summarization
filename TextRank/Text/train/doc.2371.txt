for the next three weeks at least , flying to and within @entity0 is going to be a stressful affair , for even the hardiest of travelers
hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed monday and @entity0 's civil aviation regulator warned that more flights in 12 airports will be affected over the coming three weeks
the worst affected airports so far have been @entity9 's two airports -- @entity10 and @entity11 -- two of the country 's busiest airline hubs
another 120 flights were delayed for more than two hours
domestic travelers have been switching to high - speed trains ( @entity0 only ) after hearing of the widespread delays , leading to severe overcrowding on main rail routes some have likened to the @entity22 migration
officials and airlines have shed little light on the reasons for the disruptions but local media have suggested the cause is due to military exercises
speculation is rife on social media
" perhaps i 'm ill - informed but i 've never heard of any other countries ' military exercises affecting civil airlines on such a large scale , " posted user @ luoyu on @entity35 , @entity0 's version of @entity36
" i 've also never seen such vast adjustments affecting a quarter of civil airlines ' flights in @entity0 's history
whatever is causing the wide - scale delays , it 's making history
" what 's going on ? local officials cited " air traffic restrictions " while @entity9 - based @entity50 said " the airspace was occupied , " according to the @entity53 newspaper
" among situations for air traffic restrictions being imposed are when military maneuvers are taking place , " the newspaper added
@entity60 , the state television channel , shared on its @entity35 account -- @entity0 's equivalent of @entity36 -- a widely circulated memo , originally published on a @entity0 flight crew blog , that said the civil aviation authority has requested airlines to reduce flights by 25 % in eastern @entity0
hundreds of flights to and from eastern @entity0 were canceled or delayed monday , with 200 flights canceled at @entity10 and @entity11
flights departing from other eastern @entity0 cities ' airports , including @entity74 and @entity75 , were also affected
more : and the world 's best airline 2014 is ... where to expect delays " the following 12 airports will experience massive delays for 26 days ! fliers , bring snacks and water ! " the @entity60 post said
" from july 20 to august 15 , operations of these airports -- including @entity11 , @entity88 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 -- will be affected by high - frequency exercises conducted by another party
all airlines are requested to reduce flights by 25 % and fliers are expected to face delays
" officials at the @entity104 declined to comment when approached by @entity105
past delays this is the second large - scale air traffic disruption in @entity0 in the last two weeks
more than 100 flights were canceled or delayed on july 14 in @entity9
in december 2006 , @entity88 closed and hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed due to military exercises
two internet users have been held by police for allegedly fabricating and circulating " anti-corruption - related " claims , according to @entity116 newspaper @entity115
the internet users claimed the disruption was due to the arrest of a high - ranking government official trying to flee the country
another 37 people were reprimanded in the crackdown against @entity125 " rumor mongers , " according to @entity115
@entity0 's air traffic woes continue lengthy flight delays are common in @entity0
the country 's largest airports , serving the mega-cities of @entity9 and @entity131 , suffer some of the worst flight delays in the world
in june 2013 , @entity131 's @entity134 hit the bottom of a list of the world 's most delayed airports , according to @entity141 - based air travel information service @entity139
just 18.3 % of flights from the airport left on time during that month and around 42 % of flights suffered delays of 45 minutes or longer
second worst on the list was @entity9 's @entity11 , where just 24 % of flights departed on time
overly cautious air traffic control and airspace restrictions for civilian aircraft are two of the reasons for these delays , but flights are also affected by thick smog and once , an unidentified flying object ( @entity159 )
more : delayed ! why flying in @entity0 is hard
