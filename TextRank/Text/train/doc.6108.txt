-- when was the last time you adjusted your business strategy based on @entity5 's changing consumer behavior ? with economic growth , comes consumer maturity
@entity5 's emerging consumers are becoming more independent , confident and connected
like all of us , @entity5 's consumers are changing not only demographically and geographically , they are adjusting to choice
much of that choice is emerging in the world of e-commerce
there are nearly 600 million netizens in @entity5 and they are beginning to aggressively shop online
the challenge for online commerce outlets is to define just who their customers are and how they make their purchase decisions
in other words , what influences them to spend money online ? what we do know is that men shop differently than women , even when it comes to online purchases
for example , we know that men tend to be more , let 's call it , goal oriented when they shop online
but they also tend to buy things specifically for themselves
that said , both sexes are looking for two key things : lower prices and greater convenience
@entity46 's 2012 annual report on online shopping behaviors of @entity5 consumers showed that for a couple of key categories covered in the survey , men were more active than women in online shopping
eighty percent of male respondents , ( vs. 59 % of female respondents ) went online for consumer electronics purchases , while 71 % of male respondents , ( vs. 66 % of female respondents ) went online to purchase services
with more people shopping on the @entity63 , we are also seeing online shoppers increasingly becoming impatient as they shop
if they ca n't easily find what they want , they quickly move on
they want to shop on their terms and their timelines
so , how do we ensure online shopping is embedded in the broader internet experience for @entity5 's online consumers ? according to the survey , 66 % of connected consumers were both microblog and social networking site users
the implication for brands would be to use their microblog presence as information delivery centers to combine and bring together all other digital platforms such as a company website , campaign mini-site , social networking brand page and viral video content
with the high penetration of smart phones , e-commerce evolves a step further to m - commerce
we can see that consumers are n't even waiting to get back home to switch on their computers and start spending
consumers want to browse and shop whenever they want -- on the subway , while waiting for friends , or even during meal times
engaging with mobile users is critical in this and most other markets
unlike @entity108 's dominant position in the @entity109 , there are many big scale e-commerce players competing fiercely in @entity5 , so it might take more time for a standout leader to emerge
for now , existing e-commerce players face expensive challenges surrounding logistics and pricing
some are also grappling with aligning online and offline shopping experiences
flexible shopping and delivery / pick - up options are proving popular , particularly when combined with smart promotions across online and offline platforms
satisfied customers with successful online purchases are likely to drive more sales as consumers share positive experiences via social media
a @entity46 survey found 85 % of @entity5 consumers regularly used social media to share their experiences with online purchases
as retailers look to align and grow their offline and online businesses , the challenge is how to develop successful marketing strategies for the sophisticated @entity5 consumer : 1
earn trust -- create a trusted environment with your customers and make them feel valued
every brand should take some time to understand the specific online networks with which their customers engage and to become a part of it
leveraging trusted experts or appropriate celebrities in @entity5 has also been successful in building trust
the bottom line is that emotion is the key
in a world where the consumer sees hundreds of advertisements in the span of just one day , triggering an emotional response is proven to give your product or brand the attention and recognition it needs to stand out
from there , you build brand dependency ; success here will take care of itself as consumers will recommend the product to others
get connected - @entity5 online shoppers are primarily young and educated consumers who are seeking value and convenience
offering unique product assortments online and giving the consumer multiple convenient options for payment and delivery are also likely to resonate with these shoppers
communications - again , social media is a powerful communication platform that is looked at multiple times a day
e-commerce and online shopping flip the traditional store - to - consumer , one - way conversation
consumers are now searching out retailer websites for specific products and learning about goods via social media
retailers need to engage in this social conversation and interact with @entity5 's tech - savvy consumers who are increasingly open to boosting e-commerce spending
it is also suggested that an integrated online / offline campaign can double your brand 's recall .
