-- the past week following the disclosure that @entity3 president @entity2 has allegedly been having an affair with an actress , @entity5 , has brought to the fore the need in that country to clarify -- or do away with -- the status of @entity10 , which until now has been ambiguous
in a news conference last week at the @entity13 , @entity2 did not confirm or deny the reports of an affair , but admitted that he and @entity3 's first lady were going through " painful moments
" the term " first lady " is likely to have originated in the 19th century in the @entity20 where she has a legal status as a de facto officer of government with her own budget and staff
in @entity3 though , the @entity10 has no lawful status despite usually having an office of her own and a handful of staff whose salaries are covered by tax - payers
" there should definitely not be an official status , " said @entity33 , a political science professor and author of a book published in 2009 entitled " @entity37 , second r√¥le " ( first lady , supporting role )
" if there were to be a status what functions would this cover ? they are for the most part archaic and traditional
" in the rest of @entity51 most spouses of heads of state are not in the spotlight and do not campaign with their partners
" we are talking about two different cultures , " said @entity33
" in the @entity20 men who are presidential candidates are always married , and their wives participate in their campaigns
once they have been elected , their wives , the children and the dog are all visible
" " we should take inspiration from the model in northern @entity51 where each person continues their own life , " said @entity62 , the @entity63 candidate campaigning to become the next mayor of @entity65
" when a president is elected one does n't vote for a couple
i am voting for a person , not their family
" @entity77 , a spokeswoman at @entity79 's @entity78 in @entity65 confirmed that the @entity79 prime minister 's wife is mostly absent from all events ( the couple recently divorced ) and that the role of @entity10 is " something unique to @entity20 society , " even if @entity79 's constitutional monarchy does provide the public with a figurehead of first lady in the form of the @entity90
in @entity94 , @entity93 is head of government , not head of state , and even though her husband @entity96 has no ceremonial role , he takes an unusually backseat role
" look at @entity93 's husband
no one ever criticizes her for not being accompanied by him on official visits , " commented @entity33
" he does not check that the flowers are just right on the tables when there are official events , " the role of first lady in @entity3 , however , has become increasingly conspicuous over the years
former president @entity112 's ex-wife , @entity111 , ran his election campaign , his current wife @entity109 , a singer and former top model was already a public figure , and president @entity2 's companion , @entity115 , a journalist , lurched into her undefined role under intense media coverage
@entity115 's situation is even more complex given the fact that the couple is not married
herein lies the ambiguity in @entity3 , a modern state that , lest anyone forget , removed its monarchy over 220 years ago
probably more than in any other @entity51 country , the president 's spouse or companion is a highly public figure
yet the idea of a woman giving up her career in order to become first lady is becoming less and less acceptable
@entity3 lawyer @entity136 embodies this contradiction : " for me , personally , it is of absolutely no importance that the president has a spouse
i would vote for a president who is a bachelor or gay
but in reality , whether we like it or not , the @entity10 is unavoidable , she exists , and therefore we should legalize the situation and be precise about her functions
" @entity111 , who was @entity112 's first lady for five months until their divorce , and recently published her autobiography , last week called for the @entity10 's status to be clarified
however , she said , and @entity136 agreed , once the role has been decided on , it should be up to each woman to be able to choose whether or not to leave her career
" but @entity33 echoes what more and more men and women in @entity3 are expressing : " instead of crystalizing a tradition we need to see things differently
today women exist in their own right
they become public but only because of a private relationship
the solution for our day and age is that there no longer be a first lady
" the situation in @entity3 has opened a wider debate : in societies in which divorce and partnerships are more frequent and in which there will inevitably be a gay man or woman as head of state , the concept of " @entity180 " seems increasingly anachronistic
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .
