@entity1 's latest tablet comes in a smaller , pocketable , gripable , adorable new travel size
but the @entity3 is more than just a smaller face -- it 's a whole new product with its own killer features and disappointments
joining the @entity7 and 10 - inch @entity3 in @entity1 's @entity9 lineup , the 7.8 - inch @entity3 enters a crowded market of 7 - inch tablets
here 's a closer look at the @entity3 and how it stacks up against its competitors
the body applying the patented @entity1 shrink - ray was n't the only change to the @entity3 body
the unibody shell is smooth and rounded on the back and edges -- more so than the 10 - inch @entity3
the lack of sharp edges makes it more confortable to hold in your hands
the @entity3 is also thinner and lighter than the 10 - inch @entity3
the device weighs 0.68 pounds and is 0.28 inches thick
that 's thinner than the @entity7
being lighter means your arm does n't get tired as fast ( which is good because the new mini smart cover is n't the sturdiest stand )
what else is so great about being small ? portability
taking the 10 - inch @entity3 outside of the house can be a bit of a slog
while it 's a great replacement for bulkier laptops , it 's still larger than a book
this little guy was built for reading books in cafes , watching movies in hammocks and playing games on the bus during the morning commute
after extensive pocket testing , we found the @entity3 fits in most back pockets , from baggy khakis to skinny jeans ( just do n't sit down )
it 's easy to hold it with one hand , though some daintier mitts might find palming it a bit more difficult
toss it in a purse , a saddle bag or the glove compartment
in many ways , this size feels more natural for a content - consumption device than the larger @entity3
the competition while the 10 - inch @entity3 dominates tablet sales around the world , the @entity3 is the new kid in the mid-sized tablet market
a crop of 7 - inch tablets on shelves start at $ 199 , including @entity75 's @entity74 , @entity78 's @entity77 tablet and @entity80 's @entity79
the @entity3 is different from these devices in a few key ways : it has a slighter larger and wider 7.8 - inch screen , better hardware specs in most categories ( screen resolution is a notable exception , which we 'll revisit later ) , access to the simple and refined @entity9 operating system and @entity1 's vast selection of quality apps and content
it also has a much higher price tag
the @entity3 starts at $ 329 for the @entity96 only version
the top of the line @entity3 is @entity99 , can connect over @entity96 and cellular connections , and costs $ 659
when choosing , you 'll have to consider how important the @entity1 features are to you
is the extra space and @entity1 ecosystem worth the extra $ 130 ? @entity106 readers and shoppers might get more out of a nook or the @entity110 tablet , which is tightly tied into the @entity75 store
( if you 're only interested in reading , do n't count out the amazing 6 - inch , e-ink @entity115 tablet
) the @entity3 also has a bit of friendly competition from its own big siblings
@entity1 is still selling multiple generations of 10 - inch @entity121 : the ipad 2 and the newer ipad with " @entity124 " ( @entity1 's term )
that @entity124 @entity3 was upgraded last month to the fourth generation with a faster processor and a better camera
the choice between @entity1 products largely depends on what you 're going to use the device for
if it is a laptop replacement , sticking with the faster , larger , higher - resolution 10 - inch @entity3 with @entity135 is still your best bet
the exception might be situations where the smaller size is a must - have feature , such as working in the field
the price difference between the @entity3 2 and the @entity3 is negligible -- the ipad 2 is only $ 70 more -- so that decision comes down to size preference and specs like camera resolution
the @entity3 has better cameras -- the same ones found on the newest 10 - inch @entity3
the screen this might be a sticking point for some buyers
the @entity3 screen is basically the ipad 2 screen shrunk down to 7.8 inches
the two devices have the same number of pixels ( 1024 - by - 768 ) , but the @entity3 just packs them into a smaller space
the @entity3 2 has 132 pixels per inch , the @entity3 has 163 pixels per inch
there are a few reasons @entity1 might have gone this direction
the benefit of using the @entity3 2 's display size is that all the apps designed to work on the @entity3 will work perfectly on the @entity3 , do developers do n't have to redesign their products
also , the full retina display found on the latest @entity3 would likely have been a huge drain on battery life
( we did n't do official battery tests on the @entity3 , but we did n't need to charge it once in three days , even after streaming this @entity177 documentary on @entity178 , testing out various apps and surfing the @entity180 frequently
) touchscreen technology has marched on since the @entity3 2
the third - and fourth - generation @entity121 both have 2048 - by - 1536 , 264 pixels - per - inch @entity124 screens
all three of the main competing 7 - inch tablets -- the @entity110 , @entity185 and @entity77 -- also have higher - resolution screens
if you 've never used a higher - resolution display , you might not even notice
but if you 're already using a device with a better screen , the @entity3 can look a bit grainy
it 's like eating at @entity194 and then trying to go back to @entity195 's
what is great about the display is how it fills the front of the device
the edges around the touchscreen , called bezels , are incredibly thin on the left and right sides
@entity1 also tweaked the software so that the screen is less sensitive to an errant thumb resting on the front of the device
other specs the screen is n't the only thing the @entity3 got from the @entity211
it is using the same processor , the @entity214
this processor is now two generations old , but it also does n't have to power a big retina display , so it continues to feel speedy
there are two speakers for some decent stereo sound ( not one as originally thought , according to an @entity222 teardown ) , and the @entity3 uses the new lightning connecter port
the cameras on the @entity3 are n't as good as the @entity7 , but they are exactly the same as what you 'll find on the newest @entity3
taking a photo on the 10 - inch @entity3 has always seemed awkward , but holding up an @entity3 to take a quick video feels a bit more natural .
