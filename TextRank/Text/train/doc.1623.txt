no provisions have been added to the contract , @entity7 said , but secretary of state @entity16 ordered several changes to procedure after a september incident in which @entity4 guards shot and killed 17 people , including women and children
the incident placed the operations of @entity4 and other security firms under scrutiny in @entity6 , where an estimated 25,000 private contractors protect diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials
under a provision instituted in the early days of the @entity34 - led occupation of @entity6 , security contractors have immunity from @entity6 law
the five - year @entity2 contract , which began in 2006 , must be renewed every year and is up for renewal next month
@entity7 said , in effect , @entity4 's contract will roll over for another year
@entity4 is one of three contractors working under a " task order " to provide security services in @entity6
the other two are @entity46 and @entity47
an agreement , or memorandum of understanding , between the @entity2 and @entity34 military calls for a higher level of coordination and supervision of contractors , @entity7 said
@entity4 still has to work under the rules of the @entity6 government , he said
the @entity57 is in charge of the @entity34 investigation of the september incident , in which survivors and victims ' family members said @entity4 guards started shooting unprovoked
@entity4 said its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from armed insurgents , but an @entity6 investigation called the killings " premeditated murder
" @entity7 said the @entity34 government , in particular @entity34 ambassador to @entity6 @entity73 , will take a close look at the @entity57 's investigation report and then " decide whether it is consistent with @entity34 goals and policies to continue the contract
" he said it will be important to see whether the @entity57 finds @entity4 itself criminally responsible , or merely a few of its employees
" we can terminate contracts for the convenience of the government if we have to , " he said
" i am not going to prejudge what the @entity57 is going to find in its investigation
i think the @entity34 government needs protective services
" @entity7 said he did have some concern about the reaction of the @entity6 government and people
but he noted that there have been only three additional " escalation of forces " incidents since the new rules of engagement
" i am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen , " he said
" essentially i think they do a very good job
the september 16 incident was a tragedy , it needs to be investigated carefully
the results of that will come out of that eventually and we will decide how we will proceed
" @entity4 spokeswoman @entity111 declined to comment , referring all questions to the @entity2
