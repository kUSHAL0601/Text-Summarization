@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's return to tv monday night stuck close to the standard late night talk show format and set , but he could boast one innovation
" i believe we 're the first talk show that has a view of the ocean , " @entity4 said
" you can smell the salt air waft in
" @entity4 and announcer - sidekick @entity15 demonstrated another new backdrop feature -- an over-sized moon they can move across the sky with a remote control
exclusive : watch @entity23 's opener otherwise , the one - hour @entity26 show has the desk , couch , sidekick , band and a guest promoting a movie familiar to late night audiences for decades
@entity4 's requisite opening monologue made it clear that " getting fired " jokes are to @entity23 what divorce jokes were for @entity39
" people ask me why i named the show ' @entity23 , ' " he said
" i did it so i 'd be harder to replace
" another chief source of humor for the debut show was his move from the big budget @entity48 " on a broadcast network to the frugal world of basic cable
" i 'm going to be honest , " @entity4 said
" it 's not easy doing a late - night show on a channel without a lot of money and that viewers have trouble finding
so that 's why i left @entity48
" @entity4 parodied his @entity48 firing in a pre-produced opening segment that included cameos by actor @entity63 on the " @entity64 " set and @entity2 's @entity65 as @entity23 's guardian angel
@entity4 wasted no time assuring @entity68 fans that despite the change of channel , they would see his trademark onstage antics and characters , including the infamous @entity75 bear
the first official guest was @entity77 , curator of the @entity77
she was chosen online in what @entity4 said was rigged voting
@entity81 strolled across the stage and out the side door into a studio parking lot , slowing down only to give @entity4 a leprechaun nutcracker
second guest @entity86 stayed for a while to talk about his upcoming " @entity89 " movie
" i 'm so glad everyone more famous was busy , " @entity86 said
@entity91 : what did you think of @entity23 's debut ? after interviewing " @entity96 " star @entity95 , @entity23 strapped on a guitar to jam with music guest @entity98 and the house band -- " @entity100
" the debut show ended with @entity23 promoting " @entity102 , " which moved to midnight to make way for his 11 p.m. show
@entity106 was on with @entity107 monday night
@entity4 's tuesday night guest will be @entity109 .
