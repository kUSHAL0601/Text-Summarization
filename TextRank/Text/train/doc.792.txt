-- @entity3 's first children 's book tops the @entity5 list of best - selling children 's picture books
but here 's the catch : it actually does n't have any pictures
that gimmick , together with @entity3 's celebrity status , has helped make " @entity14 with @entity15 " a bedtime story favorite for the elementary school set
the 35 - year - old actor is best known for writing , directing and producing episodes of the hit show " @entity21
" as the title of his book suggests , " @entity14 with @entity15 " lacks illustrations
but it features silly sayings such as " my only friend in the whole wide world is a hippo named @entity30 " and " my head is made of blueberry pizza , " designed to delight kids
" @entity14 with @entity15 " is not @entity3 's first foray into fiction
he also published a book of humorous short stories , " one more thing : stories and other stories , " in february
he has plans for many more works of literature , which could include a collaboration with a former " @entity21 " co-star and reported former flame : " there 's something i 'd like to write with @entity49 , a book of letters back and forth of our arguments , " @entity3 says
" ideas for books , i have a million
" for now , @entity3 is returning to his roots in standup comedy to promote " @entity14 with @entity15
" his tour is taking him to a range of elementary schools across the country , including his alma mater , @entity63 , in @entity64 , @entity65
he spoke to @entity0 about his new book , his future plans and his tour , in which he lets his young fans share the spotlight with him
below is an edited transcript
@entity0 : how did you decide to bring kids on stage with you during your tour ? @entity3 : the school events are the most exciting to me because generally , they 're assemblies where they bring all the kids , k through 3 , in
they 've never met an author before
and most excitingly , i get to read the book to a super concentrated group of little kids
and it 's like they 're in a comedy club , more than they 're being read a book
there 's something about live comedy , where they 're practically elbowing each other , like " did you hear that ? " " are you seeing what i 'm seeing ? " it really brings back my standup days to me , except it 's for 5 - year - olds
i really do feel like i 'm on a comedy tour
@entity0 : what made you decide to write a children 's book ? @entity3 : if you 've ever been a comedian , you have this addiction to laughter
the laughter of children is the most powerful drug of all
if you get hooked on that , you 're really in trouble
while i was waiting for " one more thing " to come out , i would hang out with friends who had kids
at one point , my best friend 's son , @entity118 , who was 2 years old at the time , toddled up to me , holding a book out
and something in my brain asked : " what is his dream ? what are the dream words in this book ? ? he does n't know what 's in this book unless he 's read it before
he has the power to decide what the adult says
he 's basically a little @entity136 , producing this experience , and i 'm just the actor for hire
he 's handing me a script
what is his dream script ? then my mind just went to : his dream would be that i would have to say all these ridiculous things i did n't want to say
he would feel delighted and be in complete control
that was the first notion for the book
then when i thought : what would the pictures be ? i realized i did n't have any vision for pictures and did n't need pictures
then the whole vision came together
what if the message and the challenge of the book was : what can you do without pictures ? what can you do with the power of words ? @entity0 : how long did the process take ? @entity3 : i had the idea and put it in this notebook i carry around filled with hundreds of ideas
one saturday , or one day when i did n't really have anything to do but wait , i wrote up the whole thing
and i printed it on full - sized paper
and then i went to a stationery store , and i bought an empty book
i 'm not a designer by trade , but i did my best
i chose the font and the size and the spacing
i glue - sticked the cover page on
and i paper clipped the pages in , enough to make a 2 - year - old think that it might be a real book
and i did all this all in one day
and then i took it over to @entity118 , and i asked if i could read him this new book
then i read him the book
he was patient , and he laughed a couple of times , and then he said , ' now let 's read a book with pictures
' then i went through some editing
it was six months on and off of design questions
at first i thought , a book with no pictures , great
no cover question , no title question , no design question
just put the words out there
but in fact i soon realized when there 's nothing to look at but letters on a page , and you 're trying to make the youngest of kids stare at the page , it 's actually very hard , and you have to be very particular
@entity0 : has your standup experience helped with the book tour ? @entity3 : the standup is everything
i really do feel that this is a tour of elementary schools
a good comic has the philosophy : funny is funny , and never blame the audience
more than ever , kids are kids : @entity64 , @entity65 ; @entity224 , @entity225 ; @entity226 ; @entity227 -- i 've never seen crowds react so universally to anything as when they 're 5 , 6 , 7 years old
whatever age kids become different , it 's later than this age
the later i can delay that , the better
it 's really exciting and wonderful
more than ever , i know exactly where a laugh is going to come , where a cheer is going to come , where a call and response is ; what line to hold a little longer
it 's really stunning how a 5 - year - old in one part of the country will be totally the same as kids from a totally different part of the country
and that 's very standup - like .
