he was the first detainee at @entity2 to be convicted in a military commission , and now his conviction has been thrown out
a @entity6 military appeals court on wednesday vacated the conviction of @entity8 , an @entity9 who pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorism
the court found that the activity for which @entity8 was convicted was not an offense triable by military commission at the time he was caught
" we are very happy for @entity8
today 's decision is a powerful reminder that he committed no crime , he is innocent of any offense , " said @entity18 , senior staff attorney at the @entity19
" @entity8 can now be truly free of @entity2
" @entity8 was captured by @entity6 troops in 2001 in @entity26 after the @entity6 - led attacks against the @entity28 were launched
he was transferred to @entity2 in 2002 as one of its original detainees
he was held there for five years before entering a guilty plea in 2007
under a pretrial agreement , @entity8 was sentenced to seven years in prison
however , all but nine months of that was suspended
because of a transfer agreement between the @entity6 and @entity9 , @entity8 was returned to @entity9 to serve that time
he was released from prison in late 2007
" i 'm looking forward to getting on with my life now that my name has been cleared , " @entity8 told reporters in @entity40
he spoke about the physical ailments he suffers as a result of his time at @entity2 , and suggested the @entity9 government should be responsible for his medical expenses
" they were aware of the conditions i was being held in at the time
i think they should at least pay my medical expenses
that 's not much to ask for , i think
" he said he was kept in metal rooms in freezing conditions for years , and was n't able to move or exercise
" the body deteriorates over five and a half years , even without the added torture , such as stress positions , being beaten , etc. , " he said
" i 'm in need of operation on my left knee , my right elbow , my back
my teeth keep getting pulled because i could n't brush them for five and a half years , " he said
" it 's becoming a very expensive exercise to fix myself from the years of torture
" @entity9 prime minister @entity70 has ruled out issuing an apology to @entity8
" i 'm not in the business of apologizing for the actions that @entity9 governments take to protect our country
not now , not ever , " he said , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity77
in a statement , @entity9 's attorney - general @entity78 said the ruling was based on a question of law , not on whether @entity8 had engaged in the alleged activities
he suggested he would have been convicted under @entity9 's current anti-terror laws
" mr. @entity8 has made a number of admissions regarding his activities , including in letters to his family and in his book , for example that he undertook training with militia and terrorist groups such as @entity94 in @entity26 and that he had met @entity95 on many occasions and considered him a ' brother
' " @entity8 ' lawyer @entity99 said his client had traveled to @entity26 for military training , but that was n't what wednesday 's ruling was about
" what he was doing there was not at that time illegal
he was n't doing anything that was a breach of @entity9 , international or @entity6 law
and that 's what this decision today confirms , " @entity99 said
when asked by a reporter whether he was angry , @entity8 said no : " i think i 'm too defeated to have any anger
i 'm just worn out
" @entity1 's @entity114 and @entity115 contributed to this report .
