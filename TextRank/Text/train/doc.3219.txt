@entity0 -- president @entity3 is ready to talk even on @entity5 ' terms , he insisted tuesday , so long as @entity6 acts first to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling -- even for a short period
at a news conference , @entity3 indicated @entity5 could essentially set the agenda for budget negotiations , but only if @entity6 agrees first to a short - term spending plan to fund the government and to raise the federal borrowing limit to avoid a possible first - ever @entity16 default next week
" i will talk about anything , " the president said
house speaker @entity18 , speaking tuesday afternoon after what he called a " pleasant " but ineffectual phone call with @entity3 , promptly rejected the president 's comments as nothing new
" what the president said today was if there 's unconditional surrender by @entity5 , he 'll sit down and talk to us , " @entity18 said
" that 's not the way our government works
" at the same time , @entity18 said he 's " hopeful " top @entity5 and @entity32 could soon begin a " conversation
" " there 's going to be a negotiation here , " the @entity34 @entity5 said
" we ca n't raise the debt ceiling without doing something about what 's driving it to borrow more money and live beyond our means
" yet while @entity18 did n't indicate any points of agreement , a senior @entity45 @entity5 told @entity1 's @entity48 that @entity5 members may be willing to go for a short - term debt ceiling hike -- lasting four to six weeks -- as long as the president agrees negotiations will occur during that time
still , it 's no guarantee such a measure would be supported by a majority of @entity56 : something that @entity18 has traditionally required before calling any vote in the @entity45
a second @entity5 source says the @entity45 drawing a line in the sand not to negotiate has further complicated matters
@entity5 leaders have talked , though , to @entity64 who called them at the request of treasury secretary @entity66 and senior presidential adviser @entity67
and if there 's no breakthrough ? the partial government shutdown -- which began october 1 , after the @entity5 - led @entity45 tied its funding measures to dismantling or defunding @entity3 's signature health care reform rather -- continues
plus , another crisis looms october 17 , when the @entity74 says the @entity16 government must raise the amount of money it can borrow or else be unable to pay its bills
all the partisan bickering -- and lack of progress -- is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers , shuttered government facilities and programs , but also @entity16 confidence in their government
looking directly in the camera , @entity3 acknowledged frustrations with what 's going in @entity0 -- in terms of the current impasse and all the other budgetary battles preceding it
" we 've got to stop repeating this pattern , " the president said
" i apologize you have to go through this stuff every three months , it seems like
and @entity101 knows , i 'm tired of it
but at some point we 've got to break these habits
" @entity18 : ca n't afford to keep spending without cuts while the partial government shutdown is now in its second week , next week 's deadline to raise the debt ceiling has many experts especially worried
failure to act , they say , could lead to the government defaulting on its debt , spook @entity115 , spur higher interest rates and have other negative effects on the @entity16 and global economy
" if there was a problem lifting the debt ceiling , it could well be what is now a recovery would turn into a recession or even worse , " said @entity119 , an @entity120 economist
on tuesday , @entity3 sternly warned that " every @entity16 could see their 401 ( k ) s and home values fall " and the country would see a " very significant risk " of a deep recession
the only responsible action , he repeated : raise the debt ceiling , without preconditions
" we 're not going to pay ransom for " @entity16 paying its bills , he told reporters , placing the blame squarely on @entity56
" let 's lift these threats from our families and our businesses and let 's get down to work
" in his remarks tuesday afternoon , @entity18 did n't appear to give ground either
the president 's refusal to talk -- until the government reopens and the debt ceiling is hiked -- is " not sustainable , " according to @entity18
" the idea that we should continue to spend money that we do n't have and give the bill to my kids and grandkids would be wrong , " he said
shutdown day 8 : what you need to know @entity5 - led @entity45 , @entity32 - led @entity159 offer plans @entity18 and conservative republicans want to leverage the situation to wring concessions on deficit reduction from @entity32
to keep up pressure , @entity45 @entity5 voted tuesday to set up negotiations on the debt limit and other fiscal issues
rep. @entity169 of @entity170 , a @entity5 leader in the @entity45 , said such a negotiating committee with members of both parties could pass a short - term extension of the debt ceiling while doing its work
" i suspect we can work out some mechanism to raise the debt ceiling while negotiations are under way , " @entity169 said
" but we 're not going to simply raise it without talking about the deficit , " @entity169 said
it was unclear if his description would satisfy @entity3 's insistence that the debt ceiling increase must be separate from political negotiations
yet @entity159 @entity32 have dismissed the proposal , and the @entity3 administration has vowed to veto any such
@entity32 sen. @entity189 of @entity190 called these other @entity5 offers the latest in a series of " new gimmicks " that avoid the imminent need to fully reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling
in the @entity159 , majority leader @entity196 and sen. @entity197 filed a proposal tuesday to raise the debt ceiling without addressing any deficit reduction issues demanded by @entity5
the plan would address the debt ceiling issue through december 31 , 2014 -- past the next congressional elections
most @entity5 would shy away from a bill that does n't specify spending cuts or other policy changes in return for the increased borrowing authority
yet @entity32 are hopeful some @entity5 would vote across the aisle to prevent the potentially catastrophic economic repercussions of a default
if @entity159 @entity5 require all the time - consuming steps available to them to delay action on the debt ceiling measure , a final vote might not take place until two days before the deadline for raising the borrowing limit , the @entity32 aide said
debt ceiling debate : preaching to the choir shutdown furloughs about to hit nuclear safety agency @entity5 to hold up back pay for furloughed workers debt ceiling ' like the smoke alarm ' such a @entity159 measure could increase pressure on the @entity5 - controlled @entity45 to do the same
yet @entity5 @entity45 leaders have made clear they 'll insist on concessions from @entity32 before agreeing to raise the $ 16.7 trillion debt limit
" the debt ceiling is there for a purpose
it 's like the smoke alarm , " said @entity235 chairman @entity234 , @entity236
" democrats want to unplug the smoke alarm , and @entity5 want to go out and fight the fire
" @entity18 has insisted a deal to raise the debt ceiling must include deficit reduction steps to lower costs of entitlement programs such as @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249
however , he and fellow @entity5 have moved away from the demand of the @entity252 conservative wing of his caucus targeting the president 's signature @entity254 passed by @entity32 in 2010 and upheld by the @entity256 last year
rep. @entity169 said , while any final deal must include repealing a tax on medical devices that 's part of @entity254 , efforts otherwise to tie budget negotiations to the health care law appear dead
" i think it 's been overtaken by the debt ceiling , " he said
cruz : use debt ceiling as leverage @entity267 : most civilian defense workers can return this week on the shutdown , @entity3 and @entity32 say the @entity45 would pass a @entity159 - approved spending plan to end it if @entity18 allowed a vote
a @entity1 survey indicates that -- with 18 republicans joining all 200 @entity32 -- a slim majority in the @entity45 would support such a move
but @entity18 wo n't allow such a vote , @entity169 said
" he basically said we 're going to have a negotiation , " the @entity170 @entity5 said
poll : most angry at both parties while the two parties blame each other in @entity0 , outside the capital few get off easy
shutdown forecast : week two and clouds ahead in a national poll released monday , most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country
the @entity1 / @entity290 survey indicated that slightly more people were angry at @entity56 than @entity32 or @entity3 for the shutdown , though both sides took a hit
according to the poll conducted over the weekend , 63 % of respondents said they were angry at the republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown , while 57 % expressed anger at @entity32 and 53 % at @entity3
" it looks like there is more than enough blame to go around , and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown , " said @entity1 polling director @entity301
will 2014 election solve anything ? @entity18 demands cuts for debt limit increase @entity1 's @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity48 and @entity313 contributed to this report .
