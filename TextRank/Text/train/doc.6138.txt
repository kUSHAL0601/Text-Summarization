-- from the mid- 1980s , @entity3 - born investor and philanthropist @entity1 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into foundations in @entity5 dedicated to promoting the idea of the " open society " and challenging the region 's @entity9 - backed regimes
here , writing exclusively for @entity0 , he describes how the work of his foundations ultimately contributed to the collapse of communism
a @entity9 tank rolls through @entity16 during the failed 1956 @entity3 uprising against communist domination
i set up my first foundation in @entity3 in 1984
the idea behind it was simple
the state dogma , promoted by the ruling communists , was false and by providing an alternative we could expose its falsehood
accordingly we supported every cultural initiative that was not an expression of the established dogma
i was guided by the concept of the " open society , " which i adopted from the philosopher @entity33
i saw the open society as a more sophisticated form of social organization than the totalitarian closed societies of the @entity9 bloc
the latter were trying to implement central plans ; in an open society every individual or organization was supposed to implement their own plan
to make the transition from a closed to an open society would require outside help and that was what my foundations sought to provide
in @entity3 the authorities insisted on having a controlling presence on the foundation 's board
we eventually agreed to appoint two chief executives , one nominated by them and one by me
the project succeeded beyond my expectations
with very small amounts of money people could engage in a wide variety of civic initiatives ranging from self - governing student colleges to zither clubs
one of our first projects was to offer photocopying machines to cultural and scientific institutions in exchange for local currency
we used the money to give out local grants and support all kinds of unofficial initiatives , but the photocopying machines also did a lot of good
up until then , the few existing copy machines were literally held under lock and key -- as more and more became available , the @entity76 apparatus lost control of the machines and the dissemination of information
we did not have to exercise direct control
civil society watched over the foundation
for instance , we were warned that a blind association , to whom we gave a grant for talking books , was stealing some of the money
with a budget of $ 3 million , the foundation had more influence on the cultural life of @entity3 than the @entity97
carried away my success in @entity3 , by 1988 i had set up foundations in @entity101 , @entity102 and the @entity9
i think that i could have influenced @entity103 in @entity101 to change his attitude toward the opposition and to see that dissidents such as @entity107 and @entity108 were also patriots despite their criticism of the ruling party
as the @entity9 empire collapsed , and eventually the @entity9 and also @entity112 disintegrated , we continued to expand
by 1992 there were foundations in 22 countries and expenditure had reached $ 53 million
a year later we were spending nearly $ 184 million
right at the beginning , i had a disagreement with the @entity101 board about the way the foundation should be run
but that taught me a lesson
they were right and i was wrong
i realized that the people living there understood their country better than i did and i deferred to their judgment
it did not always work
in @entity133 , a board member who made his name as a human rights activist turned out to be a racist
a @entity136 businessman sought to hijack the foundation for nationalist purposes
it was the @entity140 foundation that gave us the most trouble ; we had to reorganize it twice
but the foundations were the first out of the gate everywhere
i remembered the lesson my father who had lived through the @entity148 in @entity149 taught me : in revolutionary times things that are normally impossible become possible
in @entity151 , we set up the @entity152 before @entity151 became independent
in @entity153 , we persevered with the foundation during the five - year civil war although we had no way of controlling its activities
our impact was the greatest during that turbulent period
when i set up the foundations in @entity5 i hoped the open societies of the @entity162 would follow in my footsteps , but in that regard i was disappointed
unwilling to burden their own budgets , they gave the job to the @entity169 , which was ill suited to the task
the @entity169 was accustomed to signing letters of intent with governments , making the continuation of their programs conditional on the governments fulfilling their obligations
the countries of @entity5 fared better , but in the former @entity9 states one after another , the programs largely failed
@entity182 was the exception : @entity184 was willing to make the sacrifices that were necessary to integrate it
eventually , the countries of @entity5 , including the @entity188 , also made the grade when the @entity190 gave them accession
but the rest of the @entity193 in the @entity194 and @entity195 never succeeded in making the transition
this has left a bitter legacy
rightly or wrongly , both the rulers and the people of @entity140 harbor a deep resentment against the @entity162 , which the @entity162 has not come to grips with
the new order in @entity204 that has emerged out of the chaos of the 1990s is very far from an open society
it is an authoritarian regime that preserves the outward appearances of democracy but derives its power from its control of @entity140 's national resources
it uses those resources to maintain itself in power , to personally enrich the rulers , and to exercise influence over its neighborhood , both in @entity5 and in the former @entity9 sphere
but the ideal of an open society is difficult to suppress and i have not given up hope .
