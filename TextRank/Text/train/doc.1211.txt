-- @entity2 's latest vanity card slams an actor as an erratic junkie on his sitcom set who was " impossible to work with
" and the performer was ... a monkey ? @entity0 : @entity2 's latest super-short vanity card this just aired after " @entity11 " on the @entity12
you be the judge : dear @entity14 , thanks to the magic of computer graphics , the monkey in tonight 's episode was not actually smoking a cigarette , nor was he ever exposed to secondhand smoke
at all times , every effort was made to make the monkey feel happy and safe
nevertheless , he proved impossible to work with
during the week of production his behavior became increasingly erratic , to the point of refusing to come out of his trailer to rehearse
it was n't until after we finished filming his scenes that we learned why
the monkey is a heroin addict
yes , hard as it may be to believe , the monkey had a monkey on his back
thankfully , an intervention was staged by the @entity44 lizard and he is now going through detox and a twelve step program at the @entity48 in @entity49
everyone at " @entity11 " wishes him well
