-- a luxury cruise ship collided in deep fog with a container ship off @entity5 , punching a hole in the container ship and knocking passengers off their feet , a passenger told @entity0 monday
" the foghorn at the back of the ship had been going off consistently , throughout the morning , " passenger @entity10 said monday from @entity11 about the incident , which occurred friday morning when the @entity13 was about five miles from the coast
" but there was a certain point in time when the foghorn at the front of the ship suddenly sounded
and it was much much louder
and it caused us to look up
and in fact we looked up straight out of the window
and through the fog , to our horror , we saw this @entity5 container ship appear , sideways on
and it was as if our ship was perfectly lined up to hit it in the side
@entity10 said he and his wife had braced themselves for the impact and stayed upright
" so , it was a horrifying moment
and in less than about five seconds after the ship appeared
we did in fact collide right in the side of it
" in a statement , @entity44 said the @entity13 " was involved in a minor incident on march 16 , 2012 , at around 4:20 gmt as it was approaching the pilot station in @entity48 , @entity5
there was contact between @entity13 and a local commercial vessel
@entity13 incurred limited minor dents and guests ' safety was never compromised
the ship was fully operational and continued on its course to @entity48 , where all shore tours operated normally
" lock disputed the cruise line 's characterization of the incident
" it was a major collision , " he said
@entity63 and her husband @entity64 were in their suite when the collision occurred
the @entity68 couple recalled hearing the vessel 's horn blast several times
then they felt the ship hit something
" it was like a full stop
just -- boom ! " she said
@entity10 said he and his wife saw that the container ship was damaged
" the @entity5 ship rolled over -- at a 90 - degree angle , " @entity10 said
" in fact , we thought it was going to capsize
and with the forward momentum of our ship , it pushed the @entity5 ship around , so that it actually came down the side , the length of our ship , scraping along the side as it went
and from that viewpoint , we could see just how much damage had been done to that ship , and it was substantial
" he said he was n't aware of any injuries aboard the luxury vessel , which had a hole dug in its bow , but said the other vessel was badly damaged
" we struck the other ship in several places that we could see -- we struck it at the bridge , where they would operate from , " @entity10 said
" we literally crushed the ship inwards
and we also struck the sides of the ship , causing a tear along the side , a vertical tear , quite substantial
and as we passed by the other ship , i personally saw several of their crew members just lying on the deck
" see @entity10 's @entity118 image @entity63 says she and her husband were not instructed by cruise staff about what to do after the collision
there was confusion in the hallways as passengers tried to figure out what had happened and whether they were safe , she said
" there was a lot of fear , " she said
" the people around me were crying ... for quite some minutes there was nothing to indicate what the crew were [ doing ] or what [ we should ] do
" the couple and lock say that passengers gathered a few of their possessions and headed to the muster stations
" the crew was calm , but the passengers -- some were scared , or even frantic , " @entity10 said
but after about 10 minutes , the captain announced that there was no imminent danger , he said
as they made their way to the station , @entity63 said she and her husband approached cruise officers and asked them how the collision happened
was n't there radar or some kind of technology aboard that would warn if another ship was close ? she says cruise employees repeatedly answered by saying that the cruise ship " had the right of way
" when they kept asking questions , she says cruise staffers walked away
" i would use the word arrogant , " she said
" they were acting as if we had , really , no right to ask the question
" the ship went on to anchor in @entity48 as planned
" the next day , we went to a nearby port and once we were off the ship we could see how extensive the damage was , " @entity10 said
@entity44 said it will carry out a full investigation into the incident
