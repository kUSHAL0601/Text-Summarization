@entity2 's army has retaken most of @entity3 , the final @entity4 stronghold in the country 's southern @entity6 province , forcing hundreds of militants to flee the town , two local security officials told @entity10
hundreds of militants were still skirmishing with military forces tuesday
the state - run @entity13 also reported that government forces were retaking @entity3 on tuesday morning after fierce battles against @entity4 with the support of the @entity2 air force
the agency confirmed that @entity21 district is now under government control
the officials estimated that more than 80 militants were killed over the last three days in the province , inlcuding 29 on tuesday , mainly in areas surrounding @entity3 and @entity27
they also confirmed that seven troops were also killed tuesday
the officials said that thousands of landmines were planted in the roads and mountains leading to @entity3 and were the reason for the government 's slow progress over the last two weeks
in a statement , the @entity36 in @entity37 said tuesday that @entity2 's military retook areas previously controlled by the militants , including the governor 's mansion in @entity27
" demining engineers have been dispatched to sweep and clear previously held areas in @entity6 , " the statement said
military forces also aim to recapture the coastal town of @entity49 in @entity6 province
and troops are making gains in the city of @entity55 , an @entity4 stronghold in @entity57 province , it said
hundreds of pro-government resistance fighters joined government lines last week
eyewitnesses in @entity3 told @entity10 that most civilians fled the town last week after the government warned they would attack if militants did not put down their arms
a senior @entity67 official told @entity10 that hundreds of militants are still fighting government troops in @entity3 and the takeover will be complete by nightfall
" our troops entered @entity3 but are not in total control of the town yet
we expect the town to be cleansed from @entity4 by late tuesday evening , " the official said on condition of anonymity , as he is not authorized to talk to media
he said that @entity4 militants fled @entity3 to the coastal city of @entity49 , where the army has already targeted the fighters with shelling and airstrikes
" the militants are surrounded now , and it is a matter of time before they surrender , " he added
the government intensified its offensive against @entity4 two months ago after newly elected president @entity93 vowed to fight the militant group until its members are killed or surrender to the government
@entity97 , an offshoot of @entity4 , took over mass areas of @entity6 province last may , benefiting from the political turmoil in the country
the @entity104 - based @entity103 told @entity10 that the current government success in the war against @entity4 came after the military was united and now serves a nation rather than factions
" with a divided military last year , terror networks gained power and ground
the power transfer last february played a major role in weakening @entity4 , " said @entity114 , president of the center .
