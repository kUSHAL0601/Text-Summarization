-- president @entity2 's plan to review @entity4 surveillance programs has validated fugitive @entity7 leaker @entity6 's role as a whistle - blower , the head of the anti-secrecy group @entity10 said saturday
the statement came a day after @entity2 outlined steps to reform intelligence gathering measures , saying the classified leaks by @entity6 created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard @entity4
" as @entity6 has stated , his biggest concern was if he blew the whistle and change did not occur , " @entity17 said in a written statement
" well , reforms are taking shape , and for that , the president and people of the @entity4 and around the world owe @entity6 a debt of gratitude
" @entity2 has refused any characterization of @entity6 as a " whistle - blower " or " patriot , " telling reporters there were " other avenues " the former @entity7 contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information
the president said @entity6 's leaks came in " dribs and drabs , " giving a false general impression that " we are somehow out there willy - nilly sucking information from everybody
" at the same time , @entity2 sought to assure the public that there are safeguards in place , while acknowledging the need for transparency
among the steps being taken , according to the president : working with @entity55 to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program ; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative ; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public , including the legal rationale for government collection activities ; and appointing a high - level , independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies
@entity6 stepped forward publicly in june to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the @entity7 had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the @entity4
the agency also collected information from @entity4 companies on the internet activity of overseas residents , he said
@entity6 fled first to @entity77 and then to @entity78 before @entity79 granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the @entity2 administration to return him to the @entity4 to face charges
he has been charged with three felony counts , including violations of the @entity4 @entity86 , for the leaks
if @entity6 believes his actions were right , " he can appear before a court with a lawyer and make his case , " the president said
@entity6 and others have contended that he did @entity4 and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs , which they say wrongly impinge on people 's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the @entity4 government
" the simple fact is that without @entity6 's disclosures , no one would know about the programs and no reforms could take place , " @entity17 said
@entity17 released the statement from @entity112 embassy in @entity113 , where he sought refuge to avoid extradition to @entity116 to face questioning over alleged sex crimes
