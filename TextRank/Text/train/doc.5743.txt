@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's former army chief appeared before a military court tuesday , on charges that he says are designed to remove him from politics
retired army gen. @entity7 faced a panel of three military judges , who are to decide whether he is guilty of participating in politics while still in uniform
@entity7 's spokesman @entity12 said the former military commander 's lawyers raised two objections : that the judges are biased and that a military court can no longer rule on @entity7 's case , because he left the army more than six months ago
the court will reconvene on april 6 to rule on the objections , according to government spokesman maj. gen. @entity22
however , @entity7 must return to court wednesday to face separate charges of violating military procurement procedures
@entity7 says the charges against him are false and politically motivated
the man credited with the military campaign that defeated a quarter - century - long insurgency by the @entity31 rebel movement was arrested last month
he was dragged from his office by armed military police during a meeting with his supporters , they said
he has since been detained at naval headquarters in @entity0 , where the military tribunal is convening
@entity7 and president @entity39 were allies and heroes of last year 's battle against the @entity43 , but they drifted apart
@entity7 's supporters say the former general was seen as a threat to the government and his arrest was ordered to prevent his participation in parliamentary elections april 8
the former military commander challenged @entity39 in january 's presidential elections , but lost by a wide margin and accused the government of election fraud
the @entity7 family has challenged his arrest in @entity1 's supreme court
those arguments are to be heard april 26
his wife , @entity60 , called the legal proceedings against her husband a joke
