-- boarded up windows on austerity - hit @entity2 are a familiar site as the economic downturn bites hard , but gleaming storefronts in another corner of the retail sector prove that , for some , the worst of times can also be the best
luxury brands , including fashion label @entity13 and vehicle manufacturer @entity16 , have all enjoyed bumper years , recording slump - busting profits that may raise eyebrows among consumers forced to tighten their non-snakeskin belts
such income surges will dispel doubts raised when markets first began to falter over the resilience of the high - end market
however , they also redraw the world 's shopping map , showing how emerging economies are spreading their spending wings
" the most fundamental driver for that kind of growth is coming from sales to consumers from emerging markets like @entity40 and @entity41 , " said @entity31 , who runs the @entity33 website
" but also i just returned from @entity42 where things are booming
" for @entity13 , whose signature trench coat is clearly proof against recession as well as the @entity49 weather it was designed for , this translates into a 21 % leap in turnover in the last quarter alone
@entity16 , meanwhile , has posted its best results in its 107 - year - history thanks to 2011 sales of more than 3,500 of its stately $ 308,000 - plus cars -- a year - on - year profit jump of 31 %
such figures are in contrast to the bleak environment elsewhere in the retail sector
@entity62 figures show that sales fell by 2.5 % in the eurozone between november 2010 and 2011 , and by 1.3 % across the @entity65
@entity66 , director of retail research at industry analysis company @entity68 , said @entity70 's luxury brands have remained relatively unaffected by reduced spending because the global consumer base for exclusive goods is expanding , chiefly in @entity74
it 's a situation that has put luxury retailers in what @entity77 , ceo of @entity80 watchmaker and jeweler @entity78 , describes as " a good mood
" " the luxury market is always more optimistic than most other industries because we have the addition of a new continent -- @entity40 , " he told @entity0
" the @entity40 consume locally , but there are about 70 million traveling around the world , so we benefit from that because we sell a dream , we sell emotion and nowadays , more than ever , we need that
" while emerging market appetites have , according to @entity31 , caught the entire luxury sector on a " rising tide , " @entity95 , ceo of @entity96 and @entity97 , says it is important for brands to push hard for their share
however , he says , high - end brands have little to fear from rising raw material costs that have added to the pressures on other sectors of the economy
" luxury is about quality detail and authenticity , " he said
" it is long term
" outside of @entity74 and @entity42 , wealthy consumers are also reaching for their @entity116 purses again following several years of downturn - induced caution , according to @entity31
he says that while economic hard times have hit those in the middle to lower income brackets , in countries such as @entity49 and the @entity128 " there 's an elite class of consumer that remains untouched by the crisis
" " everyone stopped shopping in 2008 because there was a crisis of confidence ; everyone 's financial portfolio was hit , " he said
" and , even if you did have money and were n't that affected by everything , it was seen as a bit crass to go out spending on luxury goods
now that a certain amount of time has elapsed , i think that hesitation to shop has dissipated somewhat and the big spenders are out spending again
