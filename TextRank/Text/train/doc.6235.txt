@entity0 , @entity1 -- the debut album by @entity5 rock band @entity3 has been named " album of the decade " by influential @entity7 music magazine , @entity6
released in 2001 , " @entity15 " topped the @entity9 compiled by a panel of musicians , producers , writers and record label bosses , according to @entity6
the @entity17 ' 2002 debut " @entity22 " was runner - up , with @entity20 's " @entity19 " from 2000 in third spot
the @entity3 formed in 1999 with a line - up that includes lead vocalist @entity24 , guitarists @entity25 and @entity27 , bassist @entity28 , and drummer @entity29
fans had to wait two years before " @entity15 " was finally released to critical acclaim , with hits such as " @entity33 " and " hard to explain " underlining their @entity35 - inspired garage rock sound
however , the album fared better among @entity7 fans , reaching number two in the charts compared to 33 in the @entity40
the band 's second album , " @entity43 " , was released in 2003 and again reached number two in the @entity7 charts with singles including " 12:51 " and " @entity46
" but their third album , " @entity47 " , gave the band its first number one success , when it snatched top spot in @entity7 in 2006
it also reached the hitherto unknown heights of number four across the @entity56
on hearing about the @entity6 accolade , frontman @entity57 told the @entity61 : " it 's totally crazy ! i thought it was great when i heard
" but does it mean it 's a good musical decade or a bad musical decade ? i do n't know , i 'm such a bad judge of my own stuff
