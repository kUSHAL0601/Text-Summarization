-- just as @entity2 are staring down flu season , @entity1 grabbed headlines this week with news confirming that a chicken was infected with the @entity8 virus and that many more suspected of harboring the dangerous disease were slaughtered
in the recent movie " contagion " , @entity13 's version of a pandemic , the government successfully executes a response plan
but our real - life encounter with a pandemic , the @entity23 flu , raises serious questions of whether the @entity2 public is prepared for such a crisis
it should have been good news that the @entity23 epidemic we confronted in 2009 - 10 was less deadly than feared , but instead , it was used as political leverage
conservatives , in particular , claimed the vaccination recommendations were overhyped , more " big government " meddling in citizens ' lives
what 's worse , many media outlets highlighted the critical narrative while minimizing strong evidence that the government handled the threat quite well under the difficult circumstances
this occurred as opinion polls revealed the public 's growing lack of confidence in government officials and institutions , which are now at record levels is it any wonder , then , that , despite extensive planning and billions of dollars , the public will be unprepared for the next time ? the reason lies in our deep distrust of government and thus , our unwillingness to believe the experts ' claim that vaccination is the single best method for preventing the spread of disease
to be sure , @entity2 have both historical and contemporary reasons for suspecting that government officials may not be diligent in protecting the public 's health over powerful interests
the history of epidemics is replete with boneheaded government actions that trampled the rights of marginal populations in the interests of protecting the so - called larger public
nearly every major @entity2 epidemic has targeted the poor or an ethnic minority group as objects of blame in efforts to prevent the spread of disease
as late as the 2003 @entity85 outbreak , @entity83 shunned the city 's @entity86 amid rumors that undocumented immigrants had brought the disease to @entity2
by some estimates , business fell by 70 % although not a single case from that neighborhood was ever diagnosed
in this media environment it is harder than ever for us to know who to trust and how to separate fact from fiction
during the @entity23 pandemic , radio personalities such as @entity101 and @entity102 implied that choosing not to take the vaccine was a litmus test of ideological commitment to opposing the @entity108 administration
some opponents of the administration 's proposed health care reform legislation delighted in the vaccine production delays and questioned its safety and effectiveness , saying it was proof of the government 's incompetence to " run health care
" two senators commanded a news cycle by demanding the secretary of health and human services explain the shortage , joining the chorus of those accusing the government of wildly overestimating the production schedule and making false promises within two weeks of such grandstanding , there was a surplus of vaccine , although well over half of those questioned in polls said they believed there was not enough vaccine for all who wanted it
too many are willing to accept , if not engage in , factual distortions to create their own comfortable reality
public opinion polls around the time of the @entity23 danger revealed nearly a 20 - point difference between @entity147 ' and @entity149 ' intention to seek the vaccine
republicans not only were less inclined to take it , they were also more inclined to doubt the disease was as serious as health officials claimed
our continued willingness to follow politicians who are leading us astray is to our own detriment
admittedly , it takes considerably more effort to critically evaluate the accuracy of information we receive , especially if inconvenient , than to simply accept what we want to hear , but we have no other choice
acting responsibly will literally be a matter of life and death
in the end , fewer than 20 % of @entity2 took the vaccine , with over half of the population indicating they did n't believe the government message that the vaccine was safe and effective
ironically , @entity13 has now legitimated the public 's skepticism by including a scene in " contagion " in which a reporter asks the fictional @entity180 official how he knows the epidemic threat is not " another false alarm " like the @entity23
take it from me : @entity23 was not a false alarm , nor were the government recommendations to address it hyperbolic
in the uncertainty of a crisis environment , government officials provided effective leadership
the distortions of politicians , ideologues and certain media outlets did us a disservice
fewer @entity2 than expected died or required hospitalization , but next time , we might not be so lucky
ultimately , it 's up to us to see through the politicizing and headline grabbing and protect ourselves
as @entity203 observed , " we have met the enemy and he is us
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .
