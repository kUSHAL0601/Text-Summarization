-- in his time as a @entity4 police officer , @entity1 says that it only happened to him once
typically , the people he arrested wanted nothing to do with him
but then , few things about the case of @entity11 were typical
@entity11 , the man convicted of killing former @entity13 @entity12 , wrote @entity1 , his arresting officer , four letters
in the letters , @entity11 repeatedly tells @entity16 to read " @entity17 , " saying the book would explain much of what happened the night of the murder , december 8 , 1980
he expresses an ease with the officer , saying he hoped they could be friends , that he thought @entity1 was a great policeman , and that he had felt close to him ever since his arrest
chillingly , @entity11 also wrote that others " could -- and would -- have served the same purpose " as @entity12
the four letters are expected to go on sale monday on the @entity30 website , which sells rare autographs and historical documents
@entity1 says they represent the only time someone he arrested wrote him letters
" they 've been in my possession for 30 years , and i 'm 66 years old , and i 'm saying , you know , what am i going to do with these things ? so i figured i 'd sell them , " he told @entity0
the letters run from january to may 1983
each one is typed and includes @entity11 's signature
@entity1 says he wrote a few letters in return , but @entity11 " cut it off after a while
" the two men spent several hours together immediately after @entity11 's arrest
@entity11 , who was denied parole for the seventh time in august , is serving a sentence of 20 years to life
the letters will be on sale for $ 75,000 , said @entity57 , who runs the @entity30 site
the site is also selling a " @entity61 " record album , which @entity12 signed for @entity11 before his murder , for $ 650,000
@entity1 said that he plans to donate some of the money he makes to a local shelter for battered women
here are excerpts from @entity11 's letters : january 15 , 1983 " ... i am glad that we can keep in touch
i 'll not forget the first time we met ... " besides wanting to be your friend , there are two reasons for this first letter
first , is there any way that you can help me locate my copy of @entity17 that was taken from me on the night of my arrest ? second , in the patrol car on the way to the stationhouse , i remember you telling your partner -- very excitedly -- that you knew something big was going to happen to you on that evening
do you remember this ? i would like you to tell me more of this if possible
" @entity87 , have you read @entity17 yet ? i would like you to read it and tell me what you think of it
as you remember , in the copy that was taken from me i had written ' this is my statement '
i am wondering if you now understand this
let me know how you 're doing
as i 've said before , you 're probably still the ' best damn cop in @entity4 '
" january 28 , 1983 " ... the reason i wanted to write was from the time of my arrest i have felt close to you ... " to answer your question of what was meant by ' this is my statement ' , the only way i can explain is this way : do you remember the young woman in @entity103 during the @entity104 that immolated herself ? ... she believed so strongly in her purpose that she chose to end her life rather than to continue living in this phony world ... " the @entity108 in the @entity109 is my statement
the book in incredible ... " we were all part of something big , @entity114
it is all going to come out
" march 10 , 1983 " ... you mentioned your family
tell me about your children
how about a photo , too ? " have you read @entity17 yet ? i know this will help you to further understand ... " i will let you decide whether mr. @entity12 was a phony or not
his words shoot his life - purpose full of holes
if you dig deep -- and not idolize -- it is all there
yes , @entity12 was a phony of highest degree but there were others who could -- and would -- have served the same purpose
i believe the @entity134 has these names
" may 31 , 1983 " @entity136
" @entity0 's @entity137 reported from @entity4 and @entity0 's @entity138 from @entity139
@entity0 's @entity140 also contributed to this report .
