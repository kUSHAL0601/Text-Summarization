@entity0 -- the @entity2 is suing the @entity3 and @entity4 over toll increases that recently went into effect at @entity0 bridges
@entity2 of @entity0 and @entity8 filed a complaint in federal court in @entity11 tuesday , alleging that toll hikes that began on september 18 breach a federal law that requires interstate tolls be set at " just and reasonable " rates , according to a statement released by the agency
" clearly , drivers are already paying more than their fair share -- and they are doing so at a time when federal , state and local authorities are hard pressed to meet routine road and bridge maintenance needs , " said @entity19 , aaa @entity0 's vice president and counsel in a statement
the lawsuit seeks to stop the toll increases , which affect commuters using the @entity33 and @entity34 tunnels , the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 bridges , as well as the @entity39
@entity3 officials responded to the lawsuit in a statement , saying the complaint " is without merit
" the lawsuit alleges that commuters are footing the bill for the rebuilding of the @entity48 , according to @entity2 's statement
" @entity51 is attempting to burden commuters and travelers with public expenditures that are in no way related to transportation , " @entity19 said in the statement
a @entity3 press release from august attributes the toll increases to " multiple unprecedented challenges , " including declining revenues , increased security costs in the wake of september 11 as well as the cost of the @entity48 rebuilding project
drivers crossing into @entity11 must now pay $ 12
e-zpass holders pay $ 7.50 during off - peak hours and $ 9.50 during peak hours
e-zpass tolls increased $ 1.50 , and all other cars were subject to a $ 3 uptick
the tolls will continue to increase every december for four years
the @entity2 suit comes in the wake of another lawsuit aimed at the @entity3 's newly implemented tolls -- this one by @entity4 resident @entity77
@entity77 , whose income falls below poverty level , filed a civil complaint with the @entity81 for the @entity82 last week alleging that the toll hikes constitute an abuse of power that violate his rights by unfairly targeting poor commuters .
