even after apologizing for his department 's actions following @entity6 's shooting , the police chief of @entity1 , @entity2 , insisted thursday that he 's not going anywhere -- telling @entity8 , " this is mine , and i 'm taking ownership of it
" police chief @entity12 acknowledged that he 's heard calls for his ouster , but that does n't mean he 'll answer them
" i 've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward , " @entity12 said
" realistically , i 'm going to stay here and see this through
" by ' this , " he means taking a leadership role in a police department and a community that is still marred by discord and distrust of authorities -- especially among those in its large @entity35 - @entity34 community -- since the august 9 shooting
@entity6 was a 18 - year - old black teenager killed by @entity1 officer @entity38 , who is white
despite demands by protesters , @entity38 has not been charged in this case , though a grand jury is hearing evidence that could lead to an indictment
the shooting also stirred complaints of widespread racial profiling in @entity1 , which @entity12 rejected thursday
" it 's never been the intention of the @entity1 police department -- or any police department that i know -- to intentionally target individuals because of race , " said the chief
" if there is that happening , it 's a crime and it needs to be addressed
" chief ' sorry ' @entity6 's body was n't removed sooner @entity12 's interview with @entity8 came thursday afternoon , shortly after the release of his video apology to @entity6 's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to @entity1 's streets to protest @entity6 's death
in that video , the chief expressed regret that it took investigating officers four hours to remove @entity6 's body from the street after he was shot dead
" i 'm truly sorry for the loss of your son
i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove @entity6 from the street , " he said during his video statement
investigators were doing " important work " trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours , @entity12 said , but " it was just too long , and i 'm truly sorry for that
" " please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the @entity6 family , to the @entity35 - @entity34 community or the people ( in the neighborhood where @entity6 was shot )
they were simply trying to do their jobs , " @entity12 said
asked thursday afternoon why the apology took so long , @entity12 told @entity8 , " there 's been so much going on , and every day there 's a different challenge
" he said he 's been wanting to apologize for " the time it took to remove @entity6 from the scene , " and he feels better now that he 's done it
" this is something that 's just been weighing on me
it 's something that needed to be said
it should 've been said a long time ago , " he told @entity8
feels ' responsible ' if peaceful protesters were ' upset ' dressed casually in a red polo shirt , @entity12 acknowledged in his video apology that most protesters who took to the streets of @entity1 following the shooting did so peacefully , even if there were others among them " who had a different agenda
" @entity12 singled out the peaceful protesters in his video
" the right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect
if anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry , i feel responsible and i 'm sorry , " he said
he also acknowledged that the incident has sparked a larger conversation about societal issues , and he expressed interest in being part of the discussion
" overnight i went from being a small - town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism , equality and the role of policing in that conversation
as chief of police , i want to be part of that conversation
i also want to be part of the solution , " he said
he emphasized that " the city belongs to all of us " and conceded that @entity1 and the surrounding areas have " much work to do
" " for any mistakes i 've made , i take full responsibility
it 's an honor to serve the city of @entity1 and the people who live there
i look forward to working with you in the future to solve our problems , and once again , i deeply apologize to the @entity6 family , " he said
afterward , some @entity1 residents who 'd criticized police and backed the @entity161 expressed satisfaction with the apology , saying it needed to be said
others described it as too little too late , or at least called it useless unless @entity12 's words are backed up by actions to change things in @entity1
fresh violence on the streets the @entity174 suburb was cast into the national spotlight when protests erupted following @entity38 's shooting of the 18 - year - old @entity6
the demonstrations quickly devolved into looting , vandalism and violence but eventually calmed
the @entity174 suburb of 21,000 erupted again this week after one of three @entity6 memorials at the site of the shooting burned
while many peaceful protesters took to the street tuesday night , violent elements within the demonstration stoked chaos , attacking police with guns , rocks and bottles and vandalizing and looting businesses , @entity186 capt. @entity185 said
one person threw a @entity199 cocktail at a parking structure , and there was an attempt to set a gasoline fire at a custard shop , he said
two officers were injured , one of whom was struck by a rock below the eye , @entity185 said
while @entity185 promised police would protect public safety as well as the freedoms of speech and expression , he warned that police would have no choice but to respond to any violent actions
" if that means officers will respond in riot gear , they will , " he said wednesday
" we can not have nights like last night
we ca n't have actions like last night that can result in injury or death
those will not be tolerated
" in recent days , the @entity227 has taken up measures to reform court procedures and the way the city handles certain fines
the @entity227 is also presently considering a citizen review board that would work with the police department
