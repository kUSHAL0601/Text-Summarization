-- @entity2 star @entity1 has rejected a world record transfer move to @entity5 @entity4 and decided to stay with @entity6
@entity1 opted to stay with @entity6 despite the riches on offer
the 2007 world player of the year was set to earn $ 750,000 per week with @entity4 , who were reported to be willing to pay a staggering $ 147 million to acquire his services
the devoutly religious @entity1 explained his reasons on the club 's television station
" i believe i have made the right choice
" to have gone to @entity4 could have been a great project but in the past few days i have prayed a lot to understand what the right team would be and in the end i have decided to remain here
" i do n't want anything else , i just want to be well and be happy in the place where people love me
" @entity26 prime minister and @entity6 owner @entity25 originally broke the news that the devoted fans of the @entity6 wanted to hear
interviewed on @entity26 tv 's @entity30 late on monday night , @entity25 confirmed that @entity6 had offered @entity1 the chance to " make himself a fortune , but said he has " higher values
" @entity25 continued : " he is staying with us , there are things which are more important than money : we are happy
" when i heard he would prefer to stay , that he did n't think he would be missing a great opportunity and he prefers the values of our flag , the values of closeness and friendship , the warmth and the affection that all the fans have shown him in these days , i said ' hooray ' and we hugged
@entity1 is staying at @entity6
" fans of former @entity55 champions @entity6 had staged a series of protests since @entity4 's audacious move for @entity1 became public late last week
they intensified after @entity1 played in the 1 - 0 home win over @entity60 which improved @entity6 's @entity62 title chances as arch - rivals and league leaders @entity63 slipped up
have your say : should @entity1 have stayed at @entity6 or taken the money ? @entity4 , who are being backed by @entity72 's @entity71 investment group , finally admitted defeat in a statement on their club web site www.mfc.co.uk from executive chairman @entity77 : " whilst @entity4 has an obvious interest in world - class players of the quality of @entity1 , we owe it to our fans that such a transfer must work on every level ; commercially , financially , in terms of results on the field and within @entity4 's broader community
" @entity77 and a @entity4 delegation returned to @entity89 without ever managing to meet 26 - year - old @entity1 face to face , dealing instead with @entity6 officials and his father @entity92
manager @entity93 , who completed the signing of striker @entity95 from @entity96 on monday , will also be hoping to finalize a deal to acquire midfielder @entity98 from @entity99 as he strengthens his squad in the january transfer window
@entity4 , who are struggling in 11th in the @entity5 and out of the @entity103 , signed @entity1 's @entity2 international teammate @entity104 from @entity105 shortly after their new @entity71 owners took over last summer
@entity104 has proved an immediate success with 12 goals , but @entity4 are aware of the need to attract more world class players to their ranks , hence the ulitmately fruitless attempt to sign @entity1
in a separate development , @entity104 moved quickly to deny reports that he had stormed out of @entity4 's training camp in @entity116 because they had failed to sign his friend @entity1
" i had made @entity4 aware that i needed to return to @entity119 because of a family matter , " he told @entity118
" i will return to the club and hope to sort this out as soon as possible
" he added : " i feel it is important to underline that i did not return to @entity119 because of the @entity1 deal
" he is one of my good friends and it would have been great to see him at @entity4 -- but it had nothing to do with his decision to stay in @entity6
" i am committed to helping @entity4 become the force the owners assured me they will become
