-- in the 4x100 sprint relay , it is the handoffs that decide the winner
speed is important , but without a top - notch changeover , you 're out
the maneuver is a perfectly orchestrated move performed in a split second without looking
it 's all about teamwork , something @entity13 knows a thing or two about
she was part of the @entity18 team that won gold in the relay at the @entity21 , shattering the world record in the process
read related : @entity25 2012 's top - 10 sporting moments @entity26 is now back in the @entity18 , using the lessons she learned on the track to help young girls learn their worth and make positive choices for the future
as a role model , she is not shy to share her experiences -- including the downs in her life : " i went from being @entity40 long jumper in 2005 , to nothing in the last seven years , to now being an @entity42
" i dealt with a bankruptcy ; i had my home foreclosed , and these were things that happened and i was not honest with myself about why i was in that situation , " she said
crucially for her career , she realized that she could n't deal with everything on her own
she was lucky enough to get help and support from her husband
building on this experience , she started @entity53 360 , to give young women love and support , which they might not find elsewhere
@entity13 sat down with @entity0 to talk about the ups and downs of her career and how they motivated her to start the program
@entity0 : what is @entity53 and why did you decide to start it ? @entity13 : @entity53 is a personal development program for girls aged nine and up
we teach girls and young women the importance of living with integrity , honor , and self - respect and we do that through both online and offline activities
they can learn good habits , take their weaknesses and make them into strengths
@entity0 : why did you decide to incorporate your ideals of " honor , integrity and self - respect " into @entity53 's platform ? @entity81 : integrity means i will not waver from where i want to be , cut corners or cheat myself
when i met my husband , he had a hard conversation with me : i had a weakness where i would say one thing but my action would indicate something else
i would say i wanted to be a great athlete , but i would only give 50 % at practice
i learned to be very honest with myself so i know exactly where i am
i can take those weaknesses and turn them into my strengths
honor means that if i say i am going to do ten reps , i will do ten reps
it is important to me to bring honor to my sport , to the people i work with , and to my husband
i can only do that by setting the course
self - respect : do n't do anything that would derail you or damage you
when you know for a fact who you are and what you want , peer pressure really does n't exist
@entity0 : how does teamwork play into it ? @entity81 : in a relay , you have to be trusted and you have to trust the next runner
that is what made our team successful
@entity123 trusted me to hand her the baton and i trusted her to give me a good target to give her the baton
in school when you have group projects or at work when you have to come together as a team , you have to trust that each person is going to deliver and you have to be trustworthy @entity133 : photos of @entity13 @entity0 : part of your group 's platform is combating stereotypes and avoiding the over-sexualization of young women
what stereotypes do you feel compelled to combat as a female athlete ? @entity81 : people think that athletes do not put a lot of emphasis on education
that is really not true ; education is very important
we want our members to experience a range of new things
we teach girls not to not keep themselves in a box where they think they are supposed to be or where they fit in
@entity13 on @entity159 @entity0 : what challenges have you faced in your life and career , and what lessons have you learned that you feel you can pass along to these young women ? @entity81 : i had to deal with being molested in high school and what that did to my self - esteem and my ability to trust
i overcame this with the love and support of my husband
but this is definitely not a sob story ! i also went from being @entity40 long jumper in 2005 , to nothing in the last seven years , to now being an @entity42
i dealt with a bankruptcy ; i had my home foreclosed , and these were things that happened and i was not honest with myself about why i was in that situation
it was n't until ( last ) september that i was able to do that
it took someone like my husband to give me the love and tools to help me change it
it was not something i could do on my own
that is why i wanted to start @entity53 -- so we could give these young women love and support as well
@entity0 : what 's the biggest lesson you 'll take away from your experience in @entity25 ? @entity81 : no matter what stage you 're on , no matter where you are , it always comes down to your ability to execute
on the other side , the @entity202 showed me that i was a part of a larger movement
while my role in that movement was in sports , the whole world was involved in a unity that was amazing to see
