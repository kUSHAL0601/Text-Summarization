-- the charity taking care of a blonde , blue - eyed girl taken by police from a @entity6 community in @entity7 has received 8,000 calls from around the world since it issued a call for help in finding her parents
" at least eight calls have some information that can be used by the police for further investigation , " @entity14 spokesman @entity13 said sunday
" four of these calls are from the @entity20
" the group is working with @entity7 authorities , @entity21 and @entity22 to solve the mystery of @entity26 , the name by which the couple posing as her parents called the 4 - year - old
" this @entity6 family had 14 children in total , and they were registered with fake birth certificates , so now the police are trying to see whether these children also belong to this family or if there is something else behind this , " @entity13 said
the girl was immediately taken from the couple and entrusted to the care of the @entity44 , which will keep her in one of its group homes until her family is found
" the girl is at peace , " @entity13 said
" she is doing much better
" a prosecutor became suspicious when he saw the child with very pale skin in a community of @entity6 , also known as gypsies , near the town of @entity58 in central @entity7 , @entity13 said
" it was bad living conditions , poor hygiene
the girl was found in a state of neglect , both physically and psychologically , " he said
" we do n't have any other information , if this girl was forced to work or to beg on streets
" when the couple was questioned , " they changed repeatedly their story about how they got the child , " a police statement said , compounding the officers ' suspicions
dna testing then " showed that there was not any genetic compatibility " between the girl and the 39 - year - old man and the 40 - year - old woman , the police said , meaning they can not be her biological parents
photo blog : the plight of the @entity6 the two people posing as her parents have been arrested and face charges of abducting a minor , as well as counts of falsifying identity documents , said the state - owned @entity94
among the suspect documents found by police was a 2009 birth and baptism registration from @entity101 authorities , the news agency said
the woman also had two different valid identification documents and , based on family registration records , appears to have given birth to three children between june and november 1993 and another three children between october 1994 and february 1995 , it said
in fact , the state - run @entity94 news agency reported , she had two family residence registrations indicating that she was mother to 10 children : five girls and a boy in @entity58 , plus four girls in @entity116
the man is registered as the father of four more children
@entity7 's government has promised to help the child
in the meantime , the little girl is being given support by a police psychologist , the police said
anyone with information is asked to call the @entity130 hotline for @entity131 or contact the @entity44
the girl 's discovery will probably prompt speculation that she may have been abducted or trafficked , which , if proved , could serve to fuel prejudice against the @entity6 community within @entity7 and elsewhere
rights group @entity138 has called on the @entity139 to take action to end discrimination against the 6 million @entity6 , describing them as " the largest and most disadvantaged minority in the region
" in may , @entity138 said @entity7 had been found guilty of discrimination against @entity6 schoolchildren in three rulings by the @entity147
@entity0 's @entity148 and @entity149 and journalist @entity150 contributed to this report .
