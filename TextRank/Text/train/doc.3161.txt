the wife of @entity4 owner @entity3 claims the two are just business partners and denies she was involved in the team 's response in the hours after racist comments by her husband were released online , @entity1 's attorney said wednesday
on tuesday , the @entity11 reported @entity3 tried to cover up the scandal and met with his wife and the team president to craft a response to an audio recording where he made disparaging remarks about african - americans to his friend @entity19
team president @entity20 , who is on leave , also was in on the drafting of the statement that questioned the validity of the recording and suggested it was released by someone seeking revenge against @entity3 , according to the newspaper 's account of the @entity31 document
" @entity1 had no involvement whatsoever in any decision on the content or release of the april 26 statement by the @entity4 regarding her estranged husband
moreover , she had no knowledge of the statement until after it was issued by the @entity4 , " attorney @entity38 said in a written statement
the @entity11 report cited a 30 - page @entity31 document detailing the charges against @entity3 that could lead to the @entity45 losing the team they have owned since 1981
the @entity45 own the franchise through a family trust , with each spouse having a 50 % share
the league said it has been damaged by @entity3 's racist remarks , which were posted online in april by @entity53 , and other bigoted comments aired in an exclusive interview with @entity57 's " @entity56
" @entity38 also denied the @entity31 's claim , as reported by the @entity11 , that the @entity45 are n't estranged
he said they have been living in separate homes for more than a year and have both announced they intend to divorce
but they remain business partners , he said
while the @entity31 states in document that the @entity45 went to dinner after the scandal broke and @entity1 appeared to defend her husband from media charges of racisim , @entity38 explained that it was @entity3 's birthday
he said @entity1 was invited at the last minute by a friend , who hoped she might persuade her husband to apologize for the racist remarks
when she left the restaurant with her husband , she thought the media recording the @entity45 was asking her whether she was a racist , @entity38 said
" @entity1 has denounced his racist statements in the strongest terms , " he said
a person at the office for @entity3 's attorney , @entity82 , said they will have no comment until they have all documents from the @entity31 's investigation
may 27 deadline to respond the @entity11 reported that the @entity31 document it obtained accuses the billionaire real estate investor of trying to persuade @entity19 to tell a league investigator she altered the recording and it was n't @entity3 making racist remarks on the audio
according to the story , the @entity31 alleges @entity3 and @entity19 met on may 2 , about a week after the recording containing racist remarks was released by @entity53 and just before @entity19 was interviewed by @entity98 on @entity99
" @entity3 asked @entity19 to tell the @entity31 that she lied in her previous meeting with the league , " the @entity11 reported
on monday , the @entity31 released a summary of the charges against @entity3 , who has until may 27 to respond
in it , the @entity31 said : " in the course of the investigation into mr. @entity3 's conduct , it was discovered that relevant evidence was destroyed , false and misleading evidence was provided to the @entity31 's investigator , and ( the franchise ) issued a false and misleading press statement regarding this matter
" the newspaper also reported the @entity31 is prepared to argue at a special june 3 meeting of the @entity31 board of governors that @entity20 heard the recording on april 9 , weeks before it went online , after a @entity4 employee sent @entity20 a copy
the document says @entity20 told the employee to delete the audio file and text messages about it from a cell phone
@entity20 is now on indefinite leave from the team
when asked by a @entity57 producer at a tuesday news conference what evidence had been destroyed , @entity31 commissioner @entity128 said he would n't comment on the specifics of the investigation
@entity31 charges @entity45 , schedules june 3 vote @entity31 commissioner : league will oust @entity45 @entity128 said on tuesday he is confident the league will be able to force the @entity45 to sell the franchise for violating the @entity31 constitution , though the new commissioner would prefer they sell the team without the league 's pushing
" it is their team to sell , " @entity128 , who has been commissioner for three months , said ahead of the league 's draft lottery
" ( they ) know what the league 's point of view is
if ( they ) wanted to sell the team on some reasonable timetable , i prefer ( they ) sell it than we go through this process
" the chances of that happening appear unlikely
@entity3 , through his lawyer , sent a letter to the league saying he wo n't pay a $ 2.5 million fine and threatening to sue if he is n't afforded due process
to terminate the @entity45 ' franchise rights , 75 % ( 23 ) of the 30 team owners would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale at the board meeting
because @entity3 is banned from any @entity31 activities , he is not allowed to vote , but the @entity4 will have a vote , the @entity31 said
in the case of a forced sale , the league does have a duty to the @entity45 to sell the team for the highest possible price , @entity128 said
the commissioner , who took over from @entity181 in february , told reporters if it gets to that point , the league will hire investment bankers to conduct the sale
@entity128 expressed confidence that eventually a new group will own the @entity4 , who , led by all - stars @entity188 and @entity189 , advanced to the second round of the @entity31 playoffs this season before losing to the @entity192
some analysts have said the team could be worth more than $ 1 billion
@entity196 lists the franchise 's value at $ 575 million
" we know we 're doing the right thing and i know i have the owners behind me , " @entity128 said
@entity57 interview damages @entity3 's case in his interview with @entity57 's " @entity56 " last week , @entity3 talked about his relationship with @entity19 and racism in @entity207 , and he trashed @entity208 and other minorities
" that 's one problem i have
jews , when they get successful , they will help their people
and some of the african - americans , maybe i 'll get in trouble again , they do n't want to help anybody , " said @entity3 , who is @entity213
@entity45 : i 'm not a racist ; i 'm a giver @entity208 : i 'm going to pray for @entity3 opinion : @entity3 is clueless ; here 's the @entity208 i know
