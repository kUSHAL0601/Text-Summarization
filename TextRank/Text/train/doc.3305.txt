@entity0 -- with approval in hand to arm and train @entity6 rebels to fight the @entity8 terror group , president @entity2 said thursday the plan keeps with " the key principle " of @entity12 strategy : no @entity12 combat troops on the ground
" the @entity12 troops deployed to @entity19 do not and will not have a combat mission , " he said in televised remarks from the @entity17
" their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground
... we can destroy @entity8 without having our troops fight another ground war in the @entity27
" @entity2 said more than 40 countries , including @entity30 nations , have offered assistance in the battle against the @entity33 in @entity19 and @entity6 , which calls itself the @entity33
the developments came as @entity8 advanced its grip on portions of @entity6 and @entity19 , seizing 16 predominantly @entity38 villages near the @entity40 border
the move by @entity8 was just one in a series of developments that saw new reports of atrocities emerge and the release of a video of a captive @entity50 journalist criticizing the @entity12 and @entity50 governments
citing the @entity54 terror group 's brutality , from beheading civilians -- including @entity12 journalists @entity56 and @entity58 -- to the mass execution of its opponents , @entity2 said the @entity12 will not back down
" with their barbaric murder of two @entity12 , these terrorists thought they could frighten us or intimidate us or cause us to shrink from the world , " @entity2 said
" but today they are learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before , as @entity12 we do not give into fear
when you harm our citizens , when you threaten the @entity12 , when you threaten our allies , it does n't frighten us
" the question now appears to be not if , but when the @entity12 will strike @entity8 in its stronghold in northern @entity6
the @entity12 military has everything it needs to strike @entity8 targets in @entity6 , a plan that officials told @entity1 is still waiting on @entity2 's signoff
@entity8 , meanwhile , is modifying its behavior , from the way it communicates to the way it conceals itself , in response to potential @entity12 airstrikes in @entity6 , @entity12 military officials told @entity1
the officials expressed confidence the airstrikes would be effective
as top @entity12 military leadership approved a plan to strike @entity8 in @entity6 , the @entity92 on thursday gave final congressional approval to @entity2 's proposal
the @entity17 approved @entity2 's request on wednesday
@entity12 military on deck at the same time , @entity12 lawmakers have been debating the best way to stop @entity8
in testimony before the @entity104 , defense secretary @entity102 said @entity12 's top military leaders have developed a plan to hit @entity8 targets in the terror group 's stronghold in northern @entity6
@entity2 has been briefed on those plans , which were approved by @entity111 and gen. @entity112 , chairman of the @entity113
for weeks , @entity12 intelligence and military targeting specialists have been working around the clock on a list of potential targets in @entity6
the list is expected to be shown to @entity2 one more time , @entity12 military officials said
an analysis of the risks of bombing inside @entity6 will be included , as well as an assessment of how the destruction of the targets could degrade @entity8 , they said
carrying out airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity6 would be a continuation of the @entity12 military operation in @entity19 , where @entity12 airstrikes are being carried out against the group
@entity12 airstrikes on thursday struck an @entity8 training camp southeast of @entity137 , the group 's stronghold in @entity19 , the @entity12 military said
another strike southeast of @entity139 damaged an @entity8 ammunition stockpile , according to the military

" as part of that coalition , @entity144 will join the air campaign in @entity19 , he said
read more : who is doing what in the coalition ? @entity144 carried out its first airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity19 on friday morning , president @entity151 announced in a statement
it used @entity156 fighter jets to attack a logistics warehouse used by the group in northeastern @entity19 , the statement said , adding that the target had been " reached and completely destroyed
" further operations will be conducted in the next few days
@entity151 said thursday that there had been @entity144 reconnaissance flights over @entity19 this week
when officials " identify targets , we will act " in a short time frame , he told reporters in @entity164
@entity151 thanked the @entity169 for allowing @entity144 to use an air base there
@entity151 stressed that @entity144 " will not go beyond " air support and will not send ground troops into @entity19
@entity19 : more than 1,000 soldiers @entity174 @entity8 captured 16 predominantly @entity38 villages in northern @entity6 over the past 24 hours , a @entity6 opposition group said
@entity8 fighters used artillery and tanks against the villages along the @entity6 - @entity40 border , the @entity177 said
just as in @entity6 , the crisis in @entity19 continues to unfold
@entity19 's @entity184 said thursday that 1,095 @entity19 soldiers still are missing after an @entity8 attack in june on a military base formerly known as @entity188
@entity8 says it killed 1,700 @entity19 troops in the attack
the @entity19 government has n't released a number of those killed ; @entity192 says @entity8 executed hundreds of soldiers
the news came as @entity8 released a video of @entity50 hostage @entity196 criticizing the @entity12 and @entity50 governments for their failure to negotiate for the hostages as other governments have done
in a video posted online , @entity196 -- wearing an orange shirt and seated alone at a desk with a black backdrop -- says he is sending what will be the first in a series of messages on behalf of the group that calls itself the @entity33
since @entity196 is delivering @entity8 propaganda and makes clear in the video he is speaking under duress , @entity1 is not showing the video on its platforms
in recent weeks , @entity8 has drawn growing attention for spewing brutal propaganda across social media -- messages meant both to terrify and recruit @entity220
the group appears to have a well - funded , well - organized social media and video production effort
its videos are slickly produced , with high production values , experts say
the anatomy of @entity8 : how the ' @entity33 ' is run , from oil to beheadings friends of @entity231 plead with @entity8 to let him go inside the mind of an @entity8 fighter @entity234 reported from @entity0 , and @entity235 wrote and reported from @entity236
@entity1 's @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .
