@entity0 -- the @entity2 on tuesday defended its decision to subpoena phone records from @entity6 bureaus and reporters , saying the requests were limited and necessary to investigate a leak of classified information
the @entity6 revealed monday that federal agents had collected two months of telephone records for some of its reporters and editors without notifying it of the subpoena
in a letter to @entity21 , the news service 's president , deputy attorney general @entity19 said the @entity2 had balanced the public 's right to know with national security
" any subpoena that is issued should be drawn as narrowly as possible , be directed at relevant information regarding a limited subject matter and should cover a reasonably limited period of time , " @entity19 wrote
" we are required to negotiate with the media organization in advance of issuing the subpoenas unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation
we take this policy , and the interests that it is intended to protect , very seriously and followed it in this matter
" justice officials have n't specified the leak that triggered the probe , but the @entity6 has said it believes the investigation focuses on its account of a foiled plot to bomb a @entity49 airliner in may 2012
@entity6 blasts feds for phone records search in response to @entity19 , @entity21 wrote that government officials " assured us that the national security concerns had passed " before it ran the story
" indeed , the @entity57 was preparing to publicly announce that the bomb plot had been foiled , " @entity21 wrote
" the @entity57 had said there was no credible threat to the @entity49 people in may of 2012
the @entity6 story suggested otherwise , and we felt that was important information and the public deserved to know it
" speaking tuesday evening to @entity1 's @entity68 , @entity6 executive editor @entity67 said the news service is " shocked " by what unfolded
" we 've never seen anything along the size and scope of this particular investigation , " she said
in all , federal agents collected records from more than 20 lines , including personal phones and @entity6 phone numbers in @entity80 ; @entity82 , @entity83 ; and @entity0 , he wrote in a letter of protest to attorney general @entity86
among those staffers whose phone records were subpoenaed was the news service 's @entity0 bureau chief , @entity90 , @entity6 spokeswoman @entity87 said tuesday
investigators sought call records from five other reporters and an editor , the @entity6 reported monday
@entity96 said the phone lines were used by about 100 journalists , casting a " very broad net " of @entity6 operations " that have , as far as i know , no particular connection to the story that they ( authorities ) seem to be investigating
" @entity86 said tuesday that he had stepped aside to avoid any potential conflict of interest in the case and left the decision to subpoena the phone records to @entity19
he said his recusal was necessary because he had been questioned by @entity112 agents as part of the leak probe and wanted to make sure " that the investigation was seen as independent
" the story the @entity6 says is at the center of the probe broke the news that the @entity120 had thwarted an @entity122 plot to blow up a @entity49 - bound jetliner around the anniversary of the killing of @entity126 by @entity49 commandos
sources later told @entity1 that the operative who was supposed to have carried the bomb had been inserted into @entity122 's @entity132 affiliate by @entity134 intelligence , and that the device had been handed over to @entity49 analysts
@entity86 said the leak being investigated was one of the most serious he has ever seen
" it put the @entity49 people at risk , and that 's not hyperbole , " he said
" it put the @entity49 people at risk , and finding who was responsible for that required very aggressive action
" it 's not the first time the @entity2 has taken flak for seeking the phone records of an @entity6 reporter
in 2002 , @entity154 sen. @entity153 criticized the department for its subpoenas of @entity157 , an @entity6 writer who had written about an investigation into then - sen. @entity159 , @entity160
the subpoena also spurred a protest from the journalism association @entity164
the @entity166 administration has launched several high - profile leak probes , leading to the prosecution of two government employees accused of revealing classified information
@entity171 , a former @entity172 official , was sentenced to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service in 2011 , while former @entity120 officer @entity175 was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting to identifying a covert intelligence officer
documentary filmmaker @entity178 , whose previous movies have criticized the war in @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 , called the administration 's pursuit of leakers " an effort to silence and scare whistleblowers , and to get the press to be quiet and do what it wants them to do
" " this is a systemic , continuing problem , " said @entity178 , whose latest film , " @entity193 , " focuses on the issue
" it 's not a one - off , and it 's not an accident , sadly
" @entity1 legal analyst @entity199 said monday that the subpoenas were likely legal , but go further than previous administrations in pursuing private information of journalists
" i have never heard of a subpoena this broad , " @entity199 said
the @entity57 had no knowledge of any attempt by the @entity2 to seek the records , spokesman @entity205 said tuesday
" we are not involved with the @entity57 in any decisions made in connection with ongoing criminal investigations as those matters are handled appropriately by the @entity2 independently , " @entity205 told reporters at a news conference
@entity205 said the administration supports the right of the press to pursue investigative journalism , but said a balance must be struck between that right and national security interests
" the president is a strong defender of the @entity224 and a firm believer in the need for the press to be unfettered in its ability to conduct investigative reporting and to facilitate a free flow of information , " @entity205 said
" he also , of course , recognizes the need for the @entity2 to investigate alleged criminal activity without undue influence
" @entity1 's @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .
