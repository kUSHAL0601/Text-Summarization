@entity0 , @entity1 -- the line - up at this year 's @entity4 is a cineaste 's dream
there are high expectations for @entity10 's " @entity9 , " a drama about 19th - century poet @entity12
packed with big name auteurs ( @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 among others ) and intriguing propositions , the competition for the coveted @entity14 is sure to be fierce
while there may be a dearth of surprises in the line - up , the world 's shiniest cinema event has certainly proved that in these tough economic times it can still cherry pick the best of what 's out there
but what among the dizzying array of celluloid magic has caught the eye of industry insiders and professionals ? the @entity40 asked a blogger , a critic and a film buyer attending the festival what films they will be watching out for at this year 's event
the critic name : @entity49 credentials : film critic for @entity53 newspaper @entity52 on sunday @entity4 experience : 17 years it 's heavily loaded with big names and the strange thing is that this year there are very few surprises in there
last year there was @entity64 @entity63 's " @entity62 " ( which won the @entity65 ) and @entity68 @entity67 's animation " @entity69 , " films that nobody knew anything about in competition
the one that people are either really looking forward to or dreading is " @entity79 , " @entity78 's new film
@entity78 gave everybody a rough time in 2002 with " @entity82 , " a violent , confrontational rape - revenge drama
the thing about him is once he 's got you in the cinema you 're not going to get out
this one has been made in @entity88 and is the story of someone looking at the events leading up to their own death
in particular , i 'll be looking at @entity10 's film , " @entity9 , " starring @entity95 and @entity96
it 's based on the three - year romance between 19th - century poet @entity12 and @entity100 , which was cut short by his death at the age of 25
she has n't delivered for quite a while
her last few films were at best patchy and at worst disappointing
she 's shown skill at her version of costume dramas in the past with films like " @entity112 , " which won the @entity14 in 1994
five - times @entity14 nominated @entity114 [ - born ] @entity115 's " @entity118 " is another film people are talking about
it is set in 1914 and is apparently about the emergence of @entity120
i imagine it will be fairly austere and confrontational
i also imagine it will be very good
he has never made a film that does n't really engage or impress on some level
there 's also @entity128 @entity4 stalwart @entity18 's film " @entity139 , " starring @entity130 and @entity131 about a grieving couple who retreat to a small cabin in the forest to mourn following the death of their child
there has been some controversy over why he is making what looks like a conventional @entity145 horror
it almost certainly wo n't be that
i suspect it will be philosophical
a lot of these filmmakers are not entertainers
they like to give their audiences a hard time
one of the keynotes of this year is going to be confrontation
the blogger name : @entity159 credentials : co-founder of @entity163 film blog and editor of @entity166 blog @entity4 experience : two years in the @entity170 section i 'm really excited about " @entity171 , " which is directed by these two young @entity174 brothers , @entity175 and @entity176
their style is reminiscent of the @entity179 -- but with this sense of humor and willingness to experiment in real locations , and use the people that are walking by as accidental characters
they 're sometimes lumped together with the young @entity174 " @entity189 " scene but their films are really different
they 've got a really interesting sense of style
another film i 'm really excited about is a documentary by @entity1 oscar - winner @entity197
the @entity199 title is " @entity203 , " and it is about his aunt
because it is in the @entity206 section and it 's not in competition , it wo n't get the full red carpet treatment
but while the international press is looking the other way , if it 's really good it could stand out from the crowd
of course i 'm excited to see a @entity19 movie , but my experience of being at @entity4 is that going to see one of those giant films ends up taking all day long
i try to go and see films that i might not ever be able to see again
the film i 'm most excited about seeing is @entity18 's " antichrist
" it looks sort of " @entity220 " - ish and it is a return to working in @entity199 with @entity174 - known actors
i 'm also looking forward to @entity10 's new film
the buyer name : @entity226 credentials : senior vice-president , @entity229 , @entity230 @entity4 experience : seven years sometimes a film is going to " pop " where you least expect it , and it 's often not the film with established directors
it 's quite difficult to find those -- the ones that create industry buzz , the ones that the critics suddenly go for , but also when you finally do get around to releasing it in your territory that the film actually crosses over and becomes an art house hit
i 've already read the scripts for a lot of the films in competition -- you really want to get all of the information and do your homework
this year there 's buzz about a film by an @entity261 director , @entity260 , called " @entity262 , " which is being sold by innovative production company @entity263
@entity260 has served as a juror on the @entity4 jury before and took home a @entity268 award in 2000 for " @entity269 , " a drama about young @entity261 kurds
i 'm also looking forward to " @entity139
" it 's going to be interesting to see what @entity274 ' take on a horror movie is going to be
the script was off the wall and i want to see how he brings it all together
the @entity17 film " @entity283 , " which stars ex-footballer @entity282 , is meant to be fantastic
it 's already sold in the @entity53 but the script was wonderful and i think it 's going to be a very distinctive , different film for @entity17
feel - good is a very overused term , but people are going to be looking for more feel - good films now anyway .
