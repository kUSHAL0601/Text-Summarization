-- we do a lot for -- and to -- our children in the name of parenting
i know when i get it kinda right , i know when i get it mostly wrong , and i know when i 've been lucky
i will tell you that giving my teenage son a debit check card last summer was the best thing i 've ever done for him
i will also tell you that move was pure luck
i did n't plan to give him the card in order to teach him some grand lesson about life
i 'm not that clever
truth is , i was dropping him off at a monthlong summer camp and wanted to make sure he had some money in his pocket for pizza
so when i picked him up and he told me he had money left over , i was confused
" whose child is this and where is mine ? " this could n't be my son because my son claims he can barely get by with $ 50 on a night out with his friends
clearly i had picked up @entity37 's kid by mistake
intrigued , i decided to see if he was really frugal or if he had just misplaced his card for a couple of weeks and did n't want to tell me
so i deposited the money i had set aside for shopping for his school clothes into his account and told him to make it work
and man , did he ever
my son was comparing prices -- hitting the sale racks -- and he even returned items he later deemed too expensive or unnecessary
it was like the @entity53 in a mall
since then , pizzas only need one topping , chai lattes are few and far between and he packs his own lunch instead of hitting the fast food places down the street from school
" the first few times i blew it , " my 15 - year - old told me
" i 'd have all of this stuff and the cashier would be , like , ' i 'm sorry , sir , your card has been declined
' i 'd stand there and look surprised , my response was normally something like ' @entity72 ? or ' really ? hmm , one moment
i need to call my dad
' but you would n't always pick up , so i 'd have to take stuff back
now i 've learned to keep up with my balance so i can save myself the embarrassment
" in other words , he 's gotten cheap
and not because i made him do anything , but because he 's figuring life out for himself
it was the first time in my life i knew i was doing a good job
grades , opening door for strangers , saying thank you , those are all signs that he listens to me
making good decisions as an independent free thinker , that 's a sign that he gets it
seeing my son 's relationship with money transform in less than a year provided me with a snapshot of what his behavior might look like when he 's an adult , and all i could do was smile and exhale , thinking " he 's going to be all right
" growing up , i did n't know anything about money other than we did n't have any
in retrospect , it would 've been helpful if my parents had told me why
but as the research shows , most parents have the money talk in the same way they have the sex talk , and that is to say , they do n't
@entity117 released a study last month that found 77 % of parents do n't always tell their kids the truth about money matters , and nearly a third of parents surveyed said they do n't talk to their kids about family finances at all
i guess part of the reason is that the picture is n't always very pretty
in 2007 , @entity131 household debt was equal to the gdp
but just because the money talk is n't comfortable does n't mean we should avoid it , and a debit check card is a good way to bring it up
i have found since my son has started to feel the pain firsthand , when i talk to him about the bills around the house , he listens with empathy
when i remind him to turn the lights off when he leaves a room , he has an understanding of why that goes beyond " because i said so
" i still run him to track practice , the movies , anywhere he wants to go , but he gets why i plot out the errands ahead of time so i can use the least amount of gas possible
best of all , when he asks for something i think is unreasonable , i do n't lie and tell him we ca n't afford it -- as nearly 33 % of parents do
rather i tell him the truth : it 's not worth it
and i tell him why
you know for years , i 've heard financial experts stress the importance of teaching your kids about money , but it was n't until i saw my own son 's perspective change that i became a true believer
so , i encourage all parents out there to give it a try with their kids
i promise , even if you open a checking account for them and only deposit $ 10 , the return in their lives will come back a hundredfold in wisdom
over spring break i read him the story about @entity187 , the former @entity188 star who recently filed for bankruptcy
i did n't mean to laugh at someone else 's misfortune , but we both could n't help but crack up when i told him among @entity187 's listed " assets " were 240 pairs of @entity197 athletic shoes worth an estimated $ 6,500
" how is that an asset ? " my son asked
" it 's not , " i said
and then we started laughing again -- him because the story was funny , me because i know i just got lucky
