-- new videos posted from the @entity3 flashpoint city of @entity4 suggest a fresh wave of killings by the @entity3 military after the fall of the neighborhood of @entity4
activists have provided @entity0 with footage purportedly showing the bodies of 17 civilians that were discovered february 29 in villages near @entity4 following an all - out assault on the @entity4 neighborhood that had held off a government assault for weeks
much of the video is too graphic to show on air , but analysis of the video showed at least 12 bodies
in one , bodies are piled up in the back of a truck bed covered in blankets
@entity27 falls on the bodies as people in the background wail , some shouting , " there is no @entity33 but @entity34 ! " one man off camera says , " these are the victims of the massacre by the @entity39 ( a government militia ) , entire families slaughtered by the forces of @entity42 " -- a reference to @entity3 president @entity42
several of the victims appeared to have been shot in the head , with some showing signs of deep cuts to the face and other body parts
at least one victim appeared to have had his arms tied up using red strips of cloth
activist group @entity54 listed 17 names of the victims that it said it had confirmed , and claimed at least six of the men came from one family , named @entity58
in another video , the camera pans down a line of five bodies wrapped in shrouds , as someone off camera reads off their names
a third video shows a woman wailing , " bring an end to @entity42 " as people try to console her before she falls to the ground , shaking
the activist who provided the video said the woman was the mother of one victim , @entity75 , and that she had just seen his body for the first time since his death
it was not clear how the activists managed to film the bodies
opposition members say it is increasingly difficult to get videos and information out of the besieged city , with internet access mostly cut off and activists risking their lives to show what is happening
" those are civilians from @entity4 who were killed two days ago , and today their pictures finally arrived , " @entity92 , a @entity93 - based member of the @entity94
activists insist this is just one massacre among many
they say they expect more videos to surface
" @entity4 is the capital of the resistance
@entity4 is a strategic point in @entity4 because it gave the @entity102 the freedom to conduct operations , access other neighborhoods and launch attacks against the regime , " said @entity99 , the @entity94 's media director in @entity100
he did not want to be fully identified for safety reasons
residents in @entity4 tell harrowing stories of food , fuel and electricity shortages during the biting winter cold and a neighborhood besieged with raining shells and snipers firing from rooftops
one @entity3 activist contacted by @entity0 offered further details about the killings in the videos
the activist said the @entity58 family were local farmers in the area known as @entity127 , where many of the armed forces were stationed and where artillery and rocket launchers were deployed
the activist cited eyewitnesses as claiming that @entity39 and armed forces rushed through the area opening fire on residents
six men of the @entity58 family were killed , and when other neighbors came to help they were killed as well , the activist said
the incident occurred as many of the @entity141 forces were abandoning the @entity4 neighborhood of @entity4 , and as residents were trying to flee the city
@entity0 can not independently confirm the details of the killings because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists
the @entity149 estimates more than 7,500 people have died since then , while the @entity151 says more than 9,000 people have died during the conflict
the @entity3 government says more than 2,000 security personnel have been killed in the violence
@entity0 's @entity157 contributed to this report .
