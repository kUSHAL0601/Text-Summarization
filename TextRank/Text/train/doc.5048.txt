-- at my heaviest , i weighed 385 pounds
i never dared to dream i could run anywhere , never mind finish a half marathon
yet on april 27 , 2013 , i weighed 219 pounds
at 3:30 a.m. , i ate breakfast , hydrated , laced up my shoes and headed to @entity7 in @entity8 , because i was running the @entity9
it had taken a village to get me to this day
this run was for @entity13 , my best friend since college and her partner @entity14 , the two people that have taught me about the best me i can be
it was for @entity19 , the running group that became like family to me
it was for april , my @entity23 trainer
the 13.1 miles i was about to run were n't about the race itself , but about everything -- and everyone -- it took to get me there
behind the scenes : training for a triathlon @entity14 is the biggest reason i 've been able to lose more than 150 pounds
she became my trainer last june , then became one my biggest inspirations
in november 2012 @entity14 was diagnosed with uterine cancer
she and i had been working on getting me to my goal weight , which is how we decided to run a 5k and a half marathon in 2013
the plan was to do them together
i will never forget how scared i was , the anger i felt or the tears i cried , the day i heard her say , " i have cancer
" with a cancer diagnosis , @entity14 and @entity13 should 've been thinking about anything except me , but that 's not the kind of hearts they have
both were worried about how this was going to affect the plans @entity14 and i had made
so @entity13 stepped in with her " i got this " swagger and picked up where @entity14 was forced leave off
i still wonder how she did it sometimes
she would work out with me , work endlessly , go to all of @entity14 's doctor appointments and take care of everything at home
i know she was terrified , but never once did she complain
she 's a true testament to the human spirit
@entity14 's doctor decided she needed a complete hysterectomy , with possible radiation and / or chemo to follow , depending on what the surgery uncovered
surgery was set for december 26
while @entity14 was in surgery , i was in the waiting room with @entity13
believe it or not , that was the same day i did my first phone interview for @entity23
when @entity14 woke up from surgery , the first thing she said to me was , " did you talk to @entity0 ? " i was now training for two races
@entity83 , my @entity19 running coach , made sure april got my full running training plan
april then built the half training into my triathlon training
some days it was a bit overwhelming , but i was the one who wanted this
i knew what i had to do , so i stuck to the plan and kept running
while i was training , @entity14 was undergoing five weeks of radiation therapy
on april 13 , i had my first true " runner 's high
" i had 12 miles to run , my longest distance before the half
the group was small that day so one of the coaches decided to run with me
we like to talk so we kept the pace conversational
out of that run came a favorite phrase of mine : " what 's the bigger beach ? " you do n't need the story behind it to understand what it means
it 's asking whether you 'll go for instant gratification or plan , sacrifice and work on the best possible outcome for the long run
i finished the run so inspired , feeling as if i could run another 12 miles
get fit and others will follow on april 27 , just two days before @entity14 's final radiation treatment , @entity13 , @entity14 and i ran across the finish line of the @entity9 hand - in - hand
we were freezing and completely soaked from the rain
all i could do was cry as they both wrapped their arms around me jumping and screaming , " you did it ! " no , i did n't do it , i thought
we did it ! when i placed that half marathon medal around my neck , i knew it had all been worth it
i had made it to the " bigger beach
" every time i see the medal now , i see the village it took to earn it
most importantly , when i see the medal , i see me living
follow @entity140 on @entity141 .
