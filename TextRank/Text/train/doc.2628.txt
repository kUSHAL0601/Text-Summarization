-- " hello , my name is @entity2
" not a day goes by without someone asking @entity6 to say this famous and oft - repeated line
despite @entity6 's numerous other accomplishments and recent hit turn on the @entity12 drama " homeland , " " @entity14 " is what people want to hear from him , " and i never let them down , " he told @entity3
" i get asked for that line , too , " laughed @entity19 , who played the dastardly prince @entity20
" they always want me to quote @entity6 , or @entity22 : ' inconceivable ! ' and once in a great while , i get a plea for ' i 'm swamped
' " " a girl once showed me a tattoo of ' as you wish ' on the back of her neck , " said @entity25 , who played @entity14
such is the love -- some might even say true love -- for " @entity14
" the @entity34 celebrated the film 's 25th anniversary ( and release on @entity38 ) on tuesday with a special screening and cast reunion at @entity41
en route to the event from @entity45 , even @entity42 was told , " have fun storming the castle " ( in reference to his cameo as @entity14 ) when he showed his boarding pass
it 's a line , by the way , that an army sergeant told @entity25 that he tells his men when they leave the barracks to rile up the infantry
' princess bride ' star : every woman wants to hear ' as you wish ' " so many different generations find this movie not only appealing , but have such a strong affection for it , " @entity19 said
" it 's a film people see when they 're young , and then they watch it with their own kids
someone even told me that they hired an actor , got him ordained online , and had him perform a marriage ceremony exactly the way it is in the movie
" ( " @entity74 is what bwings us together ... " ) along with director @entity77 and author and screenwriter @entity78 , the " princess bride " cast -- including @entity81 ( @entity14 ) , @entity22 ( @entity14 ) and @entity82 ( @entity83 ) -- reminisced about the making of the film , which they had n't seen with an audience since before its release , and a small private screening for friends at that , since it did n't have a big premiere back in 1987
the @entity14 ? made of rubber
the @entity14 ? played by little people , one with a talent for scurrying , one with a talent for lumbering , and one with a talent for getting arrested
and that sword fight between @entity2 and @entity14 as the @entity102 ? done for real
" our greatest pride is that there 's not a single stunt man doing a single move except for the flip in the air , " @entity6 said
" i trained with an @entity111 fencing coach for two months with just my left hand -- it 's like ballet first position , second position -- and then @entity116 and i trained for four more months , so six months together , for 10 hours a day
except for the flip , we did everything
" @entity25 revealed another talent that in addition to sword fighting cinched him the job in the first place -- a dead - on @entity124 imitation
" i had no idea if he had a sense of humor , but he looked the part , " @entity77 said
" and when he did schtick , i was surprised
wow , this beautiful looking kid , he looks like @entity131 , and he does schtick ! " @entity25 demonstrated his sense of humor at last december 's @entity136 - organized stage reading of " @entity14 , " when he played the part of prince @entity20 instead of @entity14 , allowing that role to go to @entity139
" and i did a dreadful job , " @entity25 told @entity3 , laughing
it was so hard stepping into those shoes , and it was so weird because @entity139 was being me and doing a better job than me , two chairs down
so it was a very surreal experience
" ( upon hearing this , @entity19 deadpanned , " oh , i 've got to talk to @entity116 now
i want to hear what he did with me , if he screwed me over or not
" ) even though " @entity14 " is " a perfect movie , " as @entity153 called it , @entity151 has been toying around with the idea of a follow - up , which is mentioned in the later editions of the novel , some of which feature a sample chapter of " @entity160
" " see , i told him he should call it ' @entity20 's @entity163 ! ' " @entity19 joked
" i smell a sequel ! " @entity25 laughed
the plot involves the kidnapping of @entity14 and @entity14 's daughter , @entity168 , and at first it was a fiction ( along with other faux - dramas @entity151 created as part of the " bride " - verse ) , but then it started to become a reality of sorts
" i 've been trying to write it , " @entity78 admitted , " and it 's a total failure
i was looking at it today before coming [ to the reunion ]
all i can say is that i would love some day to have written it
" if @entity151 can finish the book , and if the book were to ever be turned into a movie , count on most of the original cast members to make cameos
" if they call me , i 'm there , " @entity6 promised
" ask me ! " @entity19 begged
" i would probably find myself begging to do a cameo in anything @entity151 wrote , " @entity153 said
" and i would riff all day long [ with @entity42 ] if he would let me
" @entity42 noted that he had several unused lines that ended up on the cutting room floor that he 'd be happy to trot out , such as , " do n't bother me , sonny
i had a bad day
i found my nephew with a sheep
" ( would that be as memorable ? he 's not worried , because there 's no danger of any sequel tarnishing the original anytime soon
) " i 'm in something that is really important , that is so beautifully made , and it 's all about the right things , " he told the audience
" what better life is that for the life of a movie ? that 's the ' as you wish ' for the movie
" ' @entity14 ' : anything but ' mostly dead ' in the hearts of viewers
