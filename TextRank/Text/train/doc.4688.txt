-- @entity4 's failure to respond to friday 's deadline for it to allow @entity2 observers into the country to monitor the government 's response to civil unrest moves the country a step closer to economic sanctions from its neighbors , a senior @entity2 diplomat said
" the @entity4 responded with more requests to amendments to the protocol ; they did not reject or accept , " he said
the finance and economic ministers of the @entity2 will meet saturday to draft economic sanctions that will be discussed sunday by the @entity2 's foreign ministers , said the diplomat , who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations
these could include halting dealings with @entity4 's central bank and airlines , the official said
@entity30 foreign minister @entity29 said @entity4 risked international isolation if it continued on its present path -- and , that the bloodshed resulting from its crackdown on pro-democracy protests could not be tolerated
" @entity4 has to make a decision , " he said in @entity36 alongside his @entity38 counterpart , @entity37
" it will either continue this crackdown policy against its people and become isolated more and more , or it will say yes to this well - intentioned @entity2 proposal , sign this protocol and observers will monitor the situation on the ground by going to all @entity4 cities
" in @entity52 , a representative of @entity51 said the @entity62 secretary - general " welcomes the efforts of the @entity2 to end the bloodshed and promote a political solution " and urged @entity4 authorities to agree to the league 's proposal to send an observer mission to protect civilians in @entity4
since march , protesters in cities across the country have been demanding @entity67 's ouster and democratic elections
the state - run @entity69 said the move by @entity2 diplomats meeting in @entity73 was unprecedented
the league was rejected by the @entity4 people as " a tool for foreign interference , " it said
" the sanctions include stopping air flights , trade exchanges and monetary dealings with the @entity4 government and freezing its assets , which harms the interests of the @entity4 people , " it reported
the 22 - country @entity2 suspended @entity4 from its membership this month after president @entity90 's regime ignored demands to end its crackdown on citizens
adding to the pressure on @entity96 , the @entity94 said friday it is " deeply concerned about gross and pervasive human rights violations in @entity4 , " which are allegedly taking place " in a context of impunity
" " of particular concern are reports referring to children who have suffered torture and mutilation while detained ; as well as cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; arbitrary detention by police forces and the military ; and enforced and involuntary disappearances , " said @entity102 , who heads the expert panel
reliable sources indicate the abuses " are allegedly conducted under direct orders from public authorities , at their instigation or with their consent or acquiescence , " @entity102 said
the committee has asked @entity4 to provide a special report by early march indicating it is abiding by its obligations under the @entity94 , to which @entity4 is a signatory
earlier friday , @entity130 -- a historic ally of @entity96 -- warned against international military intervention in @entity4 and described it as an " absolutely unacceptable " solution to ending the government crackdown against protesters
@entity138 @entity137 spokesman @entity136 said the @entity4 people must be left to decide their own fate
human rights issues should not be used as a justification for action by the @entity143 , he said
" under no circumstances must human rights issues be used as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a state , in this particular instance , @entity4 , " @entity136 said , quoted by the @entity138 news agency @entity144
" a scenario involving military intervention in @entity4 affairs is absolutely unacceptable for us
" @entity138 , a major arms supplier to @entity96 , blocked a @entity157 resolution last month that would have condemned the @entity4 response to the demonstrators and called for an immediate end to the government clampdown on the opposition
it abstained from voting on another resolution that was passed tuesday by a humanitarian committee of the @entity94 ' @entity166
@entity167 has resisted mounting calls for his resignation in recent weeks as international outcry over the @entity4 violence has intensified
he says his government is battling armed terrorist groups
the @entity94 says more than 3,500 people have died in the course of an eight - month government crackdown on protests
twenty - seven people died friday , one of them a child , the @entity181 activist group said
more than 20,000 anti-government protesters gathered in the city of @entity184 as a child 's funeral was held , said the opposition group , which organizes and documents anti-government protests
power , water and communications to the city had been cut , it reported
another opposition group , the @entity196 - based @entity195 , said there was heavy gunfire in the streets of @entity200 from military and security forces
in @entity205 , weapons were fired outside mosques to prevent people demonstrating after friday prayers , the group said
the @entity181 said at least 35 people died thursday in clashes with security forces
@entity0 can not independently verify the reports because the government has restricted access to @entity4 by international journalists
@entity0 's @entity215 in @entity130 and @entity216 in @entity36 , and journalist @entity217 in @entity73 contributed to this report .
