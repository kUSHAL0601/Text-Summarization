-- officials with @entity3 's interim government are reassuring the @entity4 that their religious views are moderate , after the country 's interim leader called for the country 's new laws to be based on @entity10 , or @entity12 law
at a rally on sunday in @entity16 , @entity14 leader @entity13 said , " as a @entity12 country , we have adopted the @entity12 @entity10 as the main source of law
accordingly , any law that contradicts @entity12 principles with the @entity10 is ineffective legally
" @entity13 also suggested in his speech that he would like to see new @entity12 rules implemented to limit how banks charge interest , and put an end to some of the @entity29 - era restrictions on polygamy
" the law of marriage and divorce , which deals with polygamy -- this law is against @entity12 sharia , and is now halted , " he said
that kind of talk could raise concerns among the fledgling government 's @entity40 backers
in many @entity12 countries , @entity10 law forms the basis for the constitution , but is interpreted moderately
but in some , such as @entity47 and @entity48 , it is seen as grounds for cutting off the hand of a convicted thief , or even stoning a woman to death for adultery
secretary of state @entity56 , visiting @entity55 just last week , offered a warning when she was asked whether there should be a role for @entity12 in the new @entity3
" groups and individuals who really believe in democracy should be welcome into that process , " she said
" but groups that want to undermine democracy or subvert it are going to have to be dealt with -- by the @entity3 themselves
" but @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity68 , @entity67 , says the @entity4 should not be alarmed
" @entity10 law , @entity12 law , it is not against democracy , it is not against equality , is not against the relations with the other countries based on interests and respect and cooperation
" he says that women now enjoy new rights since the end of @entity29 's regime
" there is no restriction against @entity3 women to do anything now in @entity3 , " he says
and @entity13 on monday quickly reassured the international community that @entity3 are moderate @entity12
@entity90 spokeswoman @entity89 said , " we were encouraged to see president @entity13 make a clarification
" but she reiterated a warning to @entity3 and other @entity12 countries in transition , saying that " the number one thing is that universal human rights , rights for women , rights for minorities , right to due process , right to transparency be fully respected
" @entity13 's embrace of @entity12 's role in @entity3 comes just as voters in neighboring @entity107 handed a victory to the moderate @entity110 party @entity109
" @entity12 is clearly going to play a much stronger role across the region , " says @entity111 , a @entity112 expert at the @entity113
" whether it 's @entity107 , @entity3 , @entity118 , and beyond -- as countries redefine their political systems , they are going to want to use the values of their faith to help define what they want next
but that does n't mean necessarily they 're going to be rigid @entity110 regimes
" still , she says , @entity3 women are very concerned about equal rights in the @entity132 era
" the idea of allowing polygamy again -- or allowing the husband to marry again without asking permission of the first wife -- is something that is going to really resonate throughout @entity3 , " she said .
