-- @entity3 , the @entity5 - winning @entity4 author and anti-apartheid activist , died sunday , her family said monday
@entity3 died peacefully in her sleep , according to a statement from her family
she was awarded the @entity5 in 1991
her literary works , including " a @entity11 " ( 1970 ) , the @entity13 - winning " @entity12 " ( 1974 ) and " @entity14 " ( 1981 ) were cited by the @entity15 as " giving profound insights into the historical process ( and ) help ( ing ) to shape this process
" the @entity23 , calling her " @entity4 's grande dame of literature , " responded to her death in a news release
" we have lost a great writer , a patriot and strong voice for equality and democracy in the world , " said professor @entity26 , the foundation 's chairman
@entity35 , the former @entity4 president who died last december , was a friend of @entity3 's and read her books while incarcerated
in her novels , essays and other works , @entity3 was one of the leading voices against @entity4 's apartheid system , which segregated black and white people and led to decades of unrest
three of her novels , including " @entity46 " ( 1979 ) , were banned by the government -- a reaction she fully expected , given their subject matter
" i knew ' @entity46 ' would be banned because i even put in it ... sometimes scattered little pamphlets in the street , you know , which were swept up
but i always picked these things up , and i think i put one almost in its entirety in the book , so that would be enough for it to be banned
what else could you do ? " she said in a 2009 interview
" @entity46 " was about the child of a white anti-apartheid activist who had died in prison after attempting to overthrow the government
it includes a description of the 1976 @entity70 uprising
however , she told fellow author @entity72 that her works were n't about politics , but about people
" to be a writer is to enter into public life
i look upon our process as writers as discovery of life , " she told him in 2012
indeed , @entity3 was as praised for her writing ability as she was for her stand on issues
her literary voice " is as clear and crisp as @entity90 's , " wrote @entity89 's @entity88
" her eye for the betraying detail , for the physical sensations of @entity4 heat and dust , reminds you of the great masters of location : @entity101 's @entity100 or @entity102 ­ a @entity104 ¡ rquez 's @entity103
" nevertheless , she never shrank from speaking her mind
in recent years , she had criticized what is known as the " @entity107 , " which gave the government great leeway to decide what information should be protected , as well as to prosecute violators
the bill , though approved by @entity4 's parliament in 2013 , was n't signed by president @entity114 , who returned it to the legislature
@entity3 was born in @entity4 in 1923 , the daughter of @entity119 immigrants
she was a thoughtful observer from a young age , noting the inequities of @entity4 society while attending an all - girls , all - white catholic school
" i early on began to realize how artificial our life was , " she said
but despite her recognition of societal problems , she said she was sometimes reluctant to speak up herself
when pondering " @entity46 , " she thought the topic would be better handled by a veteran of activist families
" i waited a long time to do it , because i thought , i am not in this , " she said
" i 'm neither a parent nor a child
i 'm waiting for somebody to write it who would know more about it than i did
" nobody did , so i did
" @entity3 was married twice
her second husband , @entity140 , to whom she was married for 47 years , died in 2001
she is survived by two children
people we 've lost in 2014
