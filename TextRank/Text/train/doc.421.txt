-- now that @entity2 lawmakers have passed what 's considered some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country , other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state 's footsteps or stand back
@entity2 's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there 's reason to suspect they 're in the @entity18 illegally
it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them
critics , including immigrant advocates and the @entity23 of @entity2 , are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling , arguing that most police officers do n't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person 's legal status
the bill made it through the @entity33 on monday after it was passed by the @entity34 last week
it 's now awaiting the signature of @entity37 gov. @entity37
supporters of the measure expect her to sign it
latino members of @entity43 are calling on @entity37 to veto it
@entity45 , general counsel for the @entity46 , helped draft the language of the @entity2 bill
the institute is the legal affiliate of the @entity51
on the heels of the @entity2 initiative , @entity45 said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live
he declined to identify the states , citing attorney - client privilege
" @entity2 was meant to be the leading edge , " @entity45 said
" if you are going to work on developing a state - based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- @entity2 is the place to do it
" @entity45 pointed to @entity2 's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform , noting that " what 's happening in @entity2 just did n't pop out of nowhere
it 's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process
" @entity77 state rep. @entity77 , who sponsored the legislation in @entity2 , said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent
state laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years , according to numbers from the @entity86
in 2005 , 300 bills were introduced
the next year , that number nearly doubled , and in 2007 , more than 1,500 bills were introduced
another 1,305 were introduced in 2008 , and about 1,500 were considered in 2009
about 15 percent of those were enacted , dealing with issues such as driver 's licenses , health and education
@entity97 , 000 bills have been brought up so far this year
@entity45 cited the election year , the @entity101 leadership 's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation
" historically , not only in the @entity18 but in virtually all industrialized nations , when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players , " he said
whether @entity2 becomes the standard - bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation , said @entity117 , the program director of the @entity118
" certainly states will look at it , but not in a rush , " she said
with court challenges promised from opponents , states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it 's costly , @entity117 said
@entity125 , the staff attorney with the @entity23 's @entity126 , said following in @entity2 's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction
" although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path , i think it 's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter , that @entity2 's approach is the wrong one , " he said
@entity141 , a legal defender in @entity2 's @entity142 , blasted the bill as " the most dangerous precedent in this country , violating all of our due process rights
" " we have not seen this kind of legislation since the @entity150 laws
and targeting our communities , it is the single most largest attack on our communities , " she said
@entity77 brushed off her criticism , saying , " ' illegal ' is not a race , it 's a crime
" " we do not tolerate those who break into our country , just like we do n't tolerate those who break into our homes , " he said
@entity45 praised the legislation as " the most cost - effective and the most humane way to deal with the illegal immigration problem
" " every time you convince an illegal alien to self - deport , you bypass having to resort to direct physical deportation , " he said
in addition to providing a model for other states , @entity45 said the legislation in @entity2 and other bills in the works in other states also provide an example on the national level
" the states are laboratories for democracy
the federal government is in gridlock , " he said
" we 're providing models for the day when the ice breaks up on the @entity185 and the legislative waters flow and the country decides to confront this problem in a realistic way
