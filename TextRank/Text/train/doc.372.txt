-- the seven - hour flight from the @entity2 to @entity3 had been uneventful
passengers bided time watching movies or trying to catch shut eye
but as @entity9 made its final approach to @entity11 on @entity12 , the actions of one man put at risk the lives of nearly 300 passengers on the jetliner -- and the quick thinking of another helped prevent disaster
@entity20 , a @entity2 filmmaker , appeared on @entity0 's " @entity21 " for a second time tuesday night , recounting how he and others subdued an @entity25 - linked suspect from detonating explosives that the man had attached to his underwear
that suspect , @entity29 , is now charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft in a plot that the militant group , @entity32 , has claimed responsibility for
a senior administration official said late tuesday that new information suggests the 23 - year - old @entity38 man 's plot may indeed have had ties to the group
" first , i thought it just might be a crazy guy to actually carry a firecracker onto the airplane , " @entity20 said tuesday night
" it came as quite a shock when i heard he had ties to @entity25
" from @entity11 , @entity20 had a connecting flight before his final destination : a vacation with friends in @entity53 , @entity54
as the plane neared @entity11 , @entity20 said , he heard what sounded like a firecracker going off
" first , it was just ' bang , ' " he said
" and you 're trying to look around , like where 's this bang coming from
" immediately afterward , someone screamed " @entity64 ! " @entity20 said he noticed a man on the left side of the aisle , sitting still while on fire
" a normal person would stand up , and he was n't standing up , " he said
" so then i knew , this guy is trying to do something
" @entity20 said he jumped over the passenger next to him , reached across the aisle and lunged for the suspect , now identified as @entity29
view timeline of bombing suspect " he was getting on fire
and he was still holding the device , the bomb , " @entity20 said
" and he was still holding it in his hands
and i had to , like , rip the bomb out of his hands
" @entity20 said the man just stared at him , but did not let go of whatever he was holding onto
in an earlier appearance on " @entity21 , " @entity20 described how he yanked the object from the man , stamped out the fire with his hands and tossed it
with the help of crew members and other passengers , the man was then taken to the front of the plane , handcuffed and stripped to make sure he was n't carrying anything else
through it all , the man appeared dazed
" he was staring into nothing , " @entity20 said
investigators now say @entity29 was allegedly carrying @entity102 , or pentaerythritol tetranitrate -- enough of it to blow a hole in the aircraft
but the device he used failed to detonate fully , instead setting off the fire , authorities said
part of the explosive device was sewn into the suspect 's underwear
@entity116 agents recovered what appear to be the remnants of a syringe near the seat
because the syringe was destroyed , investigators are having trouble determining the accelerant the suspect tried to use to light the explosive
" when i was interrogated by the @entity116 , i was trying to think what i was actually holding , because it was very thick , " @entity20 said
" it 's just like everything just happened in the blink of an eye
but it 's quite scary to hold a bomb in your hands
not something you do every day
" among the passengers on the friday flight were @entity140 native @entity139 and her family
they were returning from @entity143 with two children they had adopted
on " @entity21 " on tuesday , she called @entity20 a hero
" we 're just so thankful that you did what you did and the other passengers who helped , because your bravery saved us , " she said
@entity20 said his action was just a knee - jerk reaction
" there 's so much going on in your mind , you 're not afraid , " he said
" you just do n't think and just jump
" @entity139 said the security at @entity160 's schiphol airport was nothing like what she is used to in the @entity163
" we walked through and did not have to take our shoes off , " she said
" also , my mother had a water bottle in her bag that she 'd completely forgotten about
and it went right through and we did n't realize it until we were on the plane
" @entity139 said she has n't had time to relive the experience as she introduces the adopted children to life in @entity163
" with the children being home and they 're seeing snow for the first time and just so many new things , our focus right now is just on the fact that we 're here and we 're able to live these moments with them , " she said
however , she remembers one odd detail
amid the commotion , a man about 10 seats in front of @entity139 was capturing it all with a camcorder
" it was definitely a little out of the ordinary , " she said
" i mean , i do n't know why he was standing up and we were supposed to be seated and he was filming it
" a person familiar with the investigation told @entity0 that investigators have pored through tapes that several people shot during the incident
but none has provided anything useful to the investigation , because each was captured after the fire began or has an obstructed view
@entity20 said he too tries not to think too much about the day
" like @entity139 , i think we 're all happy we 're still alive and living for another day , " he said
" of course , for everybody it 's quite a big shock that a person like that can try to take out our lives
and that 's just unimaginable
