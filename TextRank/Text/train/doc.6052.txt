@entity0 -- a @entity0 police officer is under investigation after a video emerged showing him beating a 21 - year - old man at a community center in @entity8 , police said monday
the incident occurred at 5 a.m. on october 8 , after police received a call about a dispute at the @entity14 in the @entity16 section of @entity8 , police said
there , police came upon @entity20 , who refused to leave the women 's portion of the center , the statement said
" the officers used force " to make the arrest , and @entity20 was charged with assault , trespass , resisting arrest , harassment and unlawful possession of marijuana , according to the statement , from deputy commissioner @entity34
the incident was caught on camera and obtained by @entity1 from @entity37
the video shows a bare - chested , bearded man talking with two officers -- one of them a woman -- in what appears to be a game room containing a pool table and two couches
the video shows the officers approaching @entity20 , who is on one of the couches , and talking to him
moments later , he stands and talks with the officers , gesticulating with his arms but making no apparent threat toward either officer
the video has no sound
when the officers attempt to grab him by his arms , @entity20 pulls free of their grasp
at that , the male officer , 41 , crouches into a boxing stance and hits the victim more than a dozen times , striking him in the face , the back of his head and his torso
@entity20 falls back into a couch , where he raises his arms in an apparent attempt to deflect the blows , but at no point does it appear that he is seeking to strike either officer
later in the video , the female officer can be seen striking @entity20 repeatedly with a truncheon
more than three minutes into the video , about 10 more officers enter the room , where they cuff @entity20 's wrists behind his back and lead him out
" this video does not indicate @entity0 's finest , " assemblyman @entity82 said
" you begin to wonder how often things like this happen
" @entity20 " keeps his arms down and in back of him , but he is the one who gets arrested with felonies against a police officer , " @entity82 said
" it 's just lies , lies , lies
" the department 's @entity93 has opened an investigation into the incident after reviewing the video , according to @entity98
the matter was also referred to the @entity100
@entity14 -- an acronym for @entity102 -- seeks to serve " spiritual , physical , educational , emotional and vocational needs of young adults in the @entity16 community , " according to its website .
