-- as young children , the stress and burden of our life - threatening allergies to a range of common foods , including nuts , seafood , shellfish , eggs and other substances , really fell on our parents more than us
like many kids , we were unaware and felt invincible
we did n't worry too much about managing our allergies
that changed after the first severe allergic reaction either of us had
@entity18 was playing at a friend 's house when he ate what he had been assured was a " fake peanut
" almost immediately , it was apparent that something was very , very wrong
luckily , his friend 's dad also happened to be @entity18 's doctor ; he treated him immediately , and the incident was resolved
life - threatening allergies were much less common when we went to school , so we really stood out as the " strange twins with allergies " -- those guys who had to sit at a separate table by themselves at lunchtime
it is unfortunate that severe allergies are much more widespread now , but there is a silver lining : people and organizations are more aware and better able to support the children and adults who suffer
the idea to develop a new epinephrine auto - injector ( commonly known as an @entity48 ) , specifically designed for the needs of patients like us , came about the summer after we graduated high school
we were on our way to a family vacation in @entity55 , and it looked as if , once again , the two of us had not packed our epipens
they were too bulky so we often did n't carry them
after the usual finger - pointing and questions about why we did n't carry something that could save our lives , the idea of developing a smaller , more portable type of epinephrine auto - injector was born
at the time , we had recently selected our college majors
( @entity18 went into the engineering program at the @entity70 , and @entity71 chose pre-med / medicine at @entity74
) we decided to customize our education to develop the skills necessary to make this invention a reality
at the start of each school year we reviewed our course options and decided together which classes to take that would help us achieve our goal
our first real funding came from winning a collegiate inventors ' grant from the @entity87
it was at that point we knew we were on our way
soon after we confirmed what we had already suspected : that developing a new pharmaceutical product is extremely complicated
to do it successfully would require deep industry expertise
we founded @entity95 , which now has a leadership team with more than 100 years of combined experience in the pharmaceutical industry
we are fortunate to work with a team of industry veterans who are just as committed to patients as we are
as we say , the patients are the real experts -- we just need to create the opportunities to capture their insight and design products that truly address their needs
our entire approach puts the user at the center of development from the beginning of the process
it is hard to describe the feeling now that @entity114 -- the epinephrine auto - injector that is a culmination of the ideas we had all those years ago -- is available in pharmacies across the @entity117 ( and as @entity118 in @entity119 )
if you had asked us on the day of the launch in january , we would have told you that it simply ca n't get any better than this
about a month after @entity125 's launch , we read a @entity127 post in which a mother described how her daughter had a severe allergic reaction
she described how @entity114 helped her by " having a voice walking through the steps in an emergency situation
" in her opinion , @entity114 saved her daughter 's life
we can confidently say that there is no better feeling than that .
