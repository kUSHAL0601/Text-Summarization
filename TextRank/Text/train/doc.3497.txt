@entity0 , @entity1 -- while automakers lay off staff and shut down plants in response to the economic downturn , one automaker announced thursday that it will open a manufacturing plant in the @entity10 , potentially creating hundreds of jobs in the area eventually chosen
@entity13 unveils its @entity15 sedan , with a base price of $ 57,400
the manufacturing plant will be in @entity1
@entity13 , maker of a high - end electric sports car , says it will build an all - electric sedan in @entity1
thursday 's announcement was made in @entity21 , @entity1 , where @entity13 unveiled the @entity15 sedan at a base price of $ 49,900 , after a federal tax credit of $ 7,500
that 's less than half the price of its first model , the roadster
started in 2003 and bankrolled by @entity31 millionaire @entity30 , @entity13 has attracted investments from the @entity34 elite , among them @entity37 founder @entity36
it is widely believed that the @entity15 sedan will be built near the @entity40 facility in @entity21
that aerospace company , more commonly known as @entity40 , was founded by @entity30 in 2002
@entity40 recently won a @entity43 contract to deliver cargo to the international space station when the space shuttle program is retired next year
that contract , worth $ 1.6 billion , was won over such industry mainstays as @entity49 and @entity50
the promise of a high - performance , all - electric vehicle became a reality with the startup 's first model , the @entity57 , a car with the look , speed and price tag -- a steep $ 109,000 and up -- that rivals other high - end , high - performance vehicles
recently though , the economic downturn has forced @entity13 to delay production of their would - be flagship model s until 2011
they 've also had to lay off more than 80 workers , which is about 25 percent of the company 's staff
nonetheless , @entity13 predicts it will manufacture 20,000 @entity15 vehicles a year
that would make it more of a mass - market vehicle than the @entity29 ; only 1,200 of which are produced yearly
the company faces many challenges , the foremost of which is convincing consumers to pay almost $ 50,000 for an all - electric sedan when they could pay thousands less for another brand of upmarket sedan or a gas - electric hybrid .
