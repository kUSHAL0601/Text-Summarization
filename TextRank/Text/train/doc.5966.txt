during tuesday 's taping of @entity3 's " @entity2 , " @entity5 's studio audience learned the news that would shortly become public : the comedian , who never shied away from stinging commentary on the state of politics and the news media , was leaving the host chair after 17 years , saying , " in my heart i know it is time for someone else to have that opportunity
" " i 'm gon na have dinner , on a school night , with my family -- who , i have heard from multiple sources , are lovely people , " he joked of his plans
at the end , the show cut to a clip of a monkey washing a cat , mixing the lighthearted with a serious moment in true " @entity2 " form
@entity5 's top 5 political moments @entity5 fans took this tone to heart and started the # @entity36 hashtag on @entity37 , offering career advice from the sensible to the silly
on the heels of @entity42 ' six - month suspension without pay from @entity44 , many championed @entity5 to replace @entity42
last year , @entity0 's @entity45 asked @entity5 a similar question : would he ever host a show like " @entity48 , " as was , at the time , being speculated ? " like yourself ? like a real journalist ? " he asked
how @entity5 changed politics he continued , " that , i do n't believe , is in danger of happening
that i can pretty confidently state that i will not have my own ' @entity54
' that 's just a name i came up with , a ' @entity54
' " other @entity37 users also suggested @entity5 step into a more serious role , including as the president of the @entity60
and , because @entity37 trends topically , the hashtag came rife with @entity63 and other of - the - moment references .
