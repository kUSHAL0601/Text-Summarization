-- one member of the @entity3 - winning group @entity2 garners praise for more than just his rhythm
@entity6 saluted singer @entity7 for his dedication in building the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11
" his community performing arts center helps provide a safe haven to many high - risk neighborhood children with nowhere to go after school and nothing to do to occupy their time , " she says
" the center promotes traditional @entity21 singing and dancing and gives children a sense of pride and inspiration for a better life
" this photographer , who 's married to the musical group 's manager , @entity29 , has known @entity7 for more than 20 years
the two filmed an @entity33 video to highlight @entity7 's efforts to empowering children in this small community with music and art. @entity0 spoke with @entity7 about his effort to create the center and his hope for the future
@entity0 : what inspired you to start building the @entity9 ? @entity7 : in sing with the group , i saw a need
i saw the people who support our music and felt like we had to do something for the people
my father ( @entity53 , founder of @entity2 ) has been trying to build a school for kids
he said it was going to be very easy for me since it 's not too far from where i live
i saw the kids there
some of them do n't have money to go to school or even for food
i felt i should give back to the community
we have done some of the things for the community but i wanted this to be personally coming from me
@entity0 : how has the center evolved ? @entity7 : i started working in 2009
the area had a broken house with no windows and no doors
i had to build the stage starting from scratch
so far , we have done a number of things
we 've done a month - long celebration for women and children
and we 've had a ceremony with artists : @entity2 sang , and my brother 's group sang as well
@entity0 : what has been the response from the community ? @entity7 : parents come and thank me
kids are always around playing
@entity0 : how can others help ? @entity7 : through this work , we started a ( non-governmental organization )
if there are people who want to reach out and help the kids now , we are going to send children to go to school
we 've already made a website for anyone who wants to help send kids to school
what are you doing to @entity109 ? we want to hear your story about how you or someone you know is making a difference in the lives of others
go to @entity33 for details .
