-- do n't mess with @entity2 ! that 's the lesson @entity5 's costars learned while they were filming @entity7 's " haywire
" after all , @entity5 is n't just another new face in a @entity10 action thriller
she 's a former mixed martial arts star , who is making her movie debut in @entity7 's latest flick , which opens friday
" i got to be physical with some of the hottest guys in @entity10 , " @entity5 , who tussles with @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 in the film , told people at the @entity21 - sponsored @entity20 screening this week
@entity17 , in particular , was the recipient of a vase to the face when the two were filming a fight scene and he accidentally @entity27
" when @entity17 slammed my head into the wall , that 's the only time i went black , " @entity5 , 29 , said about the shoot , during which she also reportedly knocked out a stuntman
" and then i slammed a vase right into his face when he was n't expecting it
" " he did n't get cut , " @entity5 clarified , before adding , " maybe a little bit
" @entity16 , for his part , said he also emerged " sore " from his scenes with @entity5 but called the fight scenes " good fun
" but @entity15 , whom she describes as " like a bro , " is one actor @entity5 says she would n't want to fight in real life
" i 'd probably want to choke him out real quick , " she said
" because he 's actually very athletic
" return to @entity45 ? @entity5 has officially retired from mma but says she has n't ruled out a return
to prepare for the role as a @entity49 agent in " @entity6 , " she worked with a @entity10 stunt crew and attended a two - month training camp with a former @entity53 intelligence operative
according to @entity7 , it was his intention to have @entity5 -- who is a 5 - feet 8 - inches tall and 143 pounds
-- rather than one of her male costars , be the toughest character in the film
" there was something transgressive about having the woman being the one who is attacked first , " @entity7 recently told @entity59
" there 's sort of , in movie terms , a popular conception that women are weaker than men and that the only way that they can triumph in a hand - to - hand situation is if they somehow have an advantage from the beginning
... [ @entity5 's character ] is attacked in an unprovoked manner and has to work her way back into winning the fight
with someone like @entity2 , you can pull that off and have it be believable
she can really break you in half
