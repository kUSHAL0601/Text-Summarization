-- the @entity1 charged @entity2 with wire fraud on wednesday as part of a settlement with prosecutors that will require the auto giant to pay $ 1.2 billion for admittedly misleading consumers and the government over unintended acceleration
according to an agreement signed by the @entity14 company , @entity2 executives responded to initial complaints about sticking gas pedals and unwanted acceleration by deceiving the public and trying to find ways to limit damage to its global brand
@entity2 at one point boasted internally about saving $ 100 million in costs by avoiding a full safety recall
that strategy continued even after a 2009 incident in which a family of four in @entity29 was killed when their @entity30 suddenly accelerated to speeds of 100 miles - per - hour and crashed , @entity1 officials said
@entity2 wound up recalling millions of popular vehicles in 2009 - 10
attorney general @entity33 said @entity2 " confronted a public safety emergency as if it were a simple public relations problem
" the financial penalty is the largest for a car manufacturer and @entity1 officials said it represented an aggressive new strategy to deal with how companies handle safety recalls
under the agreement , the @entity1 will defer the criminal charge for three years , during which @entity2 will submit to government monitoring
the settlement ends a four - year probe by the @entity45 , which is now looking at safety issues at @entity47
@entity47 has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem
@entity47 engineers apparently knew about it years ago but the @entity53 automaker did not move to recall vehicles until last month
@entity55 , @entity56 assistant director in charge of the bureau 's @entity59 office , blasted @entity2
" the disregard @entity2 had for the safety of the public is outrageous
not only did @entity2 fail to recall cars with problem parts , they continued to manufacture new cars with the same parts they knew were deadly , " he said
according to the agreement , @entity2 admitted to deceiving @entity72 safety regulators and members of @entity74 who conducted a separate inquiry
@entity77 @entity72 attorney @entity76 said the company 's deception even raised concerns among employees
@entity76 noted that one employee , in january 2010 , said in response to the company 's misleading public statements : " @entity86 ! someone will go to jail if lies are repeatedly told
i ca n't support this
" @entity92 , chief legal officer for @entity93 said the company has made changes to be more responsive to customers
" in the more than four years since these recalls , we have gone back to basics at @entity2 to put our customers first , " he said
the company has settled similar allegations over unintended acceleration in agreements with a group of states , and has also settled with some vehicle owners
the @entity107 previously leveled stiff fines against @entity2 for not promptly addressing safety problems related to unintended acceleration
the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) also came under scrutiny during the @entity2 saga for not pushing the company harder in the early stages of their investigation into motorist complaints
the recall crisis cost @entity2 an estimated $ 2 billion in repair costs and lost sales , even before it had to pay out any legal settlements .
