-- now that @entity2 have won control of the @entity4 , @entity1 is awash with rumors and speculation about how president @entity7 and the @entity8 will get along
@entity11 dr. @entity10 are already yakking about how the two sides should just get along " for the sake of the children ... er , country
" but this is not a troubled marriage
it 's more complicated than even that
rather than look to the psychobabble of self - help , we should look at the hard - earned successes of difficult peace negotiations between nations
president @entity7 , house speaker @entity26 and presumptive senate majority leader @entity27 should begin with what peace negotiators call " @entity30
" @entity30 's between nation begin with cultural exchanges -- like sending @entity34 ping - pong players to @entity35
this is why a bourbon summit would be useful , and i hope sen. @entity38 takes the president up on his offer
but once you 've broken the ice by breaking out the bourbon , where do you go ? what issues do you start negotiating ? the easier ones
it is a troubling sign that , in their post-election press conferences , both @entity7 and @entity38 kept circling back to immigration
at one level this is obvious : immigration is an important national priority on which the two parties seem deeply divided
that 's why they should not start with immigration
instead they should start small
one place where @entity61 and @entity62 found they could agree , when they were at this juncture in the mid- 1990s was biomedical research
each wanted to build on @entity34 's lead in the field , and so they passed legislation to double funding for the @entity72 over five years
( the five years extended into the @entity74 presidency , and to his credit he honored the deal
) the @entity72 has been in the news recently , since its director , dr. @entity78 , said we would already have an @entity81 vaccine but for budget cuts
it is simply true that , after the @entity62 - @entity86 - @entity74 increase , @entity72 funding has flat - lined
in fact , @entity72 has lost 25 % of its purchasing power , due to budget constraints and the moronic policy sequester
boosting @entity72 would be good for the economy
a $ 3 billion investment championed by @entity94 sen. @entity93 and signed into law by president @entity96 paid for the research that decoded the human genome
that $ 3 billion investment has spurred -- get this -- $ 965 billion in economic activity , including 53,000 new jobs and $ 290 billion in personal income , according to a study by the @entity104 , a coalition of research institutions , patient and health advocates and private industry
boosting @entity72 is also good politics
i am on the @entity111 of @entity112 in @entity113
@entity112 is the number - one recipient of research grants from the @entity115 , which is part of @entity72
and you know which senators have @entity112 in their state ? you got it : @entity122 and @entity123
one a tea party favorite and one a @entity127 hero
if they would get on board with boosting @entity72 funding , a whole lot of their constituents on both sides of the aisle would be happy
championing biomedical research did not dent @entity61 's conservative credentials , nor did it hurt @entity62 among liberals
because cancer knows no partisan boundaries
one in two @entity34 men will develop cancer
and one in three @entity34 women will
if you 're reading this at the office ( i promise not to tell ) look around : half the guys and a third of the women will , one day , sit in an office and hear a doc say , " you have cancer
" think about that as you have dinner with your family , when you 're at a football game this weekend or in church this sunday
president @entity7 lost his mother and grandmother to cancer
each of them know the pain of loss and the promise of biomedical research
so my advice to them is to start with the basics : basic science , and then work their way up to the more intractable problems .
