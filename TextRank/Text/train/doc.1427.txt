-- terrorism causes fear , and we overreact to that fear
our brains are n't very good at probability and risk analysis
we tend to exaggerate spectacular , strange and rare events , and downplay ordinary , familiar and common ones
we think rare risks are more common than they are , and we fear them more than probability indicates we should
our leaders are just as prone to this overreaction as we are
but aside from basic psychology , there are other reasons that it 's smart politics to exaggerate terrorist threats , and security threats in general
the first is that we respond to a strong leader
@entity22 famously said : " when people feel uncertain , they 'd rather have somebody that 's strong and wrong than somebody who 's weak and right
the second is that doing something -- anything -- is good politics
a politician wants to be seen as taking charge , demanding answers , fixing things
it just does n't look as good to sit back and claim that there 's nothing to do
the logic is along the lines of : " something must be done
therefore , we must do it
" the third is that the " fear preacher " wins , regardless of the outcome
one of them preaches fear and draconian security measures
the other is someone like me , who tells people that terrorism is a negligible risk , that risk is part of life , and that while some security is necessary , we should mostly just refuse to be terrorized and get on with our lives
fast - forward 10 years
if i 'm right and there have been no more terrorist attacks , the fear preacher takes credit for keeping us safe
but if a terrorist attack has occurred , my government career is over
even if the incidence of terrorism is as ridiculously low as it is today , there 's no benefit for a politician to take my side of that gamble
the fourth and final reason is money
every new security technology , from surveillance cameras to high - tech fusion centers to airport full - body scanners , has a for - profit corporation lobbying for its purchase and use
given the three other reasons above , it 's easy -- and probably profitable -- for a politician to make them happy and say yes
for any given politician , the implications of these four reasons are straightforward
overestimating the threat is better than underestimating it
doing something about the threat is better than doing nothing
doing something that is explicitly reactive is better than being proactive
( if you 're proactive and you 're wrong , you 've wasted money
if you 're proactive and you 're right but no longer in power , whoever is in power is going to get the credit for what you did
) visible is better than invisible
creating something new is better than fixing something old
those last two maxims are why it 's better for a politician to fund a terrorist fusion center than to pay for more @entity115 translators for the @entity116
no one 's going to see the additional appropriation in the @entity116 's secret budget
on the other hand , a high - tech computerized fusion center is going to make front page news , even if it does n't actually do anything useful
this leads to another phenomenon about security and government
once a security system is in place , it can be very hard to dislodge it
imagine a politician who objects to some aspect of airport security : the liquid ban , the shoe removal , something
if he pushes to relax security , he gets the blame if something bad happens as a result
no one wants to roll back a police power and have the lack of that power cause a well - publicized death , even if it 's a one - in - a - billion fluke
we 're seeing this force at work in the bloated terrorist no - fly and watch lists ; agents have lots of incentive to put someone on the list , but absolutely no incentive to take anyone off
we 're also seeing this in the @entity162 's attempt to reverse the ban on small blades on airplanes
twice it tried to make the change , and twice fearful politicians prevented it from going through with it
lots of unneeded and ineffective security measures are perpetrated by a government bureaucracy that is primarily concerned about the security of its members ' careers
they know the voters are more likely to punish them more if they fail to secure against a repetition of the last attack , and less if they fail to anticipate the next one
what can we do ? well , the first step toward solving a problem is recognizing that you have one
these are not iron - clad rules ; they 're tendencies
if we can keep these tendencies and their causes in mind , we 're more likely to end up with sensible security measures that are commensurate with the threat , instead of a lot of security theater and draconian police powers that are not
our leaders ' job is to resist these tendencies
our job is to support politicians who do resist
