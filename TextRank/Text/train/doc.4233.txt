@entity0 -- @entity3 officials head to federal court on monday to defend a controversial new voter identification law , dismissing suggestions the requirement would deny tens of thousands of people , many of them minorities , access to the ballot
a weeklong trial will kick off in @entity0 before a panel of three judges who will decide whether the law should take effect
it is one of several legal challenges to voter identification laws nationwide
a key enforcement provision of the landmark @entity22 , gives the federal government open - ended oversight of states and communities with a history of voter discrimination
any changes in voting laws and procedures in those areas must be " pre-cleared " with @entity0
@entity3 attorney general @entity34 has defended the law , saying it will not harm any potential voter
" the changes have neither the purpose nor will they have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race , color , or membership in a language minority , " @entity34 said
the @entity46 blocked the measure from taking effect last year , concluding it was discriminatory
federal officials cited figures that registered minority voters were about 20 percent more likely than white voters to lack state - issued photo identification
the @entity46 estimated that more than 80,000 people in @entity3 could be adversely impacted by the planned requirements
@entity57 gov. @entity57 has called the @entity46 's decision " outrageous " and ordered a lawsuit
state officials have deflected criticism the legal battle could end up costing taxpayers $ 1 million or more
" it would n't cost anything if ( @entity69 attorney general ) @entity67 and the @entity46 would get out of the way and let us protect our citizens and enforce our laws , " @entity64 , a spokesman for @entity57 , said earlier this year
a decision in the case could take weeks
in legal filings with the court , @entity3 officials said a law dating to 1988 requires a state - issued voter registration card and the voter 's signature at the polls
the amended law approved last year would permit five types of photo identification : a state - issued driver 's license , a non-driver identification card issued by the @entity89 , military identification , a @entity69 passport , or state voter registration card
waivers are allowed , but the voter must sign an affidavit specifying why she or he has a " reasonable impediment " to getting the necessary identification or has a religious objection to being photographed
if the law takes effect , @entity3 would be among 11 states that require official photo identification at the polls , according to the @entity105
proponents say the drive is an effort to stop what officials contend is voter fraud and to purge voter rolls of outdated information
supporters say having valid , government - issued photo identification is a reasonable , modern - day necessity
opponents assert that the effort disenfranchise poor , minority and disabled voters
@entity122 administration officials have concluded there is little evidence of voter fraud in the state warranting the legislative changes
a coalition of civil rights groups is expected to testify at next week 's hearing , offering testimony from college students and elderly residents
those groups say claims of voter fraud are exaggerated
" @entity3 's photo id measure is a solution in search of a problem
credible studies show that one is more likely to be struck by lightning than to perceive an instance of in - person voter fraud , " @entity141 , a top lawyer at the @entity143 's @entity142 , said
" the [ upcoming ] trial will make clear that the state 's proposed photo identification measure will have a significant impact on its minority voters
" the @entity143 says that a quarter of african - americans and 16 percent of @entity156 nationally lack any kind of government - issued photo identification
a separate federal panel is considering similar challenge to a voter identification law in @entity163
a federal trial was held last month and a ruling is expected soon
both @entity3 and @entity163 say they will put their laws in place in time for the november elections , if they are upheld
it is possible the losing sides could ask the @entity69 @entity172 to intervene , delaying any immediate implementation
other @entity175 - controlled states with similar laws under legal challenge include @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , and @entity183
the @entity46 this week gave approval to @entity186 's less restrictive voter identification measure
@entity188 gov. @entity187 vetoed a law passed by the @entity175 - led @entity190
the @entity172 in 2008 allowed @entity192 's voter identification law to stand in 2008 , saying the stated goal of stopping voter fraud was a legitimate exercise of legislative power .
