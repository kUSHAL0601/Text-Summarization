-- the string of attacks at the @entity3 in the past two weeks has sparked terrible memories of a week in august 1990 that sent a tsunami of fear through the student population and the city of @entity10
unlike the most recent attempted assaults around campus , the victims in 1990 did n't have a chance
for five students that year , assaults ended in dismemberment and death
the first attack happened the sunday before school started
@entity10 police were called to check on two students in their apartment
when they arrived , the scene horrified them
both @entity29 and @entity30 had been stabbed to death , one of them mutilated , her body posed in a sexually explicit manner
within 72 hours , five students were fatally stabbed , the crime scenes staged for dramatic effect
police soon surmised @entity10 had a serial killer in its midst and it appeared @entity3 students were his targets
i was a freshman back then and remember students being pulled out of school by their parents , who feared their children would be the killer 's next victim
the killer was entering students ' apartments , usually through sliding glass doors , as people slept
police said he was likely stalking his prey and was very meticulous , staging crime scenes and cleaning them up to avoid detection
there was a sense that no one was safe at night
every day the killer roamed free and gruesome details surfaced , a wave of fear swept across the city
gun stores began selling out , students traveled in groups or left campus entirely
the university even offered to reimburse tuition for those too afraid to return
eventually , we all learned and memorized the names of the five students killed : @entity30 , @entity29 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78
after @entity78 was killed , fear increased , because it became clear men would not be spared and were just as vulnerable
by the time the killer was caught and about to go to trial , i was nearing graduation
it happened that as a student journalist working at the university television and radio station , i ended up covering the trial
i was among those allowed to view the crime scene photos that were entered into evidence
i have never been able to get those scenes out of my head
the worst : a picture of a victim 's body on a bed with her severed head staring down from a bookshelf
it is the stuff of nightmares
they were haunting , purposely theatrical photos that were pornographic in nature due to the positioning of the bodies
all of them seemed to be scenes from a horror film too gruesome to make
" i was here then , " @entity3 vice president of student affairs @entity111 said of those difficult days in 1990
" this community came together , unified and i really think that the closeness that was forged during that terrible time really is what you are seeing today
" this is a campus that never forgets
long after serial killer @entity119 confessed to the killings and was executed by the state in 2006 , a memorial to the five students he killed remains .
