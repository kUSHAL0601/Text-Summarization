at first blush , the biography of @entity2 actress @entity1 could read very much like my own
@entity1 is a working actress who supports social causes in her time away from set
the difference ? in october , @entity1 was sentenced to 18 months in prison for her peaceful activism
in this regard , she is just the latest in a string of filmmakers and actors of @entity2 cinema -- including acclaimed filmmakers @entity15 and @entity17 and actor @entity18 -- to be arrested or sentenced to lengthy prison terms in recent years
@entity15 and @entity17 each were sentenced to prison -- the former for six years and the latter for five -- and banned from filmmaking for 20 years , accused of making " anti-regime propaganda
" @entity18 , a prominent actor , was sentenced to prison after he was arrested in anti-government protests
many more have been arrested and jailed
in my role as a spokesperson for @entity30 and as a supporter of various charitable causes including @entity33 , a campaign to release prisoners of conscience in @entity33 , i have never been faced with the threat of intimidation or arrest
indeed , i can not even fathom that speaking out for the most vulnerable in society and those locked up for peaceful expression and activities would , in turn , be grounds for my own detention and arrest by government authorities
a celebrated and hugely popular actress in her native @entity33 , @entity1 first landed on the radar of the @entity2 authorities for her open support of opposition figure @entity53 , which led to her arrest in july 2009 in the aftermath of a disputed presidential election in @entity33
another arrest in july 2011 followed , as well as a ban on her leaving the country
now she has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for " acting against national security and links to foreign media
" the idea that an actress -- mostly lauded for her performances in more than a dozen films -- somehow represents a threat to @entity33 's national security is laughable at best
but in @entity1 's case , far from anything humorous , the allegations have actually resulted in the sober prospect of real prison time
ironically , @entity1 's sentence was handed down just a month after the reopening of the @entity78 in @entity79 , which had been unceremoniously ordered to shut its doors during the tenure of former president @entity82
although the reopening was welcomed by many as a delivery of one of the promises that president @entity89 made on the campaign trail to increase cultural freedoms for @entity2 , the reality is that artists such as @entity1 , rapper @entity93 and poets @entity94 and @entity96 -- who were arrested in december and later released -- continue to come under fire for their peaceful exercise of creative expression
and it 's not only artists who languish in @entity33 's prisons
according to @entity33 's reporting , at least 845 people are prisoners of conscience in @entity33 , jailed for the peaceful exercise of their lifestyle , beliefs or profession
the list of hundreds includes lawyers , students , bloggers , journalists , labor union activists and political opponents
the crisis is so acute that @entity119 secretary general ban ki - moon recently admonished the @entity2 government for continuing to jail a large number of political prisoners
and just last month , the mandate of a @entity119 expert assessing @entity33 's human rights record was renewed for yet another year because of the chronic nature of human rights abuses in the country
aside from all the reports of abuses , it is an odd thing when your counterpart in another society has experiences that are directly opposite to your own
my human rights activism has been widely met with encouragement and support
ahangarani should earn plaudits , not only for her cinematic achievements , but also for her humanitarian deeds and her commitment to increased rights and freedoms for all
she should not be intimidated and silenced with the threat of a lengthy prison sentence looming over her head
@entity141 's only " crime " is that she dared be an agent of change and speak out in support of women and young people
the @entity2 leadership is keen to prove that it is ready to engage with the international community , both on resolution of the nuclear issue in ongoing negotiations and renewal of economic ties
in addition to these concerns , human rights should be made an equal priority
a good first step would be the unconditional pardon of the 843 prisoners of rights and the hundreds of others , such as @entity1 , who are waiting to serve out their sentences
@entity177 , and all those risking their own freedom to ensure the rights of others , are national treasures , not national traitors .
