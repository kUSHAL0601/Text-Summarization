-- wind power provides a fifth of @entity4 's electricity , most of it generated by giant wind farms built on land and in the country 's coastal waters
but the tiny @entity4 island of @entity12 is proving bigger is n't necessarily better by generating all its electricity using wind turbines of its own
nineteen miles off the coast of mainland @entity4 , 91 turbines reach 114 meters above the turbulent waters of the @entity20
together they form @entity22 , the world 's biggest offshore wind farm , which can generate enough electrify to power 200,000 homes
@entity26 is ceo of @entity27 , which operates @entity22
he told @entity0 that @entity4 's trailblazing efforts in wind power are the result of the country 's energy crisis during the 1970s
" the @entity4 were totally dependant on oil imported from the @entity34
suddenly there was an embargo , so no oil
we learnt the lesson the hard way that you have to have diversified supplies of energy
" the @entity43 says wind power currently provides 1.5 percent of the world 's electricity
that 's a drop in the ocean , but as a clean and renewable source of energy , wind power is receiving support from governments around the world
" i have to admit that the reason there is a business is that there are some government subsidies attached to wind production , " said @entity26
" that goes for @entity4 and that goes for other @entity63 countries where we are doing wind operations
" the @entity67 government recently announced that its economic stimulus bill contributed to a 39 percent increase in the country 's wind power output last year , defying predictions that new wind energy output would decline because of harsh economic conditions
" small wind " is also being promoted , with governments encouraging individual households to produce their own wind power using micro turbines
the @entity67 offers a 30 percent investment tax credit to people who buy micro turbines
many other countries offer grants for installing turbines , as well as feed - in - tariff payments that allow individuals to sell the electricity they generate to their national grid network
are wind farms an underused source of clean energy , or a blot on the landscape ? leave your comments in the " @entity98 " box at the bottom of this article
when it comes to small - scale renewable energy , the @entity4 island of @entity12 -- population 4,000 -- is an example to the world
among its energy - production facilities are 11 one - megawatt turbines on the island itself and 10 more turbines within three miles of its coast
as well as using wind turbines to provide electricity , and straw - burning plants to provide heating , some islanders have solar panels on their roofs and others warm their homes using geothermal energy and the heat given off by fresh cow 's milk
@entity128 , of the @entity129 , told @entity0 , " 100 percent of our electricity comes from onshore turbines
about 75 percent of our heating comes from heating plants and private people who have changed their oil furnaces to something renewable
" then we have the offshore turbines , which compensate for what we use in fossil fuels , heating and transport
all in all we send more energy to the mainland than we use
" two of @entity12 's turbines are owned by a co-operative of around 450 of the island 's residents
" [ they ] are the most important ones because they are the turbines that give the normal guy on the island the opportunity of investing in turbines , " said @entity128
while the residents of @entity12 can take advantage of their island 's blustery weather , open spaces and low - population density to be carbon neutral , the success of wind energy on a global scale may come down to simple economics
@entity4 company @entity168 is the world 's biggest supplier of wind turbines
its president for @entity172 , @entity173 , told @entity0 , " we are very focused on providing the lowest cost of energy
with the present system we are competitive with oil at $ 50 a barrel
" there is an expectation that prices will come down as turbines become cheaper and bigger companies throw their buying power into developing wind farms
@entity26 told @entity0 , " our initiatives , small company that we are , whatever we do wo n't change the world
" but if we can be a good example so that some of the big guys will do some of the same things then the implications can be much bigger
" what do you think ? should we all try to live like the @entity12 islanders ? have your say by leaving a comment in the @entity201 off box below .
