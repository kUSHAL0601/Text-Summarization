-- there were triumph and tears , joy and sorrow at the @entity7 final between @entity8 and @entity9
but regardless of whichever team you were supporting , there were some moments sunday that were just bizarre
here are our top 5 : 1
good girl gone bad : @entity17 was so excited about @entity9 's win , she decided to give the crowd a celebratory flash
but let 's not get too excited , fellas : this was not the topless kind
the pop singer has been an avid fan of the @entity7 , and her tweeted commentary throughout the tournament rivaled @entity28 's
highlights include a picture of her scantily clad with the message : " for my @entity34 boys
" the team must have appreciated the gesture : they later brought the trophy to her
football diplomacy : world leaders take a little time off for sports , too
cameras caught @entity45 president @entity44 in deep conversation with @entity34 chancellor @entity47 at the @entity48 in @entity49
@entity47 was supporting the home team , which went on to beat @entity8 1 - 0 to win the @entity7
@entity44 was on a mission , too : @entity45 hosts the next @entity7 in 2018
and the winner of the @entity53 is ... : @entity54
the @entity34 team forward took some epic selfies after the game
and he did n't even play sunday ! if the first one was n't awesome enough , there 's a second
way to go , dude ! 4
because your kiss is on my list : @entity68 bless @entity69 -- and his cell phone
@entity69 captured footage of a streaker who rushed the field , belly out and all , and tried to kiss @entity9 's @entity76
let 's just say it was a case of unrequited love
" we 're going streaking ! everyone 's doing it
man that was hilarious , " @entity69 posted under the video on @entity85
the man , it turns out , is @entity45 prankster and viral video sensation @entity91 -- and he kind of hinted at his second - half shenanigan on @entity93 hours before the game
the message scrawled across his torso ? " @entity97
silver lining in @entity8 's loss : imagine if this guy -- and his rat tail -- had scored a winning goal
@entity8 's @entity103 came into the game toward the end and provided a hairy distraction during a long wait for a goal -- long enough for " rat tail " and # rattail to trend briefly
