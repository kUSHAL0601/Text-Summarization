@entity0 -- in recent years @entity2 has become a big deal in @entity0 , with locals and foreigners hitting up dozens of themed parties around the city in their wackiest costumes
some , however , seek out something truly macabre -- an authentic haunted house
among the freakier options in the city is a building simply called " no. 81
" unlike your average haunted house , found hidden in some dark alley or unlit street , this one sits on one of @entity0 's busiest thoroughfares -- @entity21 inner street
the area is famous for its @entity24 - style clubs , restaurants and concerts
but these days no. 81 has been giving the street a ghoulish boost due to its alleged ghostly residents
decrepit is kind of scary " the only word to describe that house is ' decrepit ' , " says @entity31 , a former resident of the neighborhood
" the broken windows , the crawling ivies ... not many people want to stop at that place
" the building has grown in infamy
@entity0 taxi drivers have no trouble finding it when you tell them you 're looking for the haunted house on @entity21
@entity45 mentions online have made it a popular site for young adventurers
" i came here to celebrate my birthday , " said a middle school girl visiting the building last week
" almost all of my friends have been here , and i thought it would be nice to come here for some fun , especially as @entity2 is approaching
" with theme parks getting more expensive , more young people are opting to get a " free ride " in the city 's old , broken buildings , ignoring ' @entity62 ! do not enter ' signs in the front
next to the " danger " sign at no. 81 , there 's a more intriguing handwritten warning on a window pane : " there are ghosts
" is the place even haunted ? building no. 81 was built in 1910 to serve as a language center and rest area
when the @entity76 was founded in 1949 , administrative departments moved in and used the building for offices
local resident @entity31 says that in the 2000s , the building was abandoned due to a lack of funding
over the last decade , it 's deteriorated to its current state , giving the building an eerie edge that 's led many to assume -- or hope -- that it 's haunted
where do the ghost tales come from ? various accounts are making the rounds , but the commonly accepted yarn has it that a number of people have unexpectedly died on the property , including workers , adventure - seekers and other innocents who for some reason or other made their way into the building
spooky as it all sounds , a recent @entity108 state - run news agency interview with local police attempted to clear up the rumors , saying no deaths were reported to have ever taken place in the building
meanwhile , the company that currently owns the building told @entity108 that its famously haunted space is n't actually haunted at all
ghosts or no ghosts , for young adventurers the place is still a spooky destination -- especially around @entity2
" i heard the building is going to be demolished or renovated soon , " said one student who recently visited the site
" i 'm not sure if it 's true , but i really wanted to take a look before it changes
" not freaky enough for you ? other ghoulish options in the @entity76 capital include a haunted walking tour or the @entity0 ghosts tour
