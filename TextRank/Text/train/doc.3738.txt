-- @entity2 's ' 90s sitcom " @entity3 " had one of the best tv bromances of our time , but the bond between @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity12 's @entity11 was n't part of the original plan
had the production team behind the ' 90s coming - of - age comedy had their way , @entity10 's @entity9 , the precocious middle child of a loving middle - class family , would 've had more male friends instead of his singular bff , @entity12 's floppy - haired @entity11
" if you watch the first five episodes , there 's always another kid there and it 's a different kid every episode , " @entity12 , now 33 , recalled in an interview with @entity0
" they kept trying to have another best friend , they really wanted @entity9 to have two best friends ... and it just was n't working -- i think they wanted this feeling of ' @entity9 's gang , ' and it just never quite clicked
" strong , of course , had already been cast as the mischievous , lady - loving underachiever that became a teen heartthrob , a part that " @entity3 " co-creator @entity43 knew was destined to be the actor 's from his first read
but the comedic ( and heartfelt ) magic that was @entity9 and @entity11 's friendship was n't as obvious
and then , around a quarter into that first season , @entity12 was given the opportunity to make @entity11 a bigger character
" there was this kid who unfortunately got fired in the middle of the week because it just was n't working , and they gave me all of his lines and just made it @entity9 and @entity11 , " @entity12 said
" that same week , @entity57 ( @entity58 ) came in as @entity3
that week everything clicked , and we were all like , ' oh , this is the show
' " for those who are obsessive about " @entity3 , " which aired from 1993 to 2000 , @entity12 pinpoints this fateful moment as " the episode where @entity10 straightens his hair
" as the show stretched on , the " bromance " between @entity10 and @entity12 became part of its foundation , both to the creative team and the stars themselves
" as actors , @entity10 and i really clicked , and it 's that kind of connection that you so rarely find with an actor with somebody else , this preternatural connection , " @entity12 said
" this confidence that we always had in each other that we would never let each other down as actors
it 's still to this day one of the greatest working relationships of my life
" @entity92 's best bromances ironically , @entity12 never imagined that he 'd ever make it beyond the pilot , let alone a seventh season
when he first landed the gig , the idea of being part of a show for six or seven years seemed like a lifetime
in essence , the show has even outlived its own cancellation
it 's been 13 years since the series wrapped , but " @entity3 " still airs regularly , and hardcore fans can own the entire series , now on @entity108 as a boxed collection for the first time
the passion for the @entity9 family and the characters who floated into their lives has produced a spinoff
in 2014 , @entity43 will reunite with @entity10 and @entity117 , whose characters have moved on from being high school sweethearts to parents , for a @entity122 series called " @entity123
" although the premise is centered on a new generation , the spinoff is a ca n't - miss for fans of " @entity3
" strong does n't currently have an official involvement with " @entity123 , " but he believes that @entity11 will probably show up at some point
" i 'm very much in conversation with @entity43 , " said @entity12 who said he is writing and directing , not acting , at the moment
if @entity11 were to make an appearance , though , he unfortunately would n't still be wearing his original famed leather jacket
strong could n't resist taking the item -- as crucial to @entity11 's character as his long hair -- when he moved to @entity139 after " @entity3 " ended
" i stole the jacket from the show -- @entity122 would n't let us take anything , but i had a leather jacket that i had bought on my own , and i swapped it , " @entity12 said
ironically , the jacket was eventually stolen from his car , @entity12 said
strong has great memories of the set
" it was a ridiculously tight group of people
... between @entity10 ( @entity154 ) , will ( @entity153 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 ) and me , it was like the goal of everyday became , can we please stop laughing long enough to get through this scene , because we 're having so much fun , " @entity12 said
somehow , in the years since they filmed their series finale , the cast has also managed to evade the dreaded @entity163 : post @entity164
photos : child star transformations for that , the actor - turned - filmmaker likes to give credit to both his grounded upbringing , and another child star who did n't self - destruct : @entity10 's older brother , " @entity175 ' " @entity154
" i always give credit to @entity154 , because he was ahead of us and very close to us but he had been through such a high level of fame , " @entity12 said
" by the time we started ' @entity3 , ' he was already going to @entity180
there was just this sense of : ' hey , school 's important
you do n't have to be the most famous person in the world and make a crapload of money
there are more important things in life
