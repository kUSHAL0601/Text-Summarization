-- some companies find their niche and stick to it
others , though , have to adapt to changing markets in order to thrive
here 's a look at some companies that switched industries at some point in their histories , usually for the better
@entity12 's may know how to prettily wrap jewelry because the company began in the paper business
@entity16 @entity17 started @entity16 in 1886 without really meaning to
@entity18 sold books door - to - door , but to lure in female customers he offered little gifts of perfume
before long , the perfume @entity18 was giving away had become more popular than the books he was selling , so he shifted focus and founded the @entity16 , which later became @entity16
@entity31 the telecom giant got its start in @entity34 in 1865 , when @entity35 opened a pulp mill and started making paper on the banks of @entity39
the company later bounced around a number of industries before getting serious about phones in the 1960s
@entity45 when the @entity45 's founders opened their business in @entity49 , @entity45 , in 1902 , they were n't selling @entity50
the partners originally planned to sell the mineral corundum , an important ingredient in building grinding wheels , directly to manufacturers
@entity56 the sprawling holding company helmed by @entity58 was originally a textile manufacturer that took off in 1839
@entity58 took control in 1962 , though , and by 1967 he started to move outside of textiles into insurance and other sectors
@entity0 : @entity63 , @entity64 and what else @entity58 owns 5
@entity66 like @entity16 , the chewing gum company got its start with a popular freebie
@entity70 founded the company in 1891 with the goal of selling soap and baking powder
he offered chewing gum as an enticement to his customers , and eventually the customers did n't care about the baking powder ; they only wanted the gum
@entity12 the jewelry and silverware hot bed was originally a stationer called @entity12 , @entity85 , and @entity86 when it started in 1837
in 1853 @entity12 switched its core business and began focusing on jewelry
@entity88 the defunct electronics corporation actually began as a leather goods company in @entity91 in 1932
in the early days it was known as the @entity88 , which was later shortened to " @entity88
@entity93 the company behind @entity95 and @entity96 began in 1923 as @entity93
the titular brothers did n't make toys , though ; they sold textile remnants
their business gradually shifted into school supplies before making the leap to toys after the 1952 introduction of mr. @entity105

founder @entity118 initially manufactured soap , candles , and starch
@entity122 when @entity122 got off the ground in 1906 , it was as a maker of photographic paper and photography equipment called the @entity128
the company did n't introduce what we would think of as a copier until the @entity122 made its debut in 1959
@entity134 the man behind the giant fleet of green tractors got his start as a blacksmith in @entity140 , @entity141
after struggling to make plows that could cut through the area 's tough clay , @entity134 hit on the idea of building plows out of cast steel , and his blacksmith gig gave way to a booming farm - supply business
@entity150 remember the @entity150 from the last time you played @entity152 ? the company still ( sort of ) exists ! the @entity150 got out of the railroad business in 1976 but was reborn as @entity150 , which operates movie theaters mainly in @entity156 , @entity157 , and the @entity159 mental floss : 11 things @entity161 has banned 14
@entity162 when @entity164 founded the clothing store in 1892 in @entity166 , he was n't dreaming of clothing high school and college students everywhere
