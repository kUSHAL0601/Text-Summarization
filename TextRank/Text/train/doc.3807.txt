-- a decision by world - renowned physicist @entity2 not to attend a conference in @entity5 in support of an academic boycott of the country has sparked controversy in @entity5 and a vitriolic debate online
@entity2 , who 's a professor at @entity12 's @entity11 , had initially accepted an invitation to the high - profile @entity14 , taking place in @entity17 in june
his change of heart this week appears to be the result of pressure from @entity22 academics to abide by a boycott set up in protest over @entity5 's occupation of @entity22 territory
" a letter was sent on friday to the @entity5 president 's office from @entity2 regarding his decision not to attend the @entity14 , based on advice from @entity22 academics that he should respect the boycott , " a @entity11 spokesman told @entity0 on thursday
@entity2 is also unable currently to fly for health reasons , the spokesman said
@entity11 initially said @entity2 's poor health was the reason he was no longer attending , according to local media reports
@entity2 , who is quadriplegic as a result of an incurable degenerative disease , has had repeated health problems
@entity2 's letter said he had first accepted the invitation " to express my opinion on the prospects for a peace settlement but also because it would allow me to lecture on the @entity48 , " the conference organizers said
his decision to boycott the conference , hosted by @entity5 president @entity50 , a @entity51 peace laureate , has prompted a " @entity52
" some tweeters accuse him of anti-semitism or comment on his physical disabilities , while others applaud his support for the @entity22 academics
one tweeter , @entity60 , observes : " amazing how many @entity5 on @entity61 want @entity2 dead , electrocuted or made to suffer in other nasty ways
" @entity64 writer @entity63 , who describes himself as a " political junkie , proud father , concerned @entity5 , veteran journalist , " tweets : " my take : @entity70 is now the academic boycott movement 's unlikely poster boy
" ' outrageous and improper ' @entity72 , chairman of the @entity14 , said @entity2 's decision to pull out of the event was wrong
" the academic boycott against @entity5 is in our view outrageous and improper , certainly for someone for whom the spirit of liberty lies at the basis of his human and academic mission , " he said in a statement
" @entity5 is a democracy in which all individuals are free to express their opinions , whatever they may be
the imposition of a boycott is incompatible with open , democratic dialogue
" some 5,000 people from around the world are expected to attend , @entity72 said , to hear speakers who include global technology company executives , academics , @entity51 laureates , artists and past and present world leaders
former @entity102 president @entity101 , @entity99 - era president @entity98 and former @entity12 prime minister @entity100 are all expected to attend , he added
@entity2 , who 's also a cosmologist , astronomer and mathematician , is the author of books including the best - seller , " @entity106 : from the @entity107 to @entity108
" the @entity110 movement was established in 2005 by @entity22 civil society groups , which called for international groups and " people of conscience " to boycott or put pressure on @entity5 " until it complies with international law and @entity22 rights
" @entity119 , one of the founding members of the movement , told @entity0 : " @entity2 is the most prominent academic today to respect the @entity22 boycott guidelines and to refuse to visit @entity5
this reminds us of the moral weight of academics in the boycott of apartheid of @entity129
" he said @entity2 had been convinced by the " unanimous @entity22 voice " he heard from his contacts within the @entity22 community
" there is deep appreciation among the @entity22 for professor @entity2 's respecting the boycott , and we sincerely hope that we convince many hesitant academics to follow suit and to shoulder a moral responsibility of boycotting @entity5 until it complies with international law , " @entity119 said
the @entity140 reports that @entity2 has visited @entity5 four times , most recently in 2006 , when he lectured at @entity5 and @entity22 universities
@entity48 housing @entity5 's government gave initial approval wednesday to plans to build 296 housing units in the settlement of @entity149 , near the @entity48 city of @entity151
@entity154 president @entity153 strongly condemned the decision , the official @entity22 news agency @entity152 said thursday
presidential spokesman @entity157 , in a media statement quoted by @entity152 , said the @entity5 move would sabotage the peace process and efforts made by the @entity102 administration to move it forward
a @entity164 report in january said @entity5 settlements had taken a " heavy toll " on the rights and sovereignty of @entity22
it outlined the consistent violation of @entity22 ' rights in what it called a " creeping annexation " by @entity5 in @entity17 and the @entity48
palestinians welcomed the report 's findings , but @entity5 , which considers the @entity178 to be biased , said the report would hurt the peace process
there are about 250 settlements in the @entity48 and @entity17 , the report said , all started since @entity5 seized the lands after the @entity183 in 1967
@entity5 's consistently growing presence in @entity17 and the @entity48 has caused great tension between @entity5 and the @entity187 world , including @entity22
@entity5 says its presence is needed for security
@entity0 's @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 contributed to this report .
