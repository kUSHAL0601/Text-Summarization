-- some people drove hours to see a cute little 18 - pound ball of fur
saturday was debut day for little @entity5 the panda at the @entity7 in @entity8
at this stage of her life , 5 - month - old @entity5 's hobbies are mainly eating bamboo and lounging
she is cautious like her mother and pretty laid back , @entity0 affiliate @entity14 reported , citing a zoo official
@entity5 ( pronounced bow - bow ) inspired lengthy lines , but visitors like @entity21 and her family said the three - hour drive worth it
" we frequent @entity27 's zoo
this is something you just ca n't see there , " she told @entity14
a note on the zoo 's website says @entity5 may not always be visible during visiting hours because she and her mother , @entity36 , will have access to the privacy of their den , where @entity5 has spent most of her time until now
on saturday , a zoo employee carried the cub out to meet the public and press
@entity5 means " precious " or " treasure " in @entity47
cute alert as @entity50 's first giant panda cub goes on show thanks to science , there are more baby pandas
