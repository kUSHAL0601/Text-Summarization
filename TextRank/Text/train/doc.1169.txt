-- his fans are literally throwing money at him
the @entity5 artist , activist and @entity8 sensation @entity7 has collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from fans who want to help him pay back taxes of $ 2.3 million
many are simply throwing the money into his @entity14 compound
" his supporters have folded 100 yuan notes -- the equivalent of $ 15.75 -- into paper airplanes that glided into the compound
others wrapped the money around pieces of fruit and hurled it over the wall , " the @entity20 wrote on its @entity22 blog
" or more traditionally @entity5 , they stuffed it into red envelopes
" @entity7 pays $ 1.3m tax bond over jail fears if you 're not one of his 110,000 @entity35 followers , you may never have heard of @entity7
but the architect who designed the @entity37 for the @entity38 in 2008 has become one of @entity5 's most noted political dissidents and online activists
at the recent @entity43 conference in @entity44 , @entity0 sat down with @entity45 , who spent several years following @entity7 for an upcoming documentary called " @entity7 : never sorry , " to learn more about his fame in @entity5 and his mastery of the @entity8
" the truth is i do n't believe it 's his art -- in terms of what 's shown in a museum -- that may have put him in the position that he 's in , " @entity45 said , referring to @entity7 's three - month detention , which ended in june , and the fact that he 's been targeted by @entity5 authorities as a dissident
" it 's really about how his life is his art. it 's about his activities , how he gives interviews very freely
he does not self - censor what he thinks , " she said
" it 's also the organizing he 's done online
part of his art includes underground documentaries that he films with collaborators and posts online for free
they have to do with the questions and conversation that he curates online -- first on his blog , until it was shut down , and now on @entity35
" @entity7 was able to use the @entity8 , to a degree , to circumvent authorities , she said
" in a society where all official media is subject to censorship -- from micro-blogs up to party papers -- that 's also an incredibly subversive thing to be able to connect to people , " @entity45 said
" and the truth is censorship can not be an all - knowing eye , and people are having very interesting conversations even within the firewall -- and on @entity35 , which is blocked in @entity5 , so people have to use technology to go outside the firewall
" @entity7 came late to technology but adopted it with gusto , she said
" @entity7 never used a computer -- never really knew how to type -- before 2005 , " she said
" and in 2005 he was invited by @entity106 , which is a big internet company in @entity5 , to have a celebrity blog
he was a well - known architect and artist , and he decided to take that on
his father was also a poet , so he was also interested in seeing how his writing chops or his literary chops were
and he immediately was drawn to the medium
he 's always been looking for ways to communicate -- and suddenly he saw the @entity8
" last year , @entity45 asked @entity7 about the biggest paradigm shift in his life
" his answer to me was the internet
' the internet is what affected me and has opened up so many doors and has ignited me
" now , as i 'm completing the documentary ... i really understand what that means
