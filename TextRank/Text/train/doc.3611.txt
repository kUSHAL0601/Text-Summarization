@entity2 threatened tuesday to nullify the armistice agreement that ended the @entity4 in 1953 , citing @entity6 - led international moves to impose new sanctions against it over its recent nuclear test , the @entity1 's official news agency @entity0 reported
@entity12 's military said it will also cut off direct phone links with @entity14 at the inter-korean border village of @entity16 , @entity0 added
@entity17 : how worried should we be about @entity2 's nuclear test ? @entity1 have technically been at war for decades
the 1950 - 53 civil war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty
this is not the first time @entity12 's rhetoric has written off the armistice
in the aftermath of a previous nuclear test in 2009 , it said its military would no longer be bound by the agreement because @entity14 was joining a @entity6 - led anti-proliferation plan
the @entity1 's latest threat comes amid new international efforts to clamp down on its weapons program
a draft @entity6 resolution to authorize more sanctions against @entity12 in response to its controversial nuclear test was formally introduced tuesday at the @entity44 by @entity6 ambassador @entity45
a senior @entity47 administration official earlier told @entity48 that the @entity6 and @entity49 , a key @entity2 ally , had reached a tentative deal on the wording of the proposed resolution
the two nations had been negotiating for weeks on the question
according to a @entity44 diplomat familiar with the negotiations , the draft resolution contains sanctions targeting specific technology known to be used for uranium enrichment
these new sanctions go beyond those contained in existing resolutions
the draft sanctions resolution also includes restrictions on a list of luxury goods such as jewelry , yachts , luxury automobiles and racing cars , according to the diplomat
these are specifically singling out the interests of the regime 's ruling elite
some luxury goods had already been banned by a @entity44 resolution prompted by @entity2 's first nuclear test in 2006
for the first time , the @entity44 would be pressuring @entity2 diplomatic personnel , calling for vigilance on diplomats engaged in illicit activities such as moving large amounts of cash across borders
the draft sanctions resolution would aim to stop @entity2 officials using diplomatic pouches to bring money back to @entity2 , according to the person familiar with the negotiations
a vote on the resolution is expected later this week
the diplomat said the @entity6 and @entity49 are satisfied with the text and see it as balanced and appropriate
the members of the @entity44 may make minor technical changes , but no major changes to the resolution are expected
' @entity102 moves ' there has been major concern in recent years among world powers about @entity2 's nuclear aspirations
timeline : @entity2 's rocket - fueled obsession @entity12 continues to make " belligerent and reckless moves that threaten the region , their neighbors and now , directly , the @entity6 , " @entity6 secretary of state @entity113 said in a @entity48 interview tuesday
" it 's very easy for @entity116 to prove his good intent here also
just do n't fire the next missile
do n't have the next test
just say you 're ready to talk , " said @entity113 , speaking on the last full day of his first international trip as the nation 's top diplomat
@entity116 is @entity2 's leader
addressing reporters later in @entity126 , @entity113 again put the onus on @entity116 to act , saying , " the @entity6 people and the world " would like to see him " take responsible actions " for peace
" rather than threaten to abrogate and threaten to move in some new direction , the world would be better served " if @entity116 tried to engage in legitimate dialogue , @entity113 said
" our preference is not to brandish threats to each other
it 's to get to the table " to negotiate , he said
as a permanent member of the @entity44 with veto power , @entity49 can strongly influence the body 's decisions and has previously resisted strong sanctions on the @entity116 regime , which it props up economically
the two communist countries have been close allies since @entity49 supported the @entity1 with materiel and troops in the @entity4
the @entity6 backed the @entity14 in the conflict , fighting side by side with its troops
in pictures : rare glimpse inside @entity2 analysts say @entity158 wants to maintain the @entity1 as a buffer between its border and @entity14 , a @entity6 ally
@entity158 's government on tuesday said it strives for a " nuclear free peninsula
" it repeated its support for the @entity44 's condemnation of @entity2 's nuclear tests but also called for a muted response to it
' paying the price ' @entity170 , director of the non-proliferation and @entity172 at the @entity174 - based @entity173 , told @entity48 that while the resolution will probably not be too onerous , the fact that @entity49 went along with another @entity44 sanctions measure against @entity2 reflects the growing anger and disillusionment that @entity158 feels toward its supposed ally
" @entity116 is now paying the price for going ahead with a nuclear test despite @entity49 warnings not to create trouble during the political transition that has been under way in @entity158 the past year , " @entity181 said
" the real question , though , is the degree to which @entity49 will be willing to implement the @entity44 sanctions and to impose punishment of its own
" a sharp drop in @entity49 grain sales to @entity2 in january may be a sign that @entity49 's support for @entity44 sanctions is more than just a symbolic punishment
" @entity181 characterized @entity2 's reported threat to nullify the 1953 armistice as " largely bluster , " pointing out that the country has " broken the armistice many times , most recently in 2010 by sinking a @entity14 corvette and shelling a @entity14 - populated island
" but , he added , " the threat does point to more trouble to come from the recalcitrant hermit kingdom
things are going to get worse before they get better
" military exercises @entity12 said the underground nuclear blast it conducted on february 12 was more powerful than its two previous detonations and used a smaller , lighter device , suggesting advances in its weapons program
it was the first nuclear test the isolated state has carried out since its young leader inherited power in december 2011 after the death of his father , @entity223 , who made building up @entity2 's military strength the focus of his 17 - year rule
like the regime 's previous tests in 2006 and 2009 , the move prompted widespread international condemnation , as well as a promise of tough action at the @entity233
a @entity235 response to @entity2 's latest challenge @entity2 's government regularly rails against sanctions imposed on it
the staging this week of joint @entity6 - @entity14 military exercises , known as @entity241 , has added to the simmering tensions , @entity0 reported monday
it described the training exercises as " an open declaration of a war " in the face of repeated warnings from the @entity1 that they should not be held
the exercises have " touched off the pent - up resentment of the service personnel and people of ( @entity2 ) and compelled them to harden their pledge to take thousand-fold retaliation against the enemies , " the news agency said
but the @entity14 military warned wednesday that it would respond strongly to any attack from its northern neighbor
" if @entity2 goes ahead with provocations and threatens the lives and safety of @entity14 , our military will strongly and sternly retaliate against the command and its supporting forces , " maj. gen. @entity259 , a senior official at the @entity260 , said at a news conference , according to the semiofficial news agency @entity262
@entity116 said @entity14 notified the @entity269 that the drills with the @entity6 " are defensive in nature
