the whereabouts of ousted @entity2 prime minister @entity1 were a mystery wednesday after he flew out of the country the night before , despite a prosecutor 's order he not leave after his removal from office
@entity1 was in @entity9 late tuesday on a refueling stop for about two hours while en route to " another @entity13 country , " @entity9 prime minister @entity11 said in televised remarks
as of wednesday , it was unclear which country that was or if he had arrived there
@entity2 's acting prime minister and minister of defense @entity19 told reporters wednesday that -- despite the prosecutor 's order -- there was no ban and @entity1 was free to leave
" if there is a warrant ... if he is wanted by the judiciary , he can return and be held accountable according to the law and international norms
and this is not considered fleeing , " @entity19 said , contradicting an earlier statement from the @entity30
hours earlier , the @entity34 country 's parliament dismissed the prime minister after rebels in eastern @entity2 said a tanker loaded with oil from a port under their control escaped a naval blockade and moved into international waters
@entity2 's prosecutor general said in @entity44 he had banned @entity1 from traveling abroad because of an investigation relating to a payment the government allegedly made last year to an armed group blocking oil ports in the east
a copy of the travel ban , dated march 11 , was posted on his press office 's facebook page marked " urgent and important
" " we order placing the aforementioned in the monitoring database and banning him from travel until he appears for the investigation , " said the order , addressed to the head of @entity2 's immigration department
oil chaos the vote of no - confidence came after @entity1 's failure to stop rebels from exporting oil independently , the latest challenge in the vast desert nation 's bumpy transition
the @entity2 government said late monday it had taken control of the @entity76 - flagged tanker , @entity77 , as it tried to leave the @entity78 in eastern @entity2 , and after having briefly exchanged fire with rebels
however , in a sign of the chaos and conflicting information typical for @entity2 , the rebels rejected the assertion
on wednesday , @entity19 said the tanker was at sea where @entity2 military forces fired on it until they were called off by the @entity88 for fear of an environmental disaster
the oil tanker managed to sail away despite a fire on board , he said
a spokesman for @entity96 's military , col. @entity97 , said on wednesday that its navy will monitor @entity96 waters for the oil tanker
if the @entity96 navy finds the @entity77 in @entity96 waters , authorities will demand to board and inspect the vessel to verify that the ship 's cargo is legal and properly authorized , @entity97 said
@entity96 authorities will detain the ship if they find it to be violating of any laws or regulations
a @entity76 state news agency said that while the ship had been temporarily flagged in @entity76 , it is operated by the @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity96
@entity116 also wrote that @entity76 notified the @entity117 that the ship owners had violated @entity76 law
it said @entity121 had canceled and deleted the ship 's registry
oil slump oil production , @entity2 's economic lifeline , has slowed to a trickle since the summer as armed protesters have seized oil ports and oil fields to press political and financial demands
oil revenue in the first two months of the year was only 16 % of what was expected in the budget , deputy oil minister @entity132 said
they are seeking a greater share of the country 's oil revenue , as well as autonomy for eastern @entity2
@entity141 said the military would not fight the protesters in the ports
" there will be no use of force against @entity2 citizens , " he said
the conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears @entity2 may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped oust @entity155 in 2011 but now do as they please
the removal of @entity1 , a liberal weakened for months by infighting with @entity159 , deepens the turmoil in the country of 6 million people .
