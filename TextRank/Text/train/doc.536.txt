-- the $ 100 million lawsuit spurred by @entity3 's dramatic firing from his hit @entity8 sitcom earlier this year has been settled " to the parties ' mutual satisfaction , " @entity1 and @entity3 's attorney said monday
@entity1 and producer @entity11 fired @entity3 from " @entity12 " in march , after a two - week public meltdown by the star that included attacks on @entity11
@entity3 sued them for $ 100 million , accusing them of breaking his contract , which paid him a reported $ 1.2 million an episode
" the pending lawsuit and arbitration will be dismissed as to all parties , " the studio said
" the parties have agreed to maintain confidentiality over the terms of the settlement
" @entity3 's attorney , @entity28 , echoed that , telling @entity0 , " the matter has been settled to the parties ' mutual satisfaction
" @entity3 had wanted a public court trial , but a @entity34 judge ruled in june that the arbitration clause in @entity3 's contract required the legal dispute to be considered by a private arbitrator , not a judge
@entity3 's character was killed off in the new season that started this month and @entity42 was added to the sitcom 's cast .
