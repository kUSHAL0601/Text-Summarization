-- the increasing amount of personal information that can been gleaned by computer programs that track how people use @entity5 has been revealed by an extensive academic study
such programmes can discern undisclosed private information such as @entity5 users ' sexuality , drug - use habits and even whether their parents separated when they were young , according to the study by @entity15 university academics
in one of the biggest studies of its kind , scientists from the university 's psychometrics team and a @entity20 - funded research centre analysed data from 58,000 @entity5 users to predict traits and other information that were not provided in their profiles
the algorithms were 88 per cent accurate in predicting male sexual orientation , 95 per cent for race and 80 per cent for religion and political leanings
personality types and emotional stability were also predicted with accuracy ranging from 62 - 75 per cent
the study highlights growing concerns about social networks and how data trails can be mined for sensitive information , even when people attempt to keep information about themselves private
less than 5 per cent of users predicted to be gay , for example , were connected with explicitly gay groups
@entity48 , one of the report 's authors , told the @entity0 that the university 's techniques could easily be replicated by companies to infer personal attributes a person did not wish to share , such as sexual orientation or political views : " we used very simple and generic methods
marketing companies and internet companies could spend much more time and resources , and hence get much higher accuracy than we did
" last week , the @entity64 agreed to water down proposals for a radical overhaul of data privacy regulation
the move reflects governments ' reluctance to impede internet businesses that might spur economic growth , and follows fierce lobbying from technology companies including @entity5 and @entity75
personal data has become big business
@entity78 , the @entity80 online lender , makes credit judgments within seconds based on thousands of pieces of information , including an applicant 's @entity5 profile
@entity87 , the supermarket chain , this month started to use its customers ' shopping histories to sell targeted online advertising
the report also revealed some unexpected correlations -- such as people who liked ' curly fries ' having higher iqs , while those who like @entity5 's " sliding on @entity97 " page were unlikely to use drugs
mr @entity99 said , however , that the study was not designed to discourage online sharing : " i would discourage people from abstaining from the technology -- the milk is to some extent already spilt and there 's a lot of information about you online anyway
i would suggest raising privacy settings and exerting consumer pressure by trying to use the services that are protecting your privacy best
