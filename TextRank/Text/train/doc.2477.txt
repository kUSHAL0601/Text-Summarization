-- @entity1 is taking its rewards program from what one industry expert calls " anemic " to competitive with the unveiling of an improved @entity6
" this is very big , " @entity7 , editor - at - large for @entity9 said of the changes , which are aimed at making it easier for members to earn and redeem points
" this move by @entity1 is going to prompt a lot of internal discussion at the major airlines about what it means to them , what their competitive response should be and then so on , " @entity7 said
one of the key changes in @entity6 is that members can now redeem points on every seat , every day and on every flight with no blackout dates or seat restrictions
as long as members fly or use a partner once every two years , their points will never expire
the changes , which will officially launch on march 1 , will improve on @entity1 's current rewards program , according to a press release on @entity1 's website
" we took our award - winning program and made it even better by giving our members more flexibility and control over how and when they earn and redeem their points , " @entity36 , @entity1 's chairman , president and ceo , said in the press release
" we know our customers are going to appreciate the fact that their points do n't expire and every seat on every flight is a reward seat
" @entity50 began on improving @entity1 's frequent - flier program several years ago , and @entity52 , senior director of customer loyalty and partnerships for @entity1 , called it the " single biggest new product launch in our company 's history , " in a blog post he wrote on the airline 's website
" we conducted months of customer surveys , focus groups , and research to find out what travelers like about our current program , what they do n't like , and what they 'd like to see changed , " @entity52 wrote
@entity6 members earn points based on the price of the flight and the type of fare purchased
for example , a one - way anytime flight from @entity76 , @entity77 , to @entity78 , @entity79 , would cost $ 257 and leave the passenger with 2,570 points , according to the point simulator on @entity1 's website
flying business select on that same flight would give the member 3,324 points and flying @entity89 would garner 948 points
buying a roundtrip ticket doubles those points
to figure out when you 'll be able to redeem a free flight , take your total amount of points and divide by 120 , 100 or 60 , depending on which fare type you plan to purchase
earn or use points at least once every 24 months , and you 'll keep your points forever ; a perk that @entity7 said is a huge improvement from @entity1 's current system , which erases any points not used within two years
" you had to earn 16 credits in 24 months , or else there was really no point of participating in the program at all , " he said
" the credits would be falling off the back end as you 're earning them on the front end
" by changing the way rewards are calculated -- by revenue rather than miles -- @entity1 is going in a direction that other airlines will be hard - pressed to follow
@entity1 ' frequent - flier programs are enormous , and tie in with other processes and services that the airlines offer , @entity7 said
they 'd have to redo reservations software and websites and retrain employees to go to a different system
" it 's an enormous top - to - bottom undertaking , " @entity7 said
" i just do n't think that 's in the cards for other airlines right now
