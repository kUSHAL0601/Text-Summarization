contents : the blood of the late , soon - to - be - canonized pope @entity5 if found , please notify @entity7 police and the church of @entity9
officers from the @entity11 , @entity7 's military police , plan to comb the nearby mountains where @entity5 used to vacation before his death in 2005 , hoping to find tracks in the snow that will lead them to whoever broke into the church and stole the item over the weekend , @entity11 col. @entity10 said
but investigators are also searching for the relic -- which holds a square bloodstained piece of cloth about 2 cm ( 3/4 inch ) -- all over @entity7 , he said
the relic and a golden cross were the only things stolen from @entity9 , located near the city of @entity31 in the @entity33 region , church members said
@entity34 , who helped restore the church , said the sanctuary was closed friday and saturday because of bad weather
@entity34 suggested the thieves were looking specifically for the relic , since nothing else was touched -- not even the boxes that hold money for charity
@entity5 's former secretary , cardinal @entity43 , gave the relic to the church in 2011 " to thank us for all that we did " for the visiting pontiff , said @entity34 's daughter @entity48
" i think it was stolen by someone very faithful to @entity5 , " she said
" really , i ca n't imagine who the thieves are
my only wish is that the relic is returned to us as soon as possible
" @entity10 would n't comment on any possible motive for the theft
he said more than 50 carabinieri will be out searching tuesday if the weather improves
@entity5 led the @entity60 for more than 26 years
