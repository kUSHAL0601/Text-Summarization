as the surviving @entity12 bombing suspect lay in a prison hospital bed , investigators 90 miles away spent friday combing a dump for his laptop and other clues that could shed light on the young men purportedly behind the bloody attack , a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said
information from @entity16 himself spurred authorities to look through the @entity20 , @entity21 , landfill , the official told @entity23 's @entity22
others who may have knowledge of the computer 's whereabouts or may have played a role in disposing of it also provided leads that led to the search , according to a @entity33 law enforcement official close to the @entity12 investigation
the 19 - year - old @entity16 went to school -- at the @entity36 -- in town adjacent to @entity20 , and he was spotted in his dorm room there in the days after the april 15 twin blasts that left three dead
@entity16 has not given investigators any substantive information since officials informed him of his constitutional rights prior to charging him with use of and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction , the source said friday
but the the source described the earlier bedside questioning -- which took place in two rounds during parts of saturday , sunday and monday , @entity56 police commissioner @entity55 had said -- as " very thorough " and said investigators do not feel hamstrung
these first interviews took place at @entity12 's @entity59 , where @entity16 had been held since his capture a week ago
latest developments in the @entity12 bombings probe @entity59 is one of several hospitals that treated the more than 260 people injured in the @entity67 attack allegedly pulled off by @entity16 and his older brother @entity68
some 30 of them remained hospitalized late friday afternoon , including one in critical condition , according to a @entity23 tally
in recent days , @entity16 has improved enough that he 'd been able to sit and was writing , a law enforcement official said
at 3:30 a.m. , the official said , he was transferred from @entity59 to @entity73 some 40 miles away
the federal @entity75 hospital , located on the grounds of the former @entity78 @entity33 military base , is designed for patients requiring ongoing medical care , according to the facility 's website
@entity16 had what appeared to be gunshot wounds to his head , neck , legs and hand when he was captured april 19 after a nearly 24 - hour manhunt , according to the criminal complaint accusing him in the marathon blasts
his 26 - year - old brother died after a gunfight hours earlier
photos : galleries from the attack and aftermath despite vow , suspects ' father still in @entity100 the suspects ' parents , meanwhile , are in @entity100
their mother @entity103 told @entity23 on friday that she and her husband had left their home in @entity106 for another part of @entity100
the brothers ' father , @entity108 , had said he 'd planned to travel to the @entity33
but that trip has been delayed indefinitely for health reasons , @entity103 told @entity23 's @entity112
the mother will not be flying to the @entity33 , where she is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property
the family lived in @entity21 before @entity103 jumped bail after her arrest on the charges in 2012
the parents moved to @entity106 , a semiautonomous republic in southern @entity100 that year
@entity100 authorities raised concerns in 2011 to @entity33 authorities about @entity103 and her son @entity68 , sources told @entity23
they asked both the @entity128 and @entity129 , separately , about @entity68 , source said
but a @entity33 official said that the @entity100 's case at the time was " thin , " though @entity33 authorities did add both their names to the @entity135 , or @entity135 , database -- which includes over a half million names -- an intelligence official said
even so , @entity33 authorities have come under fire at home , with lawmakers asking if the @entity128 and @entity129 failed to share information
in an interview with @entity23 on thursday , @entity103 said she did n't want to accept the reality of the bombing , saying it was fake
she said she has seen a video pushing the wild idea , and that there was no blood , that paint was used instead
suspects ' mother describes her last conversation with her sons nonetheless , she broke down when she spoke of the victims
" i really feel sorry for all of them
really feel sorry for all of them , " she said , her voice cracking even as she remained resolute that her sons were not involved
official : @entity33 wars in @entity162 , @entity163 motivated bombings @entity165 regrets @entity100 could n't give @entity33 more info while insisting @entity100 and @entity33 authorities often work together , @entity100 president @entity165 on thursday said that -- though authorities in @entity169 were tipped off , to some extent -- he wished they could have done something more that might have prevented the @entity12 attack
" the @entity100 ( authorities ) , to my great regret , were not able to provide our @entity33 colleagues with information that would have operative significance , " @entity165 said
dead @entity12 bomb suspect posted video of jihadist , analysis shows in his first on - camera comments since the bombing , the @entity100 leader added he hoped that the bombings might spur more cooperation between the two nations
" if we combine our efforts , we will not suffer blows like that , " he said during a live televised call - in session in @entity190 on thursday
@entity165 also lashed out against those in the @entity196 who have slammed @entity100 for human rights abuses in its actions toward @entity199
" @entity100 is among the first victims , and i hate it when our @entity202 partners call our terrorists who committed some heinous crimes in @entity100 ... freedom fighters ... they supported them , " said @entity165 , accusing unnamed people or groups of providing @entity100 's foes with political , financial and " media " support
report : carjacked man describes wild ordeal based on investigative leads and information provided by @entity16 , investigators believe that each of the brothers had their own remote control device to detonate bombs near the marathon 's finish line , said a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation on friday
the previous day , a law enforcement official said at least one of the bombs that exploded was set off by remote control
tragedy in @entity12 : how to help three days after that attack , and hours after authorities released images of two suspects , they " spontaneously " decided to go to @entity56 's @entity239 to blow up their six remaining explosives , @entity16 told investigators
but a botched carjacking spoiled the impromptu road trip , said @entity16 , whose account was outlined thursday by @entity56 's police commissioner
" we do n't know that we would have been able to stop the terrorists had they arrived here from @entity12 , " mayor @entity247 said
" we 're just thankful that we did n't have to find out that answer
" before forcing their way into the vehicle the night of april 18 , the brothers shot dead a campus police officer at the @entity257 , police said
the hijacked vehicle , a @entity258 , ran low on fuel and they stopped at a service station , where the vehicle 's owner escaped
shortly thereafter , police picked up the trail of the suv
a pursuit followed , during which , authorities say , the men were throwing the bombs out the vehicle 's window at them
the gun battle and @entity276 's death followed
in a @entity281 story , the man who was carjacked -- a 26 - year - old @entity278 entrepreneur identified only as @entity279 -- described his 90 - minute ordeal , from when a man brandishing a silver handgun got into his mercedes to when he ran for his life into a @entity289 gas station 's supply room
during this time , @entity279 told the @entity281 , the gun - wielding man confessed to pulling off the @entity12 bombing and to killing a police officer in @entity293 , @entity21 , where @entity257 's campus is located
together they crisscrossed around the @entity12 area , at one point stopping for gas and another time so that another person could join them in the car
@entity279 recognized both men from the photos released by the @entity128 earlier on april 18 , men who authorities now say were @entity68 and @entity16
the carjackers openly discussed traveling to @entity56 , before @entity279 was able to run to safety
" he fell down , screaming , ' please , please call ... the police
they want to kill me
they have a gun , they have a bomb , '' " @entity311 , the clerk working in the gas station at the time , told @entity23 's @entity314
@entity279 first hid at the front counter , then went to a storage room
@entity311 , after first making sure this man was n't one of the bombing suspects and separately thinking he might be drunk , quickly picked up a phone and called 911
" i was waiting ( for ) someone to shoot me at this moment , " @entity311 said , adding he could n't see outside from where he called
" i was waiting to die ... i wanted to finish my call very fast with the police
" within five minutes , the gas station was teeming with police
and a short time later , after a chase in which the suspects allegedly shot at police and threw bombs out their windows , @entity276 was dead
his brother was captured about 20 hours later
@entity337 -- a criminology professor at @entity338 , where @entity279 had been a student , and who has spent considerable time with him over recent days -- told @entity23 that the carjacking victim " does n't like to see himself as a hero
" " after all , he says , ' i was only trying to save myself , ' " @entity337 said
" but ... his actions , his composure , his smarts were what led this case to a close and may have indeed saved thousands of @entity33 if we believe , in fact , that ( the @entity12 suspects ) had plans to do more bombings in @entity56
" suspect 's widow is assisting investigation , lawyer says
