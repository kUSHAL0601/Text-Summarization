it may bear more than a passing resemblance to @entity3 , the dark fortress of @entity5 depicted in the @entity7 trilogy , but the @entity8 could become the tallest building on the @entity11 continent if construction begins as planned later this year
the project is slated for the picturesque city of @entity15 in @entity16 and is being proposed by @entity18 - based construction firm , @entity17 , in conjunction with @entity21 architects @entity22
aside from a stylishly swish exterior , features of the 114 - story building include offices , apartments , a seven star luxury hotel , an art gallery and a luxury arcade of shops
while a definitive date for breaking ground has still to be settled , its location finalized and full agreement of the @entity16 authorities sought , the tower 's designer told @entity1 that the project is progressing as planned
" our goal is to start the soil testing in june 2015 , " said @entity40
" then the engineering studies will take another few months ( six to nine ) and the construction should take two and a half to three years maximum to be completed
" if permission is granted , @entity40 believes the building will be the first of many large skyscrapers that will spring up across @entity11 in the coming years
he adds that this a sign of the continent 's growing strength and potential
at 540 meters tall ( designed specifically as a recognition of @entity11 's 54 countries ) @entity55 would currently rank as the fifth tallest building in the world , in between @entity60 ( 501 meters ) and @entity61 ( 541 meters ) , according to data from the @entity64 building directory
" @entity11 will have , in the next 15 years , thousands of towers , " @entity40 said
" the continent has an amazing potential with a lots of virgin places and a population of over a billion
" @entity40 added that @entity16 's stability , favorable landscape and the fact that it was at the gateway between @entity75 and @entity11 made it an attractive location for such a large development
the current tallest building in @entity11 is the 223 - meter tall @entity79 in @entity80 .
