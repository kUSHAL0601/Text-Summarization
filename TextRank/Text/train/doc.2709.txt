@entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 officials sat down at the negotiating table for the first time since @entity4 's prime minister apologized a month ago for a deadly 2010 raid on a @entity10 - bound aid ship that left eight @entity3 and an @entity12 dead
the one - day talks were held in the @entity3 capital , @entity15 , on monday
the two delegations discussed guidelines for determining how much @entity4 would compensate the families of the victims , according to @entity3 's semi-official @entity20
further talks are likely , although an exact timetable has not been released
relations between @entity4 and @entity3 , once close military and economic partners in the region , ruptured after the botched raid of the ship @entity28 nearly three years ago
@entity3 withdrew its ambassador from @entity4
since then , @entity15 has demanded a formal apology , compensation for victims , normalization of ties between the two countries , and that @entity4 lift its blockade on the @entity38 territory of @entity10
during a visit to the region last month , president @entity39 succeeded in brokering a critical phone call between the leaders of @entity3 and @entity4 , two key @entity12 allies in the turbulent @entity45
during the call , @entity3 prime minister @entity46 accepted an apology from @entity4 prime minister @entity49
" in light of @entity4 's investigation into the incident , which pointed out several operational mistakes , prime minister @entity49 expressed @entity4 's apology to the @entity3 people for any mistakes that might have led to loss of life or injury and agreed to conclude an agreement on compensation / non-liability , " the @entity4 government said last month
in its own official statement , @entity3 said the two leaders " agreed to work together to improve the humanitarian situation in the @entity38 territories
" there are still potential obstacles to a normalization of relations between the two governments
@entity3 has been prosecuting four @entity4 military commanders in absentia in connection to the @entity28 raid
also , families of the victims have said a compensation settlement will not stop their legal process against the soldiers until @entity4 ends its blockade on @entity10
" we see the negotiations for compensation for those killed as disrespectful when no steps have been taken to ensure the rights of those oppressed in the @entity38 lands and while the siege of our @entity38 brothers continues , " said a statement from the families
meanwhile , @entity3 president @entity96 and @entity38 leader @entity97 met in @entity0 for talks on regional issues , according to a statement by the office of the @entity3 president
@entity3 became the first country to send an ambassador to @entity105 last month , according to the statement
@entity3 and @entity4 have been two pro-western political , economic , and military linchpins in the @entity45 , and their falling out over the 2010 flotilla raid has hurt initiatives to tackle problems in the region , such as the @entity114 civil war and tensions relating to @entity117 's nuclear aspirations
the @entity118 organized the flotilla to bring goods into @entity10 , and to raise awareness over what it calls @entity4 's " illegal siege on @entity10
" @entity4 commandos raided one of the ships , the @entity28 , because it violated the @entity4 - imposed blockade on the @entity38 territory
more on the flotilla raid @entity4 imposed the blockade on @entity10 in 2007 after the militant group @entity133 seized control of the @entity38 territory
it is designed to stop the smuggling of arms into the territory , the @entity4 government says
but activists say @entity4 's embargo of goods into @entity10 from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the @entity148 coast .
