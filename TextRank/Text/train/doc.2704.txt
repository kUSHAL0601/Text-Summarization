-- a 19 - year - old @entity3 man was charged with capital murder tuesday in the death of an @entity7 man who died after allegedly being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck , authorities said
@entity11 , 19 , of @entity12 , @entity3 was also charged by a grand jury with hate - crime enhancement in the murder of @entity16 , said @entity18 district attorney @entity17
the indictment alleges that @entity11 killed @entity20 while in the commission of committing felony robbery , @entity17 said in a statement
@entity20 's family , however , is asking state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty in the case
relatives of @entity20 , who died shortly after receiving his injuries on june 26 , sent a letter with their request to @entity17 , saying the family is opposed to the death penalty partly for religious reasons
the indictment against @entity11 alleged @entity20 was targeted because of his race
@entity11 's arraignment has yet to be scheduled , @entity17 said
federal authorities have joined the local investigation , and both authorities are determining " the appropriate venue for the prosecution of any remaining suspects , " @entity17 's statement said
" all options are being considered and with each passing day , more evidence is being gathered , " @entity17 said
the death of @entity20 , 48 , occurred early june 26 in @entity49 , allegedly at the hands of white teens who , after a night of partying and drinking , decided to go looking for black people to assault , law enforcement officials have said , quoting one of the suspects in the case
watch : incident caught on video @entity20 's death drew national attention after @entity0 first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing , captured by a parking lot security camera in a @entity49 suburb
@entity17 , the district attorney , has called it " vicious " and a " premeditated hate crime
" the @entity70 @entity69 is investigating the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors
the killing has also prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in @entity49 , a city of about 175,000 people
a second teen , @entity79 , 18 , was initially charged with murder , but a judge reduced the charge to simple assault because @entity79 was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill @entity20
however , @entity18 prosecutors have said they plan to seek indictments against @entity79 for murder and a hate crime , and will seek indictments against other teens who were at the scene
the district attorney 's office has not officially commented on the family 's request for no death penalty in the case
last week , the @entity20 family filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white teens alleged to have been present at the beating of @entity20 that immediately preceded him being run over by the truck
the @entity103 , a nationally recognized organization based in @entity104 , @entity105 , that opposes racism and intolerance , joined the lawsuit
in addition to @entity11 and @entity79 , the lawsuit names five other teens as taking part in the incident : @entity114 of @entity115 ; @entity116 ; and @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , all of @entity12
none of the five has been arrested or charged
@entity20 , a line worker at a @entity123 plant , sang in his church choir , according to the family 's attorney , @entity127 leaves behind his partner of 17 years
attorneys for @entity11 and @entity79 have not responded to requests for comment from @entity0
during a recent bond hearing , @entity11 's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the " racial allegations
" a civil trial can proceed at the same time as a criminal case , but often the civil case is delayed pending the resolution of a criminal trial
while a criminal case is pending , a defendant in a civil case may need to invoke the @entity145
authorities believe @entity11 led and instigated the attack , which took place after a night of drinking in largely white @entity149 , outside @entity49
the gang of teens climbed into @entity11 's green truck and a white suv and drove 16 miles to the western edge of @entity49
they would have seen @entity20 immediately as they exited the highway , officials said
he was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp
on the videotape obtained exclusively by @entity0 , the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where @entity20 is standing , although he is just off camera and not visible
the teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and @entity20
witnesses told authorities this is when @entity20 's beating took place , as the teens yelled racial epithets , including " white power
" authorities allege @entity11 and many of the other teens pummeled @entity20 repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground , although this is not visible on the tape
after the beating , some of the teens left and others got into the green @entity184 truck
at this moment , @entity20 becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck
" @entity188 drove the @entity189 out of the parking lot and turned right onto @entity191 , " the lawsuit says
" just as @entity11 turned right , his headlights shone directly on @entity20 , who , having been severely beaten , was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel 's entrance
@entity11 accelerated , drove onto and over the street curb , and struck @entity20 with the front of the @entity189
" shortly afterward , @entity11 allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing , according to statements some of the teens made to detectives
" i ran that n --- -- over , " he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the teens in the other car
the proceedings of the case are taking place in the @entity18 courthouse , where in 1994 @entity210 was convicted in the notorious killing of civil rights leader @entity212 in 1963
@entity214 's @entity213 and @entity215 contributed to this report .
