@entity0 -- everyone 's made a joke they thought was funny only to see it fall flat , but @entity6 's attempt at humor could see him jailed for up to seven years in @entity8
@entity9 , a photographer by profession , re-tweeted some messages from @entity14 's official twitter feed , such as reports on the late leader @entity17 's travels across the country and negative tweets about @entity8
" i found the messages ludicrous because they are so harsh and the language is so out - dated
i found them funny , so i re-tweeted them , " @entity9 told @entity1
@entity9 , 23 , also took a photo of himself holding a whiskey bottle and edited in a @entity14 flag as a background for a joke
his supporters then doctored a @entity32 poster , replacing a smiling soldier with a sad photo of @entity9 and the image of the gun with another whiskey bottle
but @entity9 was imprisoned in january of this year , accused of " acts that benefit the enemy " and spreading @entity14 propaganda
he was released on bail in february and has another court appearance in @entity44
he 's still hoping the charges against him will be dropped
" to be honest , if you did this in @entity14 , you would be severely punished , " @entity9 said
" but this is @entity8 and i thought there would n't be a problem as i did it for fun
it certainly was n't for propaganda purposes
" @entity9 is the latest person to fall foul of @entity8 's controversial @entity56 ( @entity56 )
used widely during the years of military dictatorship in the 1970s and ' 80s , the law was designed to protect the state against @entity14 propaganda and to prosecute spies
but human rights groups say it was also used to persecute political dissidents and stifle freedom of speech
@entity65 says the law is still being abused , especially against those critical of the government 's policies on @entity14
" the @entity56 has a chilling effect on freedom of expression in @entity8 , " said @entity70 , @entity65 's @entity71 director
" it is used , not to address threats to national security , but instead to intimidate people and limit their rights to free speech
it should be reformed in line with human rights law and if the government can not do this , it must be abolished , " he said
the @entity87 has also called on @entity0 to change or repeal the law
president @entity90 's office declined to comment on the issue but the law has certainly been more widely used since the conservative president came to power in 2008
that year , just five people were prosecuted on charges of @entity98 online postings
two years later that number had jumped to 82
some within the @entity8 media are also criticizing the @entity90 administration for interfering in press freedom
journalists from four major networks went on strike earlier this year
employees from two of those stations have since gone back to work after promises from employers their concerns would be heard , but close to one thousand journalists remain on strike
" president @entity90 has appointed pro-government people as presidents of the media companies , what we call ' parachutes , '' said @entity115 , head of the @entity117 labor union which is still on strike
" they are now trying to censor our voice and stop criticism of the government , " he added
the government denies interference but picketing journalists say they are worried they are seeing increased censorship reminiscent of the dark days of dictatorship .
