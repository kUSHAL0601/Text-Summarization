@entity0 , @entity1 -- snubbing the @entity4 , former @entity1 president @entity3 returned home from exile friday , just ahead of a critical runoff election
@entity3 spoke briefly after landing at @entity8 in @entity0 but made no direct reference to sunday 's vote
he alluded , however , to the exclusion of his own party , @entity12 , banned from participating in the election
" today the @entity1 people mark the end of exile and coup d'etats while peacefully we must move from social exclusion to social inclusion , " @entity3 said in the airport 's diplomatic lounge
speaking in @entity23 , @entity24 and several other languages , @entity3 , 57 , said he condemned the violence that has wracked his nation since the disputed late november presidential election
@entity3 , a polarizing figure in @entity1 , became the second former president to return to @entity0 this year
dictator @entity31 flew back from @entity32 unexpectedly in january
@entity3 made his way from the airport to his former home in the neighborhood of @entity37 , which was recently fixed up and painted in anticipation of his return
@entity1 waved flags , danced and chanted his name along the road leading to his house
they carried signs that said " @entity47 , " @entity3 's nickname , and sported t - shirts with his picture and slogans supporting his return
" he could be the king of @entity1
he is a president we love so much , " said @entity52 , a 48 - year - old mason who waited outside @entity3 's house to catch a glimpse of the former president
@entity58 , a 66 - year - old carpenter , said he would refrain from the visiting the polls sunday
" i 'm not going to vote in this masquerade election
we 'll listen and analyze what ( @entity3 ) says to know what to do , " he said
the former @entity65 priest and @entity1 's first democratically elected president chose to go back at a tense time
@entity1 , still reeling from last year 's devastating earthquake and a cholera epidemic , are set to choose a new leader sunday
many , including the @entity72 administration , have questioned @entity3 's timing and said his presence would disrupt the vote
@entity3 's chartered jet took off thursday night from @entity77 , @entity78 , where he had been living for the past seven years , and landed shortly after 10 a.m. in the @entity1 capital
he was accompanied by his wife , @entity81 ; @entity4 actor and longtime supporter @entity82 ; and @entity4 attorney @entity84
also traveling with @entity3 was @entity85 , host of the news program " @entity87 " at a refueling stop in @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity3 told @entity85 that he believes the @entity1 people were happy to see him return
" i think that the @entity1 people are very happy , happy to know that we are on our way heading to @entity1 , happy to know that finally their dream will be fulfilled by things on the ground because they fought hard for democracy , " @entity3 said
" i share their happiness , i share their hope , and i renew my commitment to serve them in the field of education , once we move together " toward such a goal , he said
the @entity107 , however , was less than thrilled by @entity3 's return , warning this week that it would prove destabilizing
@entity110 spokesman @entity109 said monday that @entity3 seeks to influence the election
" mr. @entity3 has chosen to remain outside of @entity1 for seven years , " @entity109 said
" to return this week can only be seen as a conscious choice to impact @entity1 's elections
" @entity84 said @entity3 plans to get involved with educational projects and teach
he wanted to return before sunday 's election , @entity84 said , because he had " genuine concerns that the next president may take a different view " and not allow @entity3 to return
" it is not to be involved in the elections , as the @entity4 suggests , " @entity84 said
a group of prominent @entity4 lawyers sent a letter thursday to @entity124 , chief of staff at the @entity110 , objecting to what they said was @entity4 interference with @entity3 's " constitutional and human right to return
" " the @entity4 trying to control when any @entity1 citizen -- especially a former president -- can enter @entity1 is outrageous , " said @entity128 , a @entity129 law professor and legal director of the @entity131
" it violates a stack of binding international human rights treaties , " he said
" i felt compelled to speak out to defend both president @entity3 's human rights and the @entity4 tradition of rule of law that i teach in my classroom
" @entity3 was shuttled out of @entity1 in 2004 on a @entity4 plane after bloodshed on the streets and charges of authoritarianism and corruption
his supporters , including @entity82 , say the @entity107 wants to keep @entity3 out of @entity1 in favor of a leader more in line with its own views
" i am going to @entity78 to show our solidarity with the people of @entity1 by standing at the side of the leader they elected twice with overwhelming support : president @entity3 , " @entity82 said in a statement
" people of good conscience can not be idle while a former dictator is able to return unhindered while a democratic leader who peacefully handed over power to another elected president is restricted from returning to his country by external forces , " @entity82 said , referring to @entity31 , who fled into exile in @entity32 in 1986 after 15 years of iron - fisted rule
@entity31 stunned the world by returning to @entity1 in january
shortly afterward , @entity3 again aired his desire to go back home
the @entity1 government issued him a new passport last month
@entity3 retains a following in @entity1 , especially among the poorest of the poor , who catapulted him to power in 1990 with more than 67 percent of the vote
but @entity3 's relationship with his homeland , as well as the international community , has been a complicated one
he gained popularity in @entity1 by giving the poor and disenfranchised a voice , but his critics accused him of corruption , greed and human rights abuses -- problems that have plagued the impoverished @entity192 nation under other leaders as well
last year , a massive earthquake devastated @entity1
recovery efforts have been slow and have added to electoral turmoil
the @entity197 voiced concerns this week over violence marring the campaign and called on " all candidates , especially those in the presidential runoff , to avoid threats , intimidation and harassment
" " consolidation of democracy in @entity1 depends largely on the will of politicians to adopt the principles of a peaceful transfer of power and to accept election results in accordance with mechanisms provided by the electoral law , " said a statement from the @entity208 in @entity1 , which has been in @entity1 since @entity3 's departure
the presidential vote pits former first lady @entity222 against popular musician @entity223 in a runoff that was delayed by two months because of unrest and charges of fraud
both candidates had said earlier they support a @entity1 citizen 's right to return home
@entity223 , considered the frontrunner in the race , had no comment on @entity3 's return , spokesman @entity232 said
@entity2 's @entity237 in @entity238 and journalist @entity239 in @entity0 contributed to this report .
