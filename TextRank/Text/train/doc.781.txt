the @entity1 administration says it will seek $ 500 million from @entity2 to help " train and equip appropriately vetted elements of the moderate @entity6 armed opposition , " funding that , if approved , would deepen @entity9 involvement in that country 's civil war
@entity13 spokeswoman @entity12 announced on thursday that the administration would seek the money that she said would build on " longstanding efforts " by the @entity9 " to empower the moderate @entity6 opposition
" " these funds would help defend the @entity6 people , stabilize areas under opposition control , facilitate the provision of essential services , counter terrorist threats , and promote conditions for a negotiated settlement , " she said
the $ 500 million request would be part of a $ 1.5 billion so - called regional stabilization initiative , which would involve partnering with @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 -- @entity6 's neighbors
funding elements of the @entity6 opposition would be significant , though it would n't necessarily be surprising
in fact , the @entity9 government has been in close contact with some leading the fight to topple president @entity41
last summer , @entity2 approved some military support for @entity6 rebels , and there 's been more back - and - forth since then
still , any such support is complicated by the fact that the @entity9 does n't see eye to eye with -- and does n't want to arm or help in any way -- some elements of the @entity6 opposition
that includes the @entity51 in @entity32 and @entity6 , also known as @entity52 or @entity52 , a group whose tactics have been so brutal that they 've even been disowned by @entity56
@entity52 , which hopes to establish an @entity58 caliphate in the region , is currently making news for taking over a wide swath of @entity32 and threatening @entity62
nonetheless , the @entity1 administration has n't backed away from other rebels -- seeing them as the best bet , compared to @entity6 's current government and certain militant fighters
" while we continue to believe that there is no military solution to this crisis and that the @entity9 should not put @entity9 troops into combat in @entity6 , this request marks another step toward helping the @entity6 people defend themselves against regime attacks , push back against the growing number of extremists like @entity52 who find safe - haven in the chaos , and take their future into their own hands by enhancing security and stability at local levels , " spokeswoman @entity12 said
in may , the president told graduating cadets at the @entity90 at @entity90 that he would " work with @entity2 to ramp up support for those in the @entity6 opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator
