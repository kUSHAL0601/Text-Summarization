-- @entity1 returned the @entity2 to its next host venue of @entity4 wednesday then revealed how the hostile reception he and his @entity7 teammates received from the @entity9 galleries had given them even greater resolve
@entity11 proved a last day hero after his 5 & 3 victory over @entity14 helped his team retain the trophy , but he did not enjoy being the butt of the @entity19 supporters
" i did n't get abused , but you get ' top it , shank it , you 're a loser ' , stuff like that , every shot you play , " he said
it came as no surprise to the 43 - year - old veteran , who played in the infamous " @entity29 " in 1999 where raucous home support helped the @entity19 overturn a four - point deficit on the last day
this time the boot was on the other foot , as inspired by team captain @entity35 , the @entity7 silenced the crowd and pulled off the same feat in the concluding singles
" it makes it all the more satisfying on sunday night when you 're standing there with the @entity2 in front of you and they are not
i think it helps us , to be fair
" i think they ( the @entity19 team ) said it 's the same when they come here
apparently that 's how it is , but i ca n't see that
" @entity11 has returned to a heroes welcome on home soil where he will be playing in the @entity55 tournament this week
" since i arrived here i can hardly get a ball hit for people coming up kind of slapping you on the back
it 's been lovely , " he added
@entity62 's @entity61 , who holed the testing final putt to make sure @entity7 retained the @entity2 as he beat @entity64 , is also in the field
@entity61 had rolled his initial birdie putt on the 18th at @entity9 about six foot past the hole to leave the @entity7 supporters with their hearts in their mouth
" even though it was more difficult in the end , it was an even better feeling
of course it was a lot of pressure , but i see it more like a gift what happened , " he told the official @entity75 website
" there will never , ever , be a more important putt in my life
even if i have a chance in two years ' time again ( at @entity4 ) i 've done it before already , " added the 27 - year - old
@entity61 will be looking for his second win in three stagings of the tournament when play gets underway thursday .
