-- @entity3 , one of three @entity5 hikers held in @entity2 for more than a year , will be released saturday , @entity2 officials said thursday
an official at @entity2 's @entity7 said earlier thursday that one of the three would be freed this weekend , after the end of the @entity12 holy month of @entity13 , without specifying which one
but @entity15 , a representative for the @entity2 mission to the @entity17 , told @entity0 that @entity3 was designated for release " very soon
" the @entity20 official said one of @entity2 's vice presidents will be present when the hiker is released at 9 a.m. saturday
@entity3 , along with @entity3 and @entity3 , were detained july 31 , 2009 , after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into @entity2 while hiking in @entity27 's @entity26
@entity28 has said the three hikers were spies , and @entity2 's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of @entity2 prisoners , according to state news outlets
@entity36 , the @entity2 lawyer who represents the hikers , said he has put in a formal request for the trio 's release within the past two weeks
@entity36 said he told prosecutors that a year had passed since their arrests and the government had not shown any just cause for their imprisonment , and that @entity3 has a medical condition that requires proper care
after the news first broke thursday , the mothers of all three said they had seen the reports and were " urgently seeking further information
" " we hope and pray that the reports are true and that this signals the end of all three of our children 's long and difficult detention , " @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 said in a joint statement
" @entity3 , @entity3 and @entity3 are all innocent and we continue to call for their immediate release , so that they can return home together and be reunited with our families
" upon release , @entity3 would be leaving her fiance behind in prison
the families announced in spring that @entity3 and @entity3 got engaged in prison and plan to be married when they 're both released
in @entity73 , @entity72 spokesman @entity71 told reporters , " we do n't know , frankly , what @entity2 is contemplating at this point
" he said the @entity5 was making inquiries through the @entity79 government , which represents @entity5 interests in @entity28
" obviously , if this turns out to be true , this is terrific news , " @entity71 said
" the hikers ' release is long overdue , and i would just stress that we hope that it 's all three hikers
" @entity0 's @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 contributed to this report .
