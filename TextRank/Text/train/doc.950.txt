-- three shipwrecked fishermen lived on clams and seaweed for 10 days while stranded on an island off @entity7 's @entity6 until a passing sailboat rescued them , the @entity1 said friday
on friday , the @entity10 ship @entity11 rendezvoused with the sailboat and was transporting the three fishermen northbound back to @entity14 , according to the @entity15
the three fishermen were scheduled to arrive friday night , and no injuries have been reported , authorities said
the three men were on a fishing trip on their 50 - foot liner @entity22 when it capsized about 70 miles south of @entity14 , the navy said
the three men boarded a life raft and paddled eight miles to @entity25 , located off central @entity26 in the @entity27 , a fishing ground for salmon and halibut , the navy said
while on the island , they used their raft as a shelter , the navy said
@entity35 , maritime coordinator for @entity15 , described @entity25 as " real remote piece of coast with no real population
" " so , to see three guys on beach is really odd in itself , " @entity35 told @entity0
a passing sailor in his 70s in his boat , the @entity45 , was believed to be on a pleasure outing when he saw the stranded three fishermen , @entity35 said
the sailor radioed the @entity49 and then he anchored and launched a dinghy to approach the island shore , @entity35 said
the sailor gave the three men food and water and then called the coast guard again , @entity35 said
the coast guard 's @entity11 was on patrol an hour away when the call came in , @entity35 said
@entity59 : " real kudos to the sailing vessel @entity62 for keeping a sharp lookout and saw what was going on and did a good job
" the three fishermen 's vessel did n't have an @entity69 , which transmits a distress signal anywhere in the world through a satellite system , the navy said
@entity7 authorities were to assess the three fishermen 's health once they boarded the coast guard ship .
