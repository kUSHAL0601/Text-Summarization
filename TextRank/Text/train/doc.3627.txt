school meals will have to offer fruits and vegetables to students every day under standards issued by the @entity5 on wednesday
the meal programs , which feed about 32 million students in public and private schools , will have to reduce sodium , saturated fat and trans fats
schools must also offer more whole grains as well as fat - free or low - fat milk varieties
these standards go into effect july 1 and will be phased in over a three - year period , according to the @entity5
the new nutrition standards are largely based on recommendations by the @entity20 , as part of efforts to curb childhood obesity
recent numbers show that about 17 % of children in the @entity26 are obese
under the new rules , school meals will have calorie minimums and maximums per meal based on the child 's age
for kindergarteners to fifth - graders , meals must contain 550 to 650 calories , and for 9th - to 12th - graders , meals must have 450 to 600 calories
children will not be forced to take the vegetables and fruits onto their plates ; the standards require that the various food groups be offered
health groups reacted to the rules mostly favorably , although a controversy erupted in november after @entity50 decided that two tablespoons of tomato sauce was good enough to categorize a slice of pizza as a vegetable
@entity55 , the @entity5 under secretary for @entity57 , said he was n't concerned with the tomato paste controversy at this point
" i 'm confident we have a core healthy set of proposed diets for children , " he said
" we can , within that , accommodate those recommendations received from @entity50
" @entity66 and beverages sold in vending machines will also have to meet nutritional standards
first lady @entity70 and @entity5 secretary @entity71 unveiled the standards wednesday
" when we send our kids to school , we expect that they wo n't be eating the kind of fatty , salty , sugary foods that we try to keep them from eating at home , " @entity70 said in a news release
" we want the food they get at school to be the same kind of food we would serve at our own kitchen tables
" the @entity5 offered a weekly sample lunch menu with before and after comparisons
before the new rules , a standard elementary school lunch menu might consist of cheese pizza , canned pineapple , tater tots and chocolate milk
a healthier meal under the new standards would have whole - wheat cheese pizza , baked sweet potato fries , raw grape tomatoes , low - fat ranch dip , applesauce and low - fat milk
some parts of the major revamp of school lunches have been rejected by students
the @entity108 reported in december that students trashed the untouched healthier meals and started a booming underground market for junk food
cafeteria workers in @entity114 reported that kids were not eating the healthy meals , according to the @entity117
" if it 's not delicious , kids are n't going to eat it , " said @entity118 , assistant @entity119 chef
" i have lots of confidence in school chefs across the country who are working very hard to try to put delicious foods on the plates of kids
" he cited a chefs move to @entity130 , involving 35,000 school chefs who strive to innovate for better - tasting , healthy meals for kids
the new standards are expected to cost $ 3.2 billion over the next five years , which was less than the initial estimated price , according to the @entity5
the @entity136 gave the federal government more authority to set standards for food sold in vending machines and elsewhere on school grounds
" the new school meal standards are one of the most important advances in nutrition in decades , " said @entity143 , nutrition policy director at the @entity144
" they 're much needed , given high childhood obesity rates and the poor state of our children 's diets
" the @entity155 , which represents 55,000 school nutrition professionals , said , " through healthier choices and nutrition education , school meal programs have made tremendous strides to promote better food choices for @entity26 's students
these national nutrition standards will help school nutrition professionals build on their successes
