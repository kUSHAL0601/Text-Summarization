-- an @entity2 man who has been legally dead since 1994 will remain so in the eyes of the law after losing his complaint to overturn his death filing , according to authorities
@entity8 , 61 , testified monday that he disappeared in 1986 after losing his job , leaving behind a wife , two children and thousands of dollars of unpaid child support , according to @entity13 , the attorney for @entity8 's ex-wife , @entity14
he was declared legally dead eight years later
@entity8 said he returned to @entity2 " around 2005 " with no knowledge of his legal death , and that he had hoped to reestablish his social security number
a legal statute in @entity2 prevents changes to death rulings once three years have passed , @entity13 told @entity0 , and judge @entity21 ruled accordingly in @entity22
" in over 40 years , i 've never come across a case like this , " the judge told @entity0
" in the end though , because of the statute , it was a pretty open - and - shut case
" @entity13 recounts that at the time of @entity8 's legal death in 1994 , he owed @entity14 around $ 25,000 in child support , a matter which could have been complicated had the judge ruled in @entity8 's favor on monday
following the 1994 ruling , @entity13 said , @entity14 began receiving @entity37 death benefits to support her two children
" there could have been the possibility that my client would have to pay back what she received from @entity37 , " @entity13 said
" we certainly did not want to open that door , so we 're satisfied with the outcome
" despite her relief at the court 's ruling , @entity13 says his client has no ill will toward her ex-husband
@entity8 's attorney was not immediately available for comment wednesday
he still has 30 days to appeal the court 's ruling , according judge @entity21 .
