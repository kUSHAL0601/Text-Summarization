-- did you know that there exists an all - natural remedy for memory loss ? weight gain ? macular degeneration ? prostate enlargement ? these products are so successful that clinical testing has already begun ! just listen to the following testimonial from an unidentified person ... as these ads blare at you from your favorite am radio station , perhaps you wonder : how can this be legal ? since the late 1960s , aspirin makers have been trying to win the right to tell the public that a daily low - dose tablet can help prevent heart disease
they have been told no , and no , and no again
federal regulators are so nervous about over-selling aspirin 's benefits that they have restricted statements about aspirin to the most bland and basic
yet while the statements about aspirin have to be cushioned in the vaguest generalities , snake oil flim - flam can be huckstered in the most truth - defying way , thanks to a 1994 law coaxed through @entity31 by the people who make these drugs
the law bears the long title of the @entity36
it was sponsored in @entity38 by rep. @entity39 , @entity40 , and in the @entity41 by @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44 , @entity45
the @entity36 law draws a line between synthesized medicines like aspirin and remedies made from herbs , minerals , vitamins and amino acids
this latter group was recategorized as " dietary supplements " -- that is , as foods rather than drugs
" drugs " are subjected to exacting scientific trial to prove them both safe and also effective
sellers of dietary supplements are not required to prove that their remedies work
they are not even required to prove them safe -- as " foods " they are presumed safe unless shown otherwise
" drugs " must disclose any risk of side effect
( that 's why those erectile dysfunction ads terrify tv audiences with their references to four - hour erections
) dietary supplements bear no such burden -- which is why @entity77 can be sold as an anti-depressant , without any mention of the disturbing indications that the herb weakens the effectiveness of birth control pills
" drug " advertising must be pre-approved by the @entity85 , which minutely reviews the ads ' accuracy
dietary supplement advertising is regulated by the @entity89
so long as supplements avoid promises to cure a specific disease , their sellers can say pretty much whatever they want , provided only that they have some kind of supporting evidence on file
that evidence does not have to meet any kind of scientific test : pretty much any pattern of ink on paper will do the job
i can not say , " my rosemary - sage - thyme - and - oregano tablets cure @entity107
" but if i pay my cousin $ 100 to do a few experiments , i can claim , " my tablets boost the immune system -- and clinical trials are under way ! " ( there is an exception to the permissive rules about advertising natural products : wine
there is substantial evidence that a glass of red wine a day reduces the risk of heart attack
the laws of most states forbid any hint or suggestion that moderate alcohol use might confer health benefits
still , if you ask the scientists , wine has better grounds to call itself a health food than does , say , echinacea ! ) fifteen years after receiving the favor of @entity31 , dietary supplements have grown into a $ 24 billion a year industry
most of the products sold by the industry are merely useless
for those who eat a balanced diet , scientists have found no quantifiable benefit from taking multivitamins
on the other hand , multivitamins probably wo n't do any harm
it would be better to give the $ 10 you spend on a jar of pills to the @entity155 , but at least you are not poisoning yourself
the same could not be said , alas , for the unfortunate customers of a @entity158 herbal dispensary who bought a supplement that contained the herb @entity162
the a. fangi herb is rich in aristolochic acid , a carcinogen -- and users experienced an outbreak of urinary tract cancers
@entity169 has since been banned in the @entity170
it remains legal in the @entity172
as outrages go , @entity31 ' special favor to the herbal supplement industry might seem relatively small stuff : a splash in the torrent of the $ 2 trillion per year that @entity172 spend on health and wellness
and yet in the midst of a great national debate over health care , this small outrage has some serious implications
advocates for the herbal supplement industry justify their special sweet deal by championing the right of consumers to make their own " health choices
" individual choice certainly sounds like the @entity172 way
but the fact is that most of us are not well positioned to make intelligent health choices
if we try to play our own doctor , we are going to expose our health -- and our money -- to risk and exploitation
as individuals , we have trouble distinguishing between anecdotes : " my neighbor took zinc for her cold and she said it really helped , " and data : most colds last four days , so you could smoke yak - dung cigarettes on day three and feel better on day four
we are poor balancers of risk : look at the rising number of @entity172 who resist taking vaccines because of astronomically remote chances that something might go wrong
we are vulnerable to placebos : " hey -- i took the 30 - day free sample and i feel sure my vision did improve ! " we are swayed by prejudice and ideology : the film - maker @entity224 wrote in @entity225 in 1992 : " i 'm convinced @entity107 is a government - engineered disease
" the reason we should defer to experts is not that the experts know everything
of course they do n't
it 's just that they know more than non-experts do
it 's not that science has all the answers
it 's just that astrologers , shamans , and natural healers have none of them
@entity172 spend over 50 percent more per person on their health than anyone else on earth
for all that extra money , @entity172 see very little benefit
@entity172 rank 42nd on earth in life expectancy , 29th in infant mortality
improving and rationalizing this costly and dysfunctional system is a gigantic , maybe impossible , task
but one small reform could strike a meaningful blow for reason and cost - effectiveness : apply the rules governing the advertising of aspirin to the advertising of oregano tablets
repeal the @entity36 law and give the @entity85 full authority over every manufactured substance that purports to promote health or relieve illness
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity270 .
