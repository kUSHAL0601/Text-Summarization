-- @entity1 is ready to become more than the latest musician in a modern @entity4 invasion
the singer - songwriter has already struck it big in his native @entity7 , becoming one of the top debut artists in the last year
@entity1 's album , " + , " debuted on top of the @entity13 album charts in 2011 , and it has charted in the @entity14 everywhere from @entity15 to the @entity16
@entity1 has performed for the queen , and he will take the stage during the closing ceremony of the @entity20 in @entity21
with his mix of acoustic soul , hip - hop beats and personal lyrics , @entity1 is also ready to take on a whole new market : the @entity27
the artist is off to a good start , having already gained a cult @entity27 following since " + " shot to a top 5 debut on the @entity34
while doing promotional rounds in the @entity27 , @entity0 caught up with @entity1 at an intimate fan show for radio station 104.3 @entity38
@entity1 believes the power of the @entity40 helped to expand his fan base in countries where he had yet to release material
" anyone can get my record around the world , " @entity1 told @entity0
" anyone can see my music videos around the world ; anyone can see me live around the world
it 's like , it 's a click of a mouse , to be honest
so that has helped out with the fan base everywhere , and especially in @entity27
" @entity1 won two trophies at this year 's @entity58 , the @entity4 equivalent of the @entity60
with the current success of @entity63 and , on a smaller scale , @entity65 and @entity66 , all eyes are on the @entity4 music scene to see what else they have to offer
@entity1 , however , does n't believe this current " @entity4 wave " is anything new
" i think [ the ] @entity40 has a large amount to do with this invasion that the media are talking about , but i do n't think the invasion ended , " @entity1 told @entity0
" we 've been supplying you with music , you 've been supplying us with music , and it 's a good trade
we get @entity80 , you get @entity63
" now @entity1 is working on creating hits for other @entity83 artists
he co-wrote a track on @entity65 's album and was recently spotted heading into a studio with country music 's reigning princess , @entity87
in fact , @entity87 proclaimed her support for @entity1 on her @entity92 page
the superstar tweeted a link to purchase " + , " declaring it " my favorite album right now
" @entity1 recently performed at the @entity96 outside of @entity97 alongside superstars including @entity99 and @entity100
not only was he the only debut artist in the lineup , but it was that very event that inspired him to get started in music as a child
" the reason i started playing guitar in the first place was watching the jubilee 10 years ago when i saw @entity109 play on tv , " @entity1 said
" it 's quite a weird full circle , to have 10 years on from the day you started playing guitar [ to ] playing [ that ] event
hopefully , a 10 - year - old kid will be watching that and think , ' yeah , i want to pick up a guitar , as well
' and then 10 years on , they might be playing it
