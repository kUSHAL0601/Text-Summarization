-- finery and high fashion have long been synonymous with the @entity4 race meeting , and this year patrons are being scrutinized to a level which is almost unparalleled in the world of sport
@entity4 takes fashion so seriously there are even dress code administrators on hand to assess the thousands of people who descend upon the @entity14 venue , with a strict list of dos and don'ts issued to prevent standards slipping
the @entity19 , where @entity20 watches all five days of the meeting , is where the most stringent regulations are enforced -- including a ban on the ever - popular fascinator
no fairytale ending for @entity20 and @entity27 to ensure fashion decorum , @entity4 's organizers have gone as far as to publish style guides for race goers who will be mingling with @entity33 high society at one of the social calendar 's most prestigious events
with all eyes fixed on female visitors during thursday 's @entity41 , the women 's checklist for the @entity19 is detailed
all dresses must be of " modest " length -- defined as " falling just above the knee or longer
" shorts are a no - no , as are shoulderless dresses
women are permitted to wear pants , providing the color and material of them matches what is on display above the waistline
the dress code administrators will also be on hand to offer pashminas to any woman who may have misunderstood the regulations
if you are belly dancer it is probably best to give @entity4 a wide berth as midriffs must be covered at all times
and if you like to attend sporting events in fancy dress forget it -- pantomime horses are banned
for the gentlemen who enter @entity4 's inner sanctum , black or gray morning wear is de rigueur -- shoes , a waistcoat and tie and , of course , a top hat
in the more relaxed grandstand , a suit will ease you past the fashion police
however , if you thought dusting off your cravat for a day at the races was acceptable think again -- such neckwear is strictly verboten
@entity84 cruises to @entity4 success " horse racing 's roots as the ' sport of kings ' obviously suggest a pleasure pastime for the elite , " @entity86 , the fashion course director at @entity89 's @entity88 , told @entity0
" in the past this would have been , depending on the monarch , an opportunity for either ostentatious displays or relatively tasteful , yet expensive , modesty
" the code would denote respect for the monarchy , particularly when they were actually present
" the dress code also helps to define the class superiority of the crowd and keep out the great unwashed
" any prestigious occasion will have a code to reflect the status of the racegoers regardless of which country it is held , " said @entity86
" all codes are aimed at excluding someone
our dress is a key signifier of class or our clan , very much so in the @entity33
" @entity86 also argued @entity4 's 2012 dress code could be a not - so - subtle hint aimed at encouraging certain punters to cover up
" i do n't think that the wish here is to exclude them but to oblige them to cover up by setting strict parameters , " he said
" however the fun of strict rules is seeing how far you can bend them -- anyone who ever wore a school uniform can tell you that ! "
