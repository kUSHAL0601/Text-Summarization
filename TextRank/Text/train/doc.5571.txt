@entity0 -- @entity2 says its scientists have concluded their investigation into the failure of the country 's long - range rocket launch last week , but it declined to divulge why the flight ended in a trail of debris strewn across the sea
experts have " wound up the specific and scientific probe into the cause " of the rocket 's failure to put a satellite into orbit , the official @entity12 said in a report late thursday without elaborating on what the cause was
@entity23 had insisted that the purpose of the launch was to send an " earth observation satellite " into space
but the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 called the operation a ballistic missile test in disguise
" all the scientific and technological data and precious experience gained this time will serve as a very precious boon to space development and a reliable guarantee for greater success in the days ahead , " the @entity12 report said , citing an unidentified spokesman for the @entity36
the rocket flew for only about a minute and half after its take off on april 13 before it broke into pieces above the @entity47
on monday , the @entity48 condemned the failed launch , saying it was " a serious violation " of previous council resolutions and " has caused grave security concerns in the region
" @entity2 said in the state media report thursday that it had " never recognized " the @entity48 resolution on the matter , describing it as " a product of sinister intentions of the hostile forces
