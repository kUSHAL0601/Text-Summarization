@entity0 -- the company that made 44,000 helmets recalled by the @entity4 has stopped all helmet manufacturing
@entity6 , the company that made the potentially defective combat helmets , was subcontracted to make the helmets by @entity9 , the company named in the recall
@entity6 , also known as @entity6 , has also agreed to waive preferential status that gives it right of first refusal on @entity15 government contracts
the @entity4 recalled the helmets two weeks ago , when officials said the advanced combat helmets failed ballistic testing standards
many were used by troops in @entity22 and @entity23
troops have been instructed to exchange the helmets for ones made by another company , but the @entity4 is still trying to find all the recalled helmets
the company 's decision comes after the @entity31 launched an investigation into its helmet manufacturing and an amendment was proposed to the @entity35
that amendment would have forced the company to submit to competitive bidding
the author of the amendment , rep. @entity47 , @entity48 , said , " our military men and women deserve only the best equipment and it has become clear that @entity6 can not meet the standards required in manufacturing helmets
" the @entity49 , which uses prisoners in some of its work
@entity54 , the bureau 's chief public information officer , said , " @entity6 has always strived to make a quality product that meets or exceeds the needs and expectations of our customers
" she said if the company resumes helmet production , it will voluntarily submit to competitive bidding
the company is one of several major manufacturers of combat helmets
a competitor , @entity69 , laid off some of its staff earlier this year
@entity72 , a spokesman for @entity47 , said , " absolutely there 's a jobs element to it
i do n't think it 's widely known that prisoners are making the most basic part of a soldier 's gear
and this company has quit making helmets right in the midst of an investigation by the @entity31
" @entity4 officials said the @entity87 investigation helped trigger the testing on the helmets that determined they did not meet standards
in addition to the 44,000 - helmet contract , @entity6 had an @entity4 contract to produce 600,000 helmets and a contract to deliver 100,000 lightweight helmets to the @entity98
@entity99 said , " @entity6 has not met protective standards , nor has it met required deadlines in its production of these crucial helmets ... and we ca n't wait any longer to protect our troops
" @entity47 is a @entity106 commander , who also served in the @entity107 as an intelligence analyst .
