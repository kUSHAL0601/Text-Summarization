-- sometimes the hardest thing is to say " no " to a friend
all the more reason to applaud the bravery of @entity5 and the @entity6
a few months ago , the @entity7 accepted a $ 25 million grant from @entity9 and @entity10 to support scholarships for minority students
it raised more than a few eyebrows
after all , everyone -- including me -- reveres the college fund
its contribution to the cause of equal opportunity is legendary
but few people still alive have done more to promote policies that hurt african - americans than the @entity10 brothers
the @entity10 brothers are one of the most prominent funders of organizations that work to restrict early voting and registration and effectively disenfranchise african - americans
they oppose the minimum wage , which would disproportionately help black workers
they are spending millions to lie to the public about climate disruption , which hurts the most vulnerable communities first
in other words , the @entity25 ' agenda is great for african - americans -- so long as we do not want to vote , make a living or avoid our homes being swept away in a flood
it is one thing to accept money from dubious sources
one could argue -- convincingly -- that the college fund was taking money from a bad source and doing something good with it
but the breaking point came a few weeks ago when @entity7 president @entity54 appeared at a @entity10 brothers ' retreat in @entity57
the public stated purpose of this event was to build support for the @entity25 ' various political causes
the moment he stepped through the door , @entity62 lent the his organization 's good name to a radical agenda that causes untold damage to african - americans
all this was too much for @entity6 , a predominantly @entity73 - @entity72 union with a long civil rights track record that had partnered with the @entity7 for years in giving out scholarships
last month , @entity5 sent @entity62 a letter ending their partnership
it was a tough decision , no doubt -- but it was the right one
( full disclosure : @entity6 once made a donation to @entity85 , an organization that i lead
) i am all for education
that is one of the reasons i helped start # @entity91 , an initiative to teach computer science to black , brown and low - income young people
i am the first to point out how much brilliance and creativity our nation is losing by failing to uplift youth from low - opportunity backgrounds
that 's why i am usually such a huge fan of the @entity7
but the @entity10 money seems to have come with strings attached
the funds are earmarked only for young people with " an interest in the study of how entrepreneurship , economics , and innovation contribute to well - being for individuals , communities , and society
" to many , that sounds like the @entity10 brothers are restricting the funds only to students who adopt the @entity10 's economic and political views
@entity10 representatives will even help choose which students qualify for scholarships
it is also worth noting that @entity6 did not end its support for minority scholarships
the union will still give just as much money to young scholars as it always has -- just through other channels
it is simply choosing not to partner with a group that is lending a helping hand to those whose political views most african - americans detest
after all , according to documents reported by @entity138 and the @entity139 , @entity140 was once a member of the @entity142 , the far - right group that so opposed the civil rights movement that it declared the rev. @entity144 a communist
and that one of the speakers at the @entity10 retreat was @entity149 of the notorious " @entity150 , " a book he co-authored that argued blacks and @entity153 were innately less intelligent than whites and @entity155 , and to blame for every social injustice they face
endorsing these views in exchange for scholarship funding is not worth it
it is not two steps forward , one step back
it is half a step forward , then go sit in the back of the bus
@entity62 and the @entity7 may not agree
conservatives definitely do not -- @entity168 tactfully likened the college fund to slaves and @entity6 to slaveholders
but @entity6 has an obligation to its members not to align itself with this kind of behavior
it is harder to say " no " to a friend than an enemy
but in this case , the hard path was also the right one .
