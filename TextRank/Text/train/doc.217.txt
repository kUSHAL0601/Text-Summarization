a woman was jailed for eight years by a @entity2 court friday for her part in the kidnap of her own daughter
@entity6 and @entity7 were both involved in the plot to kidnap @entity9
nine - year - old @entity6 was locked in an apartment for 24 days after going missing from her home in february last year
after a massive police investigation , @entity6 , 33 , was found guilty last month of kidnap , false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice
she was sentenced at @entity20 in @entity21 , northern @entity22 , the @entity18 reported
her former partner 's uncle , @entity7 , 40 , was also convicted of the same offences and received an eight - year jail term , @entity23 said
prosecutors say @entity7 abducted @entity9 as she was on her way home from school in @entity33 , @entity21
they claim he gave her @entity34 -- a type of sleeping tablet -- and travel sickness pills and kept her tethered to an elasticated strap attached to a roof beam through a loft hatch when he went out
meanwhile @entity43 kept up a " wicked and dishonest lie " as her daughter became the subject of a massive police search operation and a reward fund offered by a local newspaper grew to $ 50,000 , jurors were told
@entity7 planned to release @entity9 and then " discover " her , prosecutors said
according to @entity23 , @entity43 told five versions of what happened to @entity9 , ranging from being a distraught mother whose daughter had gone missing to blaming the crime on her former partner @entity6 and other members of his family
it also emerged in court that @entity7 abducted one of his own daughters after he became involved in a custody battle with his former wife , @entity23 said .
