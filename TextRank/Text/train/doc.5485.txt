-- there are no rules to naming a startup
and most entrepreneurs do assume that the name they choose will change before their businesses really start to gain momentum
consequently , it does n't shock us that some of our favorite startups were sired by picking names out of hats , by throwing out odd proper nouns that might be cheap domain names and by haphazardly removing vowels
ever wonder what a " @entity19 " is , or who the " @entity18 " is ? we 've asked nine startups to share the story behind their names
twitter the name @entity19 was picked out of a hat
a small group of employees from @entity28 , the @entity30 podcasting startup where @entity19 initially began , had a brainstorming session
they were trying to come up with names that fit with the theme of a mobile phone buzzing an update in your pocket
after narrowing down the options ( which included @entity41 and @entity19 ) , they wrote them down , put them in a hat , and let fate decide
@entity46 decided on @entity19 ( because clearly asking someone if they saw your latest " jeep " is just weird )
foursquare dodgeball , @entity52 's first attempt at social networking for mobile phones , was acquired by @entity55 in 2005
when @entity55 killed the project , @entity52 founded an improved location - based social game he named @entity50
does @entity52 have some sort of unresolved childhood issues relating to playground games ? as it turns out , no he does n't
" @entity52 chose to name both companies after playground games because they were both designed to be fun and playful , " said @entity50 's pr manager in an email
apparently , @entity50 was always @entity52 's first choice , but the domain name was n't available at the time he founded @entity69
@entity70 @entity70 has been a sleek website where users can type or email their questions , to then be answered by the appropriate people in their own social networks
but co-founder @entity77 's idea began as a chat buddy that could intermediate conversations with people you know online
there were advantages to having this name at the top of the buddy list , a spot which was occupied on @entity77 's buddy roster by his friend @entity89
alphabetically speaking , there are n't many options that trump @entity89
" @entity70 " is one of the few names that could shoulder him out
other factors the name had going for it were its ability to conjugate the invented active verb " vark , " and being an animal that people recognized but typically did n't have strong associations with
" we also felt that an animal had the right positioning as helpful but not perfect , " said @entity77 in an email
" if we chose a human or a robot mascot people would spend their time trying to make it look stupid , but they 'd cut an animal more slack
" @entity55 recently announced it would soon shutter @entity70
users have until september 30 to retrieve their data
@entity114 @entity114 founders @entity115 and @entity116 crossed " spot " and " identify " when they named their digital music service
@entity120 " in the early days of the company , the name does n't really matter for anything
you always assume you 'll change it later ... you should be able to own a word for your company
you should not have any baggage associated with the name
" what we started doing is saying , we want to invent a word , we know that , so let 's just start making syllables without faces and when we have something that sounds good , check and see if the domain name is available ... we 'd just make these weird sounds and then run to the computer and see if it was available
we bought the domain name for $ 7
@entity142 @entity142 is named after ceo @entity144 's late @entity143 , @entity145
the name means @entity148 warrior princess
@entity149 from a spokesperson : the origin of the word " @entity149 " is shrouded in mystery
only our founder @entity154 knows for sure , and he often throws out red herrings
some widely - publicized ( and certainly fabricated ) versions of the story include : a reference to a magic word in a @entity163 film , the name of his grandmother 's favorite childhood pet , and something about a @entity170 directory , i think it 's " / etc , " pronounced " @entity172 " other fun facts ( some of which may actually be factual ) : phonetically , @entity149 has many homonyms too
it can mean : -- " and if " in @entity177 -- " horny " in @entity178 -- a slur for " loose woman " in @entity182 - speaking parts of @entity184 / @entity183 -- oh , and it rhymes with " @entity186
@entity187 @entity187 ceo @entity188 says the company picked @entity187 ( pronounced " skribbed " ) beause of its ties to writing and publishing
more interesting is how the coppany decided on the name of its mobile reader app , float
" we wanted something to highlight the floating reading experience , " @entity188 says
" namely , the idea of reading without boundaries
@entity18 after discarding names like " @entity207 " ( if there were a good travel deal , you 'd pounce , right ? ) and @entity210 ( travel , but true ) , @entity18 co-founder @entity208 was discussing the naming roadblock with his girlfriend
she suggested they go with a cute animal so that they could have a cool logo
@entity218 was auctioning for about $ 70 at a time , and so the name -- and admittedly adorable logo -- were born
