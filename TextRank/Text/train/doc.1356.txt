-- seven men were executed by beheading wednesday in @entity2 for stealing , according to @entity3 , the official @entity2 new agency
the deaths came a day after the @entity5 called for the kingdom not to carry out the punishment , in part because the men had allegedly not been given fair trials
the @entity5 said the men were reportedly accused of organizing a criminal group , armed robbery , raiding and breaking into jewelry stores in 2005
the @entity5 special rapporteur on torture , @entity16 , said there are also grave concerns that the men were tortured during detention and forced to sign confessions
" this is not the only in breach of @entity2 's international obligations under international law , which imposes an outright prohibition on torture , it is also in breach of the government 's international obligation under the convention against torture that explicitly forbids the use of all forms of torture for the purpose of extracting confessions or acquiring information , " he said
@entity3 issued a statement on behalf of the @entity39 that starts with a @entity41 verse from the chapter " @entity43
" " the punishment of those who wage war against @entity47 and his messenger , and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is : execution , or crucifixion , or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides , or exile from the land : that is their disgrace in this world , and a heavy punishment is theirs in the hereafter
" @entity0 's @entity65 contributed to this report .
