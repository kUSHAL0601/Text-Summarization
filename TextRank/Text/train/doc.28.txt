fossil fuels are going to run out
no one is entirely certain when they will run out exactly , but we know it will happen eventually
some estimates suggest we have about 70 years of coal , gas and oil left ; the fossil fuel industry itself insists that we have significantly longer
but everyone agrees they will run out in due course
so how will the world be powered when we ca n't rely anymore on fossil fuels ? why with volcanoes , waves , wet wood and solar power from space
to compensate for the decline of traditional energy sources , researchers around the world are developing innovative new technologies that -- between them -- may provide a long - term solution to our rapidly growing energy needs
some are familiar , some may seem far - fetched , and some could potentially pose as much of a threat to the environment as fossil fuels themselves
@entity34 takes a look through some of the more interesting and unusual energy technologies currently under development
solar energy from space the idea of collecting solar power from space has been under consideration since the 1970s
putting solar panels into orbit offers a few obvious advantages over regular solar power such as not having to deal with atmospheric interventions ( cloud cover and atmospheric gasses ) and not losing any productivity at night
in the past , trying to get a power plant to the edge of the @entity55 's atmosphere seemed deeply unlikely
but @entity56 , a former @entity57 engineer now with the @entity58 has been working on a project that he believes will make such an audacious idea simple : " the basic concept of the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) is to deploy a large platform in space near @entity55 , " @entity65 says , " typically in a high orbit where the sun shines almost constantly , where it would harvest sunlight , convert it into electricity and then transmit it to receivers on @entity55 for use
" read more : can @entity72 unlock its solar potential ? some have suggested that lasers could be used to transmit the energy from space
@entity56 says that in his view this is possible , but potentially dangerous ( " think about the @entity80 " he said ominously in an interview with @entity82 )
instead his project aims to use low - intensity microwave transmitters , which he believes will be safer
@entity56 says that the energy yield from a solar power satellite could be significant , potentially delivering up to 1,000 - 2,000 mw of power to the @entity55
to put it into perspective , he says " a typical home in the @entity91 requires about 4 - 5 kw of power , or about 100 kw - hours per day , or about 3,000 kw - hours per month , or about 36,000 kw - hours per year
so a single @entity62 ... would -- for example - deliver power / energy for roughly 240,000 - 480,000 homes
" some critics say the project would be prohibitively expensive or that getting something so large into space presents challenges
others note that the energy yield is still not high enough to make the project worthwhile
still , the fact that it is being considered by @entity57 lends it significant weight
so perhaps it is not so out of this world after all
mining volcanoes for power last year , work began on a new plan to extract heat from the hot rocks that lie under and around volcanoes
by injecting water into cracks in the ground , researchers hope that they may be able to create steam to power subterranean electricity turbines
two companies , @entity120 and @entity121 , were granted permission to test this procedure in the land around the @entity125 in @entity126 , in a process that critics argue is not dissimilar to the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing
read more : nuclear fusion is the ' perfect energy source ' over the past 12 months hydraulic fracturing or fracking has been the subject of protests around the world , but in fact it has been around since the 1960s
the ceo of @entity120 , @entity140 , said in a company blog post that " creating multiple reservoirs from a single injection multiplies the amount of energy that can be extracted from each production well , " and will " extend the life of the well and increase the energy recovery from each well , significantly improving the economics of enhanced geothermal system power generation
" but fracking is known to potentially generate earthquakes , and -- as noted by @entity154 -- practicing a similar technique beneath a volcano that the @entity156 says " is certain to erupt again " seems an odd choice
whether the technique can yield significant energy return , and be conducted safely is still a matter of debate as heated as the @entity125 itself
wave energy wave energy is already being used across the world
billions of dollars have been invested in the technology and the world 's first " wave farm " opened near @entity169 in @entity170 in 2008
at the @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 , the world 's biggest wave farm was approved for construction earlier this year
the @entity178 farm off the north - west coast of @entity180 promises to deliver enough energy to power nearly 30,000 homes
wave farms deploy massive buoys to turn the motion of waves into power
@entity188 the company running the project in @entity174 , says that its huge yellow buoys have " a maximum generating capacity of @entity193
" the bright yellow machines measures 26 meters across and are installed at a depth of around 13 meters , around 500 meters from the shore
the advantages of wave power are similar to those of wind -- the waves are free -- but there are some additional benefits
in particular , it 's easier to forecast wave energy output , because waves are driven by wind , but do n't vary as rapidly ; they build up more slowly and dissipate more gradually
that makes the energy from waves more predictable than that from wind or solar , which means that it is easier to integrate into the power grid
at present the @entity216 is the world leader in the technology , with the @entity91 , @entity170 and @entity219 also significant players
pocket particle accelerators researchers working in a laboratory in @entity224 , @entity216 believe that their pint - sized particle accelerator -- like the @entity226 in @entity227 but much smaller -- could offer a genuine alternative to fossil fuels
powered by thorium , a naturally occurring radioactive substance , the small scale collider could generate significant amounts of energy
the @entity235 estimates that just one ton of thorium could " produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium , or 3.5 million tons of coal
" " the idea of thorium reactors is one that is under a lot of discussion these days ; clearly the physics will work , " says @entity56
but he notes that there are always hazards in using nuclear material
" even though it certainly would be safer than past nuclear reactor approaches , it seems likely to me that governments are not going to want a lot of radioactive material on the highways
" wet leaves and damp wood biomass power involves the breakdown of biological material -- such as leaves and wood -- to produce gasses like hydrogen and methane , which in turn can be burned
the problem with some existing biomass power plants is that they need the biological materials to be dry
@entity270 , a @entity271 inventor , has come up with a new type of biomass furnace that can trap moisture from damp materials and export it as hot water
@entity278 believes this could allow his new furnace to generate up to 30 % more energy
read more : solar power when the sun has set " what 's unique about biomass , " says @entity270 , " is that you can store it
you never really know when the wind is blowing
with biomass we have the control to use it when we need it
" " @entity291 is the resource we have most of in @entity271 , " @entity293 and energy minister @entity294 told @entity34 , " and we need biomass and biogas to have the back up for when the wind stops blowing
" critics argue that burning biomass contributes carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , but its proponents suggest that such damage can be offset by growing crops specifically to be burned
a viable alternative ? one of the most substantial indicators of the viability of alternative energies can be seen in the growth in investment from venture capitalists and other private investors
@entity313 , from the @entity314 , notes that venture capital investments in clean energy went from less than $ 100 million a year in the late 1990s to over $ 10 billion a year in 2011
" in the year 2000 , most alternative energy technologies were considered niche options that might one day show promise -- now they 're multi-billion dollar industries , significant enough to precipitate serious trade disputes between the @entity91 , @entity324 and @entity325 , " @entity313 says
government investment has shown a similar pattern , but significant public and private sector research money is still going into fossil fuels
new extraction and processing technologies for coal , oil and gas are still the main focus of private sector research and development
however many experts , @entity313 included , believe that this may change by 2025 when alternative energies could finally stop being regarded as " alternative
