-- on june 15 , president @entity1 described the @entity3 oil spill in a prime - time address as " the worst environmental disaster @entity6 has ever faced
" a government report released last week , however , said almost 75 percent of the oil that gushed from @entity9 's ruptured well into the @entity3 has been collected , dispersed or evaporated
the rest remains on or just below the surface of the water in the form of a light sheen or weathered tar balls
much of the remaining oil is " being degraded and cleaned up on the shore , " said @entity17 , head of the @entity18
" many of the doomsday scenarios that were talked about and repeated a lot have not and will not come to fruition , " @entity21 press secretary @entity20 has said
so was the oil spill really " the worst environmental disaster " in @entity6 history ? disasters are hard to rank and tricky to compare , historians say , but they cite several calamities that rival or surpass the @entity3 oil spill in terms of lives lost or affected
in 1889 , for example , a poorly maintained dam collapsed , sending a wall of water crashing through @entity37 , @entity38
the flood killed over 2,200 people and destroyed 1,600 homes
historians also cite what happened in blue - collar community of @entity45 , @entity46 , which was built atop more than 20,000 tons of chemical waste and linked to high rates of cancer and birth defects
hundreds of families were ultimately forced to flee
in terms of permanently disrupting a way of life for the largest number of @entity6 , historians say , nothing compares to the @entity58 , a slow - motion disaster sparked by years of shortsighted farming practices and serious drought
native grasses across the country 's heartland were torn up , leaving little to hold the topsoil in place
when the winds kicked up , dust storms turning the sky black could be seen as far away as @entity46
about 2.5 million people fled the @entity70 in one of the largest migrations in @entity6 history
that devastated the region 's agriculture economy
" the entire way of life of the @entity83 moved away from agriculture for a time , " said @entity79 , an environmental historian at @entity80
historians do not dispute the enormity of the damage caused by the @entity88 , which killed 11 people , bruised local and regional economies and caused damage that may not be apparent for years
it was " plainly the greatest oil spill disaster " in @entity6 history , according to @entity94 , director of programs for the @entity95 , a progressive advocacy group
nearly 206 million gallons of oil gushed into the @entity3 after an explosion sank @entity9 's @entity99 drilling rig in april , compared with 11 million gallons of crude that seeped from the @entity102 into @entity104 's @entity103 in 1989
the @entity102 spill was devastating , @entity79 said
the local ecosystem and fishing communities never fully recovered
yet " the use of dispersants , the formation of plumes deep under water , and the unique ecology of the @entity3 each make ( the @entity9 ) spill more disastrous , " he said
the @entity3 oil disaster ranks as the largest recorded maritime oil spill in @entity6 history -- and the largest accidental oil spill into water in world history , topped only by @entity122 's intentional release of 240 million gallons of oil into the @entity124 during the @entity125
in 1910 and 1911 , though , more oil spilled onto land in @entity128 as a result of the @entity130 , the consequence of a 1910 well explosion in @entity128 's @entity133
nearly 380 million gallons are believed to have spilled over nearly a year and a half
that spill , though , directly affected relatively few people and had " a less complicated ecological impact , " @entity79 said
so how does the @entity3 oil spill compare with the infamous 1889 @entity139 , an event memorialized in @entity6 songs and books ? the collapse of @entity143 sent about 20 million tons of water toward the @entity38 steel town , built on a flood plain between two rivers
it 's tough to compare @entity37 's broken dam with the @entity3 's broken oil well , but they 're similar in the sense that they 're both at least partly the product of a similar sense of ethics -- or lack thereof , @entity79 said
the 19th century robber barons behind the dam -- @entity159 and @entity160 -- ignored and did not properly maintain the dam , he said
@entity9 stands similarly accused of placing safety concerns behind financial considerations , an assertion the company has denied
" that 's a very good illustration of the ethics that predominated then and now , " @entity79 argued
" at times , big oil 's ethical culture is not too different from @entity159 's and @entity160 's , and it 's allowed to exist that way because we depend so much on big oil
" of course , the long - term impact of the @entity3 spill is still unknown
local residents can be optimistic because oil is a naturally occurring substance , @entity79 said
that means the region eventually will recover , though recovery may come too late for many businesses
one neighborhood that may never wholly recover : @entity45 -- now a synonym for environmental disaster in the @entity6
purchased from the @entity188 for $ 1 in 1953 , the community 's contaminated land was linked to unusually high cancer and birth defect rates , among other things
the federal government declared an emergency in the late 1970s as hundreds of families were forced to evacuate
the incident led to the passage of the @entity197 , designed to make polluters cover the costs of cleaning up contaminated areas
though the @entity203 declared @entity45 clean in 2004 , skepticism about its safety has lingered
fewer people may have been affected by @entity45 than by the @entity3 spill , but petroleum is " not quite as corruptive as the toxins were at @entity45 , " @entity79 said ; chemicals and radioactive materials can pose a potentially greater long term risk
the bottom line : it 's tough to rank environmental calamities
" we ca n't appreciate the magnitude of ( some disasters ) until their results and implications have had time to play out , " @entity79 said
" grand statements " such as @entity1 's " miss a very important point : this very bad situation resulted from doing business as usual in the petroleum industry
such events could occur any time the industry pursues such deep water wells as long as regulation is lax
" once something crosses a threshold of being a disaster , then it 's the worst one of that type in its own way , " he said
" the lesson should always be how can we prevent it from happening again
