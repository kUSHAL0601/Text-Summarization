internet use has skyrocketed in @entity2 , especially among teens
and @entity2 parents have turned to hundreds of training camps that offer to wean their children -- mostly teenagers -- from excessive internet use
there are at least 400 private rehabilitation clinics or camps in the country , according to a recent survey by the @entity24 , adding that @entity2 has 10 million teenage web addicts
but the @entity2 @entity26 says none of the private rehab clinics are legally registered

his parents accused a counselor at the camp and @entity31 's peers of repeatedly hitting him , @entity2 media said , adding that particular camp has been closed
" he is suffering from water on the lungs and kidney failure , " @entity31 's father , @entity48 , told the publication @entity50 on wednesday
" all injuries were done by the people at the camp
" the training center denied that a counselor beat the youth , contending @entity31 was hit by other campers because he could n't get along with them , @entity50 reported
authorities in @entity63 , where the camp is located , said they detained the counselor after a report of alleged abuse from the parents of another child
the man who established the military - style camp , @entity72 , admitted to the @entity73 that youngsters were sometimes subjected to " physical punishment

" internet addiction is treatable
through about three months ' treatment , 80 percent of the patients can get away from the addiction , " @entity126 has said
some youths are so immersed in chat rooms and online games that they drop out of school , he added
" they are suffering from depression , nervousness , fear and unwillingness to interact with others , panic and agitation
they also have sleep disorders , the shakes and numbness in their hands , " @entity126 said
one authority on internet use in @entity2 said she has known several college students there who are wildly enthusiastic about the @entity142
" when they 've come to the @entity176 , they 've all been hooked on the social networking sites , " said @entity171 , associate director of the @entity172 at the @entity173
" no matter what time it is , you can always find somebody online
" the internet can easily become compulsive behavior for anyone with an addictive personality , @entity171 said .
