the @entity4 administration and its allies believe the @entity7 government may have used chlorine gas in a deadly attack this month on its own people , several @entity1 officials and other diplomats told @entity11
the alleged assault that killed at least two and affected dozens of others occurred in the village of @entity16 , a rebel - held area
while there is no firm proof as the matter is being looked into , several @entity1 officials and @entity19 diplomats say the @entity1 believes the regime of @entity24 is responsible because it has such chemicals and the means to deliver them
" our assessment is it is , at a minimum , concentrated chlorine dropped from helicopters , " a @entity1 official said
" that could only be the regime
" the official did not speak for full attribution
if true , such an attack would spotlight a deal brokered by @entity37 last fall and approved by the @entity38 that requires @entity7 to surrender its chemical weapons to the international community
the agreement quieted threats of military action by the @entity1 over allegations @entity7 launched a chemical attack last august outside @entity46 that killed more than 1,400 people
@entity48 and other officials vehemently denied their forces were responsible
the @entity7 opposition , which does not have helicopters to carry and deliver such weapons , and the regime have been trading accusations about the april 11 incident for more than a week
controversy followed video clips posted on anti-government websites showing a number of civilians , including children , appearing to have difficulty breathing and using oxygen masks
the chemical symbol for chlorine ( @entity67 ) is visible on the side of a canister that opposition activists say was used in the attack
" there are indications that these substances maybe have been used by the regime , but it has to be verified , " one @entity19 diplomat said
@entity79 spokeswoman @entity78 conveyed @entity19 suspicions on monday
she said the @entity1 " had indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical , probably chlorine , in @entity7 this month , in the opposition - dominated village of @entity87
" " we 're examining allegations that the government was responsible , " @entity78 said
chlorine is not listed as a chemical @entity7 is expected to give up under the @entity38 resolution
but its use as a weapon of war is prohibited under the @entity98 , of which @entity7 is a signatory
" you do n't have to use sarin and mustard to terrorize a population , " another official said of deadly chemical gases
" and you do n't have to kill a lot of people to terrorize the population
" @entity1 officials and @entity19 and @entity112 diplomats point to several incidents over the last month suggesting the use of toxic gases , seen as particularly effective in sowing panic and fear in rebel - held areas
officials say there now is a debate within the administration about how to respond
the matter is likely to be referred for investigation to the @entity126 , the global body charged with eliminating @entity7 's stockpiles
the latest revelation poses a new dilemma for the administration on @entity7 , where civil war continues to rage
while chlorine is not as poisonous as chemicals like mustard gas or sarin , it would violate of @entity7 's international obligations
while some of the administration feel a strong response is needed , officials said others are concerned a robust response would complicate ongoing cooperation with @entity7 on its more dangerous stockpiles
" there is not a consensus , " another @entity1 official said
" some would like to be stronger and some are more cautious
it ca n't go answered but if we equate it to a chemical attack then the question becomes what are we going to do about it ? and i do n't think we have figured that out yet
" sen. @entity159 , who has been sharply critical of the administration 's @entity7 policy , said in a statement the latest allegations are troubling
" it is essential that the @entity4 administration work with the international community to fully and immediately investigate these reports
if substantiated , it is clear that such attacks violate the spirit of the @entity1 agreement with @entity37 for the destruction of @entity7 's chemical weapons and the @entity24 regime must finally be held accountable for it actions , " the @entity169 @entity168 said .
