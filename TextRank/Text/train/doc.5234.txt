@entity0 -- " i have a bomb ! " a wheelchair bound man shouted , holding what looked like a homemade bomb
" stay away from me
" minutes earlier , @entity8 had wheeled himself into @entity10 's arrivals terminal
as he began to distribute leaflets to publicize his cause , he was stopped by airport security
arriving passengers walked past him , seemingly oblivious to the looming danger
@entity8 had written on his personal blog in 2006 that he had been attacked and beaten by security guards outside a police station in @entity19 in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle
he was paralyzed after the incident and petitioned for official compensation
shortly after his standoff with airport security , the disgruntled petitioner detonated his device , causing a minor explosion and injuring his arm
a policeman also suffered minor injuries but there were no other casualties , except perhaps @entity35 's fragile facade of stability
sympathy the country 's mainstream and social media covered the explosion and its aftermath
rather than decry what was an act of terror , many people sympathized with @entity8 -- some even depicted him as a hero for warning people away before setting off the bomb
but an editorial in the state - controlled @entity48 this week stated that although cases like @entity8 's were sad , extremism by victims was not " tolerable
" " it 's important to remember that @entity8 should be condemned and dealt with by law
his grievances ca n't provide moral support for his extreme actions , nor can they shield him from legal punishment , " the editorial stated
" behind extreme crimes at the cost of self - harm , there are often unfortunate stories of suffering and tears
we support and call for the authorities to investigate those sad stories and consider investigation to be an important element that can not be neglected when tackling extreme cases
" central concern authorities will also be worried that @entity8 's act may spawn similar actions @entity8 's act was the latest in a number of incidents involving petitioners airing grievances and seeking social justice
in 2011 , @entity80 , a 52 - year - old unemployed man , set off consecutive explosions in three government buildings in @entity84 province , killing two -- including the bomber himself -- and injuring ten people
@entity80 , it turned out , had been trying to seek redress for the loss of his property , which he claimed was illegally demolished by local authorities
" ten years of fruitlessly trying to seek redress have forced me to go on a path i did not wish to make , " he had posted on @entity93 , @entity35 's @entity94 - like microblog
while these sad tales have become more frequent , they are not new
i 've seen this replayed many times
annual petition the @entity103 practice of going to @entity0 to " shangfang " ( petition ) is centuries old , dating back to the days when aggrieved citizens could petition the emperor
every year , ahead of the annual meeting of @entity35 's legislature in @entity0 , police take away thousands of petitioners from around the country seeking redress for problems with local officials
many of them phone media offices like ours to seek help , or to simply vent their frustrations
every month or so , we receive packets in the mail containing handwritten accounts and pictures , recounting their sad stories
@entity35 is grappling with an acknowledged rise in social unrest , sparked by public anger over land grabs without proper compensation , official corruption , the growing gap between the rich and the poor and environmental damage
abusive behavior allegations of official abuse and police brutality are common
spontaneous riots are also frequent
in central @entity140 province , for example , watermelon vendor @entity136 , 56 , recently died after he and his wife were beaten up by six officers of " chengguan , " the @entity145 forces , prompting online uproar and detention of the officers
such abusive behavior has put the spotlight on the problem of the " chengguan , " the para-police agency tasked with enforcing non-criminal city regulations
although it has no legal authority to detain suspects , critics say , they frequently do so and sometimes even resort to " enhanced interrogation
" they confiscate merchandise and impose arbitrary fines , leading critics to suspect corruption
they are also known to collude with property developers to evict people
growing discontent human rights groups have called on the @entity103 government to clip the chengguan 's powers and investigate its violent acts
" the chengguan are not protecting the safety of @entity103 citizens , they 're actively undermining it , " said @entity174 , @entity35 director at @entity175
" the @entity103 government can signal that it 's serious about meaningful rule of law by ending chengguan abuses and impunity
" the @entity103 leadership recognizes the risks posed by growing social discontent , but seems unable to find fundamental solutions
it fears that political liberalization might lead to massive " dongluan " ( chaos )
such fear drives the @entity103 leaders to seemingly contradictory policies and behavior
instead of addressing legitimate complaints , officials tend to resort to force and intimidation
many cities have set up elite police squads to deal with riots and " terrorism
" they say they encourage " whistleblowers " to expose abuses , but when they aim at abusive officials , they get muzzled
@entity210 , one of @entity35 's most influential bloggers , recently had his @entity93 account suspended after he posted a pointed essay about @entity8 's case
@entity8 , 34 , had long been silenced by a system that tolerates little dissent , he said
' festering away ' the @entity19 native has been paralyzed since 2005 , when he was allegedly beaten up by several " chengguan " officers while working as an unlicensed motorcycle driver in southern @entity221 province
he was suing for damages , asking for over 334,000 yuan ( about us $ 53,000 ) but to no avail
" i am now festering away , paralyzed and over 100,000 yuan in debt , " he posted on his blog that has since been deleted
" the only thing that is keeping me going is the thought of seeking justice
" in desperation , @entity8 brought his struggle for justice to @entity0 , adding his voice to the chorus of discontent
@entity103 political scientist @entity235 says @entity103 leaders can ignore this rising chorus at their own peril
" the airport bombing shows that when people are hopeless they will resort to more violence , " he explained
" it 's dangerous because next time someone will think , if no one listens , take even more radical steps , then your voice can reach the top and your case can be solved
" @entity210 , author of the book " @entity252 of @entity253 in @entity35 , " believes the old petition system has very limited role
" the @entity103 government should give people more space , to be able to speak out and participate in local affairs
it 's a good way to defuse the anger of the people , " said the @entity0 - based political scientist
" otherwise there will just be more and more protests
