@entity0 , @entity1 friday for a black @entity13 watermelon -- grown only on the northern @entity1 island of @entity15
premium melons regularly go for eye - popping amounts there
only three years ago , someone shelled out about $ 3,000 for one
the one that sold friday had dark green skin -- nearly black -- making it look more like a bowling ball than a fruit
the nearly 18 - pound ( 8 kg ) watermelon was one of 68 sold as part of the season 's initial harvest this year and is one of only a few thousand available each year
as for the buyer , he said he wanted to support local agriculture , according to an official with a local cooperative .
