-- six people were killed and 13 wounded in the shelling of @entity2 by @entity6 forces , @entity2 officials said saturday , according to @entity9 's @entity8 news agency
officials of the breakaway @entity6 region said the shelling was part of a @entity6 military operation , @entity8 reported
@entity6 initially suggested @entity9 peacekeepers were to blame , drawing heated denials from the @entity17 , which called the allegation " dirty informational provocation
" later , however , @entity20 , the commander of @entity6 peacekeeping operations , told reporters that four people were wounded when several @entity6 villages were fired upon from @entity2 , and @entity6 " had to return fire
" women , children and the elderly were being evacuated from the conflict zone because of fears that @entity6 would continue military operations against the region , according to the @entity33 as reported by @entity8
@entity2 's government held a special session on the violence , the @entity9 news agency said
" if @entity6 continues provocative actions , we will announce the recruitment of volunteers not only in the @entity43 but in the entire @entity44 and also carry out general mobilization in @entity2 , " @entity2 leader @entity38 told @entity8
@entity6 , located on the @entity47 coast between @entity9 and @entity48 , has been split by @entity9 - backed separatist movements in @entity2 and another region , @entity51
accusations often fly on both sides , and the @entity2 leadership has alleged that @entity6 troops stage attacks to create a pretext for military action
@entity2 declared its independence from @entity6 in the early 1990s after a bloody war there between ethnic @entity6 and @entity61
the region 's independence is not internationally recognized
@entity9 , @entity6 and @entity2 troops participate in a mixed peacekeeping force there and have maintained a fragile peace broken occasionally by fighting
on friday , as reports of the shelling began , @entity9 expressed " its most serious concern about the escalation of tensions in @entity2
" @entity72 said it was taking measures to prevent escalation of the conflict as it urged both @entity6 and @entity2 to look for diplomatic ways to calm the situation .
