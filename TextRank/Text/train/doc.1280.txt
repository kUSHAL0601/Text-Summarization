-- the @entity1 knew had almost nothing to do with the @entity1 as portrayed in most media
the @entity1 knew was a man who had served his country honorably as @entity7 's vice president at the height of the @entity9 , when @entity7 kept us at peace for eight years -- with @entity1 's help -- only to have the 1960 election stolen away from him by handsome , rich @entity15 's fraud at the polls in @entity17
@entity1 had endured eight years of seeing the country disintegrate into chaos in the streets and an endless , hopeless war in @entity22 under a genuinely great but very misled president , @entity23
when @entity1 won in 1968 , he embarked on a presidency in which he never once had control of both houses of @entity27
he faced an endless bitter assault from the media and from the so - called intellectuals -- the " pointy - headed " intellectuals , as @entity32 aptly called them nevertheless , he ended the war in @entity22 , brought home the pows and calmed the wild streets
more than that , he saved @entity38 when it was threatened with annihilation by its neighbors , sending a massive airlift of arms to @entity38 during the @entity43
@entity1 gave unequivocal support to @entity38 : @entity23 could not have cared less about its fate
@entity1 opened relations with @entity48 that greatly sobered up @entity49 and allowed the @entity50 to become the world 's dominant power and peacekeeper for a generation
this was the key event in ending the @entity9
by " encircling " the @entity57 and signaling that if @entity58 began a war against either the @entity50 or @entity48 , he would face a dreaded two - front war , he showed @entity49 that its hopes of global domination were not going to work
to soothe matters with the still extremely dangerous @entity49 bear , he even signed a strategic arms limitation treaty with the @entity57
his goal , as he often explained to me and others on his staff , was to create " a generation of peace
he gave us the longest sustained period of peace since @entity76 when the @entity49 were kicked out of @entity78 -- just as we are about to be -- the encircled @entity49 domination machine simply ran out of gas
will it revive ? no. but it is a menace anyway
@entity1 was tortured , abused , beat up by the @entity82 , but through it all , above all , he was a peacemaker , a trait he inherited from his @entity86 mother
if we no longer have to fear @entity49 icbms screaming out of hell to start nuclear war , we can thank the shade of @entity1
he was startlingly progressive in domestic affairs as well
he sent up to @entity27 the first proposal for universal health care
i wrote the message sending it to @entity27 -- where @entity98 promptly killed it
he proposed a national energy policy far greener than anyone had ever imagined a conservative would go
again , @entity27 killed it
in his personal relations with me and with my father , who was his chairman of the @entity106 , and with my mother , his most devout fan and a friend and admirer of @entity111 as well , he was the soul of kindness , concern and politesse
he brought up two of the most wonderful women on the planet , @entity119 and @entity120
he was a wit and a trustworthy confidant
why did the media hate him so much ? i have always thought it was because he was vulnerable and showed it when attacked
he did not have the tough hide of a @entity127 or an @entity128
like the schoolyard bullies they are , the media went after him for his vulnerability
but let 's look at him with fresh eyes
unlike @entity23 , he did not get us into a large , unnecessary war on false pretenses
unlike @entity137 , he did not bring call girls and courtesans into the @entity140 or try to kill foreign leaders
unlike @entity142 , he did not lead us into a war for which we were unprepared
he helped with a coverup of a mysterious burglary that no one understands to this day
that was his grievous sin , and grievously did he answer for it
but to me , @entity1 will always be visionary , friend and peacemaker
and i will never turn my back on a peacemaker .
