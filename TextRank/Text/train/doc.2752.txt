@entity0 -- the @entity2 is preparing new sanctions against members of the @entity6 regime of @entity7 who are overseeing the violent crackdown against protesters , according to several senior @entity2 officials with knowledge of the action
a new @entity14 executive order targeting senior officials accused of human rights abuses would involve an asset freeze and travel ban , as well as prohibiting them them from doing business in the @entity2
on monday , @entity22 spokesman @entity21 said the @entity2 is " pursuing a range of possible policy options , including targeted sanctions , to respond to the crackdown and make clear that this behavior is unacceptable
" the move comes as the @entity30 administration weighs its options on how to step up pressure against the @entity7 regime
sanctions are among " a range of possible options " to pressure the @entity6 government to stop attacking protesters , @entity35 spokesman @entity34 said monday
" what we have seen is that sanctions can put pressure on governments and regimes to change their behavior , " @entity34 said
a meeting of the @entity49 at the @entity35 on friday explored what additional unilateral sanctions the @entity2 could impose against @entity6 and other actions the @entity2 could take , including a possible on - camera statement by president @entity30
there have been numerous reports of deadly violence over the past several days
on sunday , at least three protesters were killed when security forces and secret police raided the town of @entity60 on @entity6 's western coast and fired at demonstrators without warning , according to a witness and demonstrator
security forces surrounded a mosque that was being used to treat the wounded , preventing 18 seriously wounded people from being hospitalized , according to a doctor inside
on saturday , at least 10 people died after @entity6 security forces opened fire on mourners at funeral processions in @entity75 and the southern town of @entity77 , according to witness accounts
@entity79 reported at least 75 deaths across the country friday
the decision to step up pressure comes amid increased fears of further bloodshed
" we are worried he is dropping all pretenses of reform and carrots and sticks and is going to go out hard with all sticks , " one official said
" we are expecting him to increase the crackdown
" on friday , the @entity35 released a statement by @entity30 condemning " in the strongest possible terms the use of force by the @entity6 government against demonstrators
" " this outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now , " @entity30 said
the @entity106 is expected to call in the @entity6 ambassador to the @entity2 to protest the violence , and @entity109 , the @entity2 ambassador to @entity6 , was protesting the crackdown to foreign ministry officials in @entity112 , officials said
the administration had taken a somewhat muted response to the crackdown in @entity6 out of fear of destabilizing the @entity7 regime
officials have voiced concern about possible sectarian tensions if @entity7 's @entity122 minority were to be overthrown and have expressed little confidence about @entity6 's fragmented opposition , leaving uncertainty about what type of government would replace @entity7
the @entity2 has also been under pressure from @entity130 and allies in the @entity132 like @entity133 and the @entity134 , who fear that @entity7 's departure could produce a more radical @entity6 and encourage further revolutions , officials said
however , as the crackdown in @entity6 has intensified , several @entity2 officials and @entity140 diplomats have described the regime as increasingly brittle and predicted that it would be hard for @entity7 to survive
officials acknowledge that the @entity2 has little leverage on @entity6 , which has proved immune to @entity2 pressure during the protests
the @entity149 administration imposed strict sanctions against @entity112 in 2004 , including banning almost all imports and exports between the two countries and measures against individual officials believed to be supporting extremists fighting @entity2 forces in @entity158
it is unclear how effective a new round of sanctions would be
" it is n't the same with @entity164 , where we had relationships with the military and other institutions , " one official said
" we had aid we could use as a lever
there is n't a lot we can do with @entity6
we are pretty maxed out with sanctions
" officials said the @entity2 would be urging its @entity176 allies , who have also become increasingly concerned about the violence in @entity6 , to follow suit with measures of their own that could be more effective , given that @entity6 officials have more assets in @entity176 and travel there more frequently
but the sanctions would mark a shift in @entity2 policy toward @entity7 , whom the @entity30 administration had hoped would be a reformer and had tried to engage
since @entity30 took office , the @entity2 has eased some of the sanctions imposed by the @entity149 administration , and this year @entity30 returned a @entity2 ambassador to @entity6 after nearly six years
the @entity2 is also lobbying the @entity194 to address @entity6 's human rights abuses
on tuesday , the @entity194 @entity22 is expected to take up the issue , and @entity0 is seeking to block @entity6 's efforts to join the @entity198 in @entity199 , where members are meeting friday
@entity2 rep. @entity201 , @entity202 , chairwoman of the @entity203 , has said she will soon introduce legislation updating the @entity206 and @entity205 to strengthen @entity2 sanctions , including authorizing @entity2 assistance to support a transition to democracy in @entity6 .
