-- while the country 's been debating @entity3 and @entity4 , i 've been thinking about @entity5 , where a staggering 59 % of women are subjected to sexual or intimate partner violence , including threats of violence , in their lives
@entity4 expanded recently on the allegation that @entity3 , maker of the films " @entity14 " and " @entity15 , " sexually assaulted her as a young girl
she stared at a toy train set while it happened , she wrote in a blog post for the @entity20
toy trains still haunt her
the truth in that long - debated case may never be known , and i do n't want to parse the details , since plenty of others have
but this much i can say for certain : if a survivor comes to you with a story of sexual abuse , you should start from a place of belief and compassion
not doing so can ruin a person 's life
related : the rapist next door and it can perpetuate a cycle of violence i saw all too clearly on a two - week trip to @entity5 , in december , as part of @entity0 's @entity45 project
readers of this column voted for me to cover rape in the @entity50 state where that crime is most frequent
progress has been made to reduce rape rates nationwide , but @entity5 still has the highest reported rape rate in the country , according to 2012 @entity57 crime estimates
the rate is three times the national average
( you can read more about the trip at @entity62
) in one @entity5 town , i spent several days with a rapist who was sexually abused as a child
when he came forward to tell his parents about it his dad punished him , pulled his ears , and told him never to speak of it again
related map : reported rape by state he did n't
not until he served jail time for abusing his stepdaughter
" i 've got to be a man , " he thought
" and carry this with me alone
" another offender told me he hid his own abuse for six decades
for rape and sexual violence to end , victims have to break their painful silence and , perhaps more importantly for everyone reading this , the rest of us have to be ready to listen
too often , friends and law enforcement officers are inclined to blame the victim or question them with unfair harshness
as women 's rights advocates have told me , rape and sex abuse victims are extremely traumatized by these crimes
that may affect the way they remember events -- the timeline may appear in clouded fragments -- and they way they react to questions that would be innocuous in other situations
related : the lawless ' end of the land ' the safe way to have these conversations is n't immediately obvious
you should never ask a rape victim , for example , what she was wearing when the assault occurred
was he or she drinking ? that question , too , can be damaging in the aftermath of an assault
it implies the victim 's actions may have instigated the rape
no matter the intention , it implies someone other than the rapist is to blame
the most important thing , according to groups like the @entity132 , is to " listen , " " be there , " and " do n't be judgmental
" exercising this sensitivity can help ensure more rapes are prosecuted , too
currently , according to @entity132 's founder and president , @entity140 , only 40 % of rapes in the @entity50 are reported to authorities , and only 3 % result in jail time
all of us can encourage survivors to come forward safely
many of you took the brave step of sharing your stories as part of a project we 're calling " we are the 59 %
" in solidarity with that percentage of @entity5 women who suffer from intimate partner or sexual violence , @entity153 asked readers to share their stories of survival -- in hopes that would be healing and might encourage others to speak out
the results were raw and powerful : " i laid there pretending to be asleep , too terrified to do anything
" " it was a well - kept family secret
" " i hoped that by cooperating it would be over quickly
" i spent an afternoon reading many of the responses ( you can see a selection of them here )
one of the most common and jarring themes : survivors often are n't believed
they have to turn to each other for support
" when the night seems endless and hope so hard to hold : please , do n't give up
you are not alone , " wrote @entity179 , a 50 - year - old in @entity181
if someone tells you about their experience with sexual violence or abuse , please take time to listen -- and to remind them they absolutely are not alone
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .
