@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 soldier accused of killing 16 @entity6 villagers in a shooting rampage is sitting in a military courtroom for the next week or more , hearing the evidence against him
the article 32 hearing began monday at @entity0 in @entity12 to determine if a trial is warranted for @entity15 staff sgt. @entity14 , who could get the death penalty if convicted
the deadly shooting spree near a small @entity4 base in @entity6 's @entity19 last march strained already tense @entity4 - @entity6 relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull out @entity4 troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal
" he committed a mass killing crime , and we would like the court in the @entity4 to implement justice and punish him according to the crime , " @entity24 , a spokesman for @entity6 president @entity25 , told @entity2 on monday
@entity33 acted with " chilling premeditation " and was " lucid , coherent and responsive " when he left the remote outpost and went from house to house , gunning down villagers , lt. col. @entity35 , the @entity15 's prosecutor , told the court
women and children were among the 16 dead and six wounded , authorities said
" nothing really justifies killing women and children in a noncombat situation , " @entity33 ' attorney , @entity44 , told @entity2 earlier
" but there may be explanations if that 's true

the soldiers drank moderately and did not get drunk , @entity55 said
@entity55 was awakened early the next morning and told @entity33 was missing from camp , he testified
the soldiers searched the camp for @entity33 , who re-appeared about 4:30 a.m. and was taken into custody , he said
sgt. @entity59 testified next , telling the court that @entity33 had awakened him at 2 a.m. and told him he had been in a nearby village and had " shot some people up
" @entity69 said he did n't believe @entity33 and he told him to let him get back to sleep because he had to go on duty in an hour
" i 'll be back at 5 , " he said @entity33 told him
" you got me ? " as @entity33 departed , he told @entity73 , " take care of my kids , " @entity59 testified
when @entity33 approached @entity59 and @entity55 after he was taken into custody he asked them " did you rat me out ? did you rat me out , man ? " @entity55 testified
@entity33 , who had blood on his uniform and face , said , " i thought i was doing the right thing , " @entity55 testified
while waiting for helicopter to take him away , @entity33 told @entity55 " it 's bad
it 's real bad , " @entity55 said
capt. @entity87 , the third witness , said that when he asked @entity33 what had happened after he surrendered , he replied , " i 'm sorry i let you down
" a crowd of @entity6 villagers gathered outside the camp as the sun began to rise that morning , @entity87 said
he was told their trucks were filled with people who had been shot , he said
" interpreters were spit on because the people knew they worked for @entity4 , " so the @entity4 soldiers stayed out of sight to avoid a confrontation , he testified
@entity102 said in a @entity104 interview that his client appeared to have memory problems predating the incident
" he has some memories about what happened before the alleged event and some memories after the alleged event and some windows here and there into things , but he really does n't have any memory , " @entity102 said
along with the 16 counts of premeditated murder , six counts of attempted murder and seven counts of assault , @entity33 is also charged with illicit use of alcohol and steroids
the steroid use will be a key factor in @entity128 ' defense , @entity102 said
" steroid use is going to be an issue in this case , especially where @entity33 got steroids and how he got steroids , " he told @entity2 last spring
@entity33 , who served three tours of duty in @entity138 before being sent to @entity6 , may have been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder , @entity102 said
@entity33 suffered a traumatic brain injury during a roadside bomb explosion and lost part of his foot in separate tours in @entity138 , he said
" anybody that has seen what he 's seen and done what he 's done at the request of the military -- and i 'm not talking about these allegations -- i think would have ptsd
... dragging parts of bodies around is not something you forget very often
" read more : soldier who allegedly killed 16 @entity6 engaged in financial fraud following @entity6 tradition , the 16 victims were buried soon after the deaths , before autopsies could be done
some legal experts have told @entity2 that could present a difficulty for prosecutors
but there were photographs taken of the victims and survivors who saw it happen
also , if any rounds were recovered from the scene and matched his weapon , they could be used as evidence against @entity33
the @entity178 , named after the section of the military code of justice that dictates how it works , is sort of a combination of a grand jury hearing and a preliminary hearing in a civilian criminal case
but there are significant differences
for instance , there will be significant testimony from many of the potential witnesses in the case , and unlike in a grand jury case , @entity33 and his attorney will be there and be able to cross-examine the witnesses against him or even present witnesses of their own

on some days , the hearing in @entity12 wo n't even begin until dinnertime , when the day is just beginning on the other side of the world in @entity6
in one other difference from civilian court , the person who acts as the judge in the case will not make a decision about whether the case should go to trial in a court - martial
he or she will make a recommendation to the officer who ordered that the hearing be held
that person will decide which , if any , charges @entity33 will face at trial and also whether prosecutors will pursue the death penalty in the case
