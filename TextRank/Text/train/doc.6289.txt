last week , president @entity0 came to my country , @entity3
president @entity4 and our people received him with great pride , but it is unlikely @entity0 heard anything about our government 's plan to give a great chunk of land that has been the @entity15 tribe 's home for millennia , to a hunting company from the @entity18 ( @entity18 )
the hunters want this land to kill our lions and leopards and this deal will take away 40 % of our grasslands and forested mountains that we call home
it threatens the wildlife and the @entity15 's very existence
we want @entity0 and the international community to know our story and help stop our eviction

the @entity38 moved us 50 years ago from what is now the @entity41 park and subsequent governments have consistently restricted our grazing rights
a large amount of land next to our community near the @entity41 has already been handed to the hunters from the @entity18
we often see @entity49 royalty arriving in their jumbo jets and then driving around in jeeps shooting anything they see moving and they keep wanting more
the government uses our faces on tourism posters and brochures for @entity3 , yet president @entity4 has said that our way of life is a thing of the past and we should live in the modern world
but without our land and our traditions , what are we ? most people in @entity69 raise cows and goats to pay for food and education for our children
without grazing lands , many @entity15 men have felt pressured to move to the city to take jobs as security guards
the women are left behind to raise our children and grandchildren and despite their hardship they are fighting to preserve our way of life

thousands of our men , women and children have traveled for days to meet government officials to state our case
three hundred @entity15 women marched on the capital @entity97 to protest , and in may , all of our community elders camped outside the prime minister 's office in the capital for three weeks , demanding the @entity18 deal be abandoned
we are sure our brothers and sisters across the world can help
after we started an international campaign with @entity109 more than 1.7 million people around the world joined our cause
today we are at home in our lands but fear that tens of thousands of villagers in our community could soon be evicted
a commitment from @entity4 can easily save us from the terrible fate that has befallen so many great tribes of the world
we know that the battle for our lands will not be easy , but as long as the government knows that the world is watching we will be safe
with that kind of attention , we have hope that our ancient way of life on our traditional lands will yet survive in the 21st century .
