-- with a probate court trial over the sale of the @entity5 scheduled to begin monday , lawyers for @entity2 filed paperwork thursday to have the matter moved to federal court
@entity2 's estranged wife , @entity9 , is asking a probate judge to approve an agreement she reached with billionaire @entity12 to sell the @entity14 team
for years , she and her husband had equal shares in the franchise through a family trust , but @entity19 negotiated a deal in late may to sell the team after two doctors declared her husband was mentally incapacitated
@entity2 's lawyers filed a notice of removal in @entity26 in central @entity27 requesting the change of courts
@entity19 's attorney called thursday 's legal maneuvering a " desperate act by a desperate man
" " this latest bad - faith maneuver on the eve of his reckoning is a cowardly ploy to do just one thing : kill a record - setting $ 2 billion sale of the @entity5 , " @entity40 said
@entity2 's court filing says a probate court is not the proper jurisdiction for the case
his lead attorney said his privacy rights have been violated
" as we have stated repeatedly and from the onset of this matter , it is our contention that @entity2 's privacy rights have been trampled by the release of his medical records , " attorney @entity48 said
" in our request for removal to federal court , we have reasserted that @entity2 's rights under @entity61 ( @entity61 ) and other federal privacy laws have been violated
" @entity40 called the claim " preposterous , " saying that @entity2 , who is a lawyer , authorized release of his medical records as a term of the trust
@entity12 's attorney , @entity67 , said in a statement that he would file for emergency relief in federal court to block the move , which he called frivolous
he predicted it would delay monday 's trial as they waited for a federal judge to respond to their request
a message on the @entity26 's website said it would be closed friday
@entity2 , 80 , has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend @entity83 was posted online in late april
the recording included a series of racist comments
@entity2 's comments , first posted on @entity88 , sparked outrage among @entity14 players , executives and fans
@entity14 commissioner @entity93 fined @entity2 $ 2.5 million and banned him for life from the @entity14
the @entity14 's board of governors , representatives from each of the 30 ownership groups , is scheduled to meet july 15 and could approve a sale then if the legal aspects of the deal are sorted out
for the team to be sold , either @entity2 would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree @entity19 acted legally in selling the team
@entity2 's mental capacity not issue for trial @entity2 accused of threatening to ' take out ' wife 's lawyer , sue doctors judge denies witness protection request by @entity2 's wife @entity0 's @entity115 and @entity116 contributed to this report .
