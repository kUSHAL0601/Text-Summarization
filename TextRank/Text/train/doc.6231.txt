@entity0 , the @entity1 subsidiary of @entity3 's @entity2 that publishes newspapers including @entity5 and @entity6 , announced a new name wednesday : news @entity1
the rebranding follows a troubled period for @entity0 , hit by a phone hacking scandal
it comes as @entity2 splits into two pieces , with one company encompassing its television and film assets , and the other holding its publishing entities
the separation into two distinct publicly traded companies , @entity20 and the new @entity2 , is expected friday
the new name for @entity0 , @entity0 , is " designed to convey a more coherent and logical identity for the new parent company across the globe , " a company statement said
the rebranding is being mirrored in @entity27 , where @entity28 -- the company from which @entity3 built up his media empire -- will become known as @entity2 @entity27
both companies will become part of the new @entity2 ,
which will be incorporated on the @entity34 on friday , the @entity0 statement said
" the change follows the fundamental changes of governance and personnel that have taken place to address the problems of the recent past , " it said
" @entity0 apologized to its victims and set up a compensation scheme ; closed the @entity45 and co-operated with all the relevant authorities
" new policies and procedures are in place across the company , its main titles are all under new leadership and the executive team has been transformed
" @entity0 was forced to close @entity45 , its bestselling sunday tabloid , in july 2011 amid anger over allegations an investigator working for the paper had in 2002 hacked the voice mail of a missing 13 - year - old girl , @entity59 , who was later found murdered
since then , a number of former @entity0 staff have been charged with criminal offenses and await trial
they include @entity65 , the former @entity45 and @entity5 editor who served as chief executive of @entity0 from 2009 until 2011 , and former @entity45 editor @entity69 , who went on to work for prime minister @entity70 but subsequently resigned
several journalists working for @entity5 have also been charged in connection with two police investigations into alleged media abuses
one inquiry is looking into claims of phone hacking , while the other is probing allegations of inappropriate payments to police and public officials
in a sign of an editorial shakeup at the newspaper , @entity85 was replaced as editor of @entity5 last week
@entity85 , who had been at the paper for 17 years and was its editor since 2009 , is moving to a senior role advising the chief executive of the new @entity2 @entity94 took over as editor of @entity5 on monday
@entity96 , chief executive of @entity0 , said : " this is an exciting time and i feel privileged to be leading @entity0 as it begins a bright new chapter
