@entity0 , @entity1 -- at least 12 people have died in clashes between @entity1 police and members of an exiled @entity9 opposition group at an @entity1 refugee camp , a group spokesman told @entity2 friday
@entity1 police block entrances to @entity13 in @entity14 on july 29
a police raid at @entity13 in @entity14 province tuesday led to fighting with members of the group -- the @entity20 's @entity19 of @entity9
along with the deaths , there have been reports of several hundred injuries
the @entity25 was allied with @entity26 in @entity1 during the 1980s with a goal of toppling the @entity9 regime
but since @entity26 's overthrow in 2003 , @entity1 has established good relations with the @entity9 government
@entity9 wants to see the camp shut down , and the @entity1 government has said it would close the facility after it got control of the camp from the @entity37 this year
residents in the camp are concerned about being forcibly turned over to @entity9
people there said they would be willing to go back to @entity9 but only if there are assurances its members wo n't be mistreated
the @entity25 official also said 35 people are missing , and there are fears that they were to be forcibly taken back to @entity9
the fighting is over now , and @entity1 police have control of the entrances to the camp and its intersections and streets
it also has control of the camp 's power station and water purification plant , the @entity25 official said
@entity62 , the human rights monitoring group , wants the @entity1 government " to investigate the apparent excessive use of force by its security forces
" the group said " armed security forces used bulldozers to force their way into the camp " and they " used tear gas , water cannons and batons against unarmed residents who tried to stop them from entering the camp
" the @entity37 and @entity9 say the group is a terrorist organization
@entity62 said in most cases the " terrorist " designation pinned on the @entity25 by most entities -- such as the @entity81 and other governments -- has been shelved because the group " no longer advocates or engages in armed opposition to the government of @entity9
" meanwhile , at least 29 civilians died in @entity0 on friday when roadside bombs exploded near four @entity90 mosques , an @entity92 official said
