we 're only two days into this government shutdown , but it already seems like we 've been here before
and in a way , we have
the @entity4 and @entity5 got in each other 's faces over the @entity9 debt ceiling in 2011
the @entity10 demanded significant budget cuts before agreeing to give @entity12 more borrowing power
that amounted to $ 2 trillion in cuts over 10 years
but @entity16 never could agree on where to make the cuts , so they were implemented across - the - board
the package averted a shutdown then , but did n't soothe the hard feelings created by the standoff
plus , add this to the mix : the tea party ca n't stand @entity26
they do n't like it , never will
with that history in mind , here 's what we know and what we do n't know about the shutdown
1995 and 2013 : three differences between two shutdowns divided congress what we know : democrats and @entity4 are deeply divided and barely on speaking terms these days
feelings are hurt and fingers are pointing
right now the wounds are too fresh and no one is in the mood to give anyone a break
the @entity4 - led @entity49 tried to pass a piecemeal funding plan on tuesday night to pay for the @entity51 , veterans affairs and national parks
it failed to win the required two - thirds vote , but has no future in any case
the @entity5 - led @entity58 was n't about to agree to it and the @entity49 promised a veto
senate majority leader @entity61 called the strategy as " just another wacky idea by tea party @entity4
" president @entity64 chimed in tuesday , calling the @entity4 " reckless " and saying they 're holding the nation hostage to defund @entity26
republicans in the @entity49 say they 'll try again wednesday
@entity64 , meanwhile , canceled a trip to the @entity68 and @entity69
secretary of state @entity70 will go in his place
shutdown ' extremely damaging ' to @entity9 intelligence operations what we do n't know : who will blink first ? right now , both sides are sporting steely eyed stares
the @entity49 appears determined to stand its ground
on @entity81 , the @entity49 and @entity58 have both refused to budge from their visions for the budget and , beyond that , health care reform
but behind the tough facades , are cracks forming ? a small crack now could bring down a party 's strong stance later
sen. @entity91 points out that any attempt to repeal @entity26 will fail because the president will veto it and the @entity10 does n't have the votes to override
and rep. @entity96 says tea party conservatives only care about " their own agenda
" meet the man behind the government shutdown @entity10 what we know : the @entity10 is almost two parties these days -- call them standard @entity4 and tea party @entity4
while not polar opposites , the factions have different approaches to changing government
both want to cut federal spending , but for the tea party , defunding the president 's signature health care law and slashing deficit spending are causes worth staking a political career on
that 's what their constituents elected them to do , they say
@entity4 divisions force delay in @entity122 's debt strategy what we do n't know : how united will @entity4 stay as the government shutdown lingers , as government workers go without paychecks and as the spotlight focuses on a @entity16 that ca n't govern or members that ca n't even agree to talk to one another
@entity134 's @entity133 : " @entity61 wants a shutdown because he believes it 's a political victory for the @entity5 " how long ? what we know : the last government shutdown took place almost 18 years ago during the @entity142 administration and lasted 21 days
what we do n't know : how the major players on @entity81 will get over the bad feelings to end this latest political stalemate
right now things do n't look very promising
there 's plenty of sniping to go around
in an op - ed published online tuesday in @entity151 , house speaker @entity122 lays the shutdown at the feet of @entity5 , especially president @entity64
" @entity64 owns this shutdown now , " screams the headline
later , the article accuses the president of a " scorched - @entity160 policy of refusing to negotiate in bipartisan way on his health care law , current government funding , or the debt limit
" of course , the feeling is mutual
on tuesday , the president said it was " strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda
" " republicans in the @entity174 refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the @entity26 , " he said
should the rhetoric soften , it could signal the beginning of the end of the shutdown
10 ways the shutdown would affect you @entity184 what we know : the president , members of @entity16 , their staffs and the military get paid
non-essential government employees do n't
what we do n't know : how long government workers will have to wait until they see another paycheck
some 800,000 federal workers are being furloughed
piecemeal funding for their jobs could eventually be approved
the pressure of that many jobs hanging over both parties could become too much to bear
the shutdown could cost the still - struggling @entity9 economy about $ 1 billion a week in pay
and that 's only the tip of the iceberg , experts say
the total economic impact is likely to be at least 10 times greater than the simple calculation of lost wages of federal workers , said @entity213 , economist with @entity214
his firm estimates that a three - to four - week shutdown would cost the economy about $ 55 billion
@entity218 what we know : the @entity9 public is not amused
according to a @entity224 / @entity223 poll , 68 % of @entity9 think shutting down the government for even a few days is a bad idea , while 27 % think it 's a good idea
the survey taken before the shutdown said most @entity9 would blame congressional @entity4 : sixty - nine percent said they agreed with the statement that the party 's elected officials were acting like " spoiled children
" but @entity5 are n't off the hook
fifty - eight percent of respondents said they , too , were acting like spoiled kids
another poll showed public support for @entity16 at record low levels -- at 10 %
what we do n't know : will this high - stakes game of political chicken hurt the approval ratings of individual members ? you know the old expression : the people hate @entity16 , but love their congressman or woman
@entity224 poll : @entity10 would bear the brunt of shutdown blame
