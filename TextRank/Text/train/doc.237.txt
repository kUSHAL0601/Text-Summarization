@entity0 -- the @entity3 on wednesday will report that while the number of suicides in the active - duty force declined in 2010 , the number of suicides in the @entity6 and @entity7 increased , a senior @entity3 official said
the increase in @entity6 and @entity7 suicides is among troops who are in the @entity14 and not activated for duty
the senior @entity3 official said more than half of those troops were never deployed to a war zone
the official said one possible explanation for the increase in suicides is economic pressure and rising unemployment , but he emphasized that the @entity3 simply does not have answers
the official noted that for @entity24 personnel who live as civilians back in their communities , the @entity3 is not able to provide the same type of suicide awareness and prevention programs that are available to active - duty personnel
the decline in active - duty suicides , even though slight , may be initial evidence that those awareness and prevention programs are helping , the official said .
