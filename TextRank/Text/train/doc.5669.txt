@entity1 ' pessimism about the nation 's economic conditions , and skepticism that government can help solve that problem , delivered @entity7 their midterm beating this cycle , a team of bipartisan pollsters found in a midterm postmortem survey
@entity7 pollster @entity13 and @entity15 pollster @entity14 said those were the main takeaways from their final @entity17 of the cycle , conducted dec. 7 - 11 among 1,000 registered voters nationwide
and they said the survey has grave implications for the @entity7 if they ca n't craft a cohesive , convincing message on the economy
" tell me who is ahead on the economy in 2016 and i 'll tell you who is going to be president , " @entity13 said at a @entity25 event on thursday
she noted that " voters ' economic anxiety is deep - seated , and shows no signs of abating
" the poll found that a vast majority of @entity1 , 77 percent , said they 're at least somewhat worried about the nation 's current economic conditions
and voters in the middle class are the most pessimistic about the economy , the pollsters found
that points to why , @entity13 and @entity14 said , @entity7 had so much trouble this cycle and ultimately lost control of the @entity46 to @entity15 and gave the @entity15 their biggest majority in the @entity48 since the 1920s
democrats aimed their midterm message at middle class voters , highlighting policies like a minimum wage hike and fair pay legislation that they said polled well with the middle class
but that strategy was too " piecemeal , " @entity13 wrote in her analysis of the poll , and " struck voters as falling well short of the level of change necessary to set our country and our economy back on track
" and @entity7 had trouble selling the public government solutions for their problems because , the poll found , @entity1 voters are still split on whether government can solve them to begin with
" voters want government to intervene , but they fear what the government will do if it wades into the important task of ensuring the economic stability of voters , " @entity14 said
a slight majority , 52 percent , said the government should do more to solve problems and help meet the needs of people , while 48 percent said it should get out of the way and let the free market help people get ahead
many in the party have diagnosed that very issue as one of the main reasons the party fared so poorly in the midterms .
