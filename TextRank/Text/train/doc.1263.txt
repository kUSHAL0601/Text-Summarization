@entity0 , @entity1 -- no matter whatever else happens in tennis ' clay - court season , @entity3 is almost an automatic at the @entity6
@entity3 won an unprecedented ninth title at @entity6 and now only trails @entity8 on the men 's grand slam ladder after seeing off @entity11 3 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 4 on a third consecutive day of steamy weather in @entity0 , which did no favors for the @entity14 -- who appeared to vomit slightly in the last set
their tussle could n't compare to last year 's five - set classic in the semifinals or their six - hour duel at the @entity22 in 2012 but the final outcome , to @entity3 's delight , is that he tied @entity25 on 14 majors , three behind the 32 - year - old @entity8
" you are a great champion , @entity3 , " @entity25 said in an email sent to @entity2
" congratulations on number 14
" @entity3 was supposed to be vulnerable here
he merely won one @entity31 clay - court title this year before @entity0 , his lowest haul since 2004 -- and that year the @entity33 skipped the campaign 's second major
there were upset defeats in @entity37 and @entity38 , and @entity3 's coach , @entity39 , admitted he only won in @entity40 because his opponent , @entity41 , was hurt
with every passing encounter against @entity11 at the @entity6 , the @entity14 had won more games and kept @entity3 on court for longer
his victory over @entity3 in the @entity47 final in may , his fourth straight overall against the left - hander , gave his backers greater hope
" my best was n't ( like it was ) against him in @entity47 , " @entity11 told reporters
@entity3 , however , stormed into this year 's finale in record time -- for him -- playing a near flawless three final sets against 2013 finalist @entity58 , crushing @entity59 in the semis and lifting his game when it mattered against @entity11 , minus a rare hiccup late in the fourth set
" mentally i was so strong , " said @entity3 , 28
" i really wanted to defeat him
when there were problems cropping up , i managed to find the solutions
" yes , if @entity11 needed any reminding , @entity3 at the @entity6 -- in a best - of - five format -- is a different character to the one that competes in prep tournaments in a shorter format
he 's 66 - 1 at the @entity1 , with those nine titles alongside
despite that , the notoriously tough @entity39 said his nephew was " not special
" " if @entity3 has done it , i 'm sure another can do it , " he told reporters
" @entity3 is not special ... another can do the same
but it 's not easy
to win nine in 10 years is for me , unbelievable
" @entity11 , in tears during the trophy presentation , will have to wait to complete his grand slam collection
he missed out , too , on reclaiming the no. 1 ranking from @entity3
while @entity3 's knees have constantly troubled the @entity91 throughout his career , the heat has never been @entity11 's friend
he suffered against @entity94 on friday , the first time high temperatures were a factor this fortnight , but had enough to see off the rejuvenated @entity99 in four sets
on sunday -- unlike two days ago -- he donned a cap from the outset in an attempt to lessen the effects of the sun. @entity11 said in his post-match news conference it was " normal that you have ups and downs " physically against @entity3 at the @entity6 but his influential co-coach , @entity107 , blamed his two - match dip on a " stomach problem
" he lamented his charge 's normally splendid return game
" i was not happy with his return today , " @entity107 told reporters
but he added , " @entity3 changed his serve very good , mixed it up and caught him a bit off balance
he served very smart , where to serve and @entity11 was a bit unsure
" as popular as @entity11 is for his dance moves , humor -- and chatting to ball kids during rain delays -- it was @entity3 who received the louder applause as they walked on court
@entity11 is always playing catch up when it comes to matching @entity8 , @entity3 , and even @entity59 , in support , at least at the start of proceedings
both players were untroubled on serve until the eighth game , when @entity3 's forehand -- uncharacteristically -- went off
he missed three inside - out forehands to gift @entity11 a 5 - 3 lead
for the first time in six tries at @entity6 , @entity11 claimed the opening set against @entity3
a more aggressive @entity3 broke for 4 - 2 in the second , yet he did n't cruise thereafter
a double fault contributed to an immediate break back and the set went on serve until 6 - 5
serving to stay in the second set for a second time , @entity11 crumbled
@entity3 let out a large roar after pummeling a forehand winner for 7 - 5
the tennis was hardly scintillating but by the end of the second , @entity3 's forehand returned
the points and games were becoming extended , exactly the type of battle that favored @entity3
" without that second set , i do n't know if i have this trophy with me now , " said @entity3
a fired - up @entity3 , the crowd still on the defending champion 's side and the issues with his body all seemed to weigh down @entity11
he dumped a simple looking backhand volley into the net on a serve - and - volley to trail 2 - 0
@entity11 's frustration boiled over when he slammed his racket to the court after erring on a cross-court backhand at 2 - 4
that seventh game would be pivotal
@entity3 could n't convert a handful of game points but slammed the door shut when @entity11 suddenly found himself with a break point
he sealed the 10 - minute game with the aid of trademark defense -- and an unforced backhand error from the @entity14
it was a matter of " when " not " if " @entity3 would break in the fourth and it came in the sixth game
but what happened next was n't in the script : a shaky @entity3 forehand , double fault and errant smash handed @entity11 a lifeline , 4 - 3
such a nervy game from @entity3 in a grand slam final is almost never witnessed
wanting more tennis , the fans , for the first time , began chanting , " @entity11 , @entity11
" a re-energized @entity11 obliged to make it 4 - 4
@entity11 's time to pounce was now , but he let @entity3 off the hook
allowing @entity3 to convert a forehand winner down the line , @entity11 pounded his head with his racket
@entity11 blew a 30 - 0 lead in the final game , undone by a double fault on match point after a fan called out during his earlier service motion , forcing him to start over
" i was happy with ( @entity11 's ) performance " in the tournament , said @entity107
" maybe he had these problems a bit , he was fighting himself
it 's always tough to lose in the final but i think he 's a fighter
he will move to the ( next ) grand slam
" @entity3 sunk to his knees , and like women 's champion @entity218 on saturday after her victory over @entity220 made the trek to the players ' box
the outcome was even sweeter for @entity3 after a back injury rendered him less than 100 % in january 's @entity22 final against @entity227
before turning his thoughts to @entity230 , where @entity3 has been upset the previous two years , you can be sure he 'll be doing some celebrating sunday night
and it 's in southwest @entity0 , again .
