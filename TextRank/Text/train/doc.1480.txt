@entity0 , @entity1 -- with just his dream , determination and hard work , @entity3 started a solar fan business nearly a decade ago out of his garage in northwest @entity1
the one - time roofer simply wanted to make enough money to care for his family and to create a ripple effect for other workers , particularly in this economically depressed area outside @entity15
@entity3 vowed to create his solar attic fans entirely out of parts made in the @entity18
using only the sun 's energy , the fan pumps hot air out of the attic -- lowering cooling bills -- and does n't have to be in direct sunlight to work
his first year , @entity3 said he barely made enough to scrape by -- about $ 39,000 in sales
" it was n't enough to cover expenses , " @entity3 recalled
but he stuck with it and his promise to buy @entity18 parts
@entity3 's company , @entity32 , steadily grew to the point that he could n't keep up with the influx of orders
he looked around for companies that could help him manufacture the fans , concentrating his search in his own backyard
he eventually found a company that could help and needed the extra work about 90 miles away in @entity42 , @entity1
he bought molded plastic in @entity1 as well as fasteners , nuts , bolts and steel
wire for the fans came from workers in @entity51 , while the motors were from @entity53 and @entity15
even his cardboard boxes were manufactured in nearby @entity55
@entity3 had achieved his own small part of the @entity18 dream : he became a self - made small - business owner
and in 2008 , his success attracted the attention of the soon - to - be next president of the @entity18 , @entity61
that year , he got an unexpected call from a representative of the new administration
" he said he was with the @entity61 transition team looking for small companies , " @entity3 recalled
he later met with the man who told @entity3 , " we want to interview you , vet you
" " @entity72 sat right there talking with me , said ' i really love your story and i 'm going to push it up the rank , ' " @entity3 said
and that 's exactly what happened
shortly after he was inaugurated , @entity61 held a town hall meeting in the economically devastated city of @entity82 , @entity1
@entity3 and his wife were asked to come and -- prodded by his wife -- he stood up and told the president about his solar business
he asked @entity61 what he planned to do to encourage small business owners like himself
the question turned @entity3 into a @entity91 solar superstar
@entity92 , @entity93 and other media came calling to tell the story of the roofer who built a solar company out of his garage -- and he did so without a government handout
" move over @entity102 , " one blog headline declared after his @entity82 appearance
" there 's a new poster child for hard - working @entity18 -- and he 's green
" @entity3 's success story provided good publicity for the @entity91 which called again and again , using @entity3 to underscore the @entity61 administration 's goal of pushing @entity18 towards new sources of clean energy
" ' can you come to @entity112 ? can you come to @entity113 ? @entity116 doing this , ' " @entity3 said of the numerous requests he received from the administration
there 's the photo of him with the president and vice president @entity116 in @entity121 , another @entity1 city hard hit by the recession , as well as an appearance with sen. @entity124 of @entity125 and many others
@entity3 's story resonated with groups of all political stripes
republicans got in on the act when @entity1 sen. @entity132 named him " an energy patriot " and the @entity135 - leaning @entity18 @entity134 cited his work
environmentalists also contacted him , and featured him in one appearance after another
strange bedfellows , perhaps , but it was a feelgood story of what one @entity18 could do in a time when the recession was strangling so many
" they were continually inviting me to these things called ' advocacy days ' where they wanted me to meet with senators and congressmen , " @entity3 said , noting that he attended many with his wife
at these events , lawmakers talked about " how i created a solar product , how it 's good for the environment , for business , " he said
" ( @entity158 ) wo n't say they were putting words in my mouth but they had a lot of talking points , " @entity3 said
" i was happy to do it from that point of view
it is friendly to the environment ; it is creating jobs
" it also was good advertising for @entity3 , who could never have afforded the publicity these appearances offered
orders for the fans , which retail at about $ 500 , came pouring in from places as far away as @entity177
" it grew to where our peak was $ 2 million ( in revenues ) , " he said , referring to sales in 2009
@entity32 started exporting fans all over the world
while his home - based business employs only about 21 direct and indirect employees , it brought a much - needed economic boost to an area of the country hard hit by the recession
today , @entity3 's solar star appears to be on a collision course with another @entity61 policy that may put him out of business
the irony is not lost on @entity3 : a man whose profile and company soared because of the administration 's energy policy is now falling apart because of a new @entity61 anti-dumping policy involving @entity202
while 95 percent of @entity3 's fans are @entity18 - made , he has yet to find a @entity18 company that can make the small customized solar panels that make his fans run
it 's not that he has n't tried
he initially used a company in @entity209 but they stopped manufacturing the kind of panels he needed
then @entity3 turned to a @entity213 company but the quality was so bad that he was replacing the defective parts faster than he could sell the fans
over the years he begged environmental groups as well as the @entity218 for help in finding an @entity18 company that could make the key solar component
reluctantly , he agreed to purchase them from a major company in the @entity18 , which bought their panels from another country and then had them customized in @entity227
eventually that manufacturer told @entity3 to deal with the @entity227 customizer directly
@entity3 said the @entity18 @entity230 has accused him of using @entity202 - made solar panels , in violation of a tough import policy adopted in may at the behest of major @entity18 solar companies
the policy is intended to thwart @entity202 from undercutting prices and flooding the @entity18 market with cheaper solar panels
the @entity18 @entity218 is currently reviewing the policy , and is scheduled to make a determination in the fall
@entity3 denies that any of part of his solar fans are produced in @entity202 , but he admits he ca n't totally prove it
according to @entity3 , the owner of the @entity227 company that customizes his solar cells has stated in an affadavit that it buys the cells from the @entity18 , @entity251 and @entity252
but @entity3 worries that testimony wo n't be good enough
" the solar panel tariff is a broad - reaching tariff
in my estimation it should n't be geared toward small niche markets like mine , " @entity3 said
unless he can show specific manufacturing documentation by august 29 , @entity3 said he could be fined as much as 250 percent on his solar panels -- an effective rate of $ 270,000
if that anti-dumping fine is levied , @entity3 said he will have to shutter his business
" these guys are going to put me out of business , " @entity3 said
" i do n't have any help
i 've been trying to get help , no one can help me
" @entity3 said he has never received government financial assistance and is taxed in the 40 percent bracket
he said he has sat by and watched companies like the now bankrupt @entity275 run through taxpayers ' money and not return on the government 's investment
he said he does n't want a handout -- just a helping hand
so he went back to the well one more time , pleading with @entity282 , deputy director of the @entity283 who @entity3 said had been his contact with the @entity61 administration
under the subject line his e-mail to @entity282 , @entity3 wrote , " hanging on for life here
" " can you help me before i have to close my doors and let everyone go ? " @entity3 asked in the e-mail
" please ... i 'm pleading with you
" @entity282 responded , " thanks for bringing it to my attention
i do n't know what is possible , but let me talk to a few folks asap
" that was nearly a month ago and @entity3 is still waiting
@entity2 sent three e-mails to the @entity91 asking about @entity3 's situation , and received a reply from a spokesman late wednesday afternoon
the spokesman stated that the tariff " highlights the degree to which solar panel manufacturers have faced unfair competition from countries like @entity202 " and the president 's move to impose a tax on @entity202 - made goods is a way to establish " a level playing field with @entity202 for @entity18 businesses and workers
" the reply did not address @entity3 's situation
" when @entity61 came in office , there were a lot of small business owners who said , ' hey maybe he 'll help break barriers and help owners ' or he says he will , but it never trickles down that far to help us , " @entity3 said
" maybe it 's because we do n't have big budgets to donate to campaigns
i 'm just trying to run my company
