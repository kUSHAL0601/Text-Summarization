@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday announced the creation of a comprehensive administration initiative devoted to spurring development efforts around the globe
@entity2 calls it new @entity9 @entity8 and says it 's the " first of its kind by an @entity9 administration
" " put simply , the @entity9 is changing the way we do business , " @entity2 said at the summit of the @entity15 , an ambitious agenda world leaders set 10 years ago to tackle global poverty , which has grown amid the world economic recession
the program has four approaches
one is changing the definition of development
" for too long , we 've measured our efforts by the dollars we spent and the food and medicines that we delivered
but aid alone is not development
development is helping nations to actually develop , moving from poverty to prosperity
and we need more than just aid to unleash that change
we need to harness all the tools at our disposal , from our diplomacy to our trade to our investment policies , " he said
second , the administration is changing how " the ultimate goal of development " is viewed
" our focus on assistance has saved lives in the short term , but it has n't always improved those societies over the long term
consider the millions of people who have relied on food assistance for decades
that 's not development , that 's dependence , and it 's a cycle we need to break
instead of just managing poverty , we have to offer nations and peoples a path out of poverty
" @entity2 said that the @entity9 will " partner with countries that are willing to take the lead " and that the time when " development was dictated by foreign capitals has come to an end
" " @entity9 has been , and will remain , the global leader in providing assistance
we will not abandon those who depend on us for life - saving help , whether it 's food or medicine
we will keep our promises and honor our commitments , " he said
but , he emphasized that creating the conditions where assistance is no longer needed is what is needed now
" so we will seek partners who want to build their own capacity to provide for their people
we will seek development that is sustainable
" the third pillar is putting an emphasis on " broad - based economic growth , " @entity2 said
" it 's the force that turned @entity95 from a recipient of aid to a donor of aid
it 's the force that has raised living standards from @entity101 to @entity102
and it 's the force that has allowed emerging @entity104 countries like @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 to defy the odds and make real progress toward achieving the @entity15 , even as some of their neighbors -- like @entity113 -- have lagged behind
" @entity2 said the @entity9 will reach out to countries that are moving to democracy from authoritarianism
" the people of @entity118 , for example
show that even after years of war , great progress can be achieved
and as others show the courage to put war behind them -- including , we hope , in @entity122 -- the @entity9 will stand with those who seek to build and sustain peace
" @entity2 said the fourth pillar is insisting " on more responsibility -- from ourselves and from others
" he said the administration will work with @entity134 " to better match our investments with the priorities of our partner countries
guided by the evidence , we will invest in programs that work and end those that do n't
" he urged donor nations to honor commitments and developing countries to make the tough choices
" no one nation can do everything everywhere and still do it well
to meet our goals , we must be more selective and focus our efforts where we have the best partners and where we can have the greatest impact
and just as this work can not be done by any one government , it ca n't be the work of governments alone
in fact , foundations , the private sector and ngos are making historic commitments that have redefined what 's possible
" as for the goals to eradicate poverty , @entity2 said , no one can deny the progress that has been made , citing better education , the drop in diseases such as hiv / aids , more access to drinking water and ending poverty for many
at the same time , he says , " progress towards other goals has not come nearly fast enough
" he cites problems like malnutrition , hunger and women " who lose their lives every year simply giving birth
" @entity2 stressed the facts that development is n't charity and that some countries are " condemned to perpetual poverty
" he said progress is possible and practical
" i suspect that some in wealthier countries may ask , with our economies struggling , so many people out of work , and so many families barely getting by , why a summit on development ? the answer is simple : in our global economy , progress in even the poorest countries can advance the prosperity and security of people far beyond their borders , including my fellow @entity9
" the policy was unveiled after a year - long review ordered by @entity2 in an effort to examine how @entity9 aid dollars can be more effectively targeted after the world recession , a senior administration official said
" the policy is about real attention to focus and selectively , " the official explained
" we can not spread limited resources so thinly across every nation
" upon taking office , @entity2 promised to double @entity9 foreign aid to $ 50 million by 2012 and make @entity9 programs , accused of being riddled with waste and fraud , more effective
during the foreign aid review , secretary of state @entity222 argued for more control over development policy and control over the @entity227 , arguing that diplomacy and development go hand - in - hand
in the end , the @entity232 will maintain oversight of @entity227 , but as evidence of the new importance of development , the @entity235 is establishing a " deputies committee " to coordinate policy across the @entity9 government , the official said
while @entity227 will continue to be the premier agency for delivering development aid , the official said , the new strategy offers a " whole - of - government approach , " integrating development aid currently handled by about two dozen federal agencies and departments
countries selected for @entity9 development attention also will get assistance with technical innovation and trade
selection of countries will be primarily based on evidence of strong governance and economic policy , but other factors to be involved are where donors are currently directing their aid and where the private sector is investing , so as not to duplicate effort
two countries singled out for possible inclusion are @entity269 and @entity270
the strategy builds on the @entity272 , a @entity273 administration program that encourages political and economic stability by making multimillion - dollar investment in nations that offer plans for reform
the official said that although the new policy focuses on more stable countries , the administration does not want to send a signal that the most vulnerable countries , such as @entity285 , will be ignored
" we are not walking away , " the official said
" we will still have a commitment to improving humanitarian conditions and helping countries suffering from natural disasters and conflict
" @entity1 's @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .
