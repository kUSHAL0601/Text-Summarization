@entity0 -- graphic testimony from a forensic anthropologist , including images of decomposing bones and brain matter , continued thursday in the federal case against @entity0 's reputed mob boss , @entity8
dr. @entity9 , a @entity10 state forensic anthropologist , showed jurors gruesome photos of human remains found in shallow graves in the @entity0 area
one grave was at @entity17 in @entity18 , and two sets of remains were excavated along the @entity21
the remains at @entity17 were found in a 3 - foot grave in september 2000 , @entity9 told the court
jurors were shown several photos of the remains there , including parts of a pelvic bone , a fractured skull with decomposed brain matter and a claddagh ring with part of a decomposed finger bone
earlier this week , @entity35 , @entity8 's longtime crime associate , told jurors that at this location , @entity8 said , " drink up , @entity37 , " in reference to @entity40
authorities believe @entity8 killed @entity40 , who was a leader of a rival gang in @entity0
expletives fly between @entity8 and ex-partner most of @entity40 's remains were severely decayed due the shallow grave and the corrosive damage from the water , @entity9 explained
some of his remains were very much intact , though
jurors were shown a picture of a pair of shoes , socks and leg bones extending straight out of the socks
@entity8 is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he ran @entity0 's @entity63 mob
he also faces charges of extortion , racketeering and money laundering
two set of remains that were found along the @entity21 had also been damaged by water and tidal currents , @entity9 said
the first set of remains was excavated there in late september 2000 , and it included part of a skull with a bullet hole , she said
the remains were found with a bulletproof vest , a navy , three - piece suit , driving gloves and a claddagh ring around a finger bone
@entity9 testified that these were the remains of @entity86
@entity87 , one of @entity8 's hitmen , testified earlier in @entity8 's trial that @entity87 himself shot @entity86 in the back his head , and he knew where @entity86 's body was dumped
" i was driving over @entity93 ( in @entity0 ) one day , and @entity8 said , ' tip your hat to @entity96 ...
he 's over there , ' " @entity87 testified
the remains of @entity99 were discovered about a month later along the river
most of her remains were discovered in plastic bags along with rope around the bags , @entity9 explained
almost all of @entity108 ' bones were recovered
because her body was in bags , even some of her hair was preserved
@entity9 showed the jury photos of the remains , the hair found on the skull , and how the tidal movement corroded @entity108 ' skull
her hair , along with pieces of her bones , were tested for dna and were positively identified as the remains of @entity108 , according to @entity9
one of the shortest and more emotional testimonies of the day came from @entity126 , the widow of alleged @entity8 victim @entity127
earlier in the trial , @entity35 testified that he saw @entity8 shoot @entity127 in the back of his head after @entity127 had tried to buy his way out of death
" he called at 11 , said he would n't be home for a while ; he had to get money , " @entity126 told the court
" did your husband , @entity138 , ever come home ? " assistant u.s. attorney @entity141 asked the widow
" no. " @entity127 answered , tearing up
she said she never saw or spoke to her husband again
earlier in the day , before the jury entered the courtroom , the judge heard a request from @entity149 , @entity8 's attorney , to postpone the trial until next week
he said the defense team needed more time to go over the materials and evidence and that @entity8 , 83 , was tired
@entity8 imitates machine gun , talks about a killing in recorded jail visit assistant u.s. attorney @entity158 argued against the motion , telling the judge that the victims and their families have waited long enough for justice and the defense had enough time to go over the materials
@entity167 district judge @entity166 dismissed @entity149 's request
@entity96 , a son of one the alleged @entity8 victims , told reporters outside of court on thursday , " i do n't care if he ( @entity8 ) is tired , " in response to @entity149 's request
" like it was said in court he ( @entity8 ) had 16 years to relax ... he will be fine , " said @entity108 , brother of @entity99
@entity8 's trial continues friday when the prosecution plans to call a forensic dentist as well as @entity108 .
