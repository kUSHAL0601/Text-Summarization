-- a traffic snarl outside @entity4 's @entity3 -- not a tactical command decision -- prevented a special @entity7 unit from responding at the scene of a mass shooting there in september , an internal police report found on friday
twelve people were killed in the september 16 rampage by gunman @entity13 , who was also killed during a shootout with other law enforcement officers
the deployment disclosure came after some initial media reports said the @entity18 was one of the first on the ongoing shooting scene , then turned away at the command center , and subsequently pulled back
" initial reports of the actions of @entity7 personnel were inaccurate and failed to convey the nuanced complexity of such situations including the personal and professional impact on potential first responders , " said a summary of the report by the @entity26 @entity25
the shooting at the @entity3 facility several blocks south of the @entity26 @entity38 complex attracted a number of law enforcement , including some @entity7 officers who " self - deployed
" the board 's review team interviewed dozens of @entity7 officers and examined written reports , radio transmissions , and command center incident logs
the report did not deal with actions taken by other federal and local law enforcement , including military police officers
following some initial reports about the @entity18 's deployment , the local police union at the time had urged an investigation into the team 's actions and orders
" they were prepared to risk their lives to save the lives of the shooter 's victims , but were prevented from doing so , " labor committee chairman @entity61 said in a statement a week after the shooting
" it is impossible to say how the outcome would have been different if the @entity18 team had been permitted to respond
" @entity38 police chief @entity74 then ordered the police board review team to look into the allegations the special response team was diverted from the shooting scene
" because of traffic gridlock caused by both emergency vehicles and commuter traffic the @entity18 unit was unable to reach that incident command post , " said the report
" the @entity18 unit then moved closer to the @entity38 , increasing its flexibility to respond as needed at either the @entity38 or the @entity3
" officials had said there was initial concern the @entity38 might become a secondary target , promoting an increased security presence there
@entity0 's @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 contributed to this report .
