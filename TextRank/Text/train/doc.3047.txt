@entity0 -- targeted political advertising is heading to a new but very familiar frontier -- @entity4
if you live in @entity6 or @entity7 , @entity8 , and go to the popular video sharing site in the next two weeks to find a news clip or view a favorite home decorating show , the first thing that will pop up on your screen will be a political ad
for the first time a political campaign is targeting voters by zip code on @entity4
the @entity20 @entity19 added this new advertising tool to the broadcast media strategy it recently launched focused on a number of @entity25 and @entity26 races , one of the earliest and biggest efforts the pro-business lobby has unveiled to date
in seven @entity8 congressional districts where the @entity19 is running paid television ads , it added a new layer -- running those tv ads on @entity4
" the stakes of this election are huge for the business community and we recognize as we roll out our different phases of the campaigns , we 're going to use broadcast but we 're also going to use @entity4 , " said @entity34 , senior political strategist for the @entity20 @entity19
" we 're going to use the @entity42 to reinforce and repeat and repeat and repeat the messages of how important it is to have a growing economy and candidates that are pro-growth
" anyone who visits @entity4 in the next two weeks -- and whose ip address or computer location falls within any of the zip codes of the specific @entity8 districts -- will see the @entity19 's ad before seeing a video clip
the program , called " @entity55 " allows the user five seconds to " opt out , " or stop playing the political ad
and the @entity19 only pays for the ads that people watch
corporate advertisers have been using so - called " pre-roll ads " on websites to sell toothpaste or preview a movie coming to theaters soon
but the technology to target ads to specific zip codes was just released in march by @entity69 , which owns @entity4 , according to @entity70 , who leads @entity69 's advertising sales to political campaigns and issue advocacy groups
the @entity75 campaign pioneered targeting voters online and on mobile devices in 2008 , and both parties now feature online outreach components to get out their messages
but this effort is the first instance of a campaign turning to @entity4 to aim its political pitch at specific zip codes
@entity34 calls combining the online ads with tv a " one - two punch
" the effort includes a variety of ads , which the @entity19 is using to gauge how voters respond to different messages online
three positive ads promote the pro-business credentials of @entity95 freshman reps
@entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98
three negative ads , which the @entity19 calls " contrast " ads , criticize @entity103 reps
@entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 for supporting " @entity107 " and argue they oppose pro-growth policies
one ad combines criticism of @entity103 incumbent rep. @entity111 with a plug for his @entity95 challenger @entity113
a @entity115 study commissioned by @entity69 last year found that viewers who see advertising across multiple platforms are more likely to retain the message
the @entity19 's strategy demonstrates it believes the same successful experience businesses found with online ads could translate into the political arena
@entity124 , who is challenging @entity96 to retake the central @entity8 seat she knocked him out of in 2010 , is n't convinced that this kind of micro-targeting will make a big difference in the fall election
" it does n't surprise me that big money is going to come in on my opponent @entity131 's side because she supports these big business things that are good for them , but it 's not at all connecting to our local chamber of commerce , " @entity124 told @entity1
@entity124 said his local @entity6 chamber did n't contribute to the ad or sign off on the effort and said the national business lobby 's message does n't mesh with local concerns
" it 's almost like it 's just coming in from above with a message that 's generic in an attempt to prop her up in a district where she does n't have that kind of support , even from small businesses , " he said
the @entity19 's television campaign is a multimillion - dollar effort , but @entity34 declined to say how much specifically the chamber is spending on the @entity4 component
one expert familiar with online advertising says the average cost of a pre-roll ad is roughly 10 to 15 cents per view
over the course of two weeks , potentially thousands of users could view each of the ads in the seven districts
@entity70 stressed that the data collected on the ads does not contain any personally identifiable information , but @entity69 can pull together some aggregate data on age and gender and interest categories based on who watches the ads on @entity4
@entity34 calls the data it will get from the @entity4 after the two - week run " survey research
" " we 're able to go in and look at how long people are on the ads , if they like the ads and stay until the end of the ad , if they stay on more for a positive ad or a contrast ad , " @entity34 said , adding , " this is another tool to help us decide if our ads are penetrating and working and getting to the voters
" it 's no surprise that @entity4 is the place to start this type of targeted political outreach
more than 2 billion videos are streamed each day on its website and approximately 100 million unique users in the @entity20 click on the site every month , according to @entity4 's own statistics
earlier this year , the @entity200 paid to run an ad on @entity4 hitting the @entity25 @entity95 's budget proposal and featuring actor @entity203
it targeted users who typed any search for " @entity207
" but the @entity19 's move to focus resources to reach voters in specific congressional districts could prove to be a more effective use of money
television ads are pricey and candidates are often forced to buy time in markets that broadcast outside their particular district 's borders
with people increasingly turning to mobile devices to get news or view entertainment programming on their own schedules , fewer people are watching television programs when they actually air
a study in @entity228 last fall conducted by @entity229 , a group working with @entity95 pollsters , found that 40 % of likely voters were " going off the grid " and had not watched live television within the previous week
the @entity19 's move is a reflection of the changing environment that can make getting political messages out a greater challenge
" we know in today 's fractured media world , people get their messages from many different places , and the @entity42 is becoming the top place , " @entity34 noted
" technology is very important to reaching voters , and clearly the @entity75 campaign showed that and we ( @entity103 ) used @entity247 and @entity248 and all that to get our message out , " @entity124 said
but the @entity103 candidate said he believes @entity96 's constituents will focus on the @entity95 congresswoman 's record this fall more than the message in the 30 - second online ad
" you have to talk to voters , " @entity124 said
" you ca n't just spoon - feed them
" @entity259 @entity258 contributed to this report .
