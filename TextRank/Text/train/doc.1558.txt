-- like a magician in a blue shirt and white socks , @entity1 stood outside the @entity6 restaurant in @entity7 on july 30 , 1975 , made a phone call , and vanished
some people would later say he seemed nervous as he headed to a supposed meeting there with suspected mob bosses
some would say they saw a mysterious car leaving the lot
but the one question no one has yet answered for investigators is the essential one : where did he go ? now , once again , as they have so many times before , @entity21 agents and other officers are digging
once again , the lead has come from someone with ties to organized crime
and once again , the target is a nondescript field where @entity1 might ... just might ... be buried
all that changes is the details
@entity1 still fascinates after 40 years this time the story being told involves @entity1 being beaten with a shovel , and buried alive beneath the concrete slab of a now long - gone barn
@entity37 sheriff @entity36 says , " it is my fondest hope that we can give that closure not only to the @entity1 family but also to the community to stop tearing that scab off with every new lead and bring some conclusion
" @entity1 's life came to its mysterious conclusion after decades of truly remarkable accomplishments
born in @entity50 , he became interested in organized labor as a teenager when he encountered unfair working conditions
as he grew into adulthood , he became more assertive about organizing unions , and gradually he became the leader of the @entity58 , transforming that union into a political juggernaut capable of making or breaking candidates
on a grainy old piece of film from the @entity66 in 1960 you can still see him in his office near the @entity68 in @entity69
he bristles when the reporter asks if he has any hobbies , like golfing
" seven days a week , " @entity1 says , " i have more fun here working than anybody can have on a golf course or any sport you can name
" @entity1 's bare - knuckled , win - at - all - costs approach to the union business , however , took him down some dark roads
he struck deals with organized crime leaders
and eventually he was sent to prison
in what looked like a sketchy -- if unproven -- deal for political support , president @entity87 pardoned him , and the @entity58 lined up behind @entity87 's successful reelection campaign
but even @entity87 's help came with a price : @entity1 was told he had to stay out of the union business
still , @entity1 fought to regain his power anyway , and soon a lot of people in a lot of places arguably had reasons to want him gone
and ever since , people have looked for him
more than a dozen times investigators have followed what are invariably described as " credible " leads to a suspected @entity1 burial site
@entity7 has produced the most locations , and @entity104 often refer to them by their distinguishing features , making conversation sound like a list of a @entity109 novels : the @entity110
@entity113 , with its long history of @entity115 ( cue the " @entity117 " theme ) has also excited attention in the hunt for @entity1
one of the most popular theories is that he was encased in the cement of @entity122
and on and on the theories go
he was sunk in the swamps of @entity124
he was carted off to @entity125
he was crushed in a car and shipped overseas with a load of scrap metal
sometimes the possibilities seem as endless as the searches
all of this is not cheap
based on the sticker price of just one search as analyzed by the @entity135 , it is not unreasonable to estimate that police agencies have spent well over $ 3 million trying to find this man
or more to the point : his body
he was legally declared dead in 1982 , and even if he had been miraculously living incognito in @entity141 all these years , he would be 100 years old
strangely , there seems little debate about what most likely happened
true crime aficionados and authorities alike have long believed that @entity1 's dreams of a comeback did not sit so well with mobsters who 'd settled into a new routine while @entity1 was away
and , they theorize , because he would not go into a quiet retirement , the " muscle " showed up and retired him another way
the details are the problem
precisely who did it ? precisely how ? police know you ca n't make much of a criminal case based on , " we 're pretty sure he 's dead , and we 're pretty sure it was these guys
" @entity1 's family has responded to the latest tip and search as they always do , by suggesting they hope it works
but 38 years after the man who was the ruling face of big labor disappeared in the clear light of day , no one has yet been able to throw aside the curtain , untangle the riddle , and declare " we have found him
" for now , @entity1 , is still hiding .
