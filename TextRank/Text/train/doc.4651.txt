-- @entity4 's government must create jobs and improve education to help fight drug trafficking , the country 's senate president said in an interview with @entity0 en @entity9
" together they form a true strategy for fighting crime and violence , " said sen. @entity10 , a top official in @entity4 's opposition @entity11
currently , @entity4 's war on drugs is a " fight of firepower between criminals and the state , " he said
" we have seen 30,000 people die in the past four years , " @entity10 said
" and we are very close to seeing , at the end of this six - year term , an equal number of dead as in the @entity27
" @entity4 president @entity28 announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office at the end of 2006
since then , more than 28,000 people have died in drug - related violence across the country
and @entity28 's government has dispatched about 50,000 troops to the nation 's trouble spots
a past governor of @entity42 state , which borders @entity43 , @entity10 also discussed @entity45 's recently defeated proposition to legalize marijuana
@entity47 19 , which failed to garner enough support from @entity45 voters earlier this month , left many @entity4 lawmakers wondering what they would do if it had passed , he said
@entity45 has already legalized medical marijuana
supporters of @entity47 argued that the " prohibition " of marijuana -- much like that for alcohol decades ago -- has created a violent criminal black market , led today by international drug cartels
but opponents prevailed earlier this month
still , @entity10 said the debate over legalizing marijuana is an issue @entity4 officials will have to tackle " sooner or later
" " but we could not do it without developing a strategy with the @entity69 , which is the drug 's largest consumer ... crime and drug trafficking , which are transnational problems , need international solutions , " he said
@entity0 en @entity9 's @entity77 contributed to this report .
