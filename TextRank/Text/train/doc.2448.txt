-- police in @entity2 monday failed to bring to court an opposition activist who was scheduled to become a government minister on friday but was arrested instead
@entity2 police officers at @entity6 where @entity8 's scheduled appearance was postponed
@entity8 of the @entity9 was supposed to be sworn in as deputy agriculture minister last week under a power - sharing agreement between the @entity9 and president @entity13 's @entity12
@entity8 was charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism , sabotage and banditry
police added another charge , contravening the @entity20 , on the day he was scheduled to appear in court
they accuse @entity8 of attempting to leave the country illegally
his party has decried the charges as " trumped up
" his lawyer said monday 's court proceedings were canceled because prosecutors were unable to make it from the capital @entity32 to the court where the proceeding was to take place , in @entity36 , 132 miles ( 213 km ) away
it is unclear why local prosecutors are not being used
@entity8 's lawyer @entity39 says he hopes his client will appear on tuesday
" he is doing fine considering the conditions of the cells he is being kept in , " @entity42 said
" there is no food or running water , sanitation facilities are not working , the cells are overcrowded and there are no blankets
" @entity8 was arrested on friday while on his way to @entity53 , where he has been living for three years
@entity8 , who is also the @entity9 party 's treasurer , was pulled from an aircraft at the airport in @entity2 's capital , @entity32 , the @entity9 said
police accuse him of funding the acquisition of weapons to commit the crimes he is charged with
@entity8 , a white coffee grower , is an old foe of @entity13 's government
his farms were seized during the country 's controversial land reform program
he has previously been jailed for assaulting justice minister @entity68 in parliament
the arrest happened the same day that other @entity9 ministers in the new unity government took their oaths of office
the power - sharing agreement came into effect only after months of on - again , off - again negotiations between @entity13 , who has ruled @entity2 since independence in 1980 , and the @entity9 , led by @entity79
under @entity13 's government , the country has gone from being one of the breadbaskets of @entity53 to dire poverty
a cholera epidemic is raging , much of the population lacks adequate food and water , many public sector workers are on strike , and the country suffers such severe inflation it recently knocked 12 zeroes off its currency
