@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 authorities sunday announced that two recalled candy products made by @entity6 confectioner @entity5 had high levels of melamine
the industrial chemical has recently been found in @entity1 - made milk products that have sickened nearly 53,000 children in @entity1 , killing four
countries around the world have since banned the import of @entity1 products containing milk , or have withdrawn products that contain milk from @entity1 -- such as candy -- amid worries they contain melamine
last week , @entity5 recalled all of its @entity1 - made candy products after preliminary tests showed they contained trace amounts of melamine
@entity5 took the action because " no level of melamine is appropriate , " spokesman @entity28 told @entity2 on sunday
he could not comment on the latest test results
the company stresses that its products manufactured at its @entity36 plant are only exported to @entity37 and @entity0 , with one product -- @entity39 -- sent to @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42
@entity0 's @entity43 tested 104 samples of products made by a variety of manufacturers , including @entity5 , @entity48 , and some @entity49 and @entity1 companies
only two of the samples showed unsatisfactory levels of melamine -- @entity55 ( bulk pack 5kg ) and @entity57 ( bulk pack 5kg )
the sample of the @entity57 contained melamine levels of 65 ppm ( parts per million ) which is more than 25 times the acceptable level of 2.5 ppm , according to @entity0 's government
according to the center , a child weighing 22 pounds ( 10kg ) would have to eat more than 10 small pieces of the hazelnut chocolate to surpass the tolerable daily intake
an average adult weighing 132 pounds ( 60kg ) would have to eat more than 112 small pieces to surpass the level
the melamine levels in the samples of @entity55 were 6.9 ppm -- more than twice as high as the legal limit of melamine
@entity0 's @entity43 said it will continue to test dairy products and other products with dairy ingredients
test results on other products -- including milk powder , soya drinks , yogurt , butter , baby food and frozen confections -- would be released on monday , it said
@entity1 authorities have implicated 22 @entity1 dairy companies in the tainted milk scandal
investigators suspect people watered down milk in an attempt to sell more of it , and added melamine in order to fool quality checks , @entity1 authorities have said
the toxic chemical is used to bolster apparent protein levels in diluted or poor - quality milk
on saturday @entity1 announced that a test of 607 batches of liquid milk from 27 cities found the samples to be melamine - free , state - run media said
the tests were the sixth @entity1 officials have carried out since melamine was discovered in powdered infant formula last month
@entity1 authorities have promised to subsidize farmers hit by the shrinking demand for milk , the news agency @entity111 said
among them is the northern @entity117 province , which has earmarked 316 million yuan ( $ 46.1 million ) for subsidies
that translates to giving a farmer 200 yuan ( $ 29 ) per cow , @entity111 said

@entity1 authorities have arrested 40 people in connection with the scandal , including two brothers who could face the death penalty if convicted
