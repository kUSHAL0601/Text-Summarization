-- @entity2 's attorney general proposed arming one principal or employee at each school to defend against attacks such as the recent @entity8 school massacre
" the ideal solution would be to have an armed police officer in each school , " attorney general @entity9 said in a news release wednesday
but budget cuts have limited the number of @entity2 schools with " school resource officers " on campus , he said
the " next best solution , " @entity9 said , " is to have one person in the school trained to handle firearms , to handle emergency situations , and possessing a firearm in a secure location
" a shooter , armed with a semiautomatic rifle and two other guns , on december 14 killed 26 people -- including six faculty members and 20 young students -- at @entity32 in @entity33
@entity9 compared the plan to the @entity36 's program adopted after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks to arm airline pilots
a school would be invited to send the principal " or another designee " to " training in the use of firearms and how to handle emergencies such as that which occurred in @entity33 , " @entity9 's release said
@entity9 's office would oversee the free training with help from sheriffs , he said
" the designated individual ( no more than one per school ) would then be authorized to keep a firearm locked in a secure place , and would have adequate communication to be alerted to an emergency in any part of the school , " the release said
@entity62 publishes names , addresses of gun permit holders several @entity2 sheriffs have joined in to support the proposal , @entity9 said
legislation to allow it will be introduced by the @entity71 leader in the @entity72 , he said
" this proposal presents a golden mean between two extremes , " @entity9 said
" one extreme is to allow all teachers to bring guns to school , which could create more dangers than it prevents
the other extreme is to do nothing , which everyone will regret if a preventable incident like @entity33 would occur in the future
" @entity0 's @entity86 contributed to this report .
