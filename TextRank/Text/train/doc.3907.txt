-- the two women shot and wounded by @entity5 police during the manhunt for renegade ex-officer @entity7 are " not doing well , " their attorney said thursday at a news conference to announce a resolution to the loss of their bullet - riddled pickup truck
@entity13 , 47 , and her mother , @entity14 , 71 , will receive $ 40,000 to replace the truck , @entity5 city attorney @entity12 said
@entity16 and @entity17 were shot as police searched for @entity7 , a former police officer who was wanted for killing several people in early february
@entity7 manhunt : a car chase , a gunfight and a fiery cabin the two women were in a truck similar to the one authorities said @entity7 was driving
" they 're not doing well , " attorney @entity26 said
" @entity13 is still very emotionally impacted by what happened
@entity14 is suffering as far as her injuries are concerned
" @entity17 was shot twice in the back , and @entity16 suffered injuries from broken glass , @entity0 affiliate @entity32 reported
@entity12 told reporters that now that the issues with the truck are settled , lawyers can turn their attention to the personal injury issues
the lawyers said they had to find a creative solution to get the women a new truck because of tax laws
essentially the $ 40,000 is for the value of the truck , @entity26 ' fees , compensation for the time the women have gone without a truck and other matters
@entity26 waived his fees , which would have amounted to about $ 25,000 , he said
" we wanted to get this issue resolved because it is draining a lot of energy , " @entity26 said
he would not comment on how much the women will seek in compensation for their physical injuries and emotional distress
@entity7 died february 12 while holed up in a cabin that caught fire when police fired tear gas canisters into it
days before , he had killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades before apparently taking his own life in the cabin
