-- @entity3 football 's governing body , @entity4 has revealed that 32 of its 54 member states have declared an interest in hosting matches at the 2020 @entity8
traditionally , the tournament is hosted by one or two nations , but matches in 2020 will be shared between 13 cities across @entity3
@entity4 , who announced a change in format for the tournament 's 60th anniversary last december , welcomed the enthusiastic response from the national football associations
" we are extremely proud to see the huge interest in the bidding process , with more than half of our member associations willing to host matches at @entity27 , " @entity4 president @entity20 said
" the finals will be a great celebration of football across the @entity3 continent , and the 60th anniversary edition will be truly special , by really coming to the doorstep of all football fans
" @entity20 initially floated the idea following the 2012 championships hosted by @entity37 and @entity38 and a decision to change the format was agreed by @entity4 's @entity41 last december before being confirmed in january
the format , dubbed a " @entity43 for @entity3 , " has attracted interest from reigning @entity43 champions , @entity46 and the other traditional powerhouses of @entity3 football -- @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55
" @entity4 's ' euro for @entity3 ' in 2020 promises to be a fitting way to recognise 60 years of the @entity4 @entity43 , " said @entity57 secretary @entity56 in a statement
" it would be great to see @entity55 playing in front of their home fans here in @entity65 as part of a @entity68 tournament but many countries have also put themselves forward as hosts and we expect this to be a very competitive bidding process
" less illustrious footballing nations including @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 have also thrown their hat into the ring
@entity4 says all 32 associations can submit a maximum of two bids -- one which covers three group matches and one knockout round and another which will vie to host the semifinal and final
the closing date for bids is april 25 with @entity4 's @entity41 announcing the host cities on september 25 next year
