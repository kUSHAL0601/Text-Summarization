" i 've been told by my doctors and trainer that my back muscles need to be rehabilitated and healed
they 've advised me not to play or practice now , " @entity2 wrote
woods , 38 , was a potential selection by @entity9 captain @entity18 for the team , but the 14 - time major tournament winner said the match play event against @entity23 's best golfers meant too much and he should n't play if he could n't give it his best effort
" of course , i 'm disappointed that @entity2 has asked not to be considered for the @entity9 @entity8 team , and that his health is not where he would like it to be , " @entity18 said , according to the @entity4 's website
" however , i think we can all agree that we need @entity2 in this great sport , and he has taken the high road by informing me early on in the selection process
" nine golfers have automatically qualified for the team : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45

he said he plans to return to tournament golf at the @entity68 tournament at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , beginning december 1 .
