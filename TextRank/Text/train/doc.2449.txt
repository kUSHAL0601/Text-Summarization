@entity2 postponed the hanging of an @entity5 leader shortly before his execution was to take place tuesday , his attorney told @entity8
@entity9 is now scheduled to be hanged wednesday
his defense lawyers , meanwhile , are filing a petition for his sentence to be reviewed
it was not immediately known why the government decided to postpone the execution
the decision came a day after the @entity17 called for the hanging to be halted
on tuesday , @entity20 @entity19 joined the calls for a stay of execution
@entity9 was sentenced in september for alleged " crimes against humanity " dating back to 1971 , during the country 's war for independence
the ruling against him set off rioting in the streets and sparked a strike across the country
@entity9 was the assistant secretary general for the now - banned @entity35 party
in february , he was convicted of war crimes by an international panel set up by the government to bring to justice those accused of atrocities
he was originally sentenced to life in prison
@entity2 's supreme court then sentenced him to death
in the country 's legal system , that can not be appealed
two @entity17 human rights experts called on @entity2 on monday to halt the execution because of concerns that @entity9 did not receive a fair trial
" the right of appeal is of particular importance in death penalty cases , " said @entity53 , @entity17 special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers
" anyone convicted of a crime has the right to have his or her conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal , as laid down in the @entity70 to which @entity2 is a party , " she said in a prepared statement
" this provision is violated where a court of final instance imposes a harsher sentence that can not be reviewed
" @entity78 , @entity17 special rapporteur on summary executions , said capital punishment " may be imposed only following a trial that complied with fair trial and due process safeguards
... only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as possibly permitted under international law from a summary execution , which by definition violates human rights standards
" in a statement tuesday , @entity19 called for a stay , saying the trial had not met stringent international standards for the death penalty , the @entity17 said in a statement
the @entity17 opposes the death penalty in any circumstance
