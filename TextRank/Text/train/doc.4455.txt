-- is there no end to @entity4 's talents ? she is a grand slam tennis winner , but she has a prodigious intellect and is also an adept artist
in the relaxed settings of @entity11 's garden in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity4 reflected on a career that blossomed after years of struggles -- both personal and professional -- opening up about feeling like a " ghost " as a child and her @entity19 win at @entity20
@entity11 's garden is one of @entity4 's favorite spots
she often traveled to tennis tournaments around the world with paint brushes and recently graduated from art school in @entity28 with a 90 %
the stellar grade should n't come as a surprise , since the @entity13 once claimed she had an iq of 175 , higher than @entity32
despite winning @entity20 and carving out a 13 - year professional career with earnings of more than $ 11 million , @entity4 suffered for her art on court
and contrary to what she uttered in august , @entity4 has no plans of staging a comeback
" i had some really deep scars that were wide open , " the 29 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity41
" but i covered them and made sure no one could see them when i was playing
" now i can say i have passed every single test , and i became the happiest person in the world
" feeling of neglect by now many know the methods her dad and coach , @entity54 , used to train @entity4
her father -- also a doctor -- would reward @entity4 with sweets when she hit targets and attached tennis balls to the bottom of her feet to make sure she stayed on her toes
using old tennis balls in practice allowed @entity4 to acclimatize to all types of bounces
but much lesser known is how @entity4 said she played second - fiddle to her older brother -- who was having " issues " at school -- when growing up and received less attention from her mom @entity71
" she was giving more time to him than to me and i had almost to be a ghost , " said @entity4
even as she rose into the top 10 and reached major finals , the feeling of neglect lingered
over the years @entity71 rarely attended @entity4 's matches
" my mother had another , big influence in another way , " said @entity4
when asked if she had now proven herself to her mom , @entity4 added : " oh yeah , i think so
but that 's what was also very hard for me to take with my dad , when i could see his disappointment with my performance
" that was the toughest part
" in 2011 , @entity4 's fraught relationship with parents came to a head when she threw them both out of a player 's box on a @entity20 side court
but she grew stronger mentally on the tennis court , helping to explain her ascent
her game mirrored @entity100 ' in being unorthodox -- hitting with two hands on both the forehand and backhand
between points @entity4 could often be seen bobbing up and down , concurrently simulating a swing
" the way she bounced up and down and swung between points was exhausting , " retired former world no. 5 @entity106 , a longtime analyst with @entity107 , told @entity0
" she must have run so many miles between points let alone during the points
" for a spell @entity4 never bounced the ball before serving , another unusual practice
for the casual fan @entity4 rose to prominence at @entity20 in 2007 when she upset then world no. 1 @entity114 to reach the finale
her fondness for actor @entity117 , who watched one of her matches , became international news
" personal " problems @entity122 was indeed @entity4 's most productive surface , with her flat , hard ground strokes moving through the court and making life difficult for her opponents
this , despite her home grand slam being held on clay
it took a while for @entity4 to win over @entity13 fans and she was in dispute for most of her career with her federation
when it did n't budge in her request to make @entity54 a key member of the @entity142 setup , she sat out the competition and missed last year 's @entity144 -- on the very same grass at @entity20
but @entity4 would be the last woman standing at the @entity146 last july
not that she expected it
" if i tell you what was happening three days in my life before @entity20 started , you will never believe i won it , " she said
" keeping busy " @entity4 contested a @entity20 warmup in @entity153 on the east coast of @entity155 and developed a 40 - degree fever that forced her to pull out of a second - round encounter against former @entity159 champion @entity158
she had " personal " problems , too , to contend with -- reportedly the separation of her parents
" i just prayed to @entity163 and said , ' the only thing i want from now on is to be happy
i do n't care about my tennis ranking , i do n't care about winning or losing
i just want to be happy , ' " she said
i was tired , lonely and sad
" @entity4 's friends rallied around her -- " when i feel loved , i can lift mountains , " she says -- and thus her special fortnight began
@entity4 will be the first to tell you the draw gods helped , as she did n't have to face ex champions @entity173 and @entity174 , or grand slam winner @entity175
as it turned out , @entity4 avoided any player in the top 10
but @entity4 downed the promising @entity181 in the quarterfinals , former @entity20 junior titlist @entity183 in the semifinals and big - serving @entity185 in the final
even though she was better ranked than @entity185 , many picked the @entity188 to triumph given she had upset @entity173 and @entity189
@entity106 was n't one of them
" i thought she was just so beautifully focused and determined that there was no question in her mind that she was n't going to win , " said @entity106
" you could see the determination written large on her face
" @entity4 had little nerves entering the final , relaxed enough to take a nap shortly before it began , joking with her entourage and even booking tickets for her team
prior to striking an ace on the final point , @entity4 flashed back to those days as a child when she finished practice past midnight in freezing conditions under a leaking roof
when it was over a hug to dad , the biggest influence in her career , ensued
" two weeks earlier i just wanted to be happy , and then i won @entity20 , " said @entity4
then you can write , ' the end
' " it was indeed almost the end
a month later , her body unable to withstand the demands of the tennis tour any longer , @entity4 quit
" she dragged every little bit of talent out of herself , " said @entity106
but a return , a @entity224 , @entity225 or @entity226 , is n't on the cards
" i will not come back , " @entity4 insisted
even after winning @entity20 , @entity4 was subjected to comments about her appearance after @entity232 commentator @entity231 apologized to her for saying she was " never going to be a looker
" at the time , asked about @entity235 's comments , @entity4 reportedly said : " it does n't matter , honestly
i am not blonde , yes
have i dreamt about having a model contract ? no. i 'm sorry
" @entity4 , meet @entity240 @entity4 is keeping busy in retirement
she played in an exhibition on @entity243 -- owned by @entity244 -- this month and returns to the @entity245 in january to meet the fastest man on the planet , @entity240
@entity4 is n't sure what is on the agenda that day
" he actually invited me and wanted to meet me , " said @entity4
if @entity240 wants to learn more about tennis , painting -- and maybe even life -- @entity4 might just be the right person .
