-- among all the woes of modern air travel -- cramped seating , extra charges for baggage , outrageous prices for airport food -- perhaps nothing frays the nerves of passengers faster than air turbulence
well , brace yourself for even bumpier skies
a pair of @entity17 scientists are predicting that the white - knuckle rocking and rolling at 35,000 feet is going to get worse
according to a paper published in the scientific journal , @entity23 , climate change will significantly increase turbulence over the @entity25 , a popular route between @entity27 and @entity28
the report concludes that " journey times may lengthen and fuel consumption and emissions may increase " as a result

currently , turbulence causes about $ 150 million a year in damages to planes and other expenses , said @entity44 , one of the report 's authors from the department of meteorology at the @entity49
there 's a high chance overall industry costs will rise as turbulence intensifies , he said
the report is based on a study of climate model simulations that suggest changes in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will dramatically increase the jarring rattle , shake , shimmy and sudden drops known all too well to frequent fliers

study results show that the area above the @entity25 that will experience " significant " turbulence will double , explained @entity44
" significant " turbulence can be classified as turbulence that would prompt a pilot to turn on the seat belt sign , he said
@entity68 told @entity0 he expects to find similar results when the team looks at the @entity83 region , between @entity84 and the @entity85 of the @entity86
so , in addition to everything else , expect to hear that " keep your seat belt fastened " reprimand a little more often as you fly the shaky skies .
