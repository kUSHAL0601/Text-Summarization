-- after deliberating for only 45 minutes , a jury convicted an @entity3 man thursday of throwing his four children off a @entity6 bridge in january 2008 , according to prosecutors
@entity8 , 38 , admitted throwing the children , who ranged in age from 3 years to 4 months , off the @entity12 bridge south of @entity13 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity14
charged with five counts of capital murder , he changed his plea to guilty last week
however , @entity3 law requires that all capital cases go before a judge and jury , @entity14 said
the sentencing phase of @entity27 's trial will begin friday , the @entity24 district attorney 's office told @entity0
jurors will decide whether he should receive the death penalty or life in prison without parole
a judge is not bound by the jury 's decision , however , and @entity3 law requires an automatic appeal in capital cases
@entity27 and his wife were having marital difficulties , prosecutors said
@entity14 reported that during opening arguments in the trial , prosecutors told jurors @entity27 threw the kids off the bridge so he could see the look on his wife 's face
@entity27 was on crack at the time , and he told investigators they could charge him if they found the children 's bodies before breaking into laughter , jurors were told
the defense called no witnesses , but told jurors @entity27 was intoxicated at the time and was incapable of forming the necessary intent to be convicted of a capital offense , asking them to convict him of manslaughter , @entity14 said
during the trial , jurors heard about the search for the children 's bodies and saw graphic video of the bodies floating in the water , the station reported
a commercial fisherman recording rough weather off the coast of @entity75 , @entity76 , found one body , while two duck hunters and a @entity80 marine officer found the other three , according to @entity14
@entity27 looked down , away from the overhead screens , when the photographs of the children 's bodies were shown
@entity0 's @entity84 contributed to this report .
