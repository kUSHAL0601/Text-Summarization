-- new @entity3 light - welterweight world champion , @entity2 , is planning a career in politics , the 30 - year - old told @entity0 on his return to his native @entity7
@entity7 boxing champ @entity2 sits with secretary of environment and natural resources @entity8 ( @entity10 ) and former governor @entity11 ( r ) in @entity12
though " @entity2 " will concentrate on boxing until next year , the man dubbed the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world suggested he could retire the following year to run for congress
" i want to be a congressman so i can help the people , " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity18
but when asked if becoming the @entity7 president was his ultimate aim he added : " i would n't think about that because my ambition is only to run for congress
@entity2 previously ran in the 2007 congressional elections for president @entity29 's party but was beaten by the @entity31 candidate @entity30 , who received 139,061 votes to @entity2 's 75,908 , @entity26 's @entity25 said
@entity2 is a national hero in the @entity7 but has seen his popularity grow around the world since his comprehensive victory over @entity26 fighter @entity36 in @entity37
" i 'm happy to be back ( in @entity12 ) because there 's a lot of people supporting me here
i expected it in the @entity7 but i had many supporting me in @entity42 too
" the man dubbed the " @entity44 " will be a busy man over the next few months as he plans to make his second film and record a tv programme
this is a long way from his humble origins growing up in @entity49 , southern @entity7 , a reality that @entity2 says he struggles to believe sometimes
" i never dreamed i would reach the levels of success i have reached , he said
" but i have faith in @entity55 and discipline in myself to make the sacrifices ( needed ) and to train hard
" in 14 years as a professional , @entity2 has won world titles in four weight divisions -- from 7st 8lb to 9st 9lb , at flyweight , super bantamweight , super featherweight and lightweight
in his last contest , in december , in what many felt would be a step too far , he dismantled @entity42 's most popular boxer , @entity68 , at the 10st 7lb limit , in eight one - sided rounds
@entity2 is currently rated by @entity71 , the sport 's most respected trade magazine , as the best boxer in the world
his career earnings stand at an estimated Â£ 30 million , with major paydays coming relatively late in his career
however he remains modest despite the success
" it 's a big honour to me and my family to be looked up to by so many people
" my inspiration comes from my family -- the people who are always there behind me supporting me and love me
