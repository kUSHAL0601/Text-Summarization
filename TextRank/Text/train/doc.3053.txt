@entity0 -- i was standing just a few meters from prince @entity4 as he got to his feet
his older brother @entity6 was there too
but this was @entity4 's show -- a charity mission to @entity10 , the capital of the poverty - stricken @entity11 of @entity12 where the prince had established a charity @entity15 , to aid the country 's vulnerable children
it was a mission , back in june 2010 , and one of which the younger prince is rightly proud
within seconds of starting his speech , however , @entity4 could n't resist a playful swipe at his older brother
yet again , the third in line to the throne , who proudly boasts a healthy mop of red hair , mocked @entity6 's receding hairline
it is a running joke -- but this time @entity6 clearly thought it had been cracked once too often
he lent back against the wall , raised his eyes skywards in genuine frustration but said nothing
prince @entity4 was once again playing for laughs
predictably , at his brother 's expense , he got them
@entity6 , not for the first time , simply suffered in silence
naked @entity4 scandal a watershed moment for @entity45 press that incident sums the pair up perfectly
@entity4 is a showman , a natural performer in front of the camera and a microphone
he is warm , naughty , an extrovert and has a sense of fun
as a result people warm to him
like his late mother , @entity57 , @entity57 , he is flawed and that makes him interesting
people love his madcap ways and seem able to forgive him when he gets it wrong
he has worn a @entity63 uniform , been exposed for taking drugs and boozing and making racist comments
yet we forgive him time after time
now his naked romp in the sin capital of the world , @entity70 , has heaped further embarrassment on the @entity72
but the chances are it will blow over and we will fall in love with this princely rogue again
the reason for this maybe rooted in the fact that deep down the @entity45 public -- who after all fund his security and at least part of his lifestyle -- know unless there is a major disaster he wo n't actually get his hands of the @entity89
he can have all the fame and wealth , but in truth very little of the responsibility
nude @entity95 - how the @entity45 tabloids lost their sting for prince @entity6 , as second in line to the throne , his future is very different and he knows it
he can not let his hair down in public -- if the future @entity105 was exposed doing what @entity4 was snapped doing , it would raise serious questions about his suitability to one day be @entity45 's @entity109 , a position gifted to him by birthright
when they were boys @entity57 often confided to friends that she thought @entity4 would make a good @entity105
@entity114 , she thought , had a better temperament for the top job
she even gave him the nickname @entity117 for " @entity119
" @entity6 , always shy and less outgoing than @entity4 , was more introspective , weighed down perhaps by expectation
it was @entity4 who frustrated his protection officers by crashing royal cars into walls on the private estates and on one occasion wondering off into a public high street with a police radio for the hell of it
@entity6 was always more careful , conscious perhaps that it would be his head that would one day wear the @entity89
how ' soldier prince ' @entity4 tore up royal rule book but as an adult @entity6 has grown into his role perfectly
he fits the bill as a future king perfectly
he speaks well , conducts himself with aplomb on and off duty
since his marriage to his university sweetheart , @entity146 now @entity143 of @entity144 , if anything he has grown in confidence and composure
the pair look every inch a future @entity105 , and the modern monarchy safe in their hands
when they go to nightclubs -- which they do -- there is never a hint of louche behavior or scandal
they have a few drinks and go home
it may be a little dull , maybe even predictable , but it is what is expected of them
he is after all a senior royal not a celebrity
since his marriage last year , @entity6 has been seen less and less on the clubbing scene , preferring instead to have a quiet night in or dinner at an @entity175 restaurant with his wife
this has led to @entity4 saying his brother has become boring
but nothing could be further from the truth
prince @entity6 helps save girl from drowning @entity6 , may not have served on the frontline like @entity184 pilot @entity4 , but he risks his personal safety every time he pilots his @entity188 helicopter from @entity189 in @entity190
he only recently was in charge of a daring rescue of a teenage girl
he combines these duties with official tours abroad and does so tirelessly , sometimes completing engagements at a hospital or charity venue after a 24 hour shift on duty
@entity4 is clearly a good soldier
he served with distinction as a @entity203 commander in @entity204 before an internet leak that he was there forced him to return early from his tour of duty
he will no doubt soon be returning there as an @entity184 pilot and again , i have no doubt , serve his country well
embarrassing pics could harm a soldier 's career several way perhaps this latest naked controversy will focus his mind
perhaps it will force this " @entity220 " prince to grow up and leave his schoolboy antics behind
the next time he goes to poke fun at his older , more cautious brother , he might just hold his tongue
for surely now is the time for him to wise up and follow prince @entity6 's example
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229
