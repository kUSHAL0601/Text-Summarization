-- @entity1 knew she had some pounds to lose , but she had no idea how much being overweight affected her until the television cameras started rolling
@entity4 performs with her partner on @entity7 's new hit " @entity8
" " going into it , i knew it was a tv show , i knew it was a weight - loss show and i knew it was a dance show , but i did n't think i was going to learn so much about myself through the process , " said the 23 - year - old @entity1 , a contestant on the new show " @entity8
" " i did n't know how many issues and problems i had with my weight until i faced it on the show
" @entity1 's struggle with weight loss is one of many on television that is resonating with those tuning into programming aimed at and featuring the plus - sized
@entity28 's " @entity27 , " @entity30 's " @entity29 , " @entity31 's " @entity26 " and @entity33 's forthcoming dating show " more to love " all center on the overweight and are tapping into an audience that can relate to the desire to shed a few pounds
obesity has risen dramatically in the @entity39 during the past 20 years , according to the @entity40
and this year television has seen an increase in shows featuring participants and stars who look more like the viewing public
@entity7 's " @entity8 " combines elements of @entity49 's " @entity48 " and @entity30 's " @entity29
" contestants learn dance routines for which they are judged before weighing in to determine how much they have lost
@entity53 , senior vice president of original programming and development at @entity7 , said dance and diet are two areas of interest for younger viewers of the channel , so combining the two made sense
the 12 contestants , from the smallest to the largest , have struck a chord with viewers , she said
" people find the contestants so relatable , " she said
" we cast very purposely across the board in terms of how many pounds people needed to lose -- we had anywhere from people who needed to lose 40 [ pounds ] to over 150
" the premier of " dance " rated highly for @entity7 , with more than 1 million viewers tuning in
@entity7 also found success earlier with " @entity77 's @entity76 , " a plus - size pageant where women of substance strutted their stuff to be crowned " @entity82
" for a nation grappling with obesity , @entity83 said , there is a hunger for such shows
" if you have five pounds to lose or you have 150 pounds to lose , it 's something you think about all day long , " she said
" you take a bite of cheesecake and you think ' should i be doing this ? ' " @entity95 , a professor of women 's studies at @entity97 and co-editor of the forthcoming anthology " @entity100 , " said she wonders if part of the appeal of plus - sized shows stems from the overweight being held up for public ridicule
the subject of her book is an emerging field that has been defined as " confronting and critiquing cultural constraints " against notions of " fatness " and " the fat body
" " most people feel too fat in this country and are made to feel very unhappy with their bodies , " she said
" so by portraying somebody who weighs so much more than they do , it 's almost a way to make the audience feel like ' i could look worse ' or ' at least i 'm not them
' " @entity122 said she supports any show that does not mock the overweight
her hit show " @entity27 " started out as a documentary and has transformed @entity122 into a reality star who has lost more than 100 pounds and appeared on " @entity128
" " we are really all on this journey together , and i tell [ viewers ] that all of the time , " said @entity122 , who at her heaviest weighed 716 pounds
" there are a lot of shows out there and i think people are trying to find a way to beat it and lose weight
" @entity122 , who is traveling around the country walking in various cities to inspire fans to become more active , said shows featuring the obese can really touch the audience if they are authentic
" [ my show ] is the truth , not to say that the others are n't , " she said
" when i started out on this journey and met with @entity150 , which airs the show ] i said ' i have to keep my truth because this is about my journey and addiction and i want to deal with that because too many people are struggling
' " her show portrays her grappling with everything from temptation to embarrassment at having to visit the gynecologist , but @entity122 said it 's all worth it if it inspires others
actress @entity164 , who starred in the @entity166 musical " @entity167 , " said she agreed to host " @entity8 " because she saw the potential for inspiration in viewers witnessing overweight people being active and feeling confident and sexy -- even in skimpy dance outfits
reality television has become so popular because viewers are attracted to watching real people , and there is a craving for viewers to see folks like themselves , she said
" it became that so many people on reality shows were only beautiful skinny people , and i think a lot of people got sick of that , " said @entity164 , who has been blogging about her own struggles with weight for @entity182
" really , who 's home watching tv is the everyday person who is not a tv model
i think there is much more interest in watching people like yourself
