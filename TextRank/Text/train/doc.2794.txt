-- a 12 meter yacht bobbing off the coast of @entity3 is about to be blown to smithereens
or at least , that 's the plan
in a scene reminiscent of a @entity9 film , the boat is slowly filled with gas while a sailor in a nearby vessel holds his finger over the detonator , ready to blow the floating target sky high
these are n't undercover spies , but sailing experts undertaking a controlled explosion as part of a series of ground - breaking experiments into nautical safety
over eight months , the team from @entity26 magazine @entity25 , took one boat and sank it , capsized it , ran it aground , set it on fire , and finally blew it up -- all in the name of safety
their " @entity31 " series recreated eight nautical disasters -- ranging from a leaking hull to a dismasted sailboat -- to find the best methods for preventing and dealing with them
from january 2013 the incidents will be documented together for the first time in a new book titled , aptly enough , " @entity40
" the results featured in the book have turned much conventional sailing wisdom on its head and earned praise from both safety experts and readers across the world
" these are rare situations and when they do happen , people are n't in a position to test every method for dealing with it , " yachting monthly technical editor , @entity53 , told @entity0
" for example , if your mast breaks off , the age - old answer was to use bolt croppers to cut away the rigging and prevent more damage
" but we found that hanging over the edge of the boat while it 's rocking around like a fairground ride , with both hands on the croppers , was n't practical
a simple hacksaw , which you could use with one hand , was much more effective
" @entity71 , sailing accident investigator at the @entity72 , said recreating sailing disasters to such minute detail had never been done before
" being able to monitor the effects and test a range of responses was invaluable , " he added
the crash test boat series was first floated as @entity53 and fellow sailing enthusiasts mulled over enduring maritime questions such as : ' what would you do if your mast fell over ? ' or ' how would you survive in a capsized boat ? ' " we wanted to take theses problems and deal with them in real life , " he said
each experiment was modeled on real - life disasters , such as the @entity90 in which storms in the @entity92 capsized many of the competing yachts , resulting in 15 deaths
the series ended quite literally with a bang , in an impressive gas explosion
though it very nearly did n't get off the ground to begin with
" the authorities were telling us that a gas explosion was too dangerous , that we were crazy , " former @entity25 editor @entity101 said
" we were considering everything -- traveling the 12 mile ( 19 kilometer ) limit into international waters to escape the rules , even using a special effects expert from the @entity111 films to simulate an explosion
" after finally gaining permission to carry out the explosion , the boat was anchored in a 200 meter exclusion zone and @entity117 explosives experts were enlisted to set up the blast
but after an anxious 25 minute wait , the flash igniters set up around the leaking gas pipe failed to go off
deflated but still determined , the team vowed to give it one last shot
this time , the explosion was detonated by a wireless trigger -- and it did n't disappoint
" there was a brief orange fireball followed by the explosion
a hundred pieces of debris were hurled skywards amidst a plume of smoke , " says the report in the book
" the scale of the carnage was clear -- the entire coach roof had been blasted off the hull
" for the team , the explosion was also a thrilling chance to live out a few @entity9 - style fantasies , as @entity101 said : " how many people get to blow up a 40 foot ( yacht ) as part of their job -- and all in the name of safety ? " now a battered mess , the @entity31 continues to educate the public , exhibited at boating shows across @entity26 and used as a teaching aid at the @entity153 in @entity154
" a bit like the equivalent of a dead body in an anatomy class , " @entity101 explained
@entity53 says the boat 's greatest gift was showing sailors that " you really can rely on yourself
" " all the situations are recoverable
your boat wo n't sink if there 's hole in it
if your mast falls down you can still row to shore
the real importance of these tests was getting definitive answers in situations where people might normally panic
