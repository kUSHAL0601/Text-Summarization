-- the health of a @entity8 woman battling a rare flesh - eating bacteria has " slightly improved , " a spokeswoman for a @entity3 hospital said thursday , though the new mother remains sedated and in critical condition
@entity15 has " undergone 11 debridement surgeries to remove tissue since being admitted may 11 " to @entity14 , spokeswoman @entity10 said thursday by e-mail
but unlike 24 - year - old @entity16 of @entity17 -- who has lost a leg , part of her abdomen , her remaining foot and her hands as she fights the same disease , according to online updates from her father , @entity25 -- no parts of @entity15 's body have been amputated
" last night , @entity28 told the family in his update that ' @entity15 's vitals and blood work is good
' this is a good day for her , and we will take it , " said @entity33 , @entity15 's brother , in a message relayed by the hospital
@entity15 gave birth to twins , @entity42 and @entity43 , on may 7 in @entity44
at that time , @entity15 , a paramedic , was believed to be healthy
but a few days later she went to hospital near her @entity8 home after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg , her husband @entity28 , a firefighter , told @entity0 last week
surviving a flesh - eating disease she was diagnosed then with necrotizing fasciitis and has been intubated and sedated every day since , according to her brother and the hospital
a number of bacteria , which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections , can lead to the disease
when it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain
the disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20 % of the time , according to the @entity71
@entity72 : i survived @entity74 ... barely dr. @entity75 , chairman of the @entity76 at the @entity77 , estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the @entity79 , though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities
just last sunday , @entity15 had undergone seven surgeries for her ailment -- meaning she has had four more such operations in recent days
@entity33 said , as he did days ago , that the family is thankful the disease remains confined to his sister 's legs
while hooked up to a respirator , @entity15 is now breathing on her own , according to her brother
her baby boy and girl , who are being cared for by relatives and friends , remain healthy and are doing well
" please pray with us that @entity15 will recover quickly to a point where she will be able to interact with and enjoy this special time in their lives , " @entity33 said
@entity25 posted an update earlier thursday about his daughter @entity102 , who is fighting the same disease as @entity15 in the intensive care unit of @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity17
she was with friends may 1 near the @entity108 , about 50 miles west of @entity44 , when the zip line that she was holding snapped
she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close
three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room , and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh - devouring bacteria @entity119
her father has written regularly since about her situation , with the psychology department at the @entity123 -- where @entity102 had been pursuing her master 's degree in psychology -- also posting online updates
on thursday , her father wrote on @entity127 that @entity102 " has finally stabilized to the point that she has not needed any ventilator assistance for over 24 hours
" " each breath is a victory
each heart beat is a cause for celebration
when she opens her eyes , that is like a ticker tape parade down @entity140
when she mouths words , angelic hosts rejoice , " @entity25 said
" that is what each moment is like for us
" he described several such moments from earlier in the week , including @entity102 lighting up after listening to a " private concert " from a musician who 'd written a song about her , waking up to talk of " treats " in the hospital and sitting up in a chair
" when the doctors put @entity102 in that chair , their expectations were to give her an hour , " @entity25 said , elaborating on the latter milestone
" five hours later , @entity102 decided it was time to lie down
had she been running an @entity161 marathon , i think @entity102 would have experienced a record - breaking , gold - medal moment
" @entity0 's @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this report .
