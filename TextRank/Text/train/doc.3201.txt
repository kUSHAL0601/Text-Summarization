-- fuel - saving gas - electric hybrid and all - electric cars and trucks powered by sizable battery packs and high voltage motors could present a new kind of danger at serious accident scenes , according to an industry group
a report by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) highlighted risks to first responders and tow operators from potential electric shock from damaged systems not disengaged during or immediately after a crash
" as electric vehicles enter the marketplace in greater numbers , it 's an appropriate time to recognize best practices that facilitate a safe response when these vehicles are in an accident , " said @entity18 , chairman of the @entity11 technical committee that issued the report earlier this month
the group recommended automakers install switches that would kill battery power in the event of an accident
the location of those switches should be standardized for safety
another recommendation would create a guide for emergency workers , something @entity18 called a " cheat sheet for first responders
" it would quickly identify the location of high - voltage components allowing them to be disabled
tow truck drivers also need better information and training on how to handle hybrids and electric vehicles without receiving an unexpected jolt , the report said
more than 435,000 battery powered electric and hybrid electric vehicles were sold in the @entity55 this year , an increase of 53 % , compared to 2011 sales numbers , according to the @entity58
in may , auto industry officials and the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) and the @entity61 discussed potential dangers faced by first responders from electrical charges produced by hybrid and electric cars
@entity60 later issued interim guidance for consumers , emergency responders and tow truck operators to increase awareness about specific dangers
dangers can be reduced if responders have easy access to battery packs and if auto manufacturers create common disconnect locations in all hybrid and electric vehicles , @entity60 said
automakers are getting the message out to drivers and responders
@entity85 places the battery pack of its @entity88 all - electric car in a steel case
the @entity91 automaker also designed the battery pack to sense a crash and disable its electrical charge when involved in an accident
@entity96 has published a guide for first responders encountering its @entity99 involved in accidents
the @entity99 includes what @entity96 calls " @entity103 , " which are clearly marked logos on the doors and trunk lid to warn responders of possible electric shock
cables wrapped in orange high - voltage warning sleeves are located under the hood of the @entity112 @entity113 , maker of the @entity114 , is also helping to prepare fire service and other first responders
moreover , @entity113 took steps to better protect the volt battery pack following a fire that flared after a crash test in 2011
@entity60 found no defect with the lithium - ion battery system nor were any real world crash - fires ever reported
but the case highlighted potential safety concerns for first responders .
