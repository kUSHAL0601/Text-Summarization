@entity0 , @entity1 -- a 42 - year - old man was charged wednesday with arson and two counts of murder in connection with the deaths of a woman and her 7 - year - old son in @entity1
wearing a bulletproof vest , @entity11 appeared in @entity13
he said he has no lawyer , so one will be appointed to him
he 's being held in the deaths of @entity17 and @entity18
the boy 's stepfather , @entity19 , was also killed
there 's some question as to whether @entity17 was killed in a different county , said @entity25 sheriff @entity24 , explaining why @entity11 was charged with two , rather than three , counts of murder
there 's no indication the suspect had anything against the three victims , the sheriff noted , nor that he even knew them
" we do n't think there is ( a relationship ) , " @entity24 said
" but we have n't tied that loose end up yet
" the seeming randomness of the crime makes the deaths all the more inexplicable to loved ones , as well as to neighbors in the city of @entity45 they called home
as @entity47 , @entity48 - @entity17 's cousin , said : " we do n't know why anybody would want to do any harm to them
" the family was last seen friday in a car that was later found flipped and on fire
the @entity25 sheriff says authorities now believe that @entity11 was driving that car when he got in an accident , then set it ablaze
was he alone at the time ? @entity24 said he has " no way of knowing that right now
" after finding the vehicle , investigators found bloody clothes belonging to the victims next to a gas station trash bin
then their bodies were discovered in a wooded area , all shot to death , said @entity24
according to @entity2 affiliate @entity69 , @entity18 was a student at @entity70 in @entity45 , a city of some 22,000 people about 15 miles east of @entity72
his teacher @entity73 recalled his omnipresent smile , big eyelashes and how he 'd " concentrate on his work so hard that his little tongue would stick out the whole time
" the boy 's great - grandfather @entity80 told @entity69 that he and others were heartbroken as they tried to make sense of the deaths , especially that of young @entity18
" he was my heart , and he was so innocent , " @entity80 said
" i just hate for him to have to be caught up in this
" in july : mysterious @entity1 murder stokes suspicions bred by an ugly past @entity2 's @entity90 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity2 's @entity91 reported and wrote from @entity92
@entity2 's @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 contributed to this report .
