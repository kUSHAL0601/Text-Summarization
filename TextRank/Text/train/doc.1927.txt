-- the age of the virtual assistant is here to stay with @entity3 adding the voice of @entity5 to its @entity6
i 'm old enough to remember the days when certain computing tasks required a steep learning curve
now it seems almost magical that i can tell my virtual assistant to remind me to take out the garbage when i get home or call my mom when i get busy
the best part is that when it speaks to me , it does so in a way that allows me to believe , for a brief moment , that i 'm interacting with another person
that 's because these virtual assistants sound so human
for the creators of artificial intelligent systems , it 's critical to build them so that they can facilitate emotional connection with users
when machine interactions with humans feel effortless , natural and " real , " that 's the ultimate metric of success
we 're just getting started
today 's artificial intelligence systems are just scratching the surface of what 's possible for personal assistants , advisors and maybe , in some cases , true companions
indeed , the machine - human relationship in the movie " her " may not seem so far - fetched in the decades to come
future virtual assistants will offer far more capabilities and can be personalized for each person
why should we settle for the voice that companies choose for us ? we 've known for quite some time that typically female voices are preferred , based on their ability to be heard in a clear manner across a broad range of devices
of course , female voices also tend to be trusted more than male voices
however , if there is one request heard over and over again , it 's for more and varied choices in the persona of these virtual assistants , along with greater control over their spoken voice
creating text - to - speech , or @entity63 , can be a difficult task
the more human the system needs to sound the more data needs to be collected
often times this requires massive amounts of linguistic and acoustic information , based on recordings of real humans
fortunately , the technology is rapidly evolving
future modeling techniques , where @entity63 voices are made from mathematical models of its human counterparts , will be lifelike enough to simulate human speech
they will also allow more rapid voice creation , allowing a previously unachievable level of personalization , where each person could even pick his or her unique voice for a virtual assistant
modeling technology will also make possible the combination of different voice traits
for example , the deep qualities of a voice similar to @entity92 could be combined with the unorthodox speaking style of someone like @entity96
@entity3 took a page from the gaming world by basing @entity5 on the character from the @entity101 video game series
perhaps future voices in our devices will be as readily available to manipulate to create a cacophony of recognizable personal assistants from favorite film and tv actors , radio hosts , family members , comedians -- the sky would be the limit
whether it 's a character from our favorite game or movie , or a persona created by users themselves , we could allow our virtual assistants the freedom to keep us entertained as well as informed
while there is a fine line between personalization and novelty , i see us on a collision course for having more intelligent conversations with our digital assistants in the years ahead
the gadget - oriented systems of today will continue to grow and adapt to our ever - expanding needs , and the more they learn about us , the more they can assist us
when looking at the challenges facing humanity , whether it 's eradicating disease , solving our planet 's renewable energy needs , or even colonizing other worlds , it 's worth pondering if it will be the humans or the intelligence systems that we create that will tackle these problems
and will we be listening if it 's the virtual assistants that are doing the work ?
