-- alongside his quest to add more @entity4 medals to his collection of 16 , swimmer @entity1 has taken some time outside of the water to dive into his first video game
the 14 - time gold medalist has partnered with publisher @entity11 and developer @entity12 to create the world 's first swimming game for @entity18 's @entity17 system
" @entity1 : push the limit " is played without any controllers , allowing players to move their bodies to replicate swimming styles like backstroke , butterfly and breaststroke and virtually swim in competitions around the world
@entity27 , who instructs players in the game on how to improve their swimming , also provided voice work and his motion - capture likeness for the game
he worked with the development team throughout the creative process
a life - long gamer , the @entity39 , @entity40 , native is focused on training for the @entity44
but he 's also using technology , including the new video game , to help generate awareness for his sport outside of the global spotlight every four years
in this interview for @entity0 , @entity27 talks about gaming , @entity52 , and why he 's addicted to the mobile game " @entity54
" how often do you play video games ? i probably play two or three days a week
it 's mostly just sports games like " @entity60 " , " @entity61 " , " @entity62 " and " @entity63
" i 've always loved the sporting games
every now and then we 'll play " @entity69 " online , but i just get destroyed every time and it 's not really that fun
what was it like for you to get involved in your own video game ? it was weird
i still look at the game cover and i 'm like , " wow
" but it 's kind of cool
growing up a gamer and being able to work on the little things in this game like the different venues and those types of details has been a dream come true
the opportunities that i 've had to take the sport to a new level and change it and do things that people have n't seen before has been fun
and now having a game on @entity17 , it 's not every day a swimmer has that
it 's just exciting and hopefully everybody out there can enjoy it as much as i have enjoyed the creative process of building it and playing it and making it and being a part of everything
when it comes to the motion controls of the @entity17 , what did that open up for swimming ? past ( swimming ) games have just been about hitting the a and b buttons quickly
@entity17 allowed us to get gamers up and actually go through the motions to feel like you are swimming
it 's cool for me because this game might help people not only get into the sport more , but to also get up and be active
that 's something that 's very important for not only kids , but everybody out there
how much of a workout can players get from this game ? it actually is hard even for me
i did have a challenging time playing it , but once you get in the groove it 's not too bad
it is fairly realistic though , and that 's one of the things i really wanted to have in this game
it 's going to be interesting to see how people like it
i 've been getting people sending me messages on @entity52 constantly about it
it is a way to get off the couch and get active instead of sitting there with the controller and just tapping buttons
it 's much more interactive than regular games are
can people learn about swimming from playing the game ? yeah , i 'm sure
the better form you have , the faster you 're going to go
i found a lot of people were afraid to put their face under the water
so if they actually feel comfortable being able to just swim the strokes , maybe they 'll feel comfortable when they get in the water
there are a lot of things that could happen and hopefully we can get more people in the pool and around the pool
what 's your favorite piece of technology that you ca n't live without ? i 'm always on my phone
i 'm always on @entity52
i 'm constantly on my @entity171 and @entity172
i think the apps and everything on iphones are just unbelievable
do you have a favorite app that you play around with ? i have not been able to stop playing " @entity54
" ever since i got it , i 've been playing it constantly
i ca n't even invite any more people to play because i 'm at the max amount of games you can have
i have 30 games going at once
i 'm literally on it non-stop
i took the train up yesterday and that 's all i was doing
i had my headphones on and i was playing " @entity54
" so it kills time
it 's fun , and it 's competitive
what are your thoughts about how far games have come on smartphones ? it 's unbelievable
you can do anything from your phone
i never thought that i would switch from @entity171 to the @entity172 , but gradually i 'm taking myself away from the @entity171 and going to the @entity172 and it really is amazing
you can get anything from directions to restaurants to games
like the commercial says , there 's an app for that
how does technology allow you to connect with your fans , especially during the off @entity4 years ? that 's been one of the cool things
i said i would never get on @entity52
and i stayed away from it until last december and ( since then ) i literally have n't put it down
it 's a cool way to connect with people all over the world
there have been fans from @entity222 and @entity223 and everywhere who are constantly tweeting at me or asking things
people ask me about the video game or about how i 'm training
it 's been fun to keep everybody in the loop of what 's going on
what are you looking forward to with the next @entity4 ? i think the biggest thing is just trying to prepare myself the best way i can
over the years i probably have n't been in the best shape , but i 'm in better shape now than i was in ' 09 or ' 10 and this past summer
hopefully in the next ten months i can get in even better shape and just try and accomplish the goals that i have
i have a lot of goals that i want to accomplish in and out of the water before i retire
if i 'm able to do that , then i can look back on my career and say it 's been a success
can you share any of the goals ? my coach and i are the only two that know
throughout my career i 've always sort of kept them between him and i , and we 're the only two that are really going to be able to help each other get to the goals that we have
we 're more relaxed now than we ever have been and we 're having fun , so who knows what can happen ? the sky is the limit
we have a lot to do and the @entity4 will be here before we know it .
