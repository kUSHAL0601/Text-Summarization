-- army sgt. @entity1 is " just about done " with the final phase of his reintegration , a military source with access to information on @entity1 's care told @entity0
he is expected to be assigned shortly to a new @entity10 unit , the official said
any issue of leave would be up to that unit
@entity1 , the @entity16 soldier held captive for five years by militants before his release in may , has ventured several times off an @entity10 base in @entity21 as part of the effort to get him used to everyday life in @entity16 , a military spokeswoman has said
his release on may 31 in exchange for five @entity28 being held by the @entity16 military has rankled some , including former members of his unit , who said he was a deserter who endangered colleagues searching for him
yet while investigating circumstances surrounding his departure , the military has also said it 's focused on making sure @entity1 gets better mentally and physically , so he can gradually readjust to normal life
since being freed , @entity1 has been carefully monitored at a military hospital in @entity41 , @entity42 , and at his military home since june 13 , @entity45 - @entity44
he recently transitioned from inpatient care at @entity47 in @entity21 to outpatient care , the @entity10 said on june 22
still , @entity1 has hardly left the care of military health professionals
members of his reintegration team escort him whenever he leaves base and interacts with the public , the @entity10 spokeswoman said
his stops have included restaurants , a library , a supermarket and several stores of his choosing
@entity1 went missing on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity64 's @entity63 province , where he was deployed with the @entity65 , @entity66 , 4th @entity67 , @entity68
an @entity10 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official who was briefed on the report
but there was no definitive conclusion @entity1 was a deserter because that would require knowing his intent , something officials could n't learn without talking to him , a @entity16 military official has said
how did six die after @entity1 's disappearance ? who was swapped for @entity1 ? army general to start investigating how , why @entity1 left base
