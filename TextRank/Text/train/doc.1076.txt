@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sisters of a @entity0 woman found dead in @entity5 , @entity6 , in april want the @entity8 government to explain why her husband has not been arrested a month after @entity6 prosecutors requested his extradition
" we are tired of waiting , " @entity12 said thursday
" it 's not fair
" she and her sister @entity15 staged a rally outside the federal courthouse in downtown @entity0 on thursday afternoon to demand an arrest
" we are demanding that the @entity8 authorities just do what they have to do , " @entity12 said
" we are not asking for anything beyond what their duties are
" reality tv producer @entity25 is still living free with his children in @entity0 nearly two months after a @entity6 judge ordered his arrest
@entity6 officials said june 23 that they had sent their extradition petition to the @entity32 in @entity33
neither the @entity34 nor the @entity35 in @entity36 would confirm what has happened with the extradition request
a spokesman for the @entity8 attorney in @entity0 , who would pursue an arrest , said thursday that nothing has been filed in @entity1
" they are not telling us anything , " said @entity43 , the @entity12 family 's lawyer
" we have repeatedly asked
we have made phone calls almost daily , and we have received no information at all
" @entity25 was briefly detained after his wife 's body was found april 8 in a sewer at @entity5 's @entity53
his passport was taken by investigators , and he was told not to leave @entity6 until the inquiry was concluded
@entity58 state attorney general @entity57 said in may that he has a " very concrete " case against the former " @entity61 " producer
@entity64 - @entity63 's lawyer , @entity62 , has said he would fight extradition
@entity25 returned home in may , without the knowledge of investigators , to take care of family business and see his two young children , his lawyer said
his parents have temporary legal custody of the children , ages 3 and 5 , but they are staying with @entity25
the initial investigation suggested that @entity63 " died of strangulation , because of the bruising , " @entity6 regional police spokesman @entity77 said
a source close to the wife has said that she cleaned out the family 's bank account and took her two children to @entity86 because she was upset about her husband 's extramarital affair
the couple later traveled to @entity5 in an effort to repair their marriage , the source said .
