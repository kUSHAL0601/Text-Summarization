-- the dirty and tattered piece of paper , with remnants of thick black industrial - strength tape still stuck to its edges , would not necessarily seem to be a harbinger of summer
but those capitalized words running down the page ... catch
get around ... i pulled the piece of paper from the surface of the stage right after the show had ended
there was a copy of it next to the base of each microphone stand , so the musicians could look down to see what they were supposed to play and sing next
the capitalized words were shorthand for each song : " catch a wave
" " i get around
" @entity32 's coming , all right
i had caught up with the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , on a friday night this spring
they were scheduled to play at the @entity38
it will soon be half a century that they have been singing and touring
fifty years since they really were little more than boys , writing and singing the songs of summer for the first time
too much has happened to them since they first took to the stage wearing those identical striped shirts , nervous young men careful to bow to the audience after each song
@entity53 and @entity54 are dead ; the much - publicized acrimony in the band has meant that @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 almost never share the same stage anymore
not that anyone asked for my opinion , but here it is anyway : we all are given a finite number of heartbeats in this life
if i were those three guys , i 'd find some way to put the old anger aside and play that wonderful music together again
before it 's too late
but this column is n't about the singers
it 's about the songs they gave to the world
the songs have brought so much happiness to so many generations , for all these years
" @entity93 " and " @entity94 " and " @entity95 " and " @entity96 " -- they are @entity99 's enduring soundtrack of summer , they somehow never grow old , and there is a chance that , because of those songs , the @entity34 may one day enter @entity88 territory in the national memory , becoming a sustaining part of @entity92 history
it 's too soon for that , though ; for now , there 's a new summer of one - nighters stretching out ahead
backstage in @entity35 we ate a cafeteria - style dinner ; i sat with @entity109 , a @entity34 guitarist with whom i spent 15 summers on the road while he and i were touring with @entity112
he told me that at a television studio in @entity114 recently he had shared a similar commissary meal with astronaut @entity116
" we talked about the moon , spirituality and surf music , " @entity109 said
that is one of the many unlikely places that singing the songs of summer can take a person : to the side of a man who walked upon the surface of the moon
@entity128 , the actor , has gone on the road to sing with the @entity34 whenever he can for the last 25 years ; he was in @entity35 on this night , and as we talked , @entity58 , the band 's lead singer , came over with his own plate of food
i asked him if he thought there might be a band called the @entity34 on the road even after all the original @entity34 are gone
" i do n't see why not , " he said
" the music 's not going to die , is it ? " that 's the secret
there is something about those songs that transcends nostalgia , that parts the clouds , that brings smiles of contentment year after year , town after town
no matter how cruddy the day may have been , no matter what worries may be gnawing at you
... well , as the song advises : " @entity151
" everything will turn out all right
the show started , the guitars sounded , the audience rose to cheer
the gloriously predictable set -- " @entity157 , " " @entity158 , " " @entity159 , " " @entity160 " -- unfurled
for 105 minutes , the world seemed peaceful
as " @entity162 " was ending , @entity128 looked to where i was standing in the wings and motioned with his head for me to join him
he handed me his candy - apple - red @entity167 , and we shared a microphone on " @entity171 , " and i wish you who are reading these words could look out into a @entity34 audience and see the upturned faces on the cusp of another summer , the people joyfully singing along with songs whose lyrics they know as well as they know the @entity180 or the names of the presidents
unhappiness , it seems , can against all odds be kept at bay
one - hundred - five minutes at a time
it was after the encore , after the audience had filed out , that i returned to the stage and tore that set list from the floor
i glanced at it : catch
... i stuck it into my pocket
a souvenir in advance of warm months that will soon be arriving
however many of those heartbeats we each are given , they seem to swell more gratefully when summer is on its way
catch a wave and you 're @entity205 .
