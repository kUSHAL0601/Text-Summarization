@entity0 is a writer and actor
his partner , @entity2 , is a guesthouse owner
together , they helped make history
after the clock struck midnight on friday , the couple were among the first men marrying men and women marrying women in a range of ceremonies across @entity13 and @entity14 as a historic law legalizing same - sex marriage finally comes into force
@entity0 and @entity2 have long known they wanted to commit officially and have waited five years for gay and lesbian couples to be able exchange vows legally in their home country
that day has finally come
" when we were born , it was illegal to be gay , let alone get married , " @entity0 , 49 , said during last - minute preparations ahead of the wedding
" i did n't think about the possibility for most of my life
it is only really recently that suddenly the option seemed to be on its way
" the marriage law was the final victory in a long battle that has secured the same age of consent as heterosexuals and the right to adopt. @entity13 and @entity14 are among 15 countries as well as parts of the @entity39 and @entity40 that allow same - sex marriage
the @entity42 was the first in 2001 , and last year @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 also joined the list
' they are equal ' going through final details with the wedding 's organizers earlier this week , @entity0 and @entity2 said they were excited beyond measure
the same - sex marriage bill was published by @entity57 's coalition government in january last year
in july , the legislation was approved to allow same - sex couples to officially marry in @entity13 and @entity14
prime minister @entity60 faced vocal opposition from some members of his @entity63
the @entity64 also objected , and was given an exemption from conducting same - sex ceremonies
but in a shift in tone ahead of the weddings , archbishop of canterbury @entity67 , leader of the world 's 80 million @entity69 , signaled the @entity64 would mount no more resistance to gay marriage among churchgoers as @entity77 had spoken
" i think the church has reacted by fully accepting that it 's the law , and should react on saturday by continuing to demonstrate in word and action , the love of @entity85 for every human being , " he told the @entity79 newspaper
in an article on @entity88 , an online magazine that focuses on the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community , @entity60 said this weekend marked " an important moment for our country
" " it says we are a country that will continue to honor its proud traditions of respect , tolerance and equal worth , " he wrote
" it also sends a powerful message to young people growing up who are uncertain about their sexuality
it clearly says ' you are equal ' whether straight or gay
" a rainbow flag flew above government offices in @entity109 in celebration
battles remain @entity112 , which will hold a referendum on independence from @entity57 in september , last month became the latest to give the green light to gay marriage
the fourth @entity57 link , @entity118 , has stated it does not intend to introduce same - sex marriage legislation
gay couples in @entity57 have spent years campaigning for gay rights
civil partnerships were introduced in @entity13 and @entity14 in 2005 , effectively giving gay couples the same legal rights as heterosexuals
but campaigners insisted that only full equality would do
unlike @entity47 , where legalizing same - sex marriage prompted fierce opposition from many social conservatives and the @entity132 , there were no mass protests in @entity57
but for all the joy the weddings will bring , discrimination and bigotry remain issues in @entity57
in january , a local councilor was suspended from the anti-immigration @entity57 @entity140 ( @entity141 ) after blaming devastating floods on the legalization of gay marriage
" we never really hold hands in the street , we 're quite careful about those kind of things -- simply because it was always quite a dangerous thing to do
it 's still not entirely safe
our friends were beaten up six months ago for holding hands in the street , " @entity0 said
" now i am feeling slightly more relaxed about that kind of thing
i feel i have rights to be affectionate with this person that i am going to marry -- otherwise what does it represent ? " a recent @entity162 poll in @entity57 showed that most people support the new change in law allowing same - sex couples to marry , but a third still think gay people are treated worse than straight people
making a statement for @entity0 and @entity2 , the @entity170 is where they met when they first started dating , so it was a fitting venue for the next step in their relationship
they put much thought into personalizing the ceremony , which was attended by friends from as far away as @entity182 , and there was a cellist and songs sung by friends
the media also attended -- as with many of the first other same - sex weddings on saturday
the attention has been so huge that the local council has even received requests from ordinary @entity57 from across the country asking to attend @entity0 's and @entity2 's ceremony
for the couple , exchanging vows is not just about making a statement to each other , but to the world
" i think it 's important to make those kind of statements , be visible , be proud of who you are and what you are in a world which seems to be stepping backwards in lots of different places , " @entity0 said
" there are gay people struggling to be allowed to form relationships
" many couples getting married say they hope to send out messages of support to other gays facing discriminatory laws in their own countries
last month , @entity218 president @entity217 signed into law a bill that toughens penalties against gay people and defines some homosexual acts as crimes punishable by life in prison
in @entity229 , a " propaganda " law bans even discussion of homosexuality anywhere that children might hear it
" there are a lot of countries where it is illegal
we can show other countries that we are stepping forward , " @entity2 , 48 , said , adding he felt lucky and privileged
instead of gifts , the couple asked their guests to make a donation to @entity243 -- a charity that campaigns for equality and justice for lesbians , gay men and bisexuals
" i want the wedding day to be a fully celebratory experience but at the same time , i do n't want to forget that it 's a relative freedom , " @entity0 said
" we have n't reached the end of the line
there is still a long way to go
