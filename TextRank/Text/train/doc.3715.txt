@entity2 was sober but was struggling with depression , anxiety and the early stages of @entity6 when he died , his widow said thursday
the diagnosis of the progressive illness was " an additional fear and burden in his life , " a person familiar with @entity2 ' family told @entity16 on thursday
@entity2 was found dead in his @entity18 home monday from what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging
while fans and friends have looked for answers to why the 63 - year - old comedy icon would take his own life , his wife , @entity22 , issued a written statement about @entity2 ' health that he had kept a secret
" since his passing , all of us who loved @entity2 have found some solace in the tremendous outpouring of affection and admiration for him from the millions of people whose lives he touched , " @entity22 said
" his greatest legacy , besides his three children , is the joy and happiness he offered to others , particularly to those fighting personal battles
" @entity2 's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression , anxiety as well as early stages of @entity6 , which he was not yet ready to share publicly
" it is our hope in the wake of @entity2 's tragic passing , that others will find the strength to seek the care and support they need to treat whatever battles they are facing so they may feel less afraid
" @entity2 had been active as an actor in the last year of his life , performing in a @entity67 sitcom that was canceled this year and acting in four films that have yet to hit theaters
it is not clear whether the early - stage @entity6 affected his ability to work
" friends and family can usually detect changes in the @entity6 's patient including poor posture , loss of balance , and abnormal facial expressions , " according to the @entity80
" during this initial phase of the disease , a patient usually experiences mild symptoms
these symptoms may inconvenience the day - to - day tasks the patient would otherwise complete with ease
typically these symptoms will include the presence of tremors or experiencing shaking in one of the limbs
" parkinson 's disease " causes certain brain cells to die , " according to the website of the @entity94
it is more likely to affect men than women and most often develops after age 50
@entity2 used exercise and cycling to manage his stress and depression , and the prospect that the illness would prevent him from doing that was extremely upsetting , adding to the depression , the person familiar with his family said
what is @entity6 ? fellow actor @entity110 , who has @entity6 's and established the @entity111 , said thursday that he was unaware of his friend 's condition
" stunned to learn @entity2 had @entity6
pretty sure his support for our @entity115 predated his diagnosis
a true friend ; i wish him peace , " @entity110 tweeted
investigators believe @entity2 used a belt to hang himself from a bedroom door sometime between late sunday and when his personal assistant found him just before noon monday , according to @entity125 assistant deputy chief coroner lt. @entity124
@entity124 would not confirm or deny whether @entity2 left behind a letter , saying that investigators would discuss " the note or a note " later
the coroner 's investigation " revealed he had been seeking treatment for depression , " @entity124 said
he spent time in a treatment facility in july , a time when his wife and representative have said he was battling depression
media reports at the time speculated that @entity2 had resumed drinking alcohol , but the statement from his wife appears to dispute those reports
@entity2 entered rehab because of drug and alcohol addiction at least twice previously
" @entity2 spent so much of his life helping others , " his wife said
whether he was entertaining millions on stage , film or television , our troops on the front lines , or comforting a sick child -- @entity2 wanted us to laugh and to feel less afraid
