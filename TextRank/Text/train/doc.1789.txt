-- @entity1 has a toothache
he thinks he needs a root canal , but the full - time student , 22 , is uninsured
he ca n't afford a trip to the dentist
" i 'm only working 30 hours a week
i would n't have enough money to do something like that , " said @entity1 , a film and video student at @entity9 in @entity10
while many young adults are now covered by the @entity17 , able to remain on their parents ' insurance until age 26 , the rules are different for those like @entity1 , who grew up in the foster care system
there are more than 400,000 children in foster care in the @entity27 , the @entity23 said last year
all are provided with health care coverage as long as they are wards of the state
when foster kids turn 18 , they age out of the system and instantly lose their coverage
that 's about to change , when another part of @entity17 takes effect on january 1 , 2014
medicaid coverage will be extended for former foster youth until they reach 26 , as long as the individual was in foster care and enrolled in @entity44 until the age of 18
" i definitely think it would be a big relief , and i would definitely feel more secure as far as my health goes , " @entity1 said
but there 's a catch
@entity1 has dreams of traveling across the nation and becoming a filmmaker
a future relocation could jeopardize his medical coverage
states will only be required to keep former foster children on @entity44 if they continue to reside in the state where they were in foster care originally
@entity60 : most individual health insurance is n't good enough for @entity17 this part of the provision is " an incredibly troubling aspect , " said @entity66 attorney @entity65 , who founded the child and family advocacy group @entity68
young adults can be highly mobile as they move for educational purposes , job opportunities and a host of other reasons , she said
" you ca n't be on a film set if you are uninsured , " @entity1 said
" you could get hurt
i definitely think [ being uninsured ] is limiting and it 's a letdown , because what if i do get a job out of state ? i might not be able to take it
" while " it 's a great provision , " said @entity81 , co-executive director of the @entity82 and a professor at the @entity84 , limiting extended @entity44 enrollment because of relocation could threaten the provision 's effectiveness
she , @entity65 and other child advocates wrote a letter , circulated by the @entity92 , to the @entity93 at the @entity23 , which is working on the revisions before this part of the @entity17 is implemented in 2014 , asking them to reconsider this limitation
even if this part of the @entity17 is reinterpreted , former foster children like @entity1 may face other challenges with the existing system -- namely , not all doctors and dentists accept @entity44
@entity103 , 20 , who grew up in foster care in @entity105 , found that out the hard way
she needs someone to remove her wisdom teeth , but ca n't find a single dentist who will take her @entity44 card and she ca n't afford to pay for it on her own
" my tooth on my left side is coming in sideways , and it 's pushing my other teeth forward , " she said
" i ca n't go anywhere because it could cost about $ 3,000 [ including ] the x-rays and everything else that they have to do before
" @entity103 believes having coverage extended until she reaches 26 would be " really awesome , " but noted that even those with coverage are limited
" people think , ' oh yeah , the foster kids have everything covered for them , they can get everything done with their medical card , ' but it 's not true , " she said
" there 's really a lot that we ca n't do
" former foster youth works on @entity135 to change child welfare system @entity65 recalls one of her past clients , who she said was " actively psychotic and suicidal " : it took two years for her to obtain medication , @entity65 said , because of the difficulty in finding a psychiatrist who would take @entity44
" the reimbursement rates are abysmal " for providers , she said
@entity23 has not responded to the child advocates ' letter and did not respond to repeated requests for comment from @entity0 on the matter
the advocates , including @entity81 and @entity65 , say enrollment in @entity44 should be faster and easier to ensure all eligible young adults are enrolled without obstacles
an outreach campaign could inform eligible individuals so former foster youth are aware of the opportunity , they say
" states are still trying to figure out how these former foster youth can be identified , how they can let young adults know that this benefit is open to them and how they can enroll , " @entity65 said
@entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report .
