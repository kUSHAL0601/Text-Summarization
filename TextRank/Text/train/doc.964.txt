-- marikana lies on @entity3 's platinum belt , where the world 's richest deposits of the metal are located
together with @entity7 , @entity3 produces 90 % of the world 's platinum demand
the people of @entity1 know the land is mineral rich , and last year they demanded a taste of that wealth
in august 2012 thousands of workers at a marikana mine owned by @entity16 , a @entity17 - based firm , went on a wildcat strike , demanding better wages and improved living conditions
34 - year - old @entity21 was among them
" all we want is more money , " he told @entity0 at the time
" as you can see , we are not fighting , we are just sitting here , waiting for the employer to address our demands so we can go back to work
" but @entity21 never made it back to work
he and 33 others were gunned down by police in the bloodiest labor dispute in @entity3 since the end of apartheid
police say they acted in self - defense against a mob of protesting miners armed with clubs and machetes
a commission of inquiry was set up to probe the incident , but a year later the inquiry is incomplete and marred by delays
@entity48 has criticized the @entity3 government for failing to hold those responsible for the massacre responsible
@entity52 , the group 's deputy program director for @entity3 , said : " the long - term consequences for the respect and protection of human rights in @entity3 will be severe should the @entity3 authorities fail in taking all necessary steps to achieve accountability "
@entity0 tracked down @entity21 's family on @entity3 's @entity62 , where most of the dead miners hailed from
the family says they have no choice but to wait and hope that justice will be served -- but in the meantime , they 're preoccupied just trying to survive
@entity21 's sister , @entity70 , said @entity21 's five children , wife , siblings , nephew and niece all depended on his pay
he sent $ 200 home every month to ensure they did n't go to bed hungry
" he was responsible for everything in this household
first our parents died , then our eldest brother , " @entity70 said
" he was our last hope "
now they survive on an $ 80 grant she gets from the government for taking care of her deceased brother 's daughter
labor unions say the average @entity3 mine worker supports at least eight dependents
last year many were given hefty pay hikes after the series of strikes in the platinum belt , but as production costs rose , mass retrenchments have followed and poverty is on the rise
back in @entity1 the community is finding it hard to cope with the loss of jobs and loss of life
" we have seen a series of suicides , " said @entity110 , a field researcher with the @entity111 , a non-profit group that monitors corporate social responsibility in @entity3 's mining sector
at least 10 people who witnessed last year 's massacre have taken their own lives since then , according to the group
two of them were policemen who were on duty that day
@entity110 said the appalling living conditions of mining communities in @entity3 have been a source of despair for years -- and he believes nothing has changed as a result of the tragedy in @entity1
@entity16 has announced several initiatives aimed at improving its relationship not only with workers but with the communities where they mine
new ceo @entity135 said the firm has made land available for housing and will build infrastructure and a recreation center with a library
the people of @entity1 say they have heard promises like these before
but their anger is not just aimed at the mining company ; the resentment of the government is palpable here
million of dollars in royalty fees paid by the industry into a government administered banking account have allegedly vanished , and three independent probes have been launched to trace the cash that was meant to improve the lives of mining communities
meanwhile , violence continues to plague @entity3 's platinum belt
another 20 people were killed following last year 's massacre , according to labor unions , and experts say the conditions that led to the tragedy still have n't been addressed
" @entity3 changed politically in 1994 , but not economically , " @entity164 , an economic analyst , told @entity0
" the relationships of exploitation that are 350 years old have not changed
" " we are more likely to have @entity1 's more often , " he continued
" if you look at the negotiations in the gold mining sector now , they 're demanding 100 % ( pay rises ) and so on
if they do n't get what they want they will go on strike
the state depends on mining revenue , so it will try to force them back to work , and that is where you will see more violence
" this is a sad and disturbing scenario for a country whose economy was built on and still revolves around the mining sector .
