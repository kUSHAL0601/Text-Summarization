-- an alleged terrorist leader suspected of plotting the bombing of a @entity4 superferry more than four years ago , killing at least 116 people , has arrived in @entity6 after his arrest in @entity8 , a @entity4 justice official said saturday
authorities suspect @entity11 was behind the 2004 superferry bombing
authorities in @entity8 arrested @entity11 last month , said @entity14 , undersecretary at the @entity15
@entity11 was deported saturday to @entity6 , where police arrested him and briefly paraded him in front of local media crews before locking him inside police headquarters , @entity14 said
@entity11 is one of the top ideologues in the @entity21 , a group of former @entity22 who converted to @entity24 and claim affiliation with the @entity27 - linked regional terrorist groups @entity28 and @entity29 , @entity14 said
@entity14 said authorities suspect @entity11 helped plot the bombing of a superferry near @entity6 on february 27 , 2004 , in which at least 116 people died
they believe @entity11 also helped plan the bombing of a bus behind the @entity37 in @entity6 on february 14 , 2005 , an attack that killed at least four people and came to be known as the @entity40
the bus bombing was part of a trio of attacks that happened that day
the two other blasts , both fatal , happened in the southern cities of @entity47 and @entity48
@entity14 said he suspects @entity11 was also involved in the planning of several bomb attacks on the @entity51 in @entity6 , all of which were thwarted by @entity4 police
in describing @entity11 's arrest in @entity8 , @entity14 said only that police there arrested him as they were enforcing @entity58 resolution 1276 , which imposed air travel and financial sanctions on the @entity61
@entity28 aims to create a @entity63 " superstate " across much of @entity64
authorities blame the group for the @entity66 , @entity68 nightclub bombings of 2002 , which killed more than 200 mostly @entity70 tourists
the group is also suspected of subsequent attacks on the @entity75 embassy and @entity74 hotel , both in the @entity68 capital , @entity77
the @entity29 is one of several @entity24 militant groups fighting the government in and around the southern @entity4 island of @entity82
