a counselor in @entity2 's orthodox jewish community was found guilty monday of sexually abusing a girl over a period of three years in a case that one victim 's advocate described as marking " a new era
" @entity9 , 54 , was found guilty on all 59 counts he was facing , including sexual conduct against a child
he faces a possible sentence of 117 years in prison , the @entity14 's office said
the abuse began in 2007 , when the girl 's parents hired the unlicensed counselor to help their then - 12 - year - old daughter ; it continued -- mostly in his office -- until 2010 , the district attorney 's office said in a news release
the victim , who testified at trial , is now 17 , it said
@entity29 , a former @entity30 who identifies herself as a victim 's advocate , said the verdict ushers in " a new era for the @entity37 religious community
" @entity38 told @entity40 affiliate @entity39 that the victim will need a lot of help , but that @entity9 's conviction is part of the healing process
" we 're very hopeful that this will lead to other young women in this community and other communities understanding that they can come forward , " district attorney @entity46 told reporters
" they will be protected
" the case highlighted practices of the conservative @entity57 @entity56 community , many of whom live in the insular @entity61 neighborhood of @entity62 , @entity2
@entity63 , an advocate against sexual abuse among @entity61 who described himself as a survivor of such abuse , said it is rare for respected members of the community to face such allegations in court
in the past , members of the community have intimidated and pressured those who have accused their leaders of sexual abuse , he said
the case came to light last year , when four men were arrested and accused of trying to bribe @entity9 's victim and her boyfriend to get them to drop the case against @entity9 , a spokesman for the district attorney said
" there was a huge fundraiser for the accused @entity9 , and the entire community structure was filled with propaganda and hate against the victim in an effort to shut ( her and her family ) up , " @entity63 said
" thankfully , the courage of the young survivor has been tremendous , and she was able to withstand and go through with the process
" @entity95 , @entity9 's attorney , was not available for comment
sentencing is set for january 9 .
