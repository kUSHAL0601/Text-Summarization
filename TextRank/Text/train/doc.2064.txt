-- when a @entity2 elementary school invited rock star @entity3 to a tribute concert of his greatest hits , the last thing they expected was for him to actually show up
but that 's exactly what the " @entity10 " singer did
vocalists in grades kindergarten through second performed " @entity14 : a @entity15 " on wednesday in front of an audience consisting of their peers , teachers , families -- and @entity3 himself
" we really did n't expect him to come , " @entity22 , principal of @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , told @entity0 thursday
@entity3 , who is a @entity25 local , found out about the concert after word of mouth spread through the area , @entity22 said
@entity3 arrived just five minutes before the concert began and took a seat in the back
" i ran up to him to see if he wanted to go up to the front , and he said ' no , no , i do n't want the kids to be nervous , ' " @entity22 recounted
with his permission , @entity22 announced on stage that the " @entity38 " singer was present " and that 's when the roars started
" @entity3 hits that were featured were " @entity42 , " " @entity43 , " and " @entity38
" the tribute closed out the festivities with " @entity46 " and " @entity10 , " according to a statement on the school district 's website
every spring at @entity23 , the music teacher prepares a tribute to a different artist
last year , it was the @entity54 , although this is the first time the artist being honored actually showed up , @entity22 said
according to @entity22 , the parents and the older students were in awe at the singer 's presence , but not everyone was as impressed
" the younger kids were like , ' of course he is coming
we 're singing his songs he wants to hear us sing ! ' " @entity3 is on tour and not available for comment , according to representatives for the singer
