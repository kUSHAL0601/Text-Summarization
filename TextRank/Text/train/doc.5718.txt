-- at least nine miners remain trapped in a @entity5 gold mine after an underground fire , the @entity2 company said wednesday
@entity5 emergency workers rescued eight other miners and brought them to the surface at the @entity11 mine , west of @entity12
" rescue teams continue the search for the remaining nine miners who are still unaccounted for , " the company said in a prepared statement
" the underground fire has been subdued , although conditions underground remain challenging
" it said the eight miners who were rescued were unharmed but would be kept under medical observation during the night as a precaution
the fire is reported to have broken out about 1,733 meters ( 5,700 feet ) underground around 6 p.m. local time tuesday
@entity2 spokesman @entity25 said seismic activity -- a magnitude - 2.4 tremor that caused rock to fall -- may have caused the fire
" the rock fell , damaged a cable , which we think caused a spark which then ignited something and caused the fire , " he said
" obviously , this is all subject to inquiry
our priority is finding the missing men
" all operations other than essential services at the mine have been suspended
