-- the patent war between @entity2 and @entity3 may be only just starting
a new report says @entity2 has acquired 750 patents from computer - systems giant @entity6
the news comes shortly after @entity3 sued @entity2 for patent infringement over 10 of its software patents
a " person with knowledge of the transaction " tipped the news to @entity12 , though the deal has n't been made public yet
compared to other tech companies , @entity2 's arsenal of patents is rather meager : the company has just 56 patents compared with the thousands stockpiled by the likes of @entity24 and @entity25
however , the report says , @entity2 has applied to the @entity27 for at least 500 more
apparently it did n't want to wait for those to be approved and chose to take a shortcut in stocking up its patent portfolio
the lawsuit from @entity3 , which has recently had a wholesale change in management and is expected to announce layoffs , likely provided the motivation
see also : tech industry scorns @entity3 over @entity2 patent suit many tech companies are now using patents strategically to both generate revenue and discourage competition
for example , @entity43 licenses many patents from @entity24 in the making of the @entity48 platform , which provides a steady cash flow for @entity24
in other cases , such as the many patent lawsuits between @entity25 and @entity53 , patents are used to shut competitors out of entire regions ( though that 's rarely the outcome )
@entity6 has been friendly in selling patents to younger tech companies in the past
in january , @entity43 bought 217 patents from the @entity6 , including one for a " semantic social network
" reps from @entity2 did n't immediately respond to a request for comment
an @entity6 rep declined comment
