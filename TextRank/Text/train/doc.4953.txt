@entity0 -- a year and a half after deploying @entity5 troops to counter illegal immigration on the @entity8 border , the @entity2 and @entity3 told @entity10 tuesday they are cutting the number of troops and changing their mission
the drawdown , which the department characterized as a " transition , " will begin in january and should be completed by march
several lawmakers told @entity1 the number of @entity5 troops on the border will be cut from 1,200 with responsibilities mainly on the ground to 300 who will support the border mission in the air
the @entity2 said the change is possible because of a jump in the number of @entity29 officers in the region , an increase in technology and a drop in apprehensions at the border
but several lawmakers criticized the move , saying conditions on the @entity8 border merit more troops , not fewer
a deployment of 1,200 troops was " not enough to begin with , although they are doing as good a job as they can , " rep. @entity40 , @entity41 , told @entity1
@entity40 said the @entity47 has " operational control " of only 44 percent of the @entity50 border
" that 's not success , " @entity40 said
rep. @entity52 , @entity41 , agreed
" if the @entity58 administration 's goal is border security , their actions undermine their objective , " he said in a written statement
" we should keep guardsmen on the ground until the @entity29 can gain operational control of the majority of the @entity47 - @entity67 border
" but rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , supported the drawdown
" while i appreciate the service of our @entity5 forces , requiring them to engage in border law enforcement activity is not cost effective , " he said in a statement
the @entity2 said that in the fiscal year ending october 1 , @entity29 apprehensions of illegal immigrants -- a key indicator of the amount of illegal immigration -- decreased to 340,252 , down 53 percent since fiscal year 2008
since 2004 , the size of the @entity29 has doubled to 21,444
in a news release announcing the change , the @entity2 and the @entity3 did not cite exactly how many troops would be pulled from the border , but said the " new strategic approach " will increase border security
that approach includes " adding a number of new multi-purpose aerial assets " equipped with the " latest surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities
" in addition , the @entity5 will provide helicopters and planes to the @entity29 , " allowing for faster response capabilities , " the news release said
" i did not understand or get the impression they are going to add any equipment ; they 're going to use what they have , " said @entity40 , who was briefed on the changes
the @entity3 budget for the border would drop by half , from $ 120 million to $ 60 million , congressional staffers said they were told
specifics about the ramped - up aerial surveillance are still being worked out , the staffers said
@entity40 said he plans to fight the change
" i 'll ask the president to reconsider and then try to figure a way , bipartisan , to show that this is not a wise move , " he said .
