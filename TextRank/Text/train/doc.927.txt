the new @entity3 government has plenty of challenges ahead of it : a towering debt , chronic unemployment and relations with the rest of @entity9
but it also has an urgent security problem
@entity3 has become an unwitting crossroads -- both for jihadists trying to reach @entity14 and @entity15 from @entity9 , and for fighters returning home from the @entity18
@entity3 's long land and maritime boundaries , its proximity to @entity22 , the explosion of illegal migration from @entity15 and the country 's dire financial situation make it an inviting hub for jihadist groups , according to multiple counterterrorism sources
one source close to the @entity3 intelligence services told @entity0 there may be some 200 people in the country with links to jihadist groups such as the @entity37 in @entity14 and @entity15 ( @entity38 ) or the @entity39 -- the two groups that most @entity9 join
@entity42 leader plans his next move after elections in @entity3 among recent cases with a @entity3 connection : -- @entity48 officials believe that @entity49 , a prominent @entity48 jihadist within @entity38 , may have traveled from @entity15 to @entity3 and then communicated by phone with the terrorist cell recently broken up by @entity48 police
-- earlier this month , three young @entity48 were arrested at @entity53 as they prepared to fly to @entity3
the @entity48 @entity54 says they have been charged with participation in a terror group
-- on january 17 , @entity3 police arrested a 33 - year old @entity59 man whose extradition was sought by @entity48 in connection with last week 's raids
the man , who has not been named , has protested his innocence
-- last year , two @entity65 jihadists were arrested after using @entity3 soil to return home
one was arrested after passing through @entity69
one was @entity70 , a 23 - year - old @entity65 national born in @entity71
@entity3 border guards had found in his possession a usb stick with instructions for how to make homemade bombs
@entity9 faces ' greatest terror threat ever ' they did not detain him , but tipped off @entity65 investigators , who later found bomb - making equipment and devices in his apartment near @entity86
@entity70 has denied terror charges and awaits trial
what 's unknown is how many jihadists are traveling individually -- in either direction -- and how many are using support networks
" @entity3 is not a target , just a gateway into @entity9 and a stop on the fighters ' return home , " said the source close to @entity3 intelligence
" the large immigrant communities is @entity3 , and particularly in @entity102 , are in a position to provide jihadists and others associated with such groups with housing and generally help them remain anonymous , " the source said
in 2011 , @entity3 authorities detained nearly 50,000 illegal migrants from @entity110 and @entity111 , according to police figures
one analyst who has studied jihadist travel patterns says there are indications that militants are setting up logistical , recruitment and financial cells in @entity3 , in part to facilitate the travel of a growing number of would - be fighters traveling from @entity124 and @entity125
@entity38 has produced several propaganda videos featuring @entity124 appealing to their countrymen to join them , and the @entity124 authorities believe some 200 individuals have left to wage jihad in @entity14 and @entity15
but it 's not just the @entity132 that 's providing the travelers
" we estimate that about 2,000 people have used @entity3 in the last two years or so , mainly arriving by boat from @entity69 , as a stop to an onward journey , " the source close to the intelligence services told @entity0
" given the number of people who have left @entity9 for @entity15 and the @entity18 we do n't regard this number as very high
but there is a good chance that it is much greater than we know at this point , " he added
coming in the other direction , the number of migrants trying to reach @entity9 illegally has soared since @entity15 's implosion , especially by sea
many head to @entity3 and @entity69 on rust - buckets that trawl the @entity22 coast seeking out the desperate
@entity155 , director of the @entity156 for @entity9 and @entity158 studies in @entity102 , says many migrants have their documents taken by human traffickers and then seek political asylum when they get to @entity3
@entity155 says a few of those who arrive in @entity3 subsequently marry @entity3 women and receive @entity3 id cards or passports , allowing them to travel through much of the @entity168
figures from the @entity168 's border agency , @entity170 , show that 270,000 people tried to enter @entity9 illegally in 2014 -- with huge increases in the numbers setting off across the central and eastern @entity174
whether @entity38 or other groups are already exploiting this influx to infiltrate members into @entity9 is one of the worrying unknowns to @entity9 officials
the @entity3 @entity182 acknowledges it has little idea of the number of people living illegally in @entity3
nomikos and others say the @entity3 authorities ' ability to track asylum - seekers and would - be jihadists has been hard hit by six years of recession -- a time in which budgets have been cut and senior members of the intelligence communities have lost their jobs or retired early
combined with political appointments in the security services , and a lack of terrorism specialists , @entity155 says this has led to a damaging " expertise deficit " at a time when threats are multiplying
it does n't help that @entity3 police are preoccupied with the remnants of the far - left november 17 group that occasionally launches sabotage attacks and carries out assassinations
@entity155 also says there is inadequate coordination between the @entity214 , the police and other agencies -- and that @entity3 badly needs help from the @entity158 or @entity9 government to reform its security services
" the country urgently needs a @entity221 in order to coordinate the intelligence - sharing among the @entity3 intelligence service ( @entity224 ) , anti-terrorism squad intelligence unit " as well as police , coastguard and military intelligence , @entity155 says
the @entity132 states to the north of @entity3 have become a major source of weapons to jihadist cells elsewhere in @entity9 , and some analysts believe that militant groups in the @entity18 may also be tapping into this illicit arms bazaar
in november , @entity125 police arrested eight people in the town of @entity240 and seized guns and ammunition
prosecutors were quoted in @entity125 media as saying the weapons were destined for @entity15 or @entity14
in the wake of the @entity249 attacks this month , @entity246 , the @entity168 's foreign policy chief , promised better intelligence sharing across the @entity168 and with affected @entity252 states to tackle terrorism
an @entity168 summit on february 12 will address the issue , to be followed by a similar gathering in @entity257 the following week
whatever the @entity261 government 's disagreements with its partners on economic policy , it will likely welcome a more coordinated approach on a danger it is unable to confront alone
@entity267 is a researcher and consultant on @entity269 in @entity270 and terrorism issues based in @entity102
