hundreds of thousands of @entity0 gathered in @entity1 in a show of support for @entity6 president @entity5 ' @entity4 on friday , the 48th anniversary of the party 's founding
@entity11 leaders say @entity4 was officially founded in 1965 which coincided with its first major attack against @entity14
it was an unusual scene in @entity1 because it was the first mass rally showing open support for @entity4 since 2007
that is the year @entity18 seized control of @entity1 from @entity4 , which now controls only the @entity20
the number of people who showed up surprised many
some participants slept in the @entity25 square after gathering there overnight and the crowds eventually grew so large by daytime that at least seven of the major streets around the rally were filled with people
what is @entity18 ? high - level @entity4 officials also showed up for the event after entering @entity1 for the first time since being ousted by @entity18
leaders of both parties described it as another step toward unity
@entity5 sent a message via video from his headquarters in the @entity20 town of @entity44 that was played on huge screens set up in @entity1
" @entity1 was the first @entity6 territory to get rid of the occupation and settlement , and we want the blockage to be lifted so that it can be free and be linked to the rest of the nation , " @entity5 said
an sms sent out from a @entity18 representative referred to the rally as a " celebration of national unity and a success for both @entity18 and @entity4
" according to the @entity1 ambulance service , at least 30 people were injured after fighting broke out due to overcrowding as well as political rivalry among supporters of different political leaders
in advance of the rally there also was bickering between @entity4 and @entity18 over whether @entity18 would allow @entity4 supporters to gather in a large space that was highly visible
in the end an agreement was worked out and the festivities progressed with some people holding @entity4 flags and others waving pictures of @entity5 and late @entity6 leader @entity78
the two parties have been bitter rivals for years , but the relationship between the two parties thawed after the recent fighting between @entity14 and @entity1 that lasted eight days and left dozens dead
after the conflict , @entity18 was given approval to hold its first rally in the @entity20 , and a few weeks later @entity18 allowed @entity4 to hold a rally in @entity1
@entity18 considered it a victory when @entity14 decided not to send in ground troops
days later , @entity5 ' ability to get non-member - state status for the @entity6 territories at the @entity92 was also considered a victory
since then there has been talk of reconciliation from leaders of both parties , but no concrete steps have surfaced yet
@entity4 leadership has had a great deal of support from the @entity20 and has been warned over the years not to join hands with militant @entity18 , which several countries have deemed a terrorist organization .
