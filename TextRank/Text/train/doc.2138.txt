@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 protesters are vowing to continue their anti-government demonstrations into wednesday night , despite violent crackdowns and arrests
witnesses in @entity0 tell @entity2 the demonstrators number in the tens of thousands
the protests are timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the hostage crisis at the @entity14 embassy
@entity1 celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday , and tens of thousands showed up to hear anti-american speeches in front of the building that once housed the @entity14 diplomatic corps
" the anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in june , following a disputed presidential election
thousands of protesters ignored warnings from @entity1 authorities to stay home , many chanting " @entity36 " and others saying , " @entity33 you 're with us or with them , " referring to the @entity14 president
riot police and pro-government @entity41 militia turned out in force to quash anti-government protests
" we were running from the police in the alleys off of the main streets , " said @entity44 , an opposition protester , who gave only one name for security reasons
" strangers were opening up their garages so we could hide until the police went away
i ran into a garage for about 15 minutes
when i went back into the main street , i saw riot police arresting a group of young men , then putting them inside a bank and locking the door
" only @entity61 knows what will happen to them after that
" @entity65 : @entity1 take to the streets @entity44 , like many other of the demonstrators , took part in the protests this summer

there was strong police presence on the streets , and the police force seemed much more organized than past occasions , she said
earlier in the day , opposition supporters marched defiantly in @entity0 's @entity133 , witnesses said

" they were brought in by the busloads
as soon as crowds gathered somewhere , riot police were there within minutes
" the opposition showed wednesday that even after five months of government crackdown , people were still willing to take risks
the disputed june 12 presidential election triggered @entity1 's most serious political crisis since the @entity107 revolution toppled the shah
led by opposition candidate @entity168 , thousands of @entity1 protested what they believed was a rigged vote that returned hardline president @entity171 to office for a second term
in the election aftermath , the @entity1 government arrested more than 1,000 people and accused reformists @entity168 and @entity178 of spreading anti-government propaganda and fueling anger among the public
but despite warnings from the government , @entity1 's reformists have largely refused to back down
they released the names of 72 protesters they say were killed in the unrest that followed the election -- more than double the government 's official number
both @entity168 and @entity178 were prevented from attending wednesday 's rallies , according to a reformist web site , @entity194
@entity178 's son told the web site that his father tried to reach the @entity199 - e - @entity133 rally on foot , but he was blocked by anti-riot police , sparking clashes with his followers
police fired tear gas toward @entity206 , hitting one of his guards on the head , and causing @entity178 and some of his supporters to fall to the ground , according to @entity194
@entity178 and his followers returned to their vehicles and drove away when , at one point , security forces attacked and damaged @entity178 's vehicle , the web site said
@entity93 posted on @entity76 showed @entity178 briefly opening his car door to a crowd of cheering supporters , who chanted , " @entity220 , help the people of @entity1
" @entity1 authorities had warned @entity178 to not participate in the marches , saying he might be the victim of a suicide attack , according to @entity194
@entity168 was unable to join the demonstration after his car was prevented from leaving his office , according to his @entity229 page and a report on a reformist web site
cell phone and @entity235 connections were cut in the area where his office is located , and dozens of plainclothes motorcycle riders blocked the entrance and chanted slogans against @entity168 , the web sites said

@entity33 noted how the embassy takeover reshaped @entity14 - @entity1 relations
" this event helped set the @entity14 and @entity1 on a path of sustained suspicion , mistrust , and confrontation , " he said
" i have made it clear that the @entity14 wants to move beyond this past , and seeks a relationship with the @entity1 based upon mutual interests and mutual respect
