-- protesters shut down a @entity3 subway station monday , angry about a transit police officer shooting a drunk man at a station earlier this month
a group called " no justice , @entity7 " -- which formed after the 2009 shooting of an unarmed passenger by a @entity13 police officer -- organized the spirited , albeit largely peaceful rally centered at the city 's @entity16 stop
that officer was eventually found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in @entity21 's death
the transit system , known in @entity3 as @entity7 , said on its website that the more recent shooting occurred july 3 , after police dispatchers got a call about " a drunk who was unsteady on his feet and in danger of falling off the platform
" two @entity7 officers arrived on the scene at 9:45 p.m. and a minute later , the man -- later identified as 45 - year - old @entity35 -- was shot after a confrontation with police
the shooting victim was taken by paramedics to a local hospital , and pronounced dead later that night
in a subsequent statement , @entity7 identified @entity35 as a " suspect " who is " said to have had no known address
" but the scores who attended monday 's " civil disturbance " loudly voiced their view that @entity49 was a victim , who died without just cause at the hands of a transit police officer
with a slew of reporters , photographers and cameramen in sight , the demonstrators packed a @entity7 train
they reeled off a number of chants including " no justice , no peace " and " murderers , justice
" the protest prompted the @entity7 system to halt service in and out of its @entity16 stop , the agency announced in an alert
the 16th street mission station also closed down , while major delays were reported all around the city
no one has been charged in the shooting , which is the sixth in the system 's 40 - year history , according to @entity7
yet while there has been no admission of police wrongdoing , the @entity3 transit system has charged its " first - ever @entity85 , " according to a statement posted monday on its website
@entity86 -- who was hired in part to promote public confidence in @entity7 in the wake of the 2009 shooting -- had been on the job for all of one week when @entity35 's shooting occurred
" it is a great relief that the independent auditor is in place to reassure the public that the investigation into the officer - involved shooting is conducted with the highest integrity and greatest level of transparency , " @entity7 board president @entity93 said .
