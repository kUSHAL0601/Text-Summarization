@entity0 has called on tennis to redouble its efforts in the fight against doping , saying it would be " naive " to think the sport is clear of drugs cheats
" @entity10 says that tennis is clean , the way it 's been all the way through , " the 17 - time grand slam champion 31 - year - old told @entity9
" it 's pretty good , of course every sport always has some cases
but i think our sport needs to do the upmost to try to make sure the integrity stays and that the fans do n't tune into different sports just because they do n't trust the players anymore
" i 've always been fighting to make sure we have enough testing
" several high - profile doping scandals have rocked sport in recent months
@entity30 was stripped of his seven @entity32 titles before @entity34 sport was rocked by a government report which alleged many athletes were using illegal substances supplied by organized criminal groups
football 's global governing body @entity39 intends to introduce biological passports to detect drugs cheat , while in @entity43 the @entity45 trial into the doping network of dr. @entity47 continues
@entity0 suggested introducing a system similar to the one used in cycling , where an athletes drug test results are kept over a period of time so that the use of a banned substance is more easily detected
@entity56 , currently the world 's top - ranked male tennis player , told reporters at january 's @entity60 that he had not been tested in the previous six months
@entity0 called for increased funding and testing to ensure transparency
" more funding , more blood , more urine , you name it -- more funding all across the board , " the world @entity64 said
" maybe keep samples as well for a long period of time so you can go back and punish those players
the people , or the players , need to be scared if they cheat
" of course some players do it by mistake , but unfortunately it falls into the same situation and you have to pay the price for it
" the 31 - year - old now finds himself as the elder statesman of the men 's game , with his two nearest rivals -- djokovic and world no. 3 @entity91 -- both six years his junior
despite a legion of younger stars launching an assault on the top of the sport , including the returning @entity100 , @entity0 is comforted to see his fellow 30 - something @entity102 alongside him in the top five
" it 's nice to see that even though the game has become so physical that the older guys are hanging in there , " @entity0 said
" i do n't know why that is , but i guess my generation of players is really strong
i think at one point at the @entity113 we had 30 - plus players over 30 years in the main draw , which is pretty incredible
" and it 's nice to see that players are n't being pushed out at 27 or 29 because of the physicality in tennis right now
" @entity0 has also adapted to life as a father , after his wife @entity122 gave birth to twin girls in 2009 , although his daughters are still too young to fully appreciate who their father is
" they actually now know winning and losing a little bit , " said @entity0
" they also understand the practice and the matches now
" i 'm happy i 've been able to stay successful ever since i 've had the kids , because a lot of the press felt that things were n't going to happen for me after that
" despite them being just three years old , @entity0 admitted he has already tried to get his children playing tennis
" we 've tried to put them into lessons , just for their hand - eye coordination and all of that
i think it 's important for kids to do all sports if they have an opportunity. , " he said
" i 'm a big believer that it 's a great lesson in life , so we try to give them opportunities because we can and i think tennis is a great thing , so we 'll see if they pick it up
" meanwhile , @entity0 's defense of the @entity161 title ended in semifinal defeat friday to @entity164 @entity163 , the man who also upset him at last year 's @entity165
@entity0 held two match points in the second set tiebreak but they both went begging as @entity163 won a thrilling match 3 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 4 against the five - time champion
it set up a final with @entity173 @entity172 , who beat @entity174 of @entity175 , 6 - 3 7 - 6 in the earlier last four clash
it stretched @entity60 champion @entity56 's unbeaten run to 17 games and he will start warm favorite for saturday 's final , particularly after the exit of @entity182
" pity to lose that one , but @entity163 did well to hang in there , " said the @entity185 maestro .
