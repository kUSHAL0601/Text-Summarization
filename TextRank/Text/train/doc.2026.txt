-- @entity2 president @entity1 is one of the leading leftist figures in @entity4 and one of the @entity7 ' most vocal critics , aligning himself with former @entity9 president @entity8 and @entity11 president @entity10
with a win in sunday 's elections , the 58 - year - old @entity1 , who has been in power since 1999 , will enter a fourth term in office and extend his presidency into 2019 , or two full decades in power
@entity1 wins re-election when first elected on december 6 , 1998 , in a landslide , @entity1 was at age 44 the youngest person in the nation 's history to become president
between june 2011 and may 2012 , he underwent cancer treatment in @entity9 , raising speculation about his political future and a possible successor when he named 10 people to his inner circle of advisers , known as the @entity32
but the following month he announced his re-election bid , and in july this year he declared himself cancer - free
in a country where more than a quarter live in poverty , the charismatic @entity1 has inspired " fierce loyalty " among the poor thanks largely to his social programs , according to the @entity36
his socialist agenda has also overseen the nationalization of property and firms in numerous industries , such as finance , agribusiness , construction , oil , steel and gold
@entity1 himself came from a modest background -- born the son of schoolteachers on july 28 , 1954 in @entity55 , a city in @entity2 's @entity56
from a young age he was influenced by @entity58 , the @entity2 soldier and politician who led the @entity4 independence movement against @entity61 during the early 19th century
@entity1 would style himself in the @entity58 mold , dubbing his own revolution " @entity64
" his legacy will be one of both " self - styled @entity4 @entity68 " and " shrewd autocrat using and abusing his country 's oil riches to stay in power , " @entity0 's @entity65 wrote
according to the @entity74 , oil accounts for more than 30 % of @entity2 's gross domestic product , 90 % of its exports and 50 % of fiscal income
@entity1 's political and professional ascent was a colorful one
an avid baseball player , he had once dreamed of a baseball career but joined the army after graduating from the @entity84 in @entity85 in 1975
five colorful quotes from @entity1 amid festering social tensions in 1992 , @entity1 , by then a lieutenant colonel , led an unsuccessful coup against president @entity90 for which he was imprisoned for two years
upon his release by the new president @entity92 , @entity1 formed the opposition @entity93 , a vehicle for him to criticize government corruption and the two - party system
he cast himself as the anti-establishment figure , vowing to dissolve @entity98 and redistribute the nation 's oil wealth
voters responded , catapulting him to the presidency
after being sworn into office in february 1999 , his government created a new constitution that required a " mega-election " in 2000 for every elected official
it was under this new constitution that @entity1 was reelected to a six - year presidency in 2000
but within two years , he faced major setbacks as opposition to his social agenda grew , culminating in massive protests and a coup in 2002
although the military had been behind @entity1 's removal , his replacement , @entity118 , would dissolve the @entity119 and suspend the constitution , leading the military to force @entity118 himself to resign
in a series of musical chairs , @entity1 's vice president , @entity121 , was sworn in as president , after which he immediately restored @entity1 to power
these events took place over four days
another showdown came in the form of a presidential recall referendum in 2004
@entity1 survived that one too
@entity1 , known for marathon speeches , has long been a critic of the @entity7
he was a particularly vocal opponent of the @entity7 invasion of @entity134 in the wake of the 2001 terror attacks and of the @entity138 war
in 2006 , he rebuked then - president @entity139 in a speech at the @entity141 , stating , " the devil came here yesterday , and it smells of sulfur still today
" he has also speculated that @entity144 was behind the cancer that afflicted five @entity4 presidents , including himself , in recent years
by the end of 2006 , @entity1 would be re-elected to his third term , with a little less than two - thirds of the vote
his term would see the passage of more constitutional changes , including indefinite re-election , as well as the stifling of political dissent , such as the closure of opposition radio stations and moves against private broadcaster @entity160
he would also strengthen relations with @entity11 -- a country he has visited nine times and with which @entity2 has signed more than 270 accords
of the four nations on @entity10 's @entity4 tour earlier this year , @entity2 was the first
@entity1 has been married twice and has five children .
