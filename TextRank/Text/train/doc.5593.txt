@entity0 -- an organ played " @entity16 " as pallbearers -- from the @entity4 -- carried the simple wooden casket with a @entity6 through hundreds of admirers , friends , family members and dignitaries , and out of the @entity11 in @entity12 on monday to lay to rest the city 's brash and outspoken three - term former mayor , @entity13 , who died of congestive heart failure on friday
" i come today with the love and condolences of 8.4 million @entity0 who really are grieving with you at this moment , " said current @entity0 mayor @entity18 as he delivered one of several eulogies for @entity13 beginning around 11 a.m. " although @entity13 -- on the other hand -- has got to be loving all this attention , " @entity18 joked
" no mayor , i think , has ever embodied the spirit of @entity0 like he did
and i do n't think anyone ever will
tough and loud , brash and irreverent , full of humor and chutzpah -- he was our city 's quintessential mayor , " @entity18 said
" he knew from the beginning that the key to success lay in throwing political caution to the wind
" and it 's easy to forget just how badly our city needed that kind of leadership -- because the @entity0 that @entity13 inherited is almost unimaginable today : graffiti - filled subways , miles of abandoned buildings , filthy streets that were unsafe to walk in daylight , much less at night , a municipal government that was broke and had stopped functioning
... then came @entity13 , " @entity18 said
" it is fair to say that the city we know today would not exist without him
everything that @entity54 and @entity55 and i accomplished has been built on the foundation that @entity13 laid
" noting that @entity13 was to be buried at @entity58 in @entity12 , @entity18 added , " just think about it : a @entity61 jew in an @entity63 graveyard in a largely @entity65 neighborhood
what could be more @entity0 -- or even more @entity13 ? " former president @entity67 , who cut short a trip to @entity69 to attend , addressed the mourning crowd next
holding a handful of letters of advice and opinion @entity13 had sent him when he was president , @entity67 said no one had a better feel for " the impact of what government did on the real lives of people " than @entity13
the former president described how @entity13 advocated for tougher gun laws and said he would be proud of gov. @entity82 for his recent effort to toughen @entity85 gun laws
in his lifetime , @entity13 was known to look to his constituency and ask " how am i doing ? " on monday , @entity67 seemed to turn the question back on him , " @entity13 , we are all doing fine but we miss you and we miss you so much because we all know we are doing a lot better because you lived and served
" @entity13 's relatives spoke of him as a family man who always wanted to know what was going on in their lives
a grandnephew , @entity96 , recounted a time @entity13 bragged to @entity67 about the young man 's accomplishments
@entity99 , @entity13 's longtime chief of staff , said the key to @entity13 's gift for leadership was " an ability to meet people on their own terms without ever diluting his own distinctive personality
" also at the services monday were @entity0 's @entity110 senators , @entity111 and @entity112 ; former mayors @entity54 and @entity55 ; gov. @entity82 ; former governor @entity115 ; and other current and former city , state , federal and international government officials , including the @entity120 consul general , @entity119
" by the force of his own personality he led @entity0 to believe that our best days were n't behind us , and he succeeded , " @entity111 told @entity1
@entity112 described @entity13 as a great reformer and a friend from whom she 'd ask advice on everything from @entity129 policy to where to get the best @entity132 food
" he was mayor of this city during a time of crisis and he really brought the city together , " she said
" i think @entity13 was himself
and too often nowadays people worry about how they look or what their image is or are they doing it right , " said @entity138 , speaker of the @entity139 and rumored potential @entity141 candidate for mayor in the city 's 2013 election
" every time i asked him for advice , " she said , he told her " to do what i thought was right , to have fun and if people did n't like it just ' bleep ' ' em. and not a lot of elected officials live by those codes today
and if you do the right thing and you have some fun , you 're doing the best you could possibly do
and that 's a good thing
" an honor guard representing the city 's police , fire , parks , sanitation and correction departments and the sheriff 's office stood by the casket for the ceremony
the service was officiated by @entity175 , the synagogue 's senior rabbi
a private shiva will be held tuesday at @entity178 , the official residence of the city 's mayor , on tuesday , according to the ceremony program , and the family is requesting that contributions be made to the @entity183
@entity13 was a @entity110 congressman from 1968 until he ran for @entity0 mayor in 1977
he served three terms as the city 's 105th mayor , from january 1 , 1978 , to december 31 , 1989
