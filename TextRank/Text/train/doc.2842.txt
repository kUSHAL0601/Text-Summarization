-- the grizzly bear that attacked and killed a man in @entity4 acted in defense , park officials said on thursday , adding that they have no plans to kill the bear
the female grizzly attacked a hiker and his wife around 11 a.m. wednesday after the couple surprised the mother with her cubs , they said
the victim , @entity14 , 57 , died at the scene
his wife , @entity16 , escaped the attack without injuries
park officials were adamant that the bear 's reaction was defensive and that the park does not have plans to track down and kill the bear
" this bear is not marked in any way and has never been involved in another conflict in the area , " said wildlife biologist @entity25
" we average only one injury per year and they are usually not repeat occurrences by the same bear
... it was not predatory and we see no reason to take action against the bear
" park superintendent @entity37 said all signs indicated the @entity39 did everything right
" upon seeing the bear , they began to back down the trail and when they turned to check , the bear was in full charge towards them , " @entity37 said
@entity37 said the bear " impacted " @entity14 while his wife took cover behind a fallen tree
the bear approached @entity14 's wife , lifted her off the ground , and then dropped her
she played dead and the bear left , @entity37 said
@entity52 's cries for help alerted other hikers in the area , who called 911
park rangers arrived at the scene about 15 minutes later
@entity14 had claw and bite marks from the attack
@entity60 confirmed that he was dead when they arrived on the scene , @entity37 said
wednesday 's attack occurred along the @entity63 in the back country of the park , in northwestern @entity66
all trails that feed into @entity68 , where the incident occurred , will remain closed until park officials determine it is safe to reopen them
@entity25 said hair and dna samples were collected from the scene so that if another incident occurs they will know if the same bear was involved
there are more than 600 bears in @entity4 ecosystem , according to park officials
@entity37 said bears have been very visible to park visitors this year but that park officials rely on reports from hikers to determine how many bears are in the back country of the park
bear attacks are extremely rare -- wednesday 's attack is the first time a human has been killed by a bear in the park since 1986 , according to a park press release
this was the @entity39 ' fourth visit to @entity4 , @entity37 said
they had previously hiked the trails and never encountered a bear
a warning sign was posted at the head of the trail because of known bear activity along access points
@entity37 advised visitors to familiarize themselves with bear safety and protocol before they begin hiking
" i advise visitors to make themselves aware of the inherent danger if they go into the back country of @entity4 and to avail themselves of the safety information available to them , " he said .
