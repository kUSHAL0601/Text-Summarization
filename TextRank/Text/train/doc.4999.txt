-- was this the real @entity2 or an imposter ? given it 's @entity5 , it 's a fair question
the former world no. 1 has n't won a title all year but led @entity9 's @entity8 -- the fourth and final @entity11 event of 2013 -- after the first round and then proclaimed it was his finest 18 holes this season
it bodes well for the @entity16 , who is chasing a spot at the season - ending event on the @entity20 , the @entity21 in @entity22
perhaps beating @entity23 in an exhibition this week in @entity25 gave sixth - ranked @entity2 an added boost after a difficult year in which he failed to qualify for the @entity29 's 30 - man finale
@entity2 said thursday 's seven - under - par 65 bettered his 64 at the @entity30 in @entity31 at the end of august
" that was a good round of golf , " the 24 - year - old told reporters
" but this is probably better just because it was a little trickier conditions
there was a bit of breeze and you 've got to play good golf to shoot seven under around this place
" it 's only one round of golf , but it 's definitely the way i wanted , and needed , to start this week , keeping in mind that i obviously want to play myself into @entity22 and try to pick up my first win of the season , as well
" it 's one of the best rounds i 've played this season
" @entity2 struck eight birdies and only one bogey , on the 11th hole
" it felt good to be out there and be in control of my golf ball , " he said
" it 's a great start , but it 's only 18 holes
" i 've tried to stay patient the entire season , and i know that if i believe that i 'm working on the right things -- and i am working on the right things -- then things will start to fall into place sooner or later
" @entity2 was two shots clear of @entity72 's @entity71 and @entity74 ' @entity73
@entity76 champion @entity75 and former masters winner @entity77 were another shot back
@entity80 @entity76 champion @entity79 was tied for 28th , six shots behind @entity2
although he finished at one - under - par 71 , his round was undone by a quadruple bogey on the eighth when he twice found the water , and he dropped another shot at the following hole -- his last , having started on the back nine
recently crowned @entity89 champion @entity88 struggled , with the @entity90 finishing at two - over - par 74 to be tied for 57th in the 78 - man field at @entity92 .
