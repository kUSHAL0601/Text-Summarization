-- the @entity2 foreign minister on thursday shot down assertions that @entity4 is in his country , saying that was never an option
" of course not , " @entity8 told @entity10 radio network @entity11 1 when asked whether @entity4 was in @entity2
" the hypothesis that mr. @entity4 could come knocking on our door was never considered
" @entity8 also offered more insight on @entity4 's family fleeing to @entity2
" i think the information that was disclosed which concerns some of his family members who had to be received in @entity2 because of extreme circumstances , mainly humanitarian reasons , created a wave of panic , " @entity8 said
@entity4 's wife , two sons and other relatives fled to @entity2 , deepening the mistrust between the rebel government and @entity31 's powerful neighbor
@entity2 described the move as a humanitarian gesture , but it angered the @entity34 , with one official calling it " an aggressive act
" the transitional council has accused @entity2 of supporting the @entity4 regime
@entity2 also complained to the @entity40 about damage done to their embassy soon after the rebels entered @entity44
@entity2 will in the future recognize the @entity34 as the government in @entity31 , he said during the radio interview
" the @entity34 has said it is going to set up a government representative of all regions , and when it has done that , we 'll recognize it , " @entity8 said
