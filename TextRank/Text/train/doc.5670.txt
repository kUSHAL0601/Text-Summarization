@entity0 and @entity1 are accusing a @entity3 co-founder of illegally publishing video of their engagement party to boost his new " foundering " website
a lawsuit filed thursday by the celebrity couple blasts @entity11 , accusing him of secretly recording @entity0 's surprise proposal to @entity1 in the middle of @entity15 's @entity14 on october 21
the video shows @entity0 kneeling near second base to ask @entity1 to marry him while a large orchestra plays in center field
the leak diminishes the value of the video of the event that @entity1 and @entity25 own , the suit said
@entity11 " finagled entry " into the birthday party that @entity0 threw for his girlfriend , although only " several dozen people " were invited , the lawsuit said
although he tagged along with someone who was invited , he was permitted to stay " only after giving his word -- including in writing -- that he would not publish any aspect of the event
" the court filing includes a photo of @entity11 purportedly holding the signed confidentiality agreement in his hand
" immediately after giving his word to honor the condition required for his attendance at the event , " @entity11 posted the shaky video on @entity42 , a video sharing website owned by his @entity45 , @entity46 , company , it said
the lawsuit slammed @entity11 , 36 , as a failed entrepreneur who leaked the video " out of desperation
" " despite his extraordinary financial success in creating @entity3 , which was sold in 2006 , @entity11 has ever since sought his ' second act , ' " the lawsuit said
" this has become exceedingly elusive to @entity11
" it cites his failed @entity59 racing team and his " web service named @entity61 , which also failed and has been slated for closure in 2013
" his newest venture -- @entity42 -- " also quickly ran into trouble " after launching in august , the lawsuit contends
" following a lackluster launch and unsuccessful ensuing debut , @entity11 sought to salvage @entity42 from its dour beginning , " the suit said
" an opportunity to do so appeared to @entity11 when he learned of the october 21 , 2013 , event featuring @entity0 and @entity1 , " it said
the video is titled " @entity74 ! ! ! congrats @entity1 and @entity0 ! " it is still posted on the website , and the counter indicates it has been viewed 1.6 million times
@entity11 knows better , the lawsuit said
the terms of service on his own website warn users against posting any video that would violate copyrights , it said
" undeterred by the contractual restrictions to which he had just agreed , @entity11 opted to exploit and capitalize upon the extreme public interest he knew would attach to the event , in order to boost the fortunes or his underperforming business venture , " the suit said
@entity11 and his company did not immediately respond to @entity96 requests for comment on the lawsuit .
