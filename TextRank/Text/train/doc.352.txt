-- this week , @entity1 , 34 , reached a personal milestone : she has lost 10 pounds since the beginning of the year
@entity1 , 34 , has lost 10 pounds since january 1
she said she feels like it will be easier to lose more weight
this progress feels slow , she said , in comparison with her previous weight loss attempts , which consisted of crash dieting
but she found that those diets were n't sustainable
this time , she 's looking to find a lifestyle she can keep
@entity0 asked viewers to talk about their @entity14 's resolutions on @entity15 and upload photos and videos during their journeys of change
@entity1 , who lives in @entity20 , @entity21 , is one participant who frequently updates the @entity15 community with video updates on her progress
ireport.com : watch @entity1 talk about losing weight reaching this 10 - pound milestone , from 190 to 180 pounds , makes her feel as if it will be easier to lose more weight , she said
" you feel definitely more motivated when you actually quantify it in a number that feels good , " she said
@entity35 , your connection for better living she does n't feel physically different , but she does notice a change from previous pictures of herself , she said
her original goal for the year was to get closer to her pre-pregnancy weight of 120 pounds
@entity1 has had a hard time exercising recently because her uncle , 90 , passed away , and the grieving process has been difficult
but she plans to resume working out soon and wants to take classes at her gym
she also eats one vegan meal every day
@entity1 felt frustrated earlier this month because her progress felt slow , losing a pound a week
read about her weight loss journey often , the initial weight loss will seem the easiest , and then the loss slows somewhat over time , said @entity53 , dietician for the @entity56 @entity55 team and owner of @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60
exercise is key in speeding things up when you 've reached a plateau , she said
it 's important to find a physical activity that you enjoy doing and to vary the exercise routine -- for example , raising the incline on a treadmill to step up the intensity , she said
@entity53 usually recommends losing about 2 pounds a week , or about 5 to 8 pounds a month
at that rate , someone like @entity1 could lose 50 pounds in six months , she said
a pace faster than that -- such as 10 pounds per month -- would be hard to keep up , @entity53 said
people with on weight - loss journeys should have encouragement from friends , family or people in support groups or online communities , she said
@entity1 certainly has people supporting her in the virtual world : a video she posted a few weeks ago after she 'd lost 4 pounds had more than a dozen motivational comments from others on @entity15
watch her video her next goal is to lose 15 more pounds -- for a total of 25 -- by her birthday , march 24 , and reward herself with a digital single - lens reflex camera , which professional photographers use
" that 's basically 2 pounds a week , plus 3 more , " she said
" it 's ambitious , but i really want that camera
