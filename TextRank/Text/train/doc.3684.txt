the @entity39 said the crew aboard the train did not apply the emergency brakes just before the accident
instead , the air brakes were automatically triggered , agency spokesman @entity44 said wednesday , noting that a possible rupture in an air line may have caused the emergency braking

he added the train , with two locomotives and 80 cars , had been traveling about 25 mph when it jumped the tracks
the first 21 cars behind the locomotives derailed

the service was restored withing 24 hours , a spokesman for @entity78 , which maintains the line , said
@entity82 executive @entity81 said that once the initial investigation has been completed , authorities will assess how @entity22 and @entity9 got access to the bridge
they were apparently sitting on the bridge ledge just after midnight with their backs to the train when it derailed , according to a written statement from @entity82 police
the two posted photos to @entity97 shortly before the crash
one showed feet dangling over a road , with the caption " levitating
" another appeared to look down @entity31
@entity9 tweeted , " drinking on top of the @entity19 sign with @ r0se_petals
" the name @entity19 is painted on the railroad bridge
@entity108 , who went to school with @entity22 in the nursing program at the @entity111 , said , despite the @entity97 posts , her friend was not irresponsible
" they were just living life a little bit on the edge , and some people can do that five billion times and they live to be 80 and they live to tell all the times they lived on the edge , " @entity114 told affiliate @entity115
" some people do it once in their life , and they ca n't live to tell their tale

they were pleasant ; they always said hi in the hallway
" @entity137 , a spokeswoman for @entity138 , a nonprofit organization that promotes railroad safety , said the number of fatalities in 2012 involving people on tracks was up significantly
" it 's probably just as well to stay away , not just to be off the tracks , but stay away from the train so you know you 're going to be safe , " she said
" because it 's hard to say , ' ok , here it 's safe ; there it 's not
' so just stay away
" according to the @entity154 , in the first five months of the year , 178 people were killed in accidents on or near tracks , not including at railroad crossings
