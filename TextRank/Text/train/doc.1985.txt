-- whenever i visit @entity2 , i ca n't help but think this is the town that elected a crackhead as its mayor
i know , i know it 's not pc to say , but just because it 's insensitive does n't mean it is n't true
but think about this : there is footage of @entity14 in a room of crack smoke saying , " bitch set me up
" and yet that image , that video did not disqualify him from being seen as a viable political option in the mind of voters
in fact , not only was he re-elected mayor after serving time in a federal prison , today he sits on the @entity27 , all because he managed to convince enough black people that the video of him with the crack pipe in his mouth was white people 's fault
when analyzing what is wrong with our government , allow me to present this example as @entity40 exhibit b would be @entity42 , who cheated on two wives and is the only speaker of the @entity45 to have been disciplined for ethics violations
and yet somehow he is running for president of the @entity48 as a religious conservative and managed to get 8 % of the votes during last week 's straw poll in @entity52
are you freaking kidding me ? the fact that he is even on camera discussing the country 's sense of morality during the @entity61 debates should be offensive to any thinking person regardless of party affiliation
and yet someone , right now , is thinking about sending his campaign a check
and who can forget @entity69 gov. @entity68 , who last year , in trying to push a controversial immigration law , said law enforcement officials found headless bodies in the desert , the work of a @entity77 cartel
but she was forced to admit that was n't true , that she had " misspoke
" what she did n't speak about was her close ties to the private prisons that were set to profit because of the new law
ties like her campaign manager and her spokesman being former lobbyists for private prison companies
and despite the obvious conflict of interest , she won easily , saying on election tuesday , " tonight , the people have redeemed and renewed @entity92
" nice work , people
i could go on but i think you see what i 'm getting at : the biggest reason government is broken is because of voters
a lot of us are just plain stupid
or at the very least lazy
we want our candidates to use easy - to - digest buzz words such as " family values " or " clean energy " so we do n't have to actually invest too much time thinking
we can just slip our brains into auto - pilot and cruise on into november
do i believe our politicians need to be perfect ? no. but damn , you would think people would draw the line at crack
or just making stuff up as a candidate goes along
each time rep. @entity122 insinuates falsehoods into her arguments , as she did earlier this month on the " @entity125 " by suggesting hpv vaccinations cause mental retardation , i think : a group of people on auto - pilot in @entity131 did this to us
when you know important debates are influenced by people who do n't like being bothered with facts , you question just how many of the country 's problems over the years have been caused by people who should not have been involved in the process in the first place
but they are because of us
so can we genuinely complain about government without accepting a lot of the blame ? i do n't think so
after all , they did n't elect themselves
so if we want government to work , we have to be smarter about our choices
it 's one thing to have a population with a variety of political sensibilities ; it 's another to be a country full of idiots
too many times we vote and consequently govern like the latter
we have to move away from easy - to - repeat campaign slogans and promises of easy solutions , because we 're a country with more than 300 million people , a complicated racial and religious history and the world 's largest gdp
there are no easy solutions
so if you 're the kind of person who likes to say " i do n't follow politics , " let me remind you that no one lives in a vacuum and that sentiment epitomizes what is wrong with our government
i do n't blame @entity179 for thinking she can still toss her hat in the ring
i blame us voters for creating an environment in which a @entity179 or a @entity184 or even a reality tv star like @entity186 can feel as if they can run and even be taken seriously
last week i was bombarded with e-mails from readers who said @entity190 should be protected because they paid into it , but they did n't care about @entity191 or @entity192 because the government pays for those
and in 13 months some of these people will be voting for president
you want to know what 's wrong with government ? i just presented you with @entity200 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .
