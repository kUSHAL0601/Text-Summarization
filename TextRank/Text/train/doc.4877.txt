@entity0 -- @entity2 approved a $ 9.7 billion @entity4 aid package on friday following delays over fiscal cliff bickering , warnings of dwindling federal funds and swirling controversy over millions of dollars for unrelated projects
the measure passed the @entity12 , 354 - 67
the @entity13 did so unanimously and without debate
it was the first legislative action of the new @entity2 , which picked up the @entity4 package after the previous session on tuesday shelved a vote on a much larger assistance plan for storm victims , infuriating @entity22 and @entity23 politicians
lawmakers from both houses will weigh in on $ 51 billion in additional @entity4 aid on january 15
but that larger portion will likely face much closer scrutiny in a @entity2 anticipating more acrimony over spending and debt in coming months
@entity12 leaders initially balked at immediate consideration of a big spending bill just after concluding the excruciating negotiations around the fiscal cliff
house speaker @entity37 preferred to wait a few days at least before holding a vote on a @entity4 bill
the original storm legislation also included what some @entity41 saw as congressional " pork , " or money for unrelated pet projects
budget hawks viewed the extra funding as wasteful in an era of record deficits
some lawmakers and taxpayer interest groups teased out $ 8 million for cars for the @entity54 and justice departments , $ 2 million for the @entity55 to repair roofs , $ 150 million for fisheries , and $ 100 million for repair of @entity60 facilities
" it 's perceived to be free money
it goes around the budget caps that are ever tightening
traditionally we have n't offset disaster funding , but that does n't mean that some of these things should be in there , " said @entity65 , vice president for @entity66 , a nonpartisan budget watchdog
" it 's honey for the flies
" but @entity22 @entity77 rep. @entity77 rejected criticisms of pet projects , or earmarks
" those reports were totally false , " @entity77 said on @entity1
the @entity82 said the broader aid package was designed to provide funding for any federally declared disaster last year , not just @entity4
conservative groups , such as the @entity87 , urged @entity12 members to oppose friday 's scaled - back bill that included more than $ 9 billion to help the government pay flood insurance claims
@entity2 faced strong pressure to boost the debt - ridden flood insurance program , which is the primary option for that type of coverage for @entity97 homeowners and businesses
it has been under severe financial pressure for years from payouts related to big storms like @entity102 in 2005
the @entity103 told @entity2 on tuesday the flood insurance program was nearly out of money to compensate storm victims and required new authority to borrow more money to meet its obligations
" @entity2 should not allow the federal government to be involved in the flood insurance industry in the first place , let alone expand the national flood insurance program 's authority , " the @entity87 wrote on its website
@entity116 @entity115 rep. @entity115 said flood insurance claims needed to be met for victims who paid their premiums
" but madam speaker , here is the tragic reality -- the national flood insurance program is broke
it is now taxpayer bailout broke , " he said on the @entity12 floor
rep. @entity77 blasts his own party @entity132 and @entity41 lawmakers in the storm - struck region , including @entity23 gov. @entity135 , unleashed a firestorm of criticism at @entity138 for not addressing the measure as originally planned on tuesday
" @entity23 deserves better than the duplicity we saw on display , " @entity135 said , adding , that this is " why the @entity97 people hate @entity2
" @entity41 civil war over @entity4 relief later , closed - door meetings between @entity12 @entity41 from the @entity148 and @entity37 and majority leader @entity149 got the aid package back on track with friday 's vote on flood insurance and a promise to address the rest in coming weeks
but @entity65 said that tempers may flare anew when @entity2 debates the next portion , including the question of unrelated storm expenses
" we have to do the scrutiny
it wo n't be pretty
there 'll be some hurt feelings , " he said
opinion : @entity41 's obstructionism is suicide strategy @entity1 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .
