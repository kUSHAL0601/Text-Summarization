-- want to highlight your wedding pictures or the first snapshots of your newborn on @entity5 to make sure friends do n't miss the big news ? the social network announced on wednesday that users in the @entity10 will be able to promote their personal posts to friends for a fee , starting today
although testing first started in @entity15 in may and has since rolled out to more than 20 countries , the feature is now available in the @entity10 for the first time
the price to promote your news and updates ? about $ 7 , according to @entity21
businesses are already able to promote their posts and get updates in front of more eyes for a fee , but personal updates still reach only a limited amount of friends on the site
investing in a promoted post will increase the chance of someone seeing your post at the top of their news feed , the company said

" when you promote a post -- whether it 's wedding photos , a garage sale , or big news -- you bump it higher in news feed so your friends and subscribers are more likely to notice it
" the option may also be of use to people looking to promote bands , parties and other events
what is your impression of personal promoted posts ? let us know your thoughts in the comments
