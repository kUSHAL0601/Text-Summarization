-- a leading opposition figure in @entity2 has been jailed after being charged with " inciting and advocating terrorism , " @entity2 's @entity1 said
activists in the tiny @entity7 kingdom , however , insist the charges against @entity9 are politically motivated and accuse the country 's leadership of attempting to stifle dissent
@entity9 , secretary general of @entity13 , the main @entity14 opposition party , was arrested tuesday after being interrogated about a speech he delivered last week
according to @entity16 , @entity2 's official news agency , he was summoned to a police station , questioned and then referred to the @entity1
in a statement , the office accused @entity9 of being " affiliated with the terrorist organization " and added that he had been " speaking at many forums , inciting and promoting terrorist acts , advocating principles which incite such acts , supporting violence committed by the terrorist coalition , and legally justifying criminal activities
" @entity28 , the head of @entity13 's media center , says that @entity9 did not incite violence and that @entity2 opposition parties are suspending participation in national dialogue
@entity13 called the government 's actions in regard to @entity9 " reckless " and " a clear targeting of political action in @entity2
" the party added in a statement that it believes his detention is , in part , a reaction to a @entity45 resolution passed last week regarding the human rights situation in @entity2
on a mission : oppression in @entity2 that resolution called for " the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in @entity2 " and urged @entity2 authorities " to immediately end all acts of repression , release all prisoners of conscience , and respect the rights of juveniles
" @entity45 member @entity60 told @entity0 that " the lack of progress in terms of dialogue and reforms towards the rule of law and respect for human rights in @entity2 continue to be of great concern to the @entity45
" @entity60 spearheaded the effort to get the resolution passed
" for the sake of the well - being of all people in @entity2 , " she said , " and for the future of the country , the crackdown on peaceful demonstrations must end
the blanket ban on assembly in @entity79 is not helping reconciliation , either
" @entity2 opposition activists say that @entity9 's arrest is just the latest in a country where many prominent dissidents have been jailed in the past two years and that it only underscores how tense the situation remains in @entity2
@entity2 's government responds to activist 's claims in february 2011 , at the height of the @entity94 , @entity2 citizens , spurred by successful uprisings in @entity91 and @entity92 , demanded democratic reforms and other changes in the way the country was run
anger from the majority @entity14 population was directed at the ruling @entity103 minority
but @entity2 's uprising failed to gain the traction of other regional revolutions after a crackdown by authorities in the tiny island state , backed by troops from nearby @entity111 and the @entity112
demonstrators say authorities killed dozens of people and arrested , tortured and imprisoned hundreds of others
opposition leaders have tried to keep the protest movement alive .
