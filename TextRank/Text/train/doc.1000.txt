the deal reached with the @entity1 late saturday in @entity2 represents a risk well worth taking by the @entity5 administration and the five other powers that negotiated it with the @entity1
if the @entity5 administration briefly got some first - term international diplomatic credit for the suggestion it would hit the " reset " button on relations with @entity15 , for this , its most important second - term initiative to date , it has opted for the " hold " button
the deal is an interim agreement by which @entity20 has consented to freeze efforts that could lead to the development of nuclear weapons in exchange for modest relief from international economic sanctions
now that an interim deal has been reached , the @entity1 can not move closer to a bomb as talks proceed
even skeptics who do n't trust @entity1 and fear it has been moving ever closer to gaining nuclear weapons capability must acknowledge that if this deal slows @entity1 down at all , it serves a useful purpose
if it does not , but intensive negotiations continue as a result of it , then we are at least no worse off than we were in the first place
@entity5 : @entity1 deal limits ability to create nuclear weapons further , if at the end of the ensuing negotiating phase no deal is reached , taking military action would be seen as more justified given that diplomatic options were exhausted
that said , this deal has other little - noted or discussed implications and dimensions at many levels beyond the letter of its terms
for example , despite @entity60 prime minister @entity59 's advance denunciations of the deal -- struck between @entity1 and a group of international powers led by the @entity65 -- he deserves as much credit for the deal as anyone else
his incessant banging on the drums of war led the world to believe that absent some diplomatic agreement soon , military action by the @entity60 or the @entity65 would be inevitable
the deal struck saturday in @entity2 was as much to freeze @entity60 's edging toward war as it was to freeze @entity1 's nuclear program
for @entity60 , despite its apprehensiveness about the arrangement , to strike @entity1 now would make it an international pariah
for the @entity5 administration , the deal offers multiple advantages
for the near term , at least , it is a rare diplomatic triumph
it arguably validates its program of sanctions by suggesting that the economic measures drove the @entity1 to the negotiating table
but in addition , it not only forces @entity59 to at least sit on his hands for awhile ; it avoids the awkward situation of having to choose between supporting @entity60 ( and inviting a major conflict in the region into which it would like be drawn ) and appearing weak on @entity1
for the @entity1 , the deal provides some relief from the hardships associated with the sanctions -- estimates run in excess of $ 10 billion and some suggest the impact might be multiples of that
( @entity110 , @entity15 and the @entity111 all also have been hoping for anything that might promise a restoration of economic ties with the oil - rich nation
) but the deal also gives @entity1 useful negotiating leverage as it seeks to influence the outcome in neighboring @entity120 , where the embattled @entity122 administration is an important ally
not only has it produced a more robust diplomatic dialogue with the @entity1 , but now that the six nations that are engaged in this deal have a stake in it producing a positive outcome , they are less likely to inflame the @entity1 or put them on the defensive with a @entity120 deal that is seen by them as a defeat
of course , the critical question will be whether the next phase of negotiations for which this deal clears the way will produce a real breakthrough , a verifiable program for dismantling those elements of @entity1 's nuclear program that might allow it to develop nuclear weapons
if it did , it would be a rarity , one of the few recent instances where diplomacy succeeded in stopping a nation that wanted nukes from getting or keeping them
but it would not address the myriad other areas in which @entity1 has been helped inglame the problems of the @entity153 during the past several decades
it would not impact its state sponsorship of terror
it would not impact its efforts to extend its influence via support for regimes and political actors -- from @entity120 to @entity161 to @entity162 to @entity163 ; indeed , as noted earlier , it might help them in this respect
and what 's more , if it gave the @entity65 a greater stake in a better relationship with @entity1 , it might also complicate relations with the @entity169 and the @entity60 who see @entity1 as a threat
what 's more , if the interim deal does not result in a longer term deal , what would happen next ? would war then be the only option ? more sanctions ? would the absence of military action in that case suggest it would never come ? the @entity2 deal is a genuine diplomatic step forward
if it delays or reduces the risk of @entity1 gaining nuclear weapons and triggering an arms race in the region , it will be even more than that
but it needs to be viewed with open eyes , with sensitivity to the risks it creates , those it does not address and to its many resonances and potential consequences .
