it may be a foregone conclusion in the minds of many that accused @entity5 bomber @entity4 is guilty of murder
a horrific crime : multiple killings , including that of a child , and more than 200 maimed or wounded
what may be less clear is @entity4 's role in the attack , and whether , if convicted , he will be sentenced to death
as both sides prepare for his november trial , court filings and arguments by prosecutors and the defense provide a glimpse into their opposing strategy for the penalty phase of the case
the government says it has video showing @entity4 placing a backpack near the finish line , then using his cell phone , moments before the first bomb went off
he walked away and the second bomb went off in front of the camera , officials say
there is also the note @entity4 scribbled on the boat he was hiding in , claiming the @entity41 victims were payback for @entity44 wars in @entity46 lands
excerpts of the note open the grand jury indictment
" i ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished ; " @entity4 wrote
" we @entity46 are one body , you hurt one , you hurt us all ; " " now i do n't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in @entity57 but due to said ( unintelligible ) it is allowed ; " and " stop killing our innocent people and we will stop
" in seeking the death penalty , prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor @entity4 's " betrayal of the @entity44
" they claim that after @entity4 received asylum from the @entity44 , the defendant " enjoyed the freedoms of a @entity44 citizen ; and then betrayed his allegiance to the @entity44 " by killing and maiming its people
leading the defense team is @entity71 , a longtime public defender who has represented some of the nation 's most notorious criminals , including " @entity75 " @entity75 , who killed three ; @entity77 , who shot and killed six people and critically wounded rep. @entity79 ; and @entity80 , the emotionally disturbed mother who drowned her two children
@entity75 and @entity77 pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life imprisonment
in the @entity80 case , @entity83 argued that her client 's abusive childhood and depression tormented her , causing her to " snap
" although it convicted @entity80 of murdering her sons , the jury spared her life
" she enjoys a wonderful reputation , she fights very hard for all her clients , " said former @entity44 attorney @entity93 , who prosecuted terrorism cases in @entity96 's @entity95
" she 's the model for all defense lawyers
" humanizing @entity4 is a priority for his defense team , said @entity102 , a criminal defense lawyer who represented @entity103 , a former @entity104 nurse convicted of killing four patients
the jury in that case did not vote unanimously to impose the death sentence
@entity109 was thus sentenced to life in prison
" there 's always a story to be told , " @entity102 said
" it 's not a story that excuses or justifies what was done
but it explains and allows us to understand as human being to human being what led someone to the point in their life where they could undertake such an act that virtually everyone else finds incomprehensibly horrible
" the defense has great leeway in presenting its case for the penalty phase
" the @entity134 has held that pretty much anything related to the defense background , or character , or to the circumstances surrounding the crime " is admissible , @entity102 said
@entity102 said he believes @entity4 , who was 19 when the crime happened , has a good chance of avoiding the death penalty
" this is a young kid , still impressionable , only a year and a half over the minimum that he would have to be even to be eligible for the death penalty , who is clearly under the influence of an older brother who has been radicalized and who has become extremely violent
what do you do as a younger sibling when that kind of thing is going on in your family ? " in a recent court filing , the defense lawyers sought information prosecutors obtained from the federal government 's surveillance of @entity160
" any evidence tending to show that @entity160 supplied the motivation , planning and ideology behind the @entity41 attack , and that his younger brother acted under his domination and control , is material , " the defense argued
@entity4 's defense team declined to comment to @entity172 , but in a status hearing this week , they called the @entity4 family dynamic key to their case
" if the government indictment is true , this is about a family , " defense attorney @entity178 said
the defense objects to having an @entity184 agent monitor conversations between @entity4 and his siblings during prison visits
judge @entity188 has indicated he agrees with the defense , but deferred ruling to give prosecutors time to respond
since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 , three people have been executed : @entity193 , for the @entity195 bombing that killed 168 people ; @entity197 , for three murders connected to drug trafficking ; and @entity200 , for the kidnapping and murder of a female soldier
according to the @entity205 , juries have handed down 74 death sentence verdicts since the death penalty was reinstated
however , a judge has formally applied the sentence only 71 times
the disparity comes from defendants ' convictions that were overturned or death verdicts that were vacated before formal sentencing by the judge
the liberal - leaning nature of @entity5 - area juries also will bear watching in @entity4 's case
@entity219 banned the death penalty in 1984
@entity102 said in an area that is heavily catholic , many are inclined to follow the lead of @entity224 , who opposes capital punishment
in a @entity228 poll taken in september , 57 % of @entity5 respondents supported a life sentence for @entity4
thirty - three percent favored the death penalty
@entity231 , whose granddaughter , @entity232 , was killed in the marathon bombings , told @entity172 's @entity234 , " when they came out with this part about the death sentence ... i said , well , i do n't really care what they do with them
because whatever they do , it 's not going to bring her back , " she said
" i 'll never forget her , ever , no matter how much they say
or what they do with the guy who did it
so i would n't wish anyone dead
" " even after what he did ? " asked @entity234
" even after what he did , " @entity232 replied
prosecutors in the case declined to speak with @entity172
former federal prosecutor @entity257 said , given the nature of the crime , it 's not surprising the government is seeking the death penalty
" if not in this case , then when ? " @entity257 said
however , she said winning a death penalty verdict in @entity219 is so unlikely it may not be worth the time and resources involved
others say the government made the right decision
" the death penalty attaching to a case of terrorism where people are maimed and killed is certainly a reasonable option , " said @entity270 , the former @entity271 district attorney who prosecuted " shoe - bomber " @entity273 in 2002
@entity273 pleaded guilty before going to trial
although @entity270 said he thinks the defense has a chance of beating the death penalty , the prosecution strategy should be clear
" the prosecution keeps harping on and keeps drilling home the facts
and the facts are horrible here
two - hundred - sixty plus people who were hurt and maimed
a police officer in the aftermath of those actions executed , " @entity270 said
" the government will keep pounding home the facts in this case , which are just horrible from a human perspective
" @entity296 , who represented @entity193 , knows what it is like to lose a capital case
@entity193 was executed in 2001
" in any case where there is huge public injury , there 's pressure on political leaders to seek the death penalty
there may be pressure on jurors to return a death penalty , even against their better wisdom
" the key , @entity296 said , is to present the jurors with a detailed narrative of the defendant 's life that can evoke some mercy
" @entity83 and her team are masters at getting at a defendant 's life story , " @entity296 said
yet " she is also attuned to the critical need for the capital defense team not to ignore the victims
" " the death penalty deprives people of their humanity , " @entity296 added
" we have to try to help remind everybody that we 're all in this together
