-- players and ball boys fainting and accusations of " inhumane " treatment
if it 's hot on court -- temperatures of 42.2 @entity9 ) were recorded tuesday -- at the @entity10 , the mercury is also rising for tournament officials at @entity12
@entity14 @entity13 fainted during his match with @entity17 @entity16 , before he got really hot under the collar over the conditions players had to contend with at the first tennis grand slam of 2014
" i think it 's inhumane , i do n't think it 's fair to anybody , to the players , to the fans , to the sport , when you see players pulling out of matches , passing out , " the world no. 122 told reporters
" i 've played five set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat - stroke , it 's not normal
" having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it 's too hot to play , until somebody dies , they 're just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat
" i personally do n't think it 's fair and i know a lot of players do n't think it 's fair
" it was n't just players who succumbed to the elements
one of the ball boys fainted during 11th seed @entity54 's four - set defeat of @entity57 's @entity56
" of course there were a few players who experienced heat - related illness or discomfort , but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match , " chief medical officer @entity65 told reporters , as organizers defended the decision to play in the heat
caution urged but with temperatures above @entity72 expected for most of the week , briton @entity70 urged caution
" whether it 's safe or not , i do n't know
you 've just got to be very careful these days , " he said
" there 's been some issues in other sports with , you know , players having heart attacks
" in the women 's draw , @entity83 's @entity82 claimed the weather caused her drinks bottle to melt on court while second seed @entity89 described playing at the @entity90 as like " dancing in a frying pan
" the tournament 's " extreme heat " contingency was introduced for matches in the women 's draw , allowing for an extended break between the second and third sets
rather than solely using a temperature reading , organizers use a measurement which also considers humidity and wind to decide whether or not conditions have become unplayable
" we have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time , " tournament referee @entity105 said in a statement
" that did n't happen
while conditions were hot and uncomfortable , the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue
" while some players wilted , @entity115 was typically unflappable in the stifling heat
" just deal with it , because it 's the same for both ( players ) , " said the 17 - time grand slam winner , seeded sixth , after defeating spirited @entity120 @entity119 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 2
when asked if he thought organizers should close the retractable roof over the @entity90 to help lower the temperature on court , the 32 - year - old @entity115 , who last won one of tennis ' four majors at @entity126 in 2012 , replied : " no. i think it should always stay open , honestly
" world no. 1 @entity132 played in the last match to get under way in the @entity90 against @entity120 @entity136
thirteen - time grand slam winner @entity132 took the first set 6 - 4 before the 57th - ranked @entity136 retired with a leg injury
@entity132 will play @entity136 's compatriot @entity140 in the second round
@entity70 made a strong start in his bid to finally capture @entity12 glory , beating @entity146 's @entity145 6 - 1 6 - 1 6 - 3
the world no. 4 has been runner - up at the season 's first grand slam in three of the last four years , but enters this tournament short of match practice after undergoing back surgery
however the @entity154 looked sharp , taking just 87 minutes to dispatch his 112th - ranked opponent in punishing heat and set up a second round meeting with @entity17 @entity158
@entity161 no. 1 @entity160 's tournament is over after he was forced to withdraw from his match with @entity164 's @entity163 due to a foot injury
@entity160 , the only @entity161 male seeded in the draw , has been battling ankle and shin problems during the offseason
the 28 - year - old missed last year 's tournament with a knee injury
another @entity161 to fall at the first hurdle was @entity173 who , despite winning the opening set , suffered a battling 6 - 7 ( 1 - 7 ) 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 4 loss against fifth seed @entity176
@entity178 's @entity176 is looking to build on an encouraging 2013 season which saw him reach the last four of a grand slam , at @entity126 , for the first time since 2009
but @entity176 , the 2009 @entity183 champion , struggled with intense heat
" you are thinking about a lot more things than the tennis match , " said the 25 - year - old , who plays @entity57 's @entity187 next
" you are trying to drink a lot and always thinking about your body , your physic , and not about the game
" i know tomorrow and after tomorrow it 's going to be worst , so i will try to be ready for the weather conditions , too
" empty seats were prevalent as many fans stayed away in heat , but those that did go to @entity12 were treated to a gutsy performance from @entity120 stalwart @entity203 in his five - set battle with 24th seed @entity205
the @entity207 took a two - set lead before former world no. 1 @entity203 rallied to draw level
to the disappointment most of those in the @entity90 , though , @entity203 's comeback was thwarted and @entity207 's @entity214 eventually triumphed 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 3 5 - 7 5 - 7 7 - 5
tenth seed @entity215 , beaten in the quarterfinals in 2013 , beat @entity214 's compatriot @entity218 in straight sets .
