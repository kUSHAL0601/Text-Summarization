-- @entity2 presidents should not be sworn into office with their hand on a @entity5
at monday 's inauguration of his second term , president @entity6 will raise his right hand and place his left on not one , but two @entity12 : one owned by @entity13 and the other by @entity15 the @entity16 requires he give this oath of office : " i do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that i will faithfully execute the office of @entity21 , and will to the best of my ability preserve , protect , and defend the @entity16 of the @entity2
" you might recall that at his 2009 inauguration , president - elect @entity6 and chief justice @entity27 played some kind of " mad libs " with this oath during the swearing - in ceremony , muddling it so badly that they had to redo it a few days later
but why does the president swear on a @entity5 ? why does n't he place his hand on the @entity16 -- the very document he 's promising to " preserve , protect and defend " ? opinion : learning from @entity13 , @entity39 , @entity40 the @entity16 does not require that the president take the oath of office by swearing on a @entity5
that would have been a very simple requirement for the constitutional drafters to include
to the contrary , the @entity46 wanted to ensure that @entity2 of any faith -- or no faith -- could hold federal office
they set it forth plainly in @entity52 : " ... no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the @entity2
" placing a hand on a @entity5 while reciting the presidential oath is simply a tradition started by @entity60
indeed , two presidents , @entity62 and @entity63 , did not use a @entity5 at their swearing - in ceremonies
although @entity62 's reasons are unclear , @entity63 ' reasons could not be more plain
@entity63 , the son of president @entity67 , was a religious man
but he chose to be sworn in with his hand on a book of @entity2 laws
he wanted to demonstrate that he recognized a barrier between church and state and that his loyalty was to our nation 's laws above all else
@entity63 also refused to campaign for the presidency because he believed it was beneath the dignity of the office to make promises that might not be kept
clearly , @entity63 was not a man who acted because of tradition alone
he had to truly believe in what he did
opinion : why ' @entity87 ' remains unsung some will argue that swearing on the @entity5 ensures the president adheres to his oath
but let 's be honest : we have seen presidents and other elected officials swear to uphold the laws of our country with their hands on a @entity5 and go on to break many laws and ethical rules
it comes down to the person 's moral code , not a 30 - second oath
and just so it 's clear , my objection is not only to the @entity5
i would hold the identical view if it were the @entity108 , the @entity109 or any other religious scripture
the @entity111 made it clear that the @entity16 , " ... shall be the supreme law of the land
" it is the living legacy they bestowed upon us
it is the framework for our government
and as such , that 's the document our president should place his hand on
it should be clear to all that the president views the @entity16 as our nation 's genesis
