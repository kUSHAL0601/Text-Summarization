-- when @entity2 was born , he weighed just over 2 pounds
his tiny , underdeveloped lungs struggled for each breath
then doctors in the hospital in @entity7 , @entity8 , put @entity9 on a breathing machine made out of aquarium pumps
@entity2 is one of dozens of newborns in the @entity14 country who have survived thanks to the ingenuity of students in a senior design class at @entity20 in @entity21
the overall survival rate of babies with respiratory distress at the @entity8 hospital increased from 44 % to 71 % with the use of the students ' breathing machine , according to a recent clinical trial
using aquarium pumps , the students have designed a low - cost version of a breathing device called a bubble @entity34 , or @entity34 , machine
traditional bubble cpap systems used in developed countries can cost upwards of $ 6,000 ; the students ' machine can be manufactured for around $ 350 , providing big savings for hospitals in poverty - stricken areas
@entity8 has the highest rate of preterm birth in the world , 18.1 per 100 live births , according to the @entity48
babies born too early often have underdeveloped lungs that do n't inflate easily
premature babies struggle to breathe in part because they do n't produce enough lung surfactant , a naturally - produced chemical that keeps the tiny air sacs in the lungs , called alveoli , from collapsing
a lot of these babies die because of the stress struggling to breathe puts on their bodies
second baby possibly ' cured ' of @entity63 in @entity8 , when a newborn is suffering from respiratory distress , he or she is typically provided extra oxygen via tubes placed gently in the nose
but doctors do n't add air pressure to help inflate the infant 's lungs
this is the way respiratory distress was treated in newborns , even in developed countries like the @entity77 , until the 1970s
with a @entity34 machine , gentle air pressure is pushed via tubes into the nostrils and / or mouth to help facilitate breathing
to understand how a bubble @entity34 works , think of a straw that is partially submerged in a glass of water
when you blow into the top of the straw , bubbles come out of the bottom of the straw and bubble up
" when lungs are underdeveloped , it 's like when you 're blowing up a completely deflated balloon and that first breath to inflate the balloon is really difficult , " said dr. @entity94 of @entity20 , who helped facilitate the design of the students ' bubble @entity34 machine
" for a baby with underdeveloped lungs , every breath is like that
" doctors and nurses know that it takes very little air pressure to assist newborns
the design students found that two aquarium pumps provided the perfect amount of gentle pressure for delicate lungs
in the original prototype , the machine was housed in a clear plastic shoebox from @entity122
the device 's latest casing box is made from bent sheet metal specifically designed for usability , funcation and durability , said dr. @entity128 of @entity20 , a co-author of the device 's clinical trial along with @entity131
" having used bubble @entity34 myself , the ( low - cost aquarium pump ) machine uses the same general principles , " said dr. @entity132 , a neonatal specialist at @entity133 in @entity134 who was not associated with the device 's design
" we 've found bubble @entity34 to be very beneficial in infants with respiratory distress
... after taking a look at the photos , the low - cost machine does n't seem to be very different
" @entity150 , a former student who helped design the low - cost bubble cpap machine , has lived in @entity8 for almost two years
she is collaborating with aid organizations and using a transitions grant from @entity154 in hopes of rolling out the device across the country -- first in government hospitals , and then in private and rural hospitals
so far , the machines have been implemented in nine government hospitals , she said
mysterious cluster of birth defects stumps doctors @entity150 said one major challenge to the rollout in @entity8 is a lack of nurses and physicians ; the high turnover rate makes training difficult
" many district hospitals have maybe one doctor , who may not even be a neonatal specialist , " @entity150 said
" much of the care is provided by nurses , but one nurse could be taking care of 40 patients at a time
" another challenge , @entity150 explained , is that parents in @entity8 are sometimes reluctant to allow the bubble cpap machine to be used , perhaps because nasal tubes and masks used in respiratory therapy are associated with death -- usually , only extremely ill patients receive breathing assistance
fortunately , baby @entity2 's family allowed him to receive the respiratory therapy
his name , which means " thrown away " in @entity8 's @entity192 language , was chosen by his grandmother
she feared he had been thrown away by @entity194 , as she did n't expect him to survive
but with the help of a breathing machine made of aquarium pumps , @entity2 is now a healthy , thriving 7 - month - old baby .
