@entity4 's next two matches , against @entity20 on wednesday , and @entity21 at the weekend , have been postponed
" the players , the supporters , every one inside the executive are devastated and absolutely dumbfounded by the event of @entity2 's death , " manager @entity22 said on sunday
" we had a meeting this morning with the players and obviously they have taken it very , very badly and we are going to have to help them through that
" @entity2 , who started his career at @entity4 before stints with @entity21 and @entity8 , was about to be substituted at @entity12 against @entity6 but collapsed before he could leave the field
he was set to be replaced by substitute @entity35 , but fell to the pitch as the change was taking place
after been treated for about five minutes on the field , @entity2 was carried off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance
medical staff from both clubs said that they thought he suffered a seizure , and efforts were made to revive him en route to hospital

" this is a tragic happening and that 's all i can say
" @entity4 owner @entity63 said : " everyone here is shocked to the core , and we are sure that everyone involved in @entity3 football will feel the same

all of us at @entity4 are thinking of his wife @entity71 and their four children
" @entity22 added : " i do n't want to say anything more than how devastated everyone at the club is for his wife and his young children
obviously from the club 's point of view , we 'll gather round to give his family as much support as they need
" @entity2 , who won one @entity1 international cap , began his career with @entity4 and rejoined the club in 2004 following spells with @entity21 -- who he joined in a $ 3.5 million transfer in 1994 -- and @entity9 side @entity8
@entity91 chief executive @entity90 said : " this is absolutely devastating news
@entity2 was not just a wonderful footballer , he was a great human being

" our thoughts are with his family to whom we offer extreme condolences for a tragic loss of a young life
everyone at @entity107 will mourn him
" @entity2 is the second @entity4 player to pass away unexpectedly in the past 20 years
club legend winger @entity109 died at the age of 39 in 1995 after suffering a brain haemorrhage when filming a training video
@entity109 had been a @entity4 team - mate of @entity2 , who made his debut as a 17 - year - old
he went on to score , as a 19 - year - old , in the 4 - 3 victory over @entity6 in the 1991 @entity118 final , and won his sole @entity1 cap in 1993 as a substitute in the @entity122 qualifier against @entity123
former @entity1 manager @entity124 gave @entity2 his only international outing , and had coached him in the under - 21 side
" but for injury , i 'm sure he would have had many , many more caps , " @entity124 said
" it 's very , very sad news , i just ca n't get over it
you would not get a more ideal role model for a young footballer than @entity2
" i think in his first spell at @entity4 he was probably the best box - to - box midfield player -- maybe not just in @entity1 but in the @entity139
" injuries affected @entity2 's spells with @entity21 and @entity8 and he returned to @entity4 after being released by wednesday in early 2004
he played in the 2005 @entity143 final , and was appointed captain in 2006 after former skipper @entity145 left the club
