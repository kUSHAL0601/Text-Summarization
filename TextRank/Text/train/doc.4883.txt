-- @entity2 's gala address before @entity4 parliamentarians and officials tuesday surprised no one when he announced @entity4 's annexation of @entity8
the interesting part was his distorted view of @entity4 history , and his proclamation that a bizarre kind of simultaneously aggrieved and aggressive hyper - nationalism is now @entity4 's official ideology
in discussing @entity16 , however , @entity2 seemed to go out of his way to suggest he had no aggressive intentions and was not planning to divide the rest of the country
listening to @entity2 , one could easily forget that @entity4 is and for many centuries has been the largest country in the world and that it acquired its territories by imperialist expansion often accompanied by genocide and ethnic cleansing
instead , @entity2 prefers to see @entity4 as having been permanently on the defensive , a victim of both @entity31 and @entity32 machinations : " in a word , we have all the reasons to believe that the notorious policy of containing @entity4 , which was pursued in the 18th , 19th and 20th centuries , is continuing to this day
" they are constantly trying to drive us into some corner , because we have an independent position , because we defend it , and because we call things by their names and are not hypocrites , " he said
after the @entity45 , according to @entity2 , it was the turn of the @entity46 to aggrieve @entity4
@entity2 conveniently ignores that the vast majority of @entity46 were @entity4 and that the party @entity49 founded was institutionally @entity4 as well
@entity2 says : " the @entity46 , for a number of reasons -- may @entity51 judge them -- added large sections of the historical @entity56 to the @entity57
this was done with no consideration for the ethnic makeup of the population , and today these areas form the southeast of @entity16
then , in 1954 , a decision was made to transfer @entity65 to @entity16
... what matters now is that this decision was made in clear violation of the constitutional norms that were in place even then
" once again , @entity2 's historical myopia is breathtaking : @entity72 's decision to grant @entity8 to @entity16 was as constitutional as anything any @entity75 @entity32 leader did in the entire period of the @entity75 's existence
the @entity75 rested on illegality and the systemic violation of human and civil rights
if @entity72 was wrong , then that 's only because the @entity75 was wrong and should never have been created in the first place
unsurprisingly , there is no room in this narrative for the nation that @entity4 imperialism almost managed to annihilate -- the @entity88
@entity4 conquered the @entity89 in 1783
afterward , the @entity4 authorities forced the @entity91 out of their ancestral homeland and replaced them with settlers from @entity4
tens of thousands of @entity91 died or were killed ; some two - thirds had to leave the @entity8
in 1944 , the ethnic cleansing was completed when @entity97 expelled the entire @entity89 population -- about 200,000 people -- to @entity100 and some other @entity75 regions
about half died on the way
it was only in the late 1980s that they began returning to their homeland to find that their land and their homes had been occupied by @entity4 settlers
instead , @entity2 primarily explains why @entity8 matters to @entity4 : " the graves of @entity4 soldiers whose bravery brought @entity8 into the @entity4 empire are also in @entity8
this is also @entity117 -- a legendary city with an outstanding history , a fortress that serves as the birthplace of @entity4 's @entity121 ... symbolizing @entity4 military glory and outstanding valor
" and what of the @entity88 ? here 's @entity2 : " true , there was a time when @entity88 were treated unfairly , just as a number of other peoples in the @entity75
there is only one thing i can say here : millions of people of various ethnicities suffered during those repressions , and primarily @entity4
" the mendacity is astounding
the @entity88 were not just " treated unfairly " by some vague force
they were subjected to genocide by a @entity4 totalitarian empire
@entity4 also " suffered , " but the brunt of the suffering fell , as @entity142 historian @entity141 describes in " @entity143 , " on @entity144 and @entity16
despite all this victimization , @entity2 's speech loudly asserts that @entity4 is back : it 's mad as hell and it wo n't take being humiliated anymore
this @entity4 , the new @entity4 , is both victim and bully : " today it is imperative to end the hysterics and to renounce the rhetoric of the ' @entity153 , ' and to recognize an obvious thing : @entity4 is an independent and active participant in international life , and it has , like other countries , its national interests , which must be acknowledged and respected
" and then , remarkably , @entity2 adopts a conciliatory tone with respect to @entity16
naturally , he first denounces the new democratic government as illegitimate and in the thrall of imaginary fascists and asserts @entity4 's obligation to help defend @entity4 and @entity4 speakers from their supposed assaults and predations
here 's the soft and fuzzy @entity2 : " i appeal to the people of @entity16
i sincerely want you to understand us : under no conditions do we wish to bring you harm , to insult your national feelings
we have always respected the territorial integrity of the @entity16 state
... " do n't believe those who terrify you with @entity4 , who shout that other regions will follow @entity8
... we want @entity16 to be a strong , sovereign and self - sufficient state
... we want peace and amity to come to the land of @entity16 , and together with other countries we are ready to provide full cooperation and support to that end
but i repeat : only the citizens of @entity16 are able to bring order to their own home
" if these words were sincere , then they may mark a significant departure from the war - mongering rhetoric @entity2 employed at his march 4 press conference , where he stated he " was n't worried " by war with @entity16
indeed , if sincere , @entity2 has clearly stated that he will not invade the rest of @entity16 and attempt to annex some of its southeastern provinces
is @entity2 being truthful , or is the speech a smoke screen for further aggression ? we do n't know , of course , but now that @entity2 has gone on record as having nothing but peaceful intentions toward @entity16 , the international community would do well to remind him of that whenever the temptation to rattle sabers on @entity16 's borders and foment trouble in @entity16 's southeast proves too strong for him to resist
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .
