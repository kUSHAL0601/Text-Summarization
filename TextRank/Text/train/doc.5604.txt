-- first sgt. @entity1 smiled as he stumbled upon an old letter that had been missing since he was a young soldier in @entity3
" you are so kind to remember me with a very nice letter , " @entity1 read from the weathered pages
" the cards and letters i receive from you are very dear to me
" the letter contained words of encouragement written by @entity13 , a stranger at the time , but eventually a friend
hundreds of soldiers who got her letters came to know her as @entity20
@entity20 was a regular one - woman @entity21
from 1991 to 2003 , she wrote more than 100 letters a month to deployed soldiers
initially , she addressed the letters to " @entity25 , " hoping that someone without family support could have some contact back in the @entity29
" i would do anything for that woman , " said @entity1
" she always had an uplifting message for anyone who did n't have family , or who felt afraid
" after finding her letter , @entity1 put in a phone call to thank his " granny " for her encouragement
" it just set my heart alive that he would remember me , " @entity20 said
" my heart aches for soldiers -- it always did when i was a little girl at 8 or 9 years old
i thought the soldiers were so important
i 've just always been real patriotic
i teach my kids to be that way
" supporting the troops was a family affair in the @entity13 household
@entity20 would come home from work , cook dinner , and her husband , @entity54 , would wash the dishes so she could begin writing
her real - life grandchildren pitched in during the holidays
@entity20 's support did n't stop with the letters
she ensured her soldiers were well taken care of by mailing them cookies , toys , games , @entity67 chewing gum , films and magazines
" one box i sent out had makeup in it and ended up in a company that had no females , " @entity20 said
" the men made a point to write me back telling me how much they enjoyed dressing a couple of the guys up and joking around
" the soldiers meant the world to @entity20
she said corresponding with them and learning about their lives was incredibly rewarding
each time a different soldier responded to one of her letters , @entity20 proudly tied a bright yellow ribbon to her dogwood tree in @entity88 , @entity89
there were 147 ribbons in all
eventually , @entity20 's worsening health required that she put away her typewriter
once she stopped writing , most of the soldiers followed suit
many things have changed since @entity20 churned out letters and sent gifts regularly
next week , @entity20 will celebrate her 59th wedding anniversary
she said that some details of her vast friendships with soldiers have slipped from her memory , but she is happy the soldiers have kept her on their minds
" it was my life for those 12 years , " @entity20 said
the words in @entity20 's letter to @entity1 have faded with age , but the message is as clear as the late summer day on which it was written : " i hope this letter finds you well and in a safe place , if there is such a thing in this world
... you are a delight to my life and my heart
you are the future and i feel that you will make a better world
