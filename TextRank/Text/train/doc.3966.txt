i 'm like , ' a design on a purse
how is it a federal offense ? ' " purses or belts with gun emblems can fall under a @entity15 prohibition on replica weapons because they could be mistaken for a real weapon in the x-ray machine or by a fellow passenger
" security checkpoints may be impacted or closed because replica weapons like toy guns , novelty grenades , fake bombs and other items appear similar to the real thing when viewed through an x-ray machine , " @entity15 spokesman @entity40 said
" @entity50 closures cause significant delays , which can be avoided if passengers do n't bring these items to the airport
" by the time @entity15 officials figured out that the purse was a fake , offering @entity10 the opportunity to give up the purse or check it , @entity10 had missed her flight and was placed on another to @entity61
her frantic mother drove from @entity63 to @entity61 to pick her daughter up
@entity10 arrived at security 20 minutes before her flight was due to depart , which may have caused her to miss her flight , according to a security official
the @entity15 says it 's investigating her allegation that the purse has made it through airport security before .
