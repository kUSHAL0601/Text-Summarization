-- @entity2 is a pedophile and was rightfully convicted , filmmaker @entity1 said
yet he came out in @entity2 's defense in an interview with @entity0 's @entity5 late monday , disparaging witness testimony that led to that conviction
the a.m. radio talk show host recently released controversial interviews he conducted with the former @entity11 assistant coach
@entity2 will probably be incarcerated for the rest of his life for child sex abuse convictions , but he has had his say outside the prison walls in these recorded phone conversations , which @entity1 partially posted on the @entity18
in the audio clips , @entity2 attempted to discredit an eyewitness in the case against him and downplayed what head coach @entity22 may have known about his activities
@entity22 family : @entity27 report ' factually wrong ' it was harmless fun @entity2 recalled in one anecdote trading swats with an undressed boy who was showering near him , but mentioned no sexual acts
he depicted it as mutual amusement for both the boy and him
" he would get the last smack , " @entity2 said , " and then i would chase him , like , and i ran him into a wall ... " @entity1 combined @entity2 's account with what he called evidence corroborating it
in this case , @entity2 did not recall the presence at the incident of a key witness who testified against him
" i never saw @entity47
i do n't know if the young man saw him , " @entity2 told @entity1
@entity47 , another former @entity11 assistant coach , had testified during the trial that he walked in on @entity50 raping a child in the showers at a school facility
@entity2 scoffed at the testimony
" i do n't understand how anybody would have walked into that locker room from where he was and heard sounds associated that was sex going on , " @entity2 told @entity1 with a laugh
@entity1 then held up a paper to @entity5 , allegedly a statement from the victim in @entity2 's narrative , saying that nothing happened
@entity47 was lying , the filmmaker suggested , because prosecutors encouraged him to
still , @entity1 said he believes @entity2 committed abuse with the horseplay behavior he described
the conviction on actual sexual acts was a " rush to judgment " in @entity1 's eyes
during the trial , eight young men gave testimony about @entity2 groping them in a car , soaping them in the shower and sexually assaulting them on a basement waterbed
' the @entity2 8 ' describe seduction , molestation and betrayal @entity1 is fighting for @entity22 @entity1 , a native of @entity85 and a former @entity87 sportscaster , is fighting in the name of @entity22
" @entity22 's dying wish was -- ' just find out what the truth was , ' " @entity1 insisted
" no one has done that for @entity22
" talking with @entity2 was " the only way to do that , " he said
@entity2 , who refused to take the stand in his own case , spoke eagerly to him for three and a half hours , according to @entity1
@entity22 's family has objected to the recording 's release
" the @entity22 family would prefer to remain silent on this matter , " the family 's attorney , @entity102 , said in a written statement , " but they feel it is important to make it clear that they had no role in obtaining or releasing this recording
moreover , they believe that any attempt to use this recording as a defense of @entity22 is misguided and inappropriate
" the family advised the public to inform themselves via the website @entity121 and reports from official legal and law enforcement sources
but on their website , they have defended the iconic late head coach 's reputation , saying the allegations that he knew of the danger @entity2 posed are overblown
letters by @entity2 , wife blame everyone else a man on a mission @entity1 is passionate about his mission , and he has confidence in his opinion
those appear to be defining qualities , whenever he tackles an issue
he fights for the reputation of @entity142 and is a decided @entity144 fan
he goes after the @entity146 establishment for being too liberal or serving their own pocketbooks , and at times opts publicly against @entity146 , preferring @entity150 alternatives
he regularly lambasts the media
his list of favorite topics can be found on his website
the sex abuse scandal has tarnished the @entity11 sports program 's celebrated reputation and wiped out part of the impressive record racked up by the @entity160 under @entity22 from the annals of football history
last july , the @entity163 fined @entity164 $ 60 million
it also stripped 14 seasons of football victories from the late head coach
the university demolished a memorial statue depicting @entity22 in a visionary pose leading a past team to victory
@entity22 died on january 22 , 2012 , of cancer while the wounds to his legacy were still bleeding
@entity1 asserts that the @entity11 football legend , who made a deep mark on the @entity179 sport for over six decades , did not cover up for his abusive former assistant coach
in his documentary project , titled " @entity181 of @entity22 , " he is working hard to acquit ' @entity22
" " @entity2 had his day in court
@entity22 never did , " @entity1 said
" this is all about @entity22 's alleged culpability , which i do n't believe the facts back up
i think he was railroaded
" during his at times heated appearance on @entity5 , @entity1 accused @entity5 of having defamed @entity22 on his show
@entity5 asked him to calm down
@entity1 partly blames the media for @entity22 's fall
he asked @entity2 what he thought his late boss knew about him
" if he absolutely thought i was ( a pedophile ) , i 'd say no , " @entity2 said
" if he had a suspicion , i do n't know the answer to that
" who the interview hurt @entity11 , which has alleged that @entity22 knew what danger @entity197 posed , joined @entity22 's family in objecting to the release of @entity1 's interview
" @entity2 's statements today continue to open wounds for his victims , and the victims of child sexual abuse everywhere
we have tremendous respect for the men who came forward to tell their stories publicly , " said @entity11 spokesman @entity207
the statement from the @entity22 family 's attorney echoed that sentiment
" the release of the audio recording of @entity2 is a sad and unfortunate development , " @entity102 said
" ... releasing a recording at this time , nearly a year after he was found guilty on 45 counts , is transparently self - serving and yet another insult to the victims and anyone who cares about the truth in this tragic story
" @entity2 was sentenced in october to 30 to 60 years in prison for abusing 10 boys during a 15 - year period
on february 21 , he filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence with the @entity232 , according to court records
@entity0 's @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report
