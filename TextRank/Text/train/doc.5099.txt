-- @entity1 has begun the rollout of a new feature , @entity4 , which will allow users to get answers to their queries from the entire @entity1 community
similar in concept to @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , @entity4 gives users the opportunity to ask questions just by clicking the " @entity17 " button on the homepage
questions is also available on friends ' profiles just as you would post on someone 's wall
we first learned of @entity1 's q&a feature two months ago , when the company started asking for volunteers to beta test the product
the world 's largest social network even went so far as to promise beta testers a trip to @entity1 's offices to meet with the q&a team
i had the chance earlier today to discuss the new feature with several @entity1 employees
questions has several defining features : photo questions : for example , if you take a picture of a bird , but do n't know what species it is , you can post the picture on @entity4 and get your answer
polling : if you 're simply looking for the answer to " which city is better : @entity55 or @entity56 ? " , you can get your answer by creating a poll
tagging : the company seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on tagging questions based on category or topic
the goal seems to be to make @entity66 discovery an easier and faster process by making it simple to look up questions on cooking , photography , @entity72 or a variety of other topics
topic exploration : @entity1 described this as a roulette - type feature that allows users to browse @entity1 's eventual mountain of @entity66
under the " questions about " drop - down menu , there 's a feature called " everything " that allows users to browse the company 's catalog of questions
following : you can follow specific questions for updates and new answers
updated homepage : @entity4 does actually change the homepage , adding a new bar at the top of the page where you can choose to update your status , ask a question , add photos , or post a link
there was one more thing that @entity1 made clear to me : @entity105 is not an advertising product
while brands with @entity109 will eventually be able to answer questions , it 's not meant to be a promotional platform ; it 's meant to be a useful and insightful product for users
facebook questions will roll out to a limited group of beta testers today , but the company promises to " bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can
" the entire feature is public , so we do n't suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on @entity1
will @entity4 prove to be more useful than @entity11 or even @entity122 as a q&a platform ? we think so , if only because it has the biggest advantage of them all : 500 million users
