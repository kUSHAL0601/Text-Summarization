-- boisterous and uninhibited on screen , comedic actor @entity1 has quietly risen to the top in @entity4
five years ago , @entity1 was best known as a comedian on the cusp of a breakthrough ; now he 's dominating the comedy stage and the screen
his january film release , " @entity11 , " opened at no. 1 , and there are high expectations for his next movie , " @entity15 , " coming out friday
with a devoted fan base and an unrepentant work ethic , the 33 - year - old has quietly transformed into a burgeoning powerhouse
how exactly did he do it ? let 's recount : 1
@entity22 like with most entertainers , @entity1 is familiar with the valleys that come before finding fame
the @entity27 native and one - time shoe salesman initially began performing in the late ' 90s under the name " @entity30 , " but the comedy career he was angling for suffered from a slow start
instead of dropping out for good , @entity1 worked with a mentor and re-evaluated his position : he started performing under his own name and began to hit with his brand of loud , physical comedy that drew from personal stories
while doing stand - up , he also branched out into acting , landing roles in @entity42 productions such as " @entity43 " ( 2002 ) and " the 40 - year - old virgin " ( 2005 )
his 2004 tv series , " @entity46 , " did n't take off , but no matter -- his satiric take on reality tv , @entity52 's " @entity51 , " has been picked up for a third season
" the one thing about the business of entertainment is that you have to learn patience , " @entity1 told @entity53 in 2011 after the independent release of his comedy tour , " @entity61 , " did surprisingly well at the box office
" the thing with patience is your time will come , there 's just no telling when
your job is to be ready when the time comes
authenticity a huge part of @entity1 's appeal is his willingness to mine his own fears and foibles for comedy gold , a practice that made " @entity61 " and the 2013 top performer that followed , " @entity80 , " major moneymakers
his father 's struggle with addiction , his divorce and ( especially ) his short stature are all topics that @entity1 unabashedly broaches in his routines with a quick and sharp wit
" his comedy comes from such a real place , " @entity1 's frequent co-star , @entity90 , told @entity91
" and he 's funny as hell
versatility what 's made @entity1 such an inescapable presence is his ability to mix up his repertoire
he 's become a master of stand - up comedy , executive - produces and stars in a spoof comedy series , can host an @entity106 awards show and is a natural with the raunchy comedy of @entity42 's universe
and on the other hand , he can also slip into the family - friendly world of @entity113 's " @entity112 " with ease
( yes , that was @entity1 guest - starring as the @entity117 ' neighbor , @entity116 , in 2011 and 2012
) from the 2012 rom - com release " the five - year engagement " to the 2013 sports flick " @entity122 " with @entity123 and @entity124 , there are n't many worlds that @entity1 ca n't inhabit
cultivating an audience with more than 10 million followers on @entity128 and an eagerness to connect with his fans , @entity1 is the antithesis of the unreachable a-lister
this is a guy who was named @entity136 ' sixth - highest earning comedian of 2013 -- but still promises to make surprise appearances at local movie theaters
that 's the kind of intimacy that could make fans stick around for the long haul
no breaks by his own admission , @entity1 is industrious
but you do n't need to hear him say it -- he often uses the phrase , " everybody wants to be famous but nobody wants to do the work ! " -- to know that 's true
once his 2014 raft of movies is done -- which include " @entity11 , " " @entity154 " and now " @entity15 " -- @entity1 has at least another five projects in the works through 2016
