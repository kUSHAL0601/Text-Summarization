@entity1 , @entity0 -- the frightened look on the @entity6 players ' faces said it all
standing in the center of the @entity11 , the 11 players representing the @entity9 were subjected to a barrage of boos and screams from the 100,000 - strong crowd , drowning out every single note of their national anthem
@entity0 versus @entity9 has always been considered one of the fiercest rivalries in world football , but this age - old dual took a new dimension when the two met in a winner - takes - all match for a place in the 2010 @entity25 finals
@entity0 had to win by three clear goals to go through , or win 2 - 0 to force a play off
what had been billed as a crucial game between @entity31 and @entity32 brothers ended in violence , recriminations , diplomatic intrigue and a trail of broken glass and burned - out cars from @entity1 to @entity39
not since the so - called " @entity40 , " when a @entity25 qualifier between @entity42 and @entity43 sparked armed conflict between the two feuding @entity46 nations in 1969 , has a football match taken on such overtly political tones
@entity9 and @entity0 have long been regional rivals , but the current animus stems from 1989 , when @entity0 faced @entity9 in a winner - takes - all match for a place at @entity53
@entity9 , who had qualified for the past two finals and were considered the leading power in @entity58 football , lost 1 - 0 thanks to a controversial @entity61 goal
" the @entity9 team was full of stars and on the pitch it was very crazy ; 11 fights between every player , " recalled @entity65 , a former @entity0 international who had played for the @entity66 in that qualification campaign
" everybody forgot what the coaches had to say and just fought instead
it was a battle , not a football match
it was like our war against @entity78 in 1973
" @entity79 followed between fans and players alike , with the @entity0 team doctor losing an eye via a broken bottle
@entity85 was convicted in his absence
despite denying any involvement in the attack an @entity90 arrest warrant was hanging over him until the matter was resolved when the two governments met before last june 's first group game , which @entity9 won 3 - 1
the move was designed to defuse tensions between the two countries but by the time tickets were due to go on sale a few days before the final group match , the hysteria was almost out of control
with the @entity0 league cancelled weeks before the match , so that the team could prepare for the decider , a media war had broken out between @entity9 and @entity0 to fill the vacuum
the front page of @entity110 , @entity0 's popular weekly football newspaper , was a case in point
it depicted a scene from the film " 300 , " a cinematic depiction of the classical battle of @entity118 where 300 @entity119 held off an attack of over 100,000 @entity122 soldiers
only this time the @entity0 players ' faces were superimposed over the faces of the @entity127 soldiers
at the front , leading the charge with @entity0 flag in hand , was the coach @entity132
the headline read : " attack , " written in @entity134 and smeared in blood
the escalation of the dirty media war was highlighted when the @entity6 team landed in @entity1 : their bus was attacked by stone - throwing youths , who smashed windows and injured four people , including three players
" they let them do it , " defender @entity148 told @entity6 state radio , accusing @entity0 security guards of standing back and allowing the attack to happen
in our home game we welcomed them with flowers
" but , despite a @entity161 representative witnessing the attack , the @entity0 media , including the government controlled daily @entity159 , accused the @entity6 of fabricating the claim to try and force a cancellation
across town protests broke out in front of the @entity6 embassy as hundreds of @entity6 tried to pick up tickets only to be told that just 2,000 would be made available
" the @entity0 are so scared , they are trying any means [ to win the match ] , it is a dirty game , " explained 45 - year - old @entity169 , a @entity170 @entity6 businessman as he waited for news about tickets
" the image of @entity0 is at stake
" on the day of the match the vast majority who had arrived at the @entity11 six hours before kick off to create the intimidating wall of sound that had drowned out the @entity6 anthem were convinced that the @entity6 were trying to cheat their way to the finals
the @entity9 , several wearing heavy bandages from the wounds they had received when their coach was attacked , were visibly rattled by the hostility , so much so that @entity189 managed to score in the second minute , giving 80 million @entity0 hope
then @entity190 looped in a header five minutes into injury time
the @entity6 were silent , halted just 30 seconds from the finishing line
the @entity0 bench stormed the pitch , the crowd exploding in disbelief
" they [ @entity9 ] are so disappointed now , " shouted @entity197 , a celebrating @entity0 fan , over the din of car horns from the grid locked streets outside the stadium
" it was bulls * * t that they were attacked [ because ] i know the bus driver and he said they invented everything so they deserved to lose
" the goal set off a chain of violent events around globe
the @entity0 government eventually confirmed that 20 @entity6 had been hurt in riots outside the stadium , after initially denying anything untoward had taken place
one @entity6 newspaper reported , falsely , that seven " bodies " had been flown back from @entity1
riots flared in @entity39 , where youths of @entity6 origin set fire to boats and cars ; algiers was rocked when @entity0 businesses were ransacked by angry fans
@entity0 recalled its ambassador to @entity9 in protest
but the result meant that the two now had to play again , in @entity231 , under tight security
tens of thousands of @entity6 and @entity0 fans descended on @entity235 ( a sister city of @entity237 ) for the game , which @entity9 won 1 - 0 , sending them and not @entity0 to @entity239
ironically , it was @entity148 who scored the winning goal
even after the match the war of words continued
whilst most of the world 's press agreed that the aftermath had passed relatively peacefully , @entity0 media saw things differently
according to @entity0 football web site @entity251 , tearful fans had phoned @entity0 tv shows from @entity231 claiming to be under attack from knife - wielding @entity6
" i do n't know what to say
damn the so - called @entity31 unity , we should no longer talk about it , " presenter @entity257 angrily said on his @entity259 tv show
" we should review our situations
we can no longer bear such incidents
" president @entity264 told the @entity231 government , rather bluntly , that he would be watching the drama unfold on tv at home and would send in the army if need be
" @entity0 does not tolerate those who hurt the dignity of its sons [ but ] we do n't want to be drawn into impulsive reactions
i am agitated too , but i restrain myself , " he said afterwards in a televised speech to parliament
it was all news to the @entity231 government , who summoned the @entity0 ambassador , livid that media reports in @entity0 had exaggerated the violence
@entity161 charged the @entity0 @entity281 over the attack on the @entity6 team ; they responded by threatening to pull out of international competition for two years
the @entity6 embassy was the scene of another riot , this time by @entity0 fans angry at the pictures they had seen emerge from @entity231
like in 1989 , the aftermath will leave a bitter taste far beyond the football field
unlike 1989 , both teams may not have to wait two decades to revive the animosity : @entity9 and @entity0 play in january 's @entity295 and could meet in the knockout stages
@entity161 , not to mention both governments , will pray that fate does n't offer either side the chance for revenge .
