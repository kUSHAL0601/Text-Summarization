@entity0 airstrikes again pounded @entity3 positions in @entity4 and @entity5 on saturday , including at least a dozen strikes on @entity7 , where @entity9 forces have been trying to weaken targets ahead of an anticipated fight to wrest @entity4 's second largest city from the terror group
a @entity1 crew watching from @entity16 positions on @entity17 , to the southeast of @entity7 , saw at least 12 blasts in the city and heard jets streaking overhead
@entity3 swept into @entity7 in june , with @entity4 forces at the time largely fleeing the advance
the @entity25 terror group , also called the @entity26 in @entity4 and @entity5 , folded @entity7 into what it calls its @entity29 caliphate -- territory that it has captured in both countries
@entity16 forces , which protect a @entity16 autonomous region in northern @entity4 , recently have been trying to surround @entity7 to cut off @entity3 's lines of supply from @entity5 , setting up what could be an eventual assault to try to expel the terror group from the city
@entity4 ground forces could begin a move to retake the city as soon as april , a @entity41 official told @entity1 earlier this week
@entity16 forces say the frequency and intensity of airstrikes on @entity7 have increased sharply since tuesday , when @entity3 released a video showing its fighters burning to death a @entity52 captive pilot , @entity51 , who was captured in december after his jet crashed in @entity5
@entity3 defenses in @entity7 could be trigger for @entity57 ground troop recommendation airstrikes also hit @entity3 targets near the terror group 's de facto capital of @entity64 , @entity5 , on saturday , @entity9 activists there said
at least 10 explosions were reported saturday in @entity66 , north of @entity64 , and six other strikes happened in @entity68 to the west , the activist group " @entity64 is being slaughtered silently " said on @entity71
@entity52 , one of @entity5 's southern neighbors , again sent its jets to strike @entity3 targets saturday , and all of the jets returned safely to their bases , @entity52 state - run tv reported
@entity52 , which has promised revenge for @entity81 , has publicly pressed to participate in more of the coalition 's airstrikes against @entity3 in @entity5
@entity57 and coalition aircraft conducted 11 airstrikes over @entity5 and 15 airstrikes over @entity4 from 8 a.m. friday to 8 a.m. saturday , the @entity57 military said
@entity3 declared it had established a caliphate spanning @entity4 and @entity5 last year
since then , it has gone on a murderous rampage that has included beheadings of foreigners
hundreds of thousands of @entity4 and @entity5 have fled areas it has seized
the @entity57 , along with @entity94 and @entity95 nations , began airstrikes against the terror group last year
@entity3 militants have destroyed a bridge they recently used to assault @entity4 's oil - rich @entity102 city -- a possible attempt to hinder a counterattack against them , a @entity16 political and military leader said saturday
about 30 kilometers southwest of @entity102 , @entity3 late friday blew up a bridge that helps connect an @entity3 - held area to the city , said @entity111 , a senior @entity16 political leader who also commands @entity113 troops near @entity102
@entity3 had used the bridge to reach the @entity102 area in a surprise attack on january 30 , @entity111 said
@entity16 troops have counter-attacked since
as the coalition 's struggle against @entity3 continued in northern @entity4 , a pair of suicide bombings on saturday killed at least three dozen people hundreds of kilometers to the south in @entity4 's capital , @entity124 , a police source in the city said
an attacker blew himself up at a busy restaurant in southeastern @entity124 's @entity132 neighborhood , killing at least 30 people and injuring 66 others , the police source said
in the center of the city , a different suicide bombing at a market killed six people and injured 28 others , the source said
information about who was responsible for the bombings was n't immediately available
@entity1 's @entity144 reported from @entity4 's @entity7 area
