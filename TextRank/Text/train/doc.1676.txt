@entity0 -- @entity3 rep. @entity2 on wednesday became the first member of @entity5 to call for @entity7 director @entity6 to step down due to a prostitution scandal involving eleven agents that has raised questions about security at the agency
" there are only so many strikes you get -- in baseball it 's three , " @entity2 told @entity1
" i think ( @entity6 's ) had three
i think it 's time to put somebody else in there to make sure we 're getting a different culture in the @entity7
" @entity23 , a senior member of the @entity25 , cited an earlier security breach at a @entity28 state dinner involving the @entity29 , a couple who got through security without an invitation
he also noted the agency 's recent inability to remain within its budget
there needs to be " change at the top , " @entity2 stressed
but @entity25 chairman @entity38 , @entity39 , disagreed with @entity23 , telling reporters he did n't think the head of the agency should be held responsible
" i think that 's a reach ... to go after the head of an organization because a few guys mess up , " @entity38 said wednesday
@entity2 said the security issues were serious , and @entity5 needed to be more involved in finding out what happened in @entity49
" we are n't just talking about one prostitute
we are talking about a bus load of prostitutes that they 're bringing in , " @entity2 said
@entity55 agents are allegedly involved in the scandal , along with several members of the @entity59 military
the agents were in @entity49 in advance of a visit by president @entity63
the alleged prostitutes , the youngest of whom were in their early 20s , had all signed in at @entity68 's @entity67 , flashing their local ids
one of the women , a source said , became involved in a dispute with @entity7 personnel about how much she was to be paid
that dispute brought the incident to light
" this is kind of security planning 101 , " @entity2 said
" it is the basic core fundamental , and the big concern i have is that it is n't just @entity59 looking into this
it is the rest of the world , and so i think it is time we jump on this and do something about it
" the @entity90 @entity89 said he is confident the @entity91 is capable of handling its component of the investigation -- as many as ten members of the military have been implicated in the scandal
but @entity23 does n't have the same level of trust in agencies outside the military , and said he planned to urge the head of the @entity101 to hold hearings into the matter
the @entity104 , meanwhile , has announced it will hold a hearing on the matter next wednesday
homeland security secretary @entity107 has been invited to testify
the @entity7 is part of the @entity109
like @entity23 , @entity38 believes that the @entity91 is " very capable " of doing its own probe of members of the military who may be involved
he does n't see a role for @entity5 in the matter
" i do n't think @entity5 needs to jump in to start trying to fix something that we do n't even know what the problem is yet , " @entity38 said
but @entity38 said he would likely raise the issue with defense secretary @entity120 when he meets with @entity120 before the secretary 's scheduled appearance before the @entity25 on thursday .
