-- the mayor of london @entity1 is open to the idea of a @entity5 race in @entity7 's capital , but has yet to be approached by the sport 's powerbrokers
plans have reportedly been formulated to race around iconic venues such as @entity12 and @entity13 , with the hope it might rival @entity5 's showpiece grand prix in @entity17
" @entity19 hosts a vast array of world events , " said a spokesman for @entity1
" the mayor is always keen to explore new opportunities to do so , especially if they will create jobs , bring investment and further @entity19 's lead as a world city but as yet we have not received proposals
" @entity31 chief eyes title push while industry insiders are skeptical the race will happen , @entity5 supremo @entity32 is keen to establish another race in his homeland -- in addition to the @entity7 @entity38 at @entity39 which will take place on july 8
the 2012 world championship calendar is the largest in the sport 's history , with a total of 20 races being held between march and november
@entity32 said a @entity19 race would give the city a greater boost than the forthcoming @entity49 , while also suggesting he would put up the necessary funds himself to ensure the grand prix got off the ground
" with the way things are , maybe we would front it and put the money up for it , " @entity32 told the @entity54 newspaper
" if we got the ok and everything was fine , i think we could do that
" think what it would do for tourism
it would be fantastic , good for @entity19 , good for @entity67 -- a lot better than the @entity49
" however , the idea is already facing opposition , with @entity7 motoring association the @entity72 questioning whether @entity19 's already congested streets could handle an annual influx of @entity5 teams and fans
" @entity79 havoc you would create by having to shut roads would be interesting to see , " an @entity72 spokesman told @entity0
" we 've seen the huge fuss that has been created by road closures during the @entity49 and that it just once in a lifetime -- a @entity85 would be every year
" earlier this year @entity19 announced plans to host a one - day professional road race to rival classic events such as the @entity90 , the @entity91 and @entity92
to be first staged in august 2013 , the race will be part of a two - day cycling festival , which will become an annual event , as part of the @entity49 legacy .
