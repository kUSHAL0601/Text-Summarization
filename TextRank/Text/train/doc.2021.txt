@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 said wednesday that @entity5 's currency is undervalued , resulting in a trade advantage for @entity5 goods over @entity9 goods that contributes to the @entity9 trade deficit
responding to a question at a town hall - style meeting , @entity3 addressed one of the major current issues in relations between the world 's two largest economies
" the reason i 'm pushing @entity5 about their currency is because their currency is undervalued , " he said , adding that " people generally think they are managing their currency in a way that makes our goods more expensive to sell there and their goods cheaper to sell here
" the resulting imbalance was a major factor contributing to the @entity9 trade deficit , @entity3 said
last week , @entity3 urged @entity5 premier @entity34 to speed up the revaluation of the yuan currency , telling him in a two - hour meeting at the @entity38 that the slow pace of reforms was affecting both the global and @entity9 economies , a top @entity9 aide said
the meeting on the sidelines of the @entity45 followed a speech by @entity34 the night before in which he told the business community in @entity48 that @entity5 will continue reforming and opening its markets under a policy it started in 1978 by officially ending decades of isolation
however , demands by @entity9 lawmakers that @entity5 revalue its currency by more than 20 percent would bankrupt @entity5 companies and lead to " major unrest " in his country , @entity34 said in the speech
the @entity9 @entity59 is considering a bill to allow the @entity9 to retaliate against @entity5 's handling of its currency
@entity62 , @entity3 's special assistant and senior director for @entity65 affairs , said the president noted to @entity34 in their meeting last week " that there had not been much movement since " @entity5 said in june that it would implement a more liberal currency policy
@entity3 told @entity34 that the @entity5 inaction " had consequences for the global economy and the @entity9 economy , " according to @entity62
@entity3 said the @entity9 " looked for a more rapid and significant revaluation in coming months , " @entity62 said
@entity62 declined to characterize @entity34 's response to @entity3 , saying only that @entity34 " did reiterate @entity5 intention to continue with reform to their exchange system
" in remarks to reporters , @entity3 and @entity34 emphasized cooperation between their governments and the need for frank discussions on their differences
" obviously , we continue to have more work to do , " @entity3 said
" on the economic front , although the world economy is now growing again , i think it 's going to be very important for us to have frank discussions and continue to do more work cooperatively in order to achieve the type of balance and sustained economic growth that is so important and that we both signed up for in the context of the @entity102 framework
" @entity3 praised @entity34 for " extraordinary openness and cooperation with us as we try to strengthen the relationship between our two countries , a relationship that is based on cooperation , on mutual interest , on mutual respect
" @entity34 noted that " common interests far outweigh our differences " and that despite " disagreements of one kind or another between our two countries , the differences can be resolved
" @entity2 's @entity115 contributed to this story .
