in his final moments , 8 - year - old @entity1 managed to rescue six people -- including two younger children -- from a burning mobile home in @entity6 , authorities said
a last - ditch effort , however , to save his disabled grandfather cost the boy his life
his body was found next to his grandfather , whom @entity1 considered a best friend
" it makes me really proud , it really does , but i just want him back , " @entity1 's mother , @entity14 , told @entity16 affiliate @entity15
@entity1 , an @entity18 resident , was staying at the home of relatives in the nearby town of @entity22 on sunday night when he noticed a fire in the single - wide trailer , said @entity22 fire chief @entity25
as firefighters and sheriff 's deputies responded to 4:45 a.m. emergency call , @entity1 was able to wake six other people in the small trailer , including two more children , ages 4 and 6 , the fire chief said
then @entity1 went back into the blaze to help his grandfather , who was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own , @entity25 said
" by that time , the fire had traveled to the back of the trailer , " said @entity25
" unfortunately they both succumbed to heat and smoke
" the pair were found together on a bed in the back room
it appeared that the boy was trying to lift his grandfather from the bed when he was overcome by the smoke and fire , the fire chief said
@entity1 and his grandfather were like best friends , @entity14 said
an online fundraising campaign on @entity54 had raised more than $ 28,000 as of wednesday for @entity1 's funeral and his family
another relative was found dead in a front room , although his exact relation to @entity1 was not clear
earlier , fire officials had released a mistaken version of the incident , where the grandfather 's and uncle 's locations were switched , due to incorrect information provided by a family member
@entity1 's mother said the boy broke away from his aunt outside the burning trailer and ran back inside to try to save his grandfather
" all i could think about is how he could n't breathe , " @entity14 told @entity15
she added : " i 'm just so grateful that he went with people that he loved
he did n't go alone
" the cause of the blaze is still under investigation but believed to be accidental
the conditions of the six survivors were not immediately available
@entity25 said the trailer had no working smoke detector
he said that with so many people in one small mobile home , one alarm could have easily woken everyone in time to escape
there was at least one space heater inside the trailer , the fire chief said
several pets -- including dogs , cats , a rabbit and hamsters -- also died in the fire , @entity25 said
the @entity95 -- a volunteer unit -- intends to create a public service initiative to spread awareness and get smoke detectors out to the public , he said
meanwhile , @entity101 , interim superintendent of the @entity102 , where @entity1 attended fourth grade , issued a statement : " in bravely and selflessly giving his own life , he was able to save the lives of six others -- and he truly is a hero
