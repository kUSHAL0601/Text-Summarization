-- the last time @entity3 played a superhero , the world cried
the year was 2003 , and the movie was " @entity6 " -- a @entity7 fail that even @entity3 has insinuated he 'd rather forget
so is it any wonder that within hours of @entity12 announcing the actor was going to play @entity13 in the upcoming " @entity15 " sequel , @entity9 immediately tried to recast the part using the hashtag # @entity18
( suggestions have included " the drunken hobo who lives under the overpass , " the dog from " @entity24 " and " @entity26 's girlfriend
" ) but in the eyes of some critics , the 41 - year - old @entity28 winner may not be such a bad choice
let 's not forget that @entity3 has turned a career corner since his " annus horribilis " -- the year that sparked " @entity6 " and that other movie that had film fans writing him off , " @entity37
" he recovered from that valley slowly but surely , and went on to direct and star in standouts like 2010 's " @entity43 " and 2012 's " @entity44 , " the latter of which won an @entity28 for best picture
from actor to auteur : @entity3 's career trajectory knowing that , @entity49 thinks " we owe @entity3 the benefit of the doubt " given that " the guy has made quite the comeback lately
" and there 's also the possibility that he 's learned from his mistakes with " @entity6 " -- the faults of which , notes @entity60 , do n't rest completely on @entity3 's shoulders
now that he 's an older , more seasoned actor who 's shown himself to be a wizard in the director 's chair , maybe " @entity66 " director @entity67 's assessment is n't so far off : " @entity3 provides an interesting counter-balance to @entity71 ( @entity72 ) 's @entity73 , " @entity67 said in a statement
" he has the acting chops to create a layered portrayal of a man who is older and wiser than @entity77 and bears the scars of a seasoned crime fighter , but retain the charm that the world sees in billionaire @entity13
" if anything , says the @entity83 , @entity3 is " too perfect for the role
" " he has it all , " says @entity83 's @entity85
" the shoulder - heavy jock 's physique , the chiseled facial features set to brood , the experience playing a tough but haunted leading character
it 's yet another example of competent and professional , if uninspired , @entity13 casting
... ( it 's ) better than @entity7 forcing another nondescript young hunk on us
" @entity98 disagrees with those who call the decision ho - hum , arguing that " @entity3 as @entity13 in ' @entity66 ' is actually some pretty exciting casting news
... ( a ) fter more than a year of rumors and speculation that he would be directing their @entity108 ensemble ( movie ) and / or possibly playing the @entity13 in it , this seems to be an equally interesting announcement
" @entity3 as @entity13 ? ' no , nyet , never ! ' from the perspective of the studio , @entity12 ( which shares a parent company with @entity0 ) , @entity3 's casting is " a major win , " the wrap says
the move not only shows that the now - back - on - top star " still has faith in the studio , " but it also paves the way " for several potential superhero collaborations
" that idea is probably making several @entity13 fans cringe as they hurry to sign a petition begging @entity12 to drop @entity3 from the role
but maybe , just maybe , @entity3 wo n't be as horrible as everyone is anticipating
after all , he 's proven us wrong before .
