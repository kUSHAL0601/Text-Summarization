-- a cancer treatment that comes in a pill is as effective as the standard chemotherapy for lung patients who had previously been treated for their cancer , according to a study released thursday
the intravenous chemotherapy treatment had more severe side effects than the pill in this study
results of a large clinical trial were published in the @entity14 medical journal @entity15
the trial was designed to compare @entity17 , a daily pill , to @entity19 , an iv - chemotherapy drug that 's administered every three weeks
this international study included more than 1,400 patients for whom standard chemotherapy had been ineffective
" @entity17 and @entity19 have same survival outcomes , " according to dr. @entity25 , lead author of the study and assistant professor in @entity29 's @entity28 in @entity30 , @entity31
the study was paid for by the maker of @entity17 , @entity34
@entity25 says the @entity35 mandated that the pharmaceutical company conduct this clinical trial
in the study , patients taking @entity17 had an average survival of 7.6 months , and 32 percent survived one year , compared with patients getting the chemotherapy drug @entity19
their survival was an average of eight months ; 34 percent of patients survived one year
@entity25 says this is the largest study in lung cancer comparing an oral therapy with chemotherapy
dr. @entity50 , a lung cancer specialist at the @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 , who was not involved in this research , says , " this study did what it intended to do in showing equivalency
i ca n't imagine any clearer evidence
" one significant difference between the two drugs is in side effects
patients taking @entity17 mainly experienced skin rashes and / or mild diarrhea
patients on @entity19 had many more severe side effects , including hair loss , numbness in hands and feet , severe diarrhea , a drop in blood cells and nausea
given the difference , " the single pill trumps chemotherapy , " said dr. @entity77 , who heads the @entity78 and also was not involved in the clinical trial
@entity50 says that 5 to 10 percent of patients taking @entity19 will drop out every three weeks because of side effects
@entity25 points out that if the two treatments have the same survival benefit but one has fewer side effects and is easier to take , doctors want their patients to have the option for this treatment
currently , no new lung cancer patients can get @entity17 , because doctors are no longer allowed to prescribe it
in 2003 , @entity17 got fast - track @entity35 approval as a treatment for patients with non-small - cell lung cancer , specifically for patients in whom standard chemotherapy had failed
the approval was based on two small @entity102 clinical trials that showed @entity17 was able to shrink tumors by about 10 percent , which led the @entity35 to believe that the drug would lead to a " positive effect on survival or benefits
" more on @entity17 from the @entity35 when the @entity35 gives a drug accelerated approval , it requires that the manufacturer continue testing it to determine whether there 's a clinical benefit to the patient
if further studies ca n't show this type of benefit , the @entity35 has the power to withdraw that drug from the market
but a year later , results were revealed from a larger , phase iii clinical trial that compared @entity17 with placebo in patients for whom chemotherapy was ineffective
" @entity17 was better but not statistically significant , " said @entity77 , who also directs the @entity127
given this information and because another lung cancer pill -- tarceva -- had shown a survival benefit , the @entity35 decided that " it is not reasonable to start new patients on @entity17
" since 2005 , the @entity35 allows only those already getting @entity17 prescribed or those enrolled in clinical trials that were under way at the time to continue taking @entity17
all three lung cancer experts @entity0 spoke with regularly see patients and have treated them with @entity17 or the other available lung cancer drugs
@entity142 said they could n't predict whether the @entity35 would allow new patients to be treated with @entity17 based on this and other recent studies
@entity25 believes that based on this data , @entity17 " is a valid treatment option for patients with pretreated non-small lung cancer
" both @entity77 and @entity50 say that more choices in treatment will always benefit the patients .
