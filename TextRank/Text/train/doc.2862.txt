@entity0 -- it 's a maze out there
a complicated , fragmented hodgepodge of laws in each state that dictate the lives of gays , lesbians and transgender
living in @entity12 and are one - half of a same - sex marriage ? you can visit your partner in the hospital
but if your partner got sick across the border in @entity19 , sorry -- unless you are a recipient of @entity20 or @entity21 , then you have visitation rights because of a federal government law passed in 2011
a lesbian living in @entity25 has no protection against discrimination in the workplace based on her sexual orientation
but if she gets a job in neighboring @entity31 , she does
a @entity33 same - sex couple has the ability to adopt a child , but if that couple moves to @entity38 , the law is not clear and adoption becomes a lot less guaranteed
" we are living in this era of two @entity45 where @entity47 people living in certain states and certain areas have much greater access to basic rights and marriage , " @entity41 , the state legislative director at the @entity42 , said
chess game for the @entity47 community , it 's a game of chess with 51 players on the move ( 50 states plus the @entity0 )
my same - sex parents , a proud secret as for now , the state of play is looking up for @entity47 advocates
in the last week alone , federal judges in @entity66 and @entity38 ruled that their states ' bans on same - sex marriage are unconstitutional
the rulings come on the heels of judges in conservative states of @entity74 and @entity75 who ruled that marriage bans are unconstitutional
@entity78 announced that it will no longer defend its ban on same - sex marriage
and lgbt rights groups are pleased that the @entity81 amended its proposal for a ban on same - sex marriage because it buys them more time
the earliest it can be on the ballot for public approval is 2016
last week in @entity94 , in what would have been one of the most draconian measures facing same - sex couples in recent years , the state @entity81 decided to forego voting on a measure that would permit businesses to discriminate against same - sex couples
after the @entity99 passed the bill that is said to protect religious freedom , the @entity81 realized it is too toxic to touch
it does n't mean that advocates are only moving forward
@entity41 said they are watching a series of bills in state legislatures that limit lgbt rights in terms of relationships and the workplace
one step forward , two steps back but for @entity47 advocates , it 's more like two steps forward , one step back
@entity0 has also added to the onslaught
attorney general @entity119 earlier this month announced that the federal government will expand the recognition of same - sex marriages in federal legal matters , including bankruptcies , prison visits and survivor benefits
actress @entity127 : " i am gay " analysts expect the @entity129 to rule on the issue soon , especially as the four previously mentioned states ' decisions are now in the pipeline , adding to the pile of same - sex marriage related case load
while the federal government has made a lot of changes in recent years , including repealing the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and president @entity145 's publicized support of same - sex marriage , advocates are n't only seeing victory
' unsustainable ' the @entity146 is sitting on a federal version of the @entity148 , known as @entity148 , which would issue federal employee protections for sexual orientation and gender identity
and @entity145 has n't addressed the " low - hanging fruit , " including signing an executive order banning workplace discrimination of gay , lesbian and transgender federal contractors
public opinion is moving more quickly than judges and elected officials
according to a national @entity163 poll from september , 56 % of @entity161 support marriage for same - sex couples , compared with only 25 % who supported it in 1996
a @entity1 poll in 2010 was the first one that suggested that a majority of respondents backed it
same - sex marriage a dying political issue @entity176 strategist @entity175 said recently on @entity1 's " @entity177 " that opinions on same - sex marriage represent the " most rapid social change that we 've seen in our lifetime
" as for the patchwork of state laws , @entity42 's @entity41 said it 's " unsustainable in the long run
she said the issue is " unfinished business
" same sex marriage fast facts
