@entity0 , @entity1 -- a bat that apparently had trouble flying instead tried to hitch a ride on the space shuttle @entity8 , @entity4 officials said
the free tail bat was last seen clinging to the space shuttle @entity8 's external fuel tank just before launch
the animal was last seen clinging on the foam of the external tank of the space shuttle moments before the @entity8 launched , officials said
@entity4 officials had hoped the bat would fly away on its own , but admitted the bat probably died quickly during @entity8 's climb into orbit
@entity8 's seven - member crew , which lifted off from @entity0 on sunday , is on a 14 - day mission to deliver supplies needed to expand the @entity23
@entity4 officials noticed the bat before shuttle 's liftoff and brought in a wildlife expert to look at video images of it
the expert said it appeared to be a free - tailed bat that probably had a broken left wing and an injured right shoulder or wrist
the launch pads at the space center are near the @entity38 , so @entity4 has sirens to scare away animals that get near the shuttles
the bat is n't the first to try hitching a ride into space
@entity4 officials said they noticed one of the creatures on a tank of a shuttle in 1998
that bat flew away as the shuttle 's massive engines ignited
the crew of the @entity8 safely docked at the @entity23 on tuesday
it was unclear whether its stowaway was still clinging to the shuttle .
