@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 detainee said he was kicked and punched while his hands were tied behind his back in a recording played tuesday in the trial of a @entity9 accused of assaulting the detainee
petty officer 2nd class @entity11 has pleaded not guilty to punching @entity13 in the stomach , dereliction of duty and lying to investigators
wearing @entity9 dress whites , @entity11 spoke his first words -- " yes , @entity19 " -- when greeted by the military judge , navy capt. @entity20
the prosecution and defense teams presented opening statements tuesday after @entity20 seated a military jury of four @entity9 officers and three enlisted personnel
" it 's a story you do n't want to hear , " said @entity9 lt. commander @entity27 , the prosecutor
" and as the evidence unfolds , it becomes a story you just have to believe
" @entity11 stared straight ahead as @entity27 told the jury that @entity11 failed to live up to @entity9 standards when he struck a detainee in the abdomen and walked away while the prisoner lay on the floor bleeding
" by the way , the entire time , the detainee had his hands tied behind his back , " @entity27 said , urging the jury to muster the " moral courage " to convict @entity11
" it 's about doing the right thing , and holding the accused accountable , " he said
@entity11 's civilian defense attorney , @entity46 , a retired @entity47 lieutenant colonel , said in his opening statement that @entity11 was doing his job
" the @entity9 did what they were trained to do , " he said to the jury " they were serving an @entity4 arrest warrant
" @entity46 said the evidence will show that the detainee 's mouth injury started as a canker sore and that the bleeding was self - inflicted -- not induced by @entity11
" not only [ will ] you not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt , but you will believe he is innocent , because he is innocent , " said @entity46
@entity11 is the last of three seals accused of abusing @entity13 , who was arrested in @entity4 and charged with masterminding the 2004 slayings of four @entity65 contractors in @entity66
the killings were widely covered by news organizations when the burned bodies of two contractors were paraded through @entity72 's streets and hanged from a bridge as their captors cheered
in the recording of his three - hour deposition , @entity13 denied involvement with @entity78 or @entity79 and said that @entity65 and @entity4 forces raided his home and took him to a @entity65 base , where he was attacked for five minutes
@entity13 said he was standing with his hands tied behind his back when he was hit in the stomach
he described falling down from the force of the punch , hitting his face on the floor
he said he felt " pain in my face " and later tasted blood in his mouth
while on the floor , @entity13 described being kicked several times with a boot - covered foot in his shoulder and back
he said that although blindfolded , once he fell on the floor he was able see enough from beneath his eye - cover to determine that his attacker was bare - legged and wearing shorts
he did not identify @entity11 as his assailant
the two other seals in the case were acquitted in april in @entity4 on charges of dereliction of duty and impeding an investigation
@entity11 is the only one charged with abusing the detainee .
