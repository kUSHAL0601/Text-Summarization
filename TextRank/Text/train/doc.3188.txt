@entity10 president @entity9 , left , walks with pope @entity1 at the airport in @entity12 , tuesday
he landed in @entity10 , the first stop on a trip that will also take him to @entity16
@entity5 has been hit harder by @entity17 and @entity18 than any other region of the world , according to the @entity21 and @entity22
there has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it
the pontiff reiterated the @entity3 's policy on condom use as he flew from @entity35 to @entity12 , the capital of @entity10 , @entity0 @entity3 analyst @entity36 said
pope @entity1 has always made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional @entity40 teaching on artificial contraception -- a " clear moral prohibition " -- @entity36 said
but his remarks tuesday were among the first times he stated the policy explicitly since he became pope nearly four years ago
he has , however , assembled a panel of scientists and theologians to consider the narrow question of whether to allow condoms for married couples , one of whom has @entity18 , the virus that causes @entity17
it is still not clear how the pope will rule on the matter , said @entity36 , who is also a senior correspondent for the @entity58
the @entity59 has long been on the front line of @entity18 care , he said , adding that it is probably the largest private provider of @entity18 care in the world
more than 22 million people in @entity5 are infected with @entity18 , according to a 2008 @entity68 / @entity22 report
nine out of 10 children with @entity18 in the world live in the region , which has 11.4 million orphans because of @entity17 , the report said , and 1.5 million people there died of the disease in 2007 .
