@entity0 -- in a rare , joint news conference with the global news media inside the heart of @entity0 , @entity3 president @entity2 and @entity5 president @entity4 pledged cooperation on a range of common interests as they concluded an unusually colorful economic summit
asked about anti-american rhetoric in @entity5 state - run media which accused the @entity3 of backing recent democracy protests in @entity17 , @entity2 brushed off the criticism as " part of being a public official
" " the @entity3 had no involvement in fostering the protests that took place there , " @entity2 insisted
@entity4 appeared to grimace when asked by @entity26 reporter @entity25 about international press access in @entity5 and whether he viewed @entity2 's " pivot " to @entity28 as an authentic component of @entity3 foreign policy
in a sign of clear annoyance with the setting , @entity4 initially did not answer the question and moved to hear instead from a @entity5 reporter
in response , @entity4 appeared at times to read a prepared statement
@entity3 , @entity5 reach historic climate change deal " we do n't see eye to eye on every issue
both sides should respect each other 's core interests , " @entity4 said , adding the two nations should manage their differences respectfully
@entity4 , however , went on to take note of international criticism of @entity5 's human rights record
" @entity5 has made enormous progress in its human rights
that is a fact , " @entity4 said , conceding that his nation 's work in that area is not " mission accomplished
" before finishing his remarks , @entity4 responded to @entity25 's question , accusing the @entity26 of causing its own access problems in @entity5
@entity2 added he had an opportunity to stress to @entity4 that the @entity28 " pivot " is not an attempt to challenge @entity5 's leadership in the region
@entity4 and @entity2 fielded only two questions , one from @entity25 , the other from a reporter representing @entity5 's state - controlled news media
still , the news conference was the culmination of weeks of intense negotiations between high - level @entity74 and @entity5 officials who initially balked at the idea
@entity3 officials were confident the press event marked one of the only known occasions in which a @entity5 leader had taken an unscripted question from an @entity3 journalist in @entity5
@entity3 - @entity5 relations : can teens succeed where presidents have failed ? following five hours of discussions that included a close circle of @entity5 and @entity3 officials tuesday night , the two leaders also announced a new climate agreement that would cut @entity3 greenhouse gas emissions by nearly one - third from 2005 levels by 2025
@entity5 would peak its carbon emissions no later than 2030 and increase the use of nonfossil fuels to 20 % also by 2030
" this is an ambitious goal , but it is an achievable goal , " @entity2 said about the climate deal
" @entity5 is ready to work with the @entity3 to make progress in a number of priority areas , " @entity4 added
the @entity2 administration is confident it can avoid any potential stumbling blocks for the climate agreement next year when republicans take control of the @entity110
" @entity114 may try to stop us , but we believe that with control of @entity114 changing hands we can proceed with the authority we already have , " a senior administration official said on a conference call with reporters
@entity2 arrived in @entity0 for the @entity119 still wounded politically by his party 's stinging defeat in last week 's congressional midterm elections
but the @entity3 president managed to string together a slew of modest trade and diplomatic agreements with @entity0 that will loosen visa restrictions for @entity5 travelers and cut tariffs on high - tech @entity3 products
@entity5 maximized its position as @entity119 summit host , staging an @entity137 - caliber dinner spectacular complete with fireworks
@entity2 drew howls in the @entity5 media when he was seen chewing gum as he entered monday night 's festivities
@entity144 president @entity143 earned a few cringes of his own when he placed a shawl around the shoulders of @entity5 's first lady in an apparent act of chivalry
she promptly removed the garment , creating such a stir the incident was removed from @entity5 's state - run news outlets
@entity5 censors attempted to further block coverage of the story by blacking out a portion of a @entity1 segment on the incident on the network 's " @entity164 " program
@entity2 is scheduled to attend a state banquet with his @entity5 counterpart before departing for @entity167 for a gathering of leaders at this week 's @entity171 summit
the president 's visit is also designed to check on @entity167 's efforts to expand democratic reforms in the @entity177 nation
24 hours with president @entity2 in @entity5
