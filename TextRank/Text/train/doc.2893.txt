it 's astounding how fast the words of a 22 - year - old woman , her life suddenly cut short , have spread across the @entity5 and into the hearts and minds of people all over the world
@entity10 , a budding writer , was once published by the @entity11 and had a job lined up at the @entity13
also a playwright , she had a musical slated for a staging in august at the @entity17
she wrote a moving essay in the @entity19 to inspire her fellow seniors as they graduated last week
she died in a car crash a few days later
that column , in which she strives to remind her peers that " we have so much time , " has taken on a tragic , powerful resonance
discussing the " immense and indefinable potential energy " many felt as freshmen , she wrote that it 's important to remember " we can still do anything
we can change our minds
... we 're so young
we ca n't , we must not lose this sense of possibility because in the end , it 's all we have
" the loss of @entity37 is heartbreaking for many reasons
one of them is that she surely would have been among the too few people in the world who chase their dreams and bring them to fruition
i know what it is to feel the " sense of possibility " she described
i felt it when i was at @entity19 in the ' 90s
since then , i 've lived by it
i 've also had time to see what distinguishes those who chase dreams from those who give up
two friends of mine , fellow @entity56 who graduated in different years and do n't know each other , told me that in the years after college , they felt " betrayed " by some friends who had wonderful plans for the future and swiftly gave up on them
people who did n't harness their creativity to carve new paths
people who became focused on making more and more money and little else , who never took chances , because they got too busy , more interested in wealth or stature than doing something amazing , or just forgot about those dreams
in each case , i asked my friend how that amounted to betrayal
and each gave me the same answer : the plans we had for the future were n't just plans or hopes
we would take the education and incredible opportunities we had been given and go out and fight for a better world in new ways
it 's what @entity37 touched on in her last line to her class : " we 're in this together , 2012
let 's make something happen to this world
" as i 've written before , the world needs more visionaries
from electricity to vaccines to @entity105 , everything humanity has created that improves our lives exists because dreamers pursued their visions
it 's not easy , and it can become harder as you grow up and have families dependent on you
life exhausts and distracts you into shelving aspirations
making them happen is hard work
but it 's incomparably rewarding
there is every reason to believe that @entity37 would have fought for hers
it 's clear in her writing
written from the perspective of a young woman at the dawn of her adult life , her words are a stunning bookend to something @entity131 wrote about in october in the @entity11 : a collection of short autobiographies that members of the @entity19 class of 1942 wrote for their 50th reunion
people who " passively let their lives happen to them " lamented " how boring they must seem , " while others " regret the risk not taken , " @entity131 wrote
" the most exciting essays were written by the energetic , restless people , who took their lives off in new directions midcourse
" anyone with an unfulfilled dream would do well to keep that in mind -- and should read @entity37 's column , because it applies to them as well
the essays by people who " felt summoned to do one thing , " @entity131 added , " ring with passion and conviction
" that 's about instincts , which are ultimately the key to chasing dreams and the biggest driver for those of us who do n't give up
we let ourselves tune out everything else and listen to what our instincts are telling us we have to do
that 's why nothing can stop us
it 's easy to imagine that nothing would have stopped @entity37
her death is also a reminder of a daily tragedy
while @entity180 fatalities in car crashes are decreasing , far too many families and friends know the pain of such loss
@entity37 , above all else , valued family and friends
in this , she seemed wise beyond her years
i was -- like many other ambitious young people -- so focused on career goals , it took me years to gain the perspective she had and live by the knowledge that the loved ones you surround yourself with are by far the most important thing in life
" we do n't have a word for the opposite of loneliness , but if we did , i could say that 's what i want in life , " she wrote
@entity19 graduates from 70 years before her say the same
" for almost all , family and friends mattered most , " @entity131 wrote
@entity37 's words give us all reason to remember the world of possibilities before us and to make sure we 're valuing time with loved ones
in her death , she just may be inspiring people to live better , deeper , more exciting lives -- with " passion and conviction
" and that 's unforgettable .
