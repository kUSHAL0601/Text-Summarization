-- the @entity1 said wednesday it will apologize to veterans who were mistakenly told they 'd been diagnosed with a fatal neurological condition
@entity4 said went into a " meltdown " when he got a letter from the @entity1 saying , erroneously , that he had @entity7
letters were sent august 13 to 1,864 veterans and survivors , the @entity1 said in a written statement
they were supposed to be sent to veterans with @entity7 -- also known as @entity15 's disease -- to keep them apprised of expanding benefits eligibility
" according to the records of the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , you have a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( @entity7 ) , " said the letter , according to the @entity18
" this letter tells you about @entity1 disability compensation benefits that may be available to you
" but some who received the letters , like @entity4 , do not have @entity7
@entity4 , a disabled @entity27 veteran from the first @entity28 , told @entity0 that when he received the letter , he was " just completely beside myself
went into a complete and total meltdown
i could n't speak , could n't -- i guess i was , truthfully , speechless
" the @entity1 said issued a statement saying it made " a coding error , and a number of veterans who should not have received this letter did
" an estimated one - third of the letters -- more than 600 -- were sent erroneously , a department official familiar with the program told @entity0
after hearing from veterans who received the letter but do not have @entity7 , the @entity1 immediately began reviewing individual claims files for all the recipients to determine who received the letter by mistake , agency spokeswoman @entity40 said in the statement
" va employees are personally contacting these individuals to ensure they understand the letter should not be confused with a medical diagnosis of @entity7 , explain why they mistakenly received the letter and express @entity1 's sincere apologies for the distress caused by this unfortunate and regrettable error
" " it 's not right for it to happen this way , " @entity4 said
" regardless if it was the case that i was diagnosed with @entity7 , that would be the worst possible way for an organization to let an individual know
" upon receiving the letter , some veterans sought a second opinion outside the @entity1 , according to veterans ' service organizations , paying for doctors ' consultations out of their own pockets
the @entity1 said it will reimburse those veterans for the costs
in addition , the @entity1 said it is reviewing its notification process to make sure a similar error does n't happen again
the @entity78 service organization is " encouraged " by the @entity1 's response to the situation , and pleased to see they caught the error , said spokesman @entity83
@entity0 's @entity84 contributed to this report .
