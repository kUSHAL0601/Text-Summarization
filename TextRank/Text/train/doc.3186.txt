-- last week , i joined the board of a new organization to oppose marijuana legalization : smart approaches to @entity6
the group is headed by former @entity9 rep. @entity8 and includes @entity10 , a veteran of the @entity11 under president @entity12
the new group rejects the " war on drugs " model
it agrees that we do n't want to lock people up for casual marijuana use -- or even stigmatize them with an arrest record
but what we do want to do is send a clear message : marijuana use is a bad choice
there are many excellent reasons to avoid marijuana
marijuana use damages brain development in young people
heavy users become socially isolated and perform worse in school and at work
marijuana smoke harms the lungs
a growing body of evidence suggests that marijuana can trigger psychotic symptoms that otherwise would have remained latent
it 's possible to imagine a marijuana rule that tries to respond precisely to such risk factors as happen to be known by the current state of science
such a rule might say : " you should n't use marijuana until you are over 25 , or after your brain has ceased to develop , whichever comes first
you should n't use marijuana if you are predisposed to certain mental illnesses ( most of which we ca n't yet diagnose in advance )
be aware that about one - sixth of users will become chronically dependent on marijuana , and as a result will suffer a serious degradation of life outcomes
as yet , we have no sure idea at what dosage marijuana will impair your ability to drive safely , or how long the impairment will last
be as careful as you can , within the limits of our present knowledge ! " yet as a parent of three , two exiting adolescence and one entering , i 've found that the argument that makes the biggest impression is : " marijuana is illegal
" i think many other parents have found the same thing
when we write social rules , we always need to consider : who are we writing rules for ? some people can cope with complexity
some people will snap back from an early mistake
" just say no " is an easy rule to follow
" it depends on individual risk factors , many of them unknowable in advance " -- that rule is not so easy
@entity92 : @entity93 a trillion - dollar failure over the past three decades , and in area after area of social life , @entity9 have replaced simple rules that anybody can follow with complex rules that baffle large numbers of people
consider , for example , the home mortgage
once the mortgage was a very simple product
put 20 % down , then sign up for a fixed schedule of payments over the next 30 years
in the space of a single generation , these 30 - year fixed - rate amortizing mortgages turned what had been a nation of renters into a nation of homeowners
for more sophisticated buyers , however , the standard mortgage was a big nuisance
for them , bankers developed more flexible products : no money down , no documentation , interest - only , adjustable rate
these products met genuine needs
but as they diffused down - market , they became traps for people who did not understand the risks they were accepting
consider how we finance higher education
once , state governments subsidized their universities to offer a low tuition fee to all comers
fee increases at private universities were constrained by the lower fees at the public institutions : @entity143 can raise its price only so high above the @entity145
the universities soon realized , however , that by setting their tuition fees low , they were forgoing revenues that might be collected from the most affluent students
universities rapidly raised their tuition fees , then offered discounts and aid to students in need
@entity10 : legalize pot ? no , reform laws but while anybody could understand a $ 500 per semester tuition bill , the new system of rebates confuses the very people who most need help
a few days before @entity166 , @entity164 of the @entity165 reported a depressing example of the toll modern financial aid exacts upon students from less sophisticated backgrounds
he told the story of three bright girls from poor families who had recently tried -- and failed -- to gain college degrees
one of them was admitted to @entity176 , a prestigious school with a full - ticket price of $ 50,000 , but one that grants very generous financial aid -- if the student can figure out how to make the financial aid work for her
the trouble was that students who most need aid are often precisely those who have nobody around them who has ever successfully navigated a complicated bureaucratic institution like a university financial aid office
" though @entity176 sent weekly e-mails -- 17 of them , along with an invitation to a program for minority students -- they went to a school account she had not learned to check , " @entity164 wrote
" @entity194 reported that her mother made $ 35,000 a year and paid about half of that in rent
with her housing costs so high , @entity176 assumed the family had extra money and assigned ... an income of $ 51,000
... ( @entity204 ) discovered what had happened only recently
" unable to cope with the school 's e-mail system or to decrypt its rules for imputing family income , @entity204 finally dropped out of @entity176 , burdened by $ 61,000 in student debt
in 1943 , vice president @entity211 published a book celebrating the coming " century of the common man
" that century did not last very long
we have transitioned instead into the era of the clever man and clever woman
we have revised our institutions , our programs , our rules in ways that offer profitable new chances to those with cultural know - how -- and that inflict disastrous consequences on those who are overwhelmed by a world of ever - more - abundant and ever - more - risky choices
opinion : the end of the war on marijuana we 're not going to uninvent the no - money - down loan
universities that receive applications from all over the planet can not finance themselves like an old - fashioned state land - grant college
but we need to recognize that modern life is becoming steadily more dangerous for people prone to make bad choices
at a time when they need more help than ever to climb the ladder , marijuana legalization kicks them back down the ladder
the goal of public policy should not be to punish vulnerable kids for making life - wrecking mistakes
the goal of public policy should be to protect ( to the extent we can ) the vulnerable from making life - wrecking mistakes in the first place
there 's a trade - off , yes , and it takes the form of denying less vulnerable people easy access to a pleasure they believe they can safely use
but they are likely deluding themselves about how well they are managing their drug use
and even if they are not deluded -- if they really are so capable and effective -- then surely they can see that society has already been massively re-engineered for their benefit already
surely , enough is enough ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity277 .
