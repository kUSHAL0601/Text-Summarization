@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 will never be the same after being shot through the head little more than two years ago
yet one thing has n't changed , ironically , is her appreciation for guns
for the former congresswoman who is now at the center of the debate over gun control and background checks , target practice is still a form of entertainment
in the back yard of her mother @entity18 's house , located deep in the @entity1 desert , @entity3 ' husband , @entity16 , uses planting pots and water bottles as targets
@entity3 watches from the patio above with her mother , cheering him on
" excellent ! " exclaims @entity3
" excellent ! " repeats her mother
and @entity16 is n't shooting with just any kind of gun
it 's a 9mm @entity29 , the same kind @entity28 used to shoot @entity3 while she greeted constituents in front of an @entity1 supermarket
" in that case it had a magazine that held 33 rounds , " said @entity16
" he shot 33 rounds
every round hit somebody , we think
" this gun belongs to @entity3
it was a gift from her husband several years ago , before she was shot
" well , @entity3 used to like shooting a gun , too , " @entity16 said when asked how recreation for him can still be shooting a gun after his wife was shot though the head
" yes , " @entity3 adds
" she did n't want to get rid of it , " said @entity16
@entity3 and @entity16 : the new ' @entity50 ' of gun control nevertheless , allowing @entity2 's cameras to exclusively capture @entity16 shooting a gun with @entity3 looking on is meant to help advance their political cause : curbing gun violence
they hope to show that @entity3 and @entity16 are legitimate gun owners and credible messengers for tightening gun restrictions
the speed of background checks @entity16 also showed off a gun he recently bought -- videotaping the transaction -- for the sole purpose of demonstrating how easy it is to get a background check , and why he and @entity3 want the checks expanded to private sales such as gun shows
" when we timed it , it took 5 minutes and 36 seconds , not a lot of time
you could do the same thing at the gun show where people are currently not subject to background checks in most states , " said @entity16
' stronger , better , tougher ' : @entity3 improves , but she 'll never be the same @entity3 and @entity16 formed their organization -- @entity84 -- in january , the second anniversary of the shooting that left @entity3 partially paralyzed and robbed the once - articulate politician of her gift of speech
" optimistic ! " @entity3 exclaimed
but a clear answer she gave to describe how she sees the odds for gun restrictions to pass
" i am , too , " said @entity16
" especially when we 're talking about universal background checks
" @entity96 the @entity96 in @entity97 last december spurred them to take a stand
the brain damage from her own gunshot wound makes it difficult for her to find words , even " @entity96
" " @entity108 , " said @entity3 several times , before finally getting the word right by repeating her husband
" @entity96 , " said @entity16
" hook , " @entity3 finally said
you know , it 's something we just ca n't -- you know , 20 -- 20 first graders , " @entity16 said , as @entity3 chimed in
" first graders died ... awful
" being politically realistic following recent mass shootings , the couple originally called for a ban on assault weapons and limits to high - capacity magazines
this year , @entity3 made a dramatic plea to senators , asking them to be " bold " and " courageous
" but the couple admits there are limits on what is politically realistic
" background checks , " said @entity3 , when asked to name the single most important move @entity129 could make right now
reid to force a vote thursday on debating gun proposals @entity3 has learned to navigate an @entity133 for e-mail with her left hand , because her right hand is paralyzed
but most of her communicating with former colleagues -- pressing them for new gun laws -- goes through @entity16 , and most of it is on the phone from their home in @entity1
@entity16 notes that when they visited congressional offices in february , she did n't have to say much to make her point
" when @entity3 sits in their office and tells them how important a universal background check bill is , they -- they hear that
and she 's a former colleague
she was doing her job , you know , like they do every single day , when she was nearly killed , " said @entity16
representing a ' red ' district when @entity3 was in @entity129 -- she represented her largely @entity158 @entity1 district on the @entity160 border -- filled with voters who expected her to defend their gun rights
she pushed to overturn a gun ban in the @entity164 , and voted to allow guns in national parks
exclusive : @entity3 still appreciates gun culture a conservative @entity169 herself , she knows first - hand how politically hard it is for her former colleagues to support gun restrictions
" yes , it 's tough , " said @entity3
a big part of what @entity84 is trying to do is raise enough money and gain enough influence to be a counterweight to the powerful @entity180
when they press senators to support background checks , they tell them they will spend money in their states to back them up and support them
they said their money -- their organization is a super pac that can raise unlimited funds -- is coming both from small donors on the @entity192 and large wealthy donors who are writing big checks
stopping ' a bad guy with a gun ' what does @entity3 think of the @entity180 's argument that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun ? " it does n't work
it does n't work ! " she exclaimed
but , realistically , had she not been shot , would the pro-gun congresswoman have been open to voting for stricter gun laws ? " yes
yes , " @entity3 said
@entity209 : gun vote opponents in a ' time warp ' she tried to describe her politics when in @entity129
" @entity214 , " she said
" straight in the middle
" there is no question the gun culture is deeply ingrained in @entity3
she still exposes herself to guns , even after her near fatal shooting
what is it like to hear gunshots go off ? does it startle her ? " no. no , " said @entity3
" i think that 's because @entity3 does n't remember the gunshot going off the day she was injured , right ? you do n't remember that ? " @entity16 asked @entity3
" no , " @entity3 affirmed
since @entity3 is right - handed , and that hand is paralyzed , she is limited in what she can do with her left hand
that has made joining her husband in target practice impossible
would she want to shoot a gun again ? " we 've talked about it
@entity3 has actually held it
( @entity240 ) has n't shot one since she 's been injured , but , a few days ago , she was actually trying to aim with it , with her left hand , " said @entity16
does she want to work towards being able to shoot ? is it a priority ? " not really , " said @entity3
" not at the top of the list
@entity3 is seen as a good spokesperson for new laws to curb gun violence , even though she ca n't speak very well
" it stinks , " @entity3 responds
again , two words which speak volumes
