-- for observers of @entity8 , this week 's meeting in @entity2 between @entity4 president @entity3 and @entity6 president @entity5 was remarkable for how unremarkable it was
@entity5 and @entity3 , both in suits , sat closely at a table as they signed a number of bilateral initiatives on agriculture , trade and security
before last year , the thought of @entity6 and @entity4 cooperating on anything at all seemed remote
relations were so strained between the two countries that the word " war " was on politicians ' lips
@entity3 and @entity5 ' predecessor , @entity26 , volleyed insults back and forth like professional tennis players
the relationship has healed much since then , but analysts say that old wounds remain near the surface
@entity33 had poisoned the relationship between the neighbors -- @entity26 accused @entity4 of creating a haven for guerrillas ; @entity3 accused @entity6 of creating a haven for the @entity40 military
when @entity41 -- @entity26 's hardline defense minister -- was elected president , he was expected to continue his policies , and he has , with one big exception
" when @entity5 was elected , we thought this was it for @entity4 , but after the election , he took some real steps to patch things up , " said @entity46 , a @entity6 expert and senior associate at the @entity48
in august of last year , @entity5 and @entity3 agreed to put the hostilities aside
" starting at zero , " @entity5 called it
" i 'm here to turn the page , " @entity3 said
" one thing they agreed to do was cooperate more on the @entity58 presence in @entity4 and it 's a real debate on what 's actually been done , " @entity46 said , referring to the @entity58 , a guerrilla group
@entity5 has vouched for a @entity4 claim that all @entity58 encampments located in @entity4 have been dismantled , but the true test of cooperation will come now that the @entity58 has a new leader
@entity68 , also known as @entity69 and @entity70 , is the new @entity58 head after its former chief was killed in a military operation last month
@entity6 has specifically named @entity74 as a guerrilla that lives in @entity4
he is believed to cross the border between the two countries freely , @entity46 said
how strongly @entity4 goes after @entity74 could be an indicator of how deep these new ties are
nonetheless , even talk of cooperation is a world away from the atmosphere two years ago
in november 2009 , @entity3 ordered his military to begin preparations for a war with @entity6 , warning of a conspiracy between @entity6 and the @entity40 to attack @entity4
@entity6 called the announcement a " war threat , " and @entity4 retorted by calling @entity6 's response " hypocritical " and " immoral
" eight months later , @entity4 broke off all diplomatic relations with @entity6
so when @entity5 and @entity3 decided to be friends , " most of the region let out a huge sigh of relief because of it , " @entity46 said
but from his perspective , the relationship is " fragile , and it remains fragile , " he said
the friendship between the two leaders also speaks to the pragmatism of each , said @entity103 , president of the @entity104
unlike @entity26 , @entity41 has aspirations to be a regional leader , and cordial relations with @entity4 make it possible for @entity6 to become less isolated from other @entity110 countries , he said
also , by cooperating with @entity3 , there is probably the expectation of more progress against the @entity58 , @entity103 said
and cooperation has shown some rewards in the shape of increased trade , reduced tensions and some high - level captures
during their meeting monday , the leaders announced that @entity4 had captured @entity122 , one of @entity6 's most - wanted drug traffickers
" this shows that if we work together , if our police enforcement work together , we will get better results , " @entity5 said
@entity3 added , " we will do everything we can to stop any attacks from @entity4 soil into @entity6
" there is a sense of pragmatism on both sides , it appears , but mistrust has ruined that before
" the relationship is based on mutual interest , but i do n't think the trust goes very deep on either side , " @entity103 said
other challenges exist as well
@entity3 's health -- he underwent treatment for cancer this year -- has kept the two leaders from meeting often , @entity46 said
their meeting this week was the first in seven months
also , @entity103 points out , @entity3 is unpredictable and @entity6 makes an easy target
" they are very , very close in many areas
that 's made for a complicated relationship , " he said
for now , at least , @entity3 summed up his view like this on monday : " we can be an example of how governments with different views ... ( can ) put those differences aside and put forth a single direction , a single compass
