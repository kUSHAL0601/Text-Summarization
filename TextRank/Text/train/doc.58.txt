did you ever wonder what happens to your old laptop or cellphone when you throw it away ? chances are some of your old electronic junk will end up in @entity7
according to a recent @entity11 report , " @entity7 now appears to be the largest e-waste dumping site in the world
" e-waste , or electronic waste , consists of everything from scrapped tvs , refrigerators and air conditioners to that old desktop computer that may be collecting dust in your closet
many of these gadgets were initially manufactured in @entity7
through a strange twist of global economics , much of this electronic junk returns to @entity7 to die
" according to @entity11 data , about 70 % of electronic waste globally generated ended up in @entity7 , " said @entity27 , a spokesman for the @entity29 office of @entity30
" much of [ the e-waste ] comes through illegal channels because under @entity11 conventions , there is a specific ban on electronic waste being transferred from developed countries like the @entity40 to countries like @entity7 and @entity42
" for the past decade , the southeastern town of @entity44 , nestled in @entity7 's main manufacturing zone , has been a major hub for the disposal of e-waste
hundreds of thousands of people here have become experts at dismantling the world 's electronic junk
on seemingly every street , laborers sit on the pavement outside workshops ripping out the guts of household appliances with hammers and drills
the roads in @entity44 are lined with bundles of plastic , wires , cables and other garbage
different components are separated based on their value and potential for re-sale
on one street sits a pile of green and gold circuit boards
on another , the metal cases of desktop computers
at times , it looks like workers are reaping some giant plastic harvest , especially when women stand on roadsides raking ankle - deep " fields " of plastic chips
in one workshop , men sliced open sacks of these plastic chips , which they then poured into large vats of fluid
they then used shovels and their bare hands to stir this synthetic stew
" we sell this plastic to @entity105 , " one of the workers said , referring to a @entity98 company that manufactures products for many global electronics companies , including @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103
dirty , dangerous work this may be one of the world 's largest informal recycling operations for electronic waste
in one family - run garage , workers seemed to specialize in sorting plastic from old televisions and cars into different baskets
" if this plastic cup has a hole in it , you throw it away , " said a man who ran the operation , pointing to a pink plastic mug
" we take it and re-sell it
" but recycling in @entity44 is dirty , dangerous work
" when recycling is done properly , it 's a good thing for the environment , " said @entity27 , the @entity30 spokesman in @entity29
" but when recycling is done in primitive ways like we have seen in @entity7 with the electronic waste , it is hugely devastating for the local environment
" according to the april 2013 @entity11 report " e-waste in @entity7 , " @entity44 suffered an " environmental calamity " as a result of the wide - scale e-waste disposal industry in the area
much of the toxic pollution comes from burning circuit boards , plastic and copper wires , or washing them with hydrochloric acid to recover valuable metals like copper and steel
in doing so , workshops contaminate workers and the environment with toxic heavy metals like lead , beryllium and cadmium , while also releasing hydrocarbon ashes into the air , water and soil , the report said
for first - time visitors to @entity44 , the air leaves a burning sensation in the eyes and nostrils
toxic tech studies by the @entity171 revealed that many children tested in @entity44 had higher than average levels of lead in their blood , which can stunt the development of the brain and central nervous system
piles of technological scrap had been dumped in a muddy field just outside of town
there , water buffalo grazed and soaked themselves in ponds surrounded by piles of electronic components with labels like @entity103 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity102
the enormous animals casually stomped through mounds of sheet glass , which clearly had been removed from video monitors
flat screen displays often use mercury , a highly toxic metal
" releases of mercury can occur during the dismantling of equipment such as flat screen displays , " wrote @entity30 , in a report titled " @entity209 " " incineration or landfilling can also result in releases of mercury to the environment ... that can bioaccumulate and biomagnify to high levels in food chains , particularly in fish
" most of the workers in @entity44 involved in the e-waste business are migrants from destitute regions of @entity7 and poorly educated
many of them downplayed the potential damage the industry could cause to their health
they asked only to use their family names , to protect their identity
" of course it is n't healthy , " said @entity226 , a woman who was rapidly sorting plastic shards from devices like computer keyboards , remote controls and even computer mice
she and her colleagues burned plastic using lighters and blow - torches to identify different kinds of material
" but there are families that have lived here for generations ... and there is little impact on their health , " she said
several migrants said that while the work is tough , it allows them more freedom than working on factory lines where young children are not permitted to enter the premises and working hours are stringent
used to be worse despite the environmental degradation and toxic fumes permeating the air , many in @entity44 said that conditions have improved dramatically over the years
" i remember in 2007 , when i first came here , there was a flood of trash , " said @entity259 , a 20 - year - old man who ferried bundles of electronic waste around on a motorcycle with a trailer attached to it
" before people were washing metals , burning things and it severely damaged people 's lungs , " @entity259 added
" but now , compared to before , the [ authorities ] have cracked down pretty hard
" but residents who did not work in the e-waste business offered a very different take on the pollution in @entity44
a group of farmers who had migrated from neighboring @entity282 province to cultivate rice in @entity44 told @entity284 they did not dare drink the local well water
they claimed if they tried to wash clothes and linens with the water , it turned fabrics yellow
the head of the group , who identified himself as @entity295 , had another shocking admission
" it may not sound nice , but we do n't dare eat the rice that we farm because it 's planted here with all the pollution , " @entity295 said , pointing at water - logged rice paddy next to him
asked who did eat the harvested rice , @entity295 answered : " how should i know ? a lot of it is sold off ... they do n't dare label the rice from here as ' grown in @entity44
' they 'll write that its rice from some other place
" not that surprising considering that the latest food scandal to hit the country earlier this month is cadmium - laced rice
officials in @entity318 , roughly 400 kilometers away from @entity44 , found high rates of cadmium in rice and rice products
according to the city 's @entity324 samples pulled from a local restaurant , food seller and two university canteens showed high levels of cadmium in rice and rice noodles
officials did not specify how the contaminated rice entered the city 's food supply
@entity284 made several attempts to contact the @entity44 town government
government officials refused to comment on the electronic waste issue and hung up the phone
however , it did appear that government efforts to restrict imports of foreign waste are reducing the flow of e-trash here
" why are they stopping the garbage from reaching us ? " asked one man who ran a plastic sorting workshop
" of course it 's hurting our business , " he added
domestic e-waste grows the @entity7 government had some success regulating e-waste disposal with a " @entity358 , " which was tested from 2009 to 2011
with the help of generous government subsidies , the program collected tens of millions of obsolete home appliances , according to the @entity11 even if @entity7 authorities succeed in limiting smuggled supplies of foreign garbage , the @entity11 warns that the country is rapidly generating its own supply of e-waste
" domestic generation of e-waste has risen rapidly as a result of technological and economic development , " the @entity11 reported
it cited statistics showing an exponential surge in sales of tv 's , refrigerators , washing machines , air conditioners and computers in @entity7 over a 16 - year period
to avoid a vicious cycle of pollution , resulting from both the manufacture and disposal of appliances , @entity30 has lobbied for manufacturers to use fewer toxic chemicals in their products
the organization also has a message for consumers who seem to swap their phones , tablets and other computer devices with increasing frequency
" think about where your mobile phone or where your gadgets go , " said @entity27 , the @entity30 activist
" when you think about changing [ your phone ] , or buying a new product , always think about the footprint that you put on this planet
