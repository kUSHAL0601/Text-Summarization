another flight , another woman goes into labor
@entity3 from @entity4 to @entity5 diverted to @entity6 on wednesday when a pregnant passenger went into labor during the flight
a pediatrician on board helped the passenger until the flight landed at about 9:45 a.m. , according to @entity15 affiliate @entity14
the passenger was taken by the local fire department to the @entity18 , where she gave birth to a baby boy
both the mother and baby are in good condition , the hospital said
" i was getting contractions about every minute almost immediately , which was really scary ... " mother @entity26 told @entity15 affiliate @entity27 on thursday
the pediatrician was a big help , she said , as were the flight attendants
" they were great , like helping me breathe
because we had n't done our classes yet , so we were really kind of out of our element , " @entity26 said of her and her husband , @entity32
" there were about four ( other people ) there all breathing with me
" the 4 - pound , 6 - ounce child , named @entity40 , is fine
" he 's doing so well and he 's so cute , " said @entity26 , whose family lives in @entity42
it 's not the first time this month that a pregnant passenger has diverted a flight
on december 9 , a baby was born on @entity48 shortly after its 6:24 a.m. takeoff
the aircraft departed from @entity4 bound for @entity52 , but diverted to @entity53 at about 7:30 a.m. a nurse and doctor on board assisted with the delivery
" it was amazing , " a flight attendant said in a video posted on the airline 's website
" all the passengers were awesome
" the plane was met by a @entity67 emergency response team upon landing , according to @entity53 spokeswoman @entity69
after a two - and - a - half hour delay , the 111 other passengers aboard @entity71 were able to continue their journey to @entity52 aboard a new aircraft
airline restrictions for pregnant passengers vary
@entity3 does n't restrict the travel of pregnant passengers , but the airline does offer guidance about change fees on its website
" ticket change fees and penalties can not be waived for pregnancy
" for any passenger traveling after her eighth month , " it 's a good idea to check with your doctor to be sure travel is not restricted
" @entity90 advises that pregnant women consult with their doctors before traveling by air , and the airline recommends not traveling after the 38th week of pregnancy
barring medical complications , the @entity95 says that pregnant women can fly safely just like the general population
however , " air travel is not recommended at any time during pregnancy for women who have medical or obstetric conditions that may be exacerbated by flight or that could require emergency care
