-- @entity1 has agreed to hold talks friday with the @entity4 - led @entity3 on the peninsula over the sinking of a @entity8 warship
it will be the second meeting between the two parties since the march attack on the @entity12 , which killed 46 @entity8 sailors
an international investigation blamed @entity1 for the sinking , an assertion the @entity1 has denied
officers from both sides will meet in @entity19 in the demilitarized zone between @entity21
the talks are designed to set the stage for higher - level discussions on the disputed naval incident
the demilitarized zone was created as part of the armistice signed between @entity21 in 1953 that halted fighting in the @entity31 , but the war has never officially ended
the @entity33 and @entity1 began occasional meetings between generals -- " general officer talks " -- at @entity19 in 1998 in an effort to lessen tensions
there have been 17 such meetings so far
earlier this month , the @entity33 formally condemned the sinking of the @entity12 but did not specifically name @entity1
" the @entity45 deplores the attack , " the 15 - member council said in what is known as a presidential statement
it urged that " appropriate and peaceful measures be taken against those responsible for the incident aimed at the peaceful settlement of the issue
" it also called for full adherence to the 1953 armistice agreement
about 8,000 military personnel from the @entity4 and @entity21 are to participate in joint military exercises dubbed " @entity60 " from july 25 - 28 , @entity56 and @entity57 announced tuesday
" the purpose of this readiness exercise is to highlight @entity65 resolve to face any threat @entity1 may pose , " it said in a news release .
