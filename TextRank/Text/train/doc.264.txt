-- a new @entity2 law requiring a woman to get counseling at a " pregnancy help center " and wait 72 hours after a physician assessment before having an abortion appears destined for a legal challenge
law opponents say the waiting period would be the longest in the nation
gov. @entity12 , who signed @entity13 on tuesday , is anticipating such a move
the restrictive bill 's prime sponsor , rep. @entity17 , has pledged to raise private funds to help finance any needed defense , @entity12 said in a statement
" i think everyone agrees with the goal of reducing abortion by encouraging consideration of other alternatives , " @entity12
" i hope that women who are considering an abortion will use this three - day period to make good choices
" the law , which also requires the woman to receive counseling at a " pregnancy help center , " is currently scheduled to take effect july 1
but the @entity34 and a regional office of @entity36 said they will file a lawsuit to stop the law
" @entity36 's legal team has determined that this bill is such an egregious violation of the @entity46 , that we will file suit if the governor signs it , " said the @entity36 office for @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity2 before @entity12 's action
" the law also purports to ensure that women are ' informed ' before consenting to an abortion , but actually imposes requirements that are both impossible to meet and require physicians to flood their patients with false and misleading information , " the group said in a statement
@entity58 , head of @entity2 's @entity59 , told @entity0 @entity61 affiliate ksfy that " @entity36 has not done anything to police itself when a woman is being coerced into this action
" @entity58 says the centers will provide important counseling about abortion and offer alternatives " so that women get the information so that they can make an informed decision , a voluntary decision
" the @entity72 , a @entity74 - based research center for sexual and reproductive health , says that 34 states require that women receive counseling before an abortion is performed
twenty - five of those states also require women to wait a specified amount of time -- usually 24 hours -- between the counseling and the abortion procedure , the group says
language at the beginning of the bill states that it establishes " certain procedures to better insure that [ abortion ] decisions are voluntary , uncoerced , and informed , and to revise certain causes of action for professional negligence relating to performance of an abortion
" under the law , no physician may have the pregnant woman sign a consent for the abortion on the day of the initial consultation
the doctor must perform an assessment and can not schedule a procedure " to take place in less than 72 hours from the completion of such consultation and assessment except in medical emergency
" the physician will discuss risk factors with the woman and must provide information on " pregnancy help centers , " according to the law
the woman must undergo a pregnancy center consultation prior to the day of any scheduled abortion and provide written proof to the doctor
@entity36 said the centers " must have as their central mission a desire to dissuade a woman from having an abortion , no matter what her particular risks or circumstances
" @entity2 obstetrician @entity130 told @entity0 @entity132 affiliate @entity131 that the new law is " government - mandated interference in the doctor / patient relationship
