@entity0 is happy to be alive
in 2008 , the young husband and father was riding his four - wheeler on his grandfather 's farm when he came in contact with a downed power line
his body was jolted with 7,200 volts of electricity
" i remember waking up from an induced coma a few days later and being told that they had to amputate my both hands in order to save my life , " said @entity0 , now 34
" my mom and dad kept telling me that i would get through this
since his accident , @entity0 has had a variety of prosthetic hands to help him function with his " new normal " in everyday life
" it 's like i 'm carrying a tool box , but only have one tool , " said @entity0
" you ca n't use a wrench for everything
" in recent years , the prosthetic devices field has seen remarkable developments
and @entity0 is the first double amputee in the world to receive one of the most innovative products on the market : bionic hands that are , in part , controlled by an @entity38 app. the @entity39 is the latest innovation from @entity42 - based prosthetic developers @entity43
@entity44 approves first bionic eye the hand offers " unparalleled dexterity and control , enabling wearers to more easily perform activities of daily living and thus increase their quality of life , " said @entity54 , ceo of @entity43
the company claims it offers the closest thing on the market to a real human hand
unlike most conventional prosthetics , this hand boasts five individually - powered fingers -- including a fully rotatable thumb
" this is something we 've never seen available for patients before , " said @entity62 , senior clinical director at @entity63 , who is not affiliated with @entity43
the prosthesis also has an auto - grasp feature , which prevents accidental slippage when , say , holding a soda can or picking up an apple
but the most unique part of the prosthetic is the app control
on an @entity77 or an @entity38 , users can select 24 different types of grip patterns that will allow more functionality
" if you are holding a computer mouse ( and ) you want to right click , that is a complicated thing with a prosthetic
but this integrated app technology allows a person to do this with ease , " said @entity62
these are basic movements many of us take for granted : a tri-pod grip to pick up a pen , or hand - shake grip for business meetings , said @entity62 , who has fitted hundreds of amputees with prosthetic devices
amputee scales 103 floors with mind - controlled ' bionic leg ' " for the first time in five years i can hold my daughter 's hand , " said @entity0
" i ca n't tell you what a gift that feels like
" users can also customize grip patterns through the integrated app technology
" let 's say you want to go out and play pool with your friends
you can customize a grasp pattern that allows you to hold the pool stick -- or if you like to do handy work , you may customize one to hold an electric drill , " said @entity62
the hands are not waterproof , which is one reason @entity0 says he 'll still keep his other prosthetics , like his metal claw , available
" nothing is perfect , but i feel like i can be a more active participant in everyday life with these hands , " said @entity0 , who now spends his time reaching out to new amputees about keeping a positive outlook on their situation
" i can do pretty much everything i could before ; it just might take me a little longer
