-- @entity3 singer @entity2 has pulled out of one of the world 's best - known opera events , the @entity7 in @entity8 , because he has a @entity10 tattoo , organizers said sunday
@entity2 was in a heavy metal band as a young man , and got the swastika tattoo then , said festival spokesman @entity14
" that is a problem in @entity16 , " @entity14 said
" @entity16 has a bad history with the @entity18
it 's clear that @entity16 has to be careful about this terrible part of history and has to take a position against it
" the festival is dedicated to the works of @entity26 , one of @entity10 dictator @entity28 's favorite composers
@entity28 attended the @entity7 regularly , according to the @entity29 , which describes @entity26 as " an artist long associated with anti-semitism " and the racist - nationalist volkisch tradition " from which the @entity18 drew much of their ideology
" @entity2 , 38 , a bass - baritone , has " painted over " his @entity10 tattoo , and it would not have been visible during his performance in " @entity37 , " @entity14 said
but there are videos of him online where the tattoo is visible , he said
" i had the tattoos made when i was young
it was a big mistake in my life and i wish i had never done it , " @entity2 said in a statement released by the festival
@entity2 canceled his appearance after discussions with @entity16 management , the spokesman said
he had already been in @entity8 rehearsing for his premiere on wednesday , @entity14 said
@entity2 's agent did not immediately respond to @entity0 questions about the cancellation
his website still lists him as appearing in " @entity37 " at the festival this summer
the festival website does not list him in the cast .
