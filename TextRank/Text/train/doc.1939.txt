-- after president @entity1 made his tepid endorsement of same - sex marriage last week , the pundits , from @entity5 all the way to the @entity7 , quickly pivoted from asking why to whether it will hurt him politically
but there is a more interesting question : how , in less than a decade , did @entity11 go from being a country in which some states punished gay sex with criminal penalties to one in which the highest elected official in the land now champions the right of same - sex couples to marry ? the answer can be found in the interaction between supporters of marriage equality and the @entity27 conservative movement over the past few decades
as late as the 1980s , same - sex marriage was on virtually no one 's radar screen
in 1972 , the @entity11 @entity31 found the idea of a legal right of same - sex couples to marry so outlandish that it dismissed a @entity37 case presenting the issue without bothering to write an opinion
at the time , the gay rights movement was understandably focused on combating private violence and public discrimination
no single factor explains the movement 's shift to the goal of marriage equality , but much of the credit must go to the very religious conservatives who assiduously campaigned against same - sex marriage , thus forcing the issue onto the front burner of @entity11 politics
it happened like this : in 1993 , in the case of @entity58 , the @entity56 decided that the state 's prohibition on same - sex marriage was discriminatory
in 1998 , @entity62 's voters passed a referendum giving the legislature the right to declare same - sex marriage illegal , but in the meantime , social conservatives had taken the issue to the national stage , where it promised to pay handsome dividends
same - sex marriage was still so unpopular that in 1996 , tremulous @entity72 joined @entity73 in overwhelmingly passing the @entity74 , or @entity74 , signed by president @entity75
that act defined marriage at the federal level to mean only heterosexual marriage and authorized states to deny recognition to same - sex marriages performed in other states -- even though , at the time , no state had authorized the practice
@entity74 was thus a preemptive strike by the opponents of marriage equality
but the act helped to call into being the very marriage equality movement it aimed to combat
encouraged by their surprising , if temporary , success in @entity62 , and outraged by the blatantly homophobic arguments that had been made in favor of @entity74 , the lesbian / gay / bisexual / transgender movement reluctantly began to turn its energy and resources toward the goal of marriage equality
this was a fundamental shift , not made without controversy within the movement , where many worried that calling for marriage equality would unleash the fury of the @entity105
whereas many activists had given higher priority to such issues as employment discrimination , hiv / aids education and protection against hate crimes , the denial of marriage equality now came to be seen as a broad symbol of second - class citizenship for @entity116
@entity1 's declaration of his support for marriage equality the day after @entity120 residents banned both same - sex marriage and civil unions in a referendum is only the latest encapsulation of the dialectical interaction of movement and countermovement : each effort to limit marriage equality has led to a countereffort on behalf of equal rights
as the first @entity132 - @entity11 president , @entity1 could not be seen to stand on the wrong side of the most prominent civil rights struggle of our time
@entity116 increasingly see laws that deny a person the right to marry someone of the same sex as reminiscent of the ugly laws that once forbade interracial marriage
the rest is , if not yet history , at least a well - known story
although same - sex marriage remains illegal in most of the @entity11 , and the issue may yet play to @entity151 's advantage in november , time is on the side of equality
those of us who favor same - sex marriage are rightly grateful to @entity1 for having come off the fence
but we should also thank religious conservatives for having put the president on the fence in the first place
were it not for their opposition to same - sex marriage , it might have taken much longer for @entity116 to take up the cause
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 and @entity168 .
