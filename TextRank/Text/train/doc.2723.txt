standing side - by - side behind the front window of their home , @entity4 and her husband , @entity5 , shot videos of the powerful tornado barreling toward this southern @entity9 town
the images and sound of the couple talking with each other have taken on a decidedly tragic air since the march 2 @entity16 twister -- with sustained winds of between 166 mph and 200 mph -- moved through @entity18
" it was my last time with him , " @entity4 told @entity19
@entity22 , 62 , did not survive the storm
he was among 39 killed , 13 of them in @entity9 , by a powerful @entity26 and @entity27 storm system
amazingly , the @entity29 ' cameras survived the powerful winds that flattened their home
@entity4 shared the dramatic footage publicly for the first time with @entity19
" i always wanted to see a tornado , but not like that
that was huge , huge , " she said
@entity9 mom loses legs saving kids from tornado @entity5 was n't particularly a fan of storms , but @entity4 , 59 , was
" we watched ' twister ' ( the movie ) quite a bit , " she said
" i could quote practically all of it
" but this twister was the real thing
the hunters , married 41 years , are heard on the video describing the tornado heading their way
@entity4 says it was n't clear at first that it would stay on course toward their home
" it looks like it 's heading right toward us , " @entity22 is heard telling his wife
" maybe we should get away from the window , " she replies
her husband utters an expletive under his breath and laughs nervously as they describe the tornado 's funnel changing colors and picking up more debris
" we 'll need to close the window
i 've got to close the door , " @entity4 says
" @entity75 , " she says breathlessly
the tape on her camera then cuts off
at that point , @entity22 said , the couple ran to the center of their single - story home , which had no basement
" her husband grabbed his wallet and she grabbed her purse
" they 're going to know who i am , " she recalled thinking
" i was still cracking jokes
we were going to be ok
i kept telling him we 'll be fine
" " we hunkered down
put the blanket over us
we had arms around each other , " @entity4 said friday , her voice breaking , as she showed @entity19 how the couple crouched and held each other tightly
" he said ' i love you
' i said , ' i love you , too
' " they were the couple 's last words to each other
@entity4 describes hearing a roar and her ears popping
" i remember waking up and yelling , screaming , ' help us ! ' " she said
" i mean my whole body , it was like i was just crushed
and i could n't see anything , " says @entity22
@entity110 and @entity111 heard sounds like a baby crying
" all you could see was her head and a bunch of blood , " said @entity110
the woman was badly bruised , but suffered no broken bones
" we just knew we needed to get her out of there somehow , " @entity111 said
but , first , they found @entity22
he was lying next to his wife , covered by a refrigerator
" i remember shaking his arm saying , ' @entity5 , @entity127 , ' and he never responded , " @entity110 said
' i said , ' is he ( @entity5 ) ok ? , " @entity4 recalled
" he ( @entity110 ) said , ' no , ma'am , ' which was the perfect answer , because i would n't have wanted someone to say , ' well , i think he 'll be ok
" as softball - sized hail landed , @entity111 took @entity4 by the hand , covered her head with a roasting pan , and led her to safety
while sitting on the concrete steps that used to lead to her front door , @entity22 cried softly as she recalled another section of their final home videos
on the tape , @entity4 initially sounds excited as the tornado approaches
" i have never seen one
i finally get to see one , " she tells @entity5
" maybe the last one i see , " she tells him
@entity5 laughs and replies , " that 's true
" as she recalled those recorded words , @entity4 buried her head in her hands and cried
" @entity22 , a retired emergency room nurse , served in the @entity154 and was stationed in @entity155 during the @entity156 , according to his son , @entity157
@entity5 's widow intends to rebuild in the same spot where their home once stood and where the couple planned to enjoy the rest of their retirement
the residence will include a basement
" this is our home
and it will be my home forever , " @entity4 told @entity19
she has the support of her two grown children and grandchildren -- and says her faith will pull her through
" i will make it
sometimes it 's hard , but i 'm going to be ok
" @entity4 dabs her eyes
" i 'm gon na miss him
