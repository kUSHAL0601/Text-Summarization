the disastrous roll out of the @entity1 raises a litany of questions about president @entity5 's leadership and management ability
but it also begs for an answer to who would take the fall
as problems mount , rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , said thursday that " heads should have rolled " at the @entity15
@entity17 secretary @entity16 , the woman in charge of implementing @entity1 , took the blame for a flawed @entity21 website , even as calls mounted -- inside and outside of @entity23 - for her to be fired
testifying before a hostile congressional committee , @entity16 said she should be held accountable for the online site that stumbled out of the starting gate on october 1 and wo n't be functioning smoothly for most people -- according to @entity5 , himself -- until the end of the month
" i 'm responsible , " she told lawmakers
but @entity5 had her back
@entity15 spokesman @entity31 said the president has " full confidence " in @entity16
@entity34 , crisis management expert and ceo of @entity34 , said that an age - old @entity15 policy is that federal agencies take the blame and the @entity15 collects the props
but as letters started landing in people 's mailboxes , notifying them that their health insurance plans were being canceled , @entity16 might have been in deeper hot water , except that @entity5 promised when selling @entity1 that people could keep their plans if they like them
that was not true in the end
@entity5 takes brunt of new storm people were given false assurance
@entity16 shrunk out of the spotlight as @entity5 's unkept promise took the brunt of a new storm
it culminated in a public apology on thursday when @entity5 -- also talking about the website -- acknowledged that he " fumbled " the launch of his signature domestic policy achievement
while @entity5 is taking responsibility publicly , internally he is faced with many questions , including why his staff let him make such a claim if it was n't true
should @entity16 have known ? she was responsible for overseeing the implementation and creation of the specifics of @entity1
additionally , as a former insurance commissioner responsible for approving or rejecting coverage plans for @entity73 consumers , it seemed like she would have had an understanding of the impact as federal coverage standards changed to become more robust
and some insurance commissioners are troubled by the president 's proposal to allow a one year extension of individual health plans -- those most likely to be canceled
@entity16 ' successor , @entity82 , said she and her fellow insurance commissioners around the country warned the administration early on
" we said from the get - go that if you start taking pieces out of this , it will collapse , " @entity82 told the @entity86
should someone be fired ? " i think there is limited utility in just firing people , but if you need to do it for political reasons , it 's always an option , " @entity34 said
@entity34 cautioned , however , that this is not an acute problem but a chronic one , and firing @entity16 wo n't make everything magically better
even if @entity5 chose to fire @entity16 , he would need to replace her , and that may be the ultimate reason why she may stay on for now
not only would it take time for a new health secretary to get up to speed , a permanent replacement requires @entity110 confirmation -- lately an unappealing prospect for @entity5
finding someone else would likely subject @entity5 to a damaging political fight with @entity114 determined to draw as much attention to the problematic components of @entity1
@entity118 senior political analyst @entity117 said that a new health nominee would ensure " virtual certainty " for @entity114 to " use this as kind of a way to leverage more concessions from the administration
" @entity118 's chief political analyst , @entity126 , said @entity16 ' head would roll at some point
" he 's very deliberate
in the end , will she go ? eventually
but there are lots of other issues she 's got to deal with first , " @entity126 said
but for now , this is @entity5 's problem
it is called @entity1 , not @entity136
" @entity137 ceases to be an option , " @entity34 said
" @entity137 is an option when you have a place to hide and when no one is looking
it 's not an option when there 's no place to hide and everyone 's looking
