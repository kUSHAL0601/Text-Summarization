-- the international draw of its star players , the huge sums paid for rights to broadcast live action and the loyal nature of its consumers have long made the @entity10 an attractive home for investors
in recent years this has included a number of @entity15 billionaires who , having made their money with sport franchises in the @entity15 , saw ownership of teams including @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , @entity22 ( @entity23 and @entity24 ) and @entity25 ( @entity26 ) as the best way to expand a global portfolio
@entity29 -- owner of the @entity31 basketball team , the @entity32 's @entity30 and @entity34 's @entity33 -- could be the next to join this elite group after a major shareholder at @entity38 - based @entity37 confirmed that she is looking to sell her stake
@entity29 already owns 29 percent of the @entity42 quarterfinalists , and needs only one more percent to trigger a complete takeover
blog : should @entity29 buy @entity37 ? but with the economic downturn compounding both @entity22 and @entity20 's struggles with debt and growing fan unrest -- coupled with @entity29 's recent confirmation of a takeover bid for the @entity52 -- would it be wise for the @entity15 to aim his sights on owning @entity37 now ? @entity0 's business correspondent @entity54 helps break down @entity29 's decision
why invest in the @entity10 ? the recent sale of their overseas television rights amounted to over $ 1.5 billion , while the domestic rights went for much more
this means the @entity10 clubs can sign expensive players on big wages , according to @entity54
" a lot of the league 's strength is to do with @entity68 and its multi-billion dollar deal to show the games around the world , " he said
" @entity68 gives an enormous amount of money to @entity10 clubs
" could @entity29 expect much profit from @entity37 ? @entity54 says the main way to maximize profit is to keep a club healthy , and deliver success on the pitch before selling it on down the line for a profit
he said : " i look upon @entity29 like these other guys in @entity15 : the @entity87 own a @entity89 team , the guys who own @entity22 own hockey clubs in @entity15
they only make money if they hold onto them for a really long time and sell them
" is @entity37 a financially healthy club ? yes , according to @entity54
he says the club had to take out a big loan to build its new stadium -- the @entity98 , which opened in 2006 -- but that is being chipped away
he explained : " there is a small section of seats at @entity37 's new ground that generates as much money on a match day as the entire former ground did
all other seats are gravy , so the amount of money they make per game is phenomenal
" the site of the former ground has been turned into flats , which has also generated a considerable amount of money , @entity54 said
@entity54 believes @entity37 manager @entity116 's model of investing time and money into youth players is also a shrewd move
" @entity116 's theory is to buy someone when they are young and other clubs have n't even noticed them
by the time they come good , and most of them do , he would have to pay $ 20 million to get these guys
" he says these players can also be sold on for huge profit , like in the case of @entity135 striker @entity134 , who came through the @entity37 youth system before being sold to @entity137 for $ 35 million
would @entity29 put the club in debt to buy it , as did the owners of @entity20 and @entity22 ? the @entity21 family bought @entity20 by putting the debt onto the club , and their most recent accounts show they are over $ 1 billion in debt
@entity54 says any similar move at @entity37 may not do the club any good
" @entity37 already has a debt from the building of the new stadium , so it would be hard to see how @entity29 would get a bank to agree to give them more debt , " he said
does @entity29 's extra investment in the @entity52 limit his spending power ? @entity54 says @entity29 's purchase of the @entity52 makes it very unlikely he would also fight to acquire @entity37 at the same time : " the fact that he has just ingested the @entity52 -- one of the worst teams in the @entity89 -- means he is going to have to spend his time and effort trying to rebuild that club
it 's hard to see that he would do that and try to take over @entity37 -- that would be a lot for one person to take on
