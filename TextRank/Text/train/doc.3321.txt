@entity0 -- a member of the @entity5 military assigned to the @entity6 is under investigation in connection with alleged misconduct in @entity10 , bringing to 12 the total number of military personnel being reviewed , officials said monday
one @entity14 official said the military member admitted to his leadership that he was involved in misconduct " of some kind " while in @entity10 for the recent @entity19 attended by president @entity20
the agency is a non-white @entity22 office that provides the president with secure communications while he travels
it is staffed by members of the military who report through the @entity28
a total of 24 people -- 12 @entity31 members and 12 @entity5 military members -- are under investigation in the alleged prostitution scandal that occurred before @entity20 arrived in @entity35 on april 13
the controversy has embarrassed the nearly 150 - year - old @entity31 , which protects the president and other top officials and investigates criminal activity , and raised questions about a possible security breach immediately preceding @entity20 's visit
six @entity31 members have left their jobs in the wake of the incident in @entity35 , and one employee " has been cleared of serious misconduct but will face administrative action , " the @entity31 said
five other @entity31 employees are on administrative leave and have had their security clearances temporarily revoked
in addition , the @entity5 military is investigating 12 of its own service members for alleged misconduct
defense secretary @entity57 said monday that security clearances have been suspended for all @entity5 military personnel involved in the incident in @entity35 , and he repeated his vow that anyone found to have violated regulations would be punished
" we expect our people wherever they are , whether they 're in @entity10 or any other country or in the @entity5 , to behave at the highest standards of conduct , " @entity57 said during a visit to the @entity10 capital @entity65
" that 's what we expect
and so we will wait for the investigation that is currently taking place
" at the @entity22 , press secretary @entity75 said monday that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by @entity22 staff or advance team members
when asked about the possibility of @entity6 staff members being involved , @entity75 pointed out that they are members of the military
" to make clear , the @entity31 is investigating specific allegations of misconduct by members of the @entity31
the @entity14 is investigating specific allegations of misconduct by members of the military , " he said
" there have been no specific , credible allegations of misconduct by anyone on the @entity22 advance team or the @entity22 staff
" nevertheless , out of due diligence , the @entity22 counsel 's office has conducted a review of the @entity22 advance team , and in concluding that review , came to the conclusion that there 's no indication that any member of the @entity22 advance team engaged in any improper conduct or behavior
" that drew the attention of sen. @entity110 , the ranking @entity111 on the @entity112
in a letter to the counsel 's office , @entity110 noted that he had asked @entity31 director @entity115 whether any @entity22 advance staff had been involved and had n't had an answer back by monday
@entity110 asked for answers to 14 questions , including details of how the @entity22 review was conducted , whether any @entity22 staffers had " overnight guests " and whether any additional room charges were incurred
also monday , a source familiar with the investigation said that one of the @entity31 agents linked to the prostitution scandal brought a woman back to the @entity35 , the same hotel where @entity20 later stayed , five days before the president 's arrival
the source was not certain whether money exchanged hands or whether the @entity31 member simply brought a woman he met -- a foreign national -- to the @entity138
according to the source , the incident appeared to be separate from the one a few nights later that caused 11 other @entity31 members to be sent home for alleged heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes
based on the investigation , there is no evidence that the women realized the @entity31 personnel were with the agency , the source said
investigators have interviewed the prostitutes and other women involved
" it does n't appear these women knew who the heck they were , " the source said
meanwhile , @entity162 chairman @entity161 said he expects more @entity31 members to be forced out soon
" i am very certain that within the next day or so , you 're going to see a number of people leaving the @entity31 , " said @entity161 , @entity165 - @entity164
@entity161 , as well as the other source familiar with the investigation , said polygraph tests administered to the @entity31 members helped get information to force out six of them
according to @entity161 , the 11 @entity31 members originally under investigation were all given drug tests , which came back negative
from the start , @entity115 told legislators how outraged he was about the scandal , promising a broad and comprehensive investigation
most legislators seemed comfortable with the way the @entity31 has reacted to the scandal
however , both the @entity22 and @entity187 chairmen are now conducting their own investigations and will probably hold hearings in coming weeks
the 11 @entity31 employees accused of consorting with prostitutes arrived earlier the same day as a part of the " jump team " that flies in on military transport planes with vehicles in the president 's motorcade
according to sources , the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at the @entity35 hotel where @entity31 members apparently stayed , flashing their local id cards
one of these women allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night , which brought the entire incident to light and sparked controversy in the @entity5 and @entity10
that woman has been identified as @entity215 , whose neighbors described her as a 24 - year - old single mother who studies @entity218
@entity215 has n't been seen in the neighborhood since the controversy erupted , though a visitor took suitcases from the house recently , they said
while soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in @entity10 , military law bars service members from patronizing prostitutes , engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or , for enlisted personnel , conduct " prejudicial to good order and discipline
" it is also considered a breach of the @entity31 's conduct code , government sources said
@entity1 's @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .
