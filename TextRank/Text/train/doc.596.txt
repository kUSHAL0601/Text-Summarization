-- the holder of one of three winning tickets in last week 's record $ 656 million @entity7 drawing came forward friday to claim a share , @entity2 officials announced
the winner -- a single ticket holder -- has chosen to remain anonymous , state lottery director @entity9 said
" the person looks forward to retirement , " @entity9 said
@entity14 was one of three states where three tickets matched the winning numbers -- 2 , 4 , 23 , 38 and 46 , with a @entity19 of 23 -- amounting to an equal share of roughly $ 218.6 million , before taxes , under the annuity option
the @entity14 winner , who bought the winning ticket at a @entity26 's convenience store in @entity27 , chose the cash option to collect the winnings -- $ 157 million
" they were still just in awe that they had won it , " @entity9 said of the winner , who did n't know the ticket was a winner until monday
the other winning tickets were purchased in @entity38 and @entity39
the @entity14 winner is the first to officially come forward , just a week after the winning numbers were picked
meanwhile , @entity38 lottery officials have been responding to a flurry of questions from the media this week after a @entity45 - area woman told the @entity46 that she had one of the winning tickets
however , in a bizarre twist of the story , @entity49 , a 37 - year - old single mother of seven who works at @entity51 , told the @entity46 on friday that she is n't sure where she last had the ticket
" i 'm still looking for it
i have n't even looked in my uniform pants yet , " the @entity46 quoted @entity9 as saying
" i 'm still looking everywhere to find it , in my purse , everywhere
" the state 's lottery director said thursday he has n't seen the ticket , but he also says no one else has come forward saying he has it
@entity65 , a spokeswoman for the @entity66 , said tuesday she does n't " put much stock in that story
" " she claims she won , " @entity69 said
" she ca n't produce a ticket
... in our opinion , until they walk in that door , hold that ticket , produce valid identification and our security people can process and validate it , it does n't matter
" if @entity9 is determined to be a winner , a showdown could be brewing with her @entity82 's co-workers
they are demanding a share because they say they pooled their money to buy several tickets
@entity9 has said the ticket she bought was separate from that
@entity0 's @entity93 and @entity94 contributed to this report .
