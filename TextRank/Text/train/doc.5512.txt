@entity0 -- @entity2 will stay in rehab a few more weeks despite a prosecutor 's request he be thrown in jail
@entity2 , who has been on probation since pleading guilty to assaulting girlfriend @entity11 five years ago , is becoming more violent , with his outbursts " increasing in severity and intensity , " @entity9 deputy district attorney @entity7 argued monday
the singer has been in a rehab program for anger issues and drug abuse since november when the judge ordered him to go there instead of jail for an earlier probation violation
but the prosecutor asked monday that he been locked up in jail because of his arrest in @entity24 on an assault charge
although @entity27 judge @entity26 ruled @entity2 was again in violation of probation , he cited a new report from his probation officer that concluded @entity2 " is doing well in the program and making great strides " in rehab
for now , @entity2 can stay in rehab , the judge ruled
" it appears your doing well in the program , " he told @entity37
" there 's no reason to put him into custody at this point , " @entity2 attorney @entity41 said after the hearing
" we 're happy that the judge agreed with us
" @entity2 is expected to complete the rehab program on february 19 , but he has to travel to @entity24 for a hearing on the assault charge on february 20
that case could still send @entity2 to jail in @entity0 if he is found guilty
the probation imposed when he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in the 2009 attack on @entity11 requires that he stay out of legal trouble
the judge will hold another hearing on february 28 to decide his fate after rehab
the latest probation report praises @entity2 's new improved attitude in complying with probation rules
" he appears to have a more serious and responsible demeanor and is responding well to dual diagnosis treatment program and changes in medication , " his probation officer wrote
@entity2 is working on a community labor crew three days a week until he completes 1,000 of work ordered by the judge in november
he 's finished 109 hours and still has 809 hours left before his probation can be completed , the probation officer said
at that pace , @entity2 has another 101 days of work left
the glowing report is a stark contrast to what the probation officer wrote in november after @entity2 was booted from another rehab facility after smashing his mother 's car window during a family session
" there is much concern with the probationer 's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility , " that probation report said
@entity2 and his bodyguard , @entity93 , face assault charges stemming an incident outside the a hotel near the @entity97 in october
the federal prosecutor handling the case offered to let them each plead guilty to one count of simple assault , but they rejected the offers at court last month
@entity2 rejects plea deal in @entity24 court
