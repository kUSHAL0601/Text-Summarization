@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 announced what he called a " meaningful and unprecedented " climate change deal with @entity6 and other key nations that was expected to be sealed before the president headed home from the @entity10 late friday
" for the first time in history , all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change , " @entity3 told reporters
the president said he met with leaders from @entity20 , @entity6 , @entity21 and @entity22 , and " that 's where we agreed ... to set a mitigation target to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees @entity27
" it 's a nonbinding goal , and the emissions targets " will not be by themselves sufficient to get to where we need to get by 2050 , " @entity3 said
however , he added that it is a first step , and that for many countries " this is going to be the first time in which even voluntary they offered up mitigation targets
" " i think that it was important to essentially get that shift in orientation moving , " @entity3 said
the president said he believes it 's necessary that the countries get to a legally binding treaty , but said , " if we just waited for that , we would not make any progress
" earlier , a senior @entity3 administration official said , " no country is entirely satisfied with each element but this is a meaningful and historic step forward and a foundation from which to make further progress
we thank the emerging economies for their voluntary actions and especially appreciate the work and leadership of the @entity58 in this effort
" critics of the @entity61 have said that without specific commitments from the leaders to actually cut carbon emissions it would be difficult to reach any target
the deal calls on nations to submit their " concrete commitments " into an appendix attached to the agreement to specifically lay out each country 's intentions for climate change , @entity3 said
those commitments will be subjected to an international " consultation and analysis " that will help foster accountability among the nations
" it will not be legally binding , but what it will do is allow for each country to show to the world what they 're doing , " @entity3 said , " and there will be a sense on the part of each country that we 're in this together , and we 'll know who is meeting and who is not meeting , the mutual obligations that have been set forth
" another senior administration official had said the precise details of the agreement were still in some flux , so it was unclear whether the final version would include language that was in earlier drafts aimed at forcing nations to set legally binding targets for reducing emissions
the president worked behind the scenes on getting a vote among key nations -- including @entity6 and @entity20 -- to approve the agreement before taking it to the wider group for a vote , according to the official
the first official added @entity3 would leave @entity0 shortly after addressing the media about the tentative deal in order to return to @entity118 before a major snowstorm hits
@entity2 's @entity120 contributed to this report .
