@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 government said saturday was a " historic day " after two loyalist paramilitary groups announced they had completed the process of decommissioning their weapons
the @entity8 also said it was decommissioning its weapons
the @entity11 and @entity12 made the announcement saturday , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said
a third loyalist group , the @entity8 , announced it had begun the process of decommissioning , according to the @entity10 , which is the @entity4 government department responsible for @entity17 affairs
loyalist paramilitary groups are those that want @entity17 to remain a part of the @entity4
while it was not clear what led up to saturday 's announcements , the three groups had faced an august deadline to demonstrate substantial progress toward decommissioning
a report last month by independent monitors questioned whether the groups were serious about completing the decommissioning process
@entity31 , the secretary of state for @entity17 , then said he was tired of " foot - dragging " on the issue
if there was no substantial progress by august , @entity31 said , he would end the amnesty the groups currently enjoy
current legislation ensures that individuals handling illegal arms with the purpose of decommissioning them are immune from prosecution
" today 's announcement is a culmination of a long and difficult process , " @entity31 said in a statement saturday
" the leadership of the @entity11 and @entity12 have delivered on what they said they would do
in decommissioning their weapons they have clearly signaled that loyalism has nothing to fear and is confident in the political institutions and wants to play a positive role in the future of @entity17
" the two groups made a " bold and courageous decision , " he said , and he urged the @entity8 to continue decommissioning
" for those who have doubted the political process , it is proof that the politics works and that guns have no place in a normal society
" this is proof that decommissioning works and today 's acts of leadership ( are ) further testimony to the transformation in @entity17
" @entity78 secretary of state @entity77 praised the move , calling it a " courageous step
" " leaders on all sides deserve our praise for their continued commitment to moving the process forward , " she said in a statement saturday
the @entity11 was formed in 1966 and has conducted bombings , assassinations , kidnappings , extortion , and robberies , according to @entity93
before its 1994 cease - fire , targets included nationalist paramilitary groups -- those fighting for the reunification of @entity17
the @entity12 is a splinter group of the @entity11
the @entity8 is the largest loyalist paramilitary group in @entity17 , with between 2,000 and 5,000 members , according to the @entity102
it has evolved into a criminal group deeply involved in drug trafficking , but it has also targeted the @entity106 community , the @entity102 says .
