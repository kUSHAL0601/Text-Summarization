she was supposed to be facing @entity1 at a tennis tournament in @entity3 , @entity4 but @entity5 instead landed 1,500km short -- in @entity3 , @entity6
the @entity8 player had mistakenly flown to the wrong town after a travel mix - up and only arrived at the correct destination half an hour before her first round match after an early morning flight
things went from bad to worse when she finally made it on court at the @entity17 as she lost 3 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 1 to her @entity19 opponent
the 19 - year - old took part in a tournament in @entity23 the week before and then flew from @entity24 to @entity25 and then via @entity26 to the wrong @entity3
after arriving at a near - empty airport @entity5 called tournament organizers who said they had officials looking for her in the arrivals hall at the @entity4 destination
" they said they were at the airport and looking for me , " she was quoted as saying by @entity35
" i said i was the only person here
" after the mix - up was discovered , @entity5 spent the night in the @entity6 town before her early morning scramble to the right @entity3 the following day .
