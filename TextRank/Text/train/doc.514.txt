after a stop in @entity21 , @entity2 is expected to arrive late sunday afternoon in @entity0
for almost two decades , @entity2 was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the @entity7 because of its location on the @entity26 , a key strategic and economic waterway between the @entity28 and @entity29 oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the @entity31

judicial officials in @entity0 will determine whether @entity2 can stand trial , @entity35 said
interior minister @entity48 said @entity2 will receive the same treatment as other inmates at the @entity52 prison complex
" the @entity11 state has no special consideration when it comes to him serving his sentence inside the prison complex , " @entity53 said
" however , based on our laws , and if there 's a valid request from his attorneys , they can ask that he be transferred from the prison to house arrest if the inmate 's health is in jeopardy or if the inmate , being over 70 years old , may face risks inside the prison complex
" last year , a @entity8 court sentenced @entity2 to seven years in prison for laundering money through @entity8 banks
he also was fined almost 2.3 million euros ( $ 2.9 million ) , the amount of drug money he was accused of laundering through @entity8 banks
during the trial , defense lawyer @entity81 tried to paint @entity2 as the victim of larger geopolitical forces , accusing the @entity7 of placing and moving pawns to serve its interests
the @entity7 government has portrayed @entity2 as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the @entity91 drug cartel in @entity92 to protect cocaine and money shipments
he was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the @entity7

by 1983 he controlled both @entity0 's armed forces and civilian government
in 1988 @entity2 was indicted in the @entity7 on charges of racketeering , laundering drug money and drug trafficking

he surrendered in january 1990 and was quickly escorted to the @entity7 for civilian trial
during his 2010 trial in @entity8 , @entity2 said , " i received high praise from the @entity7 , @entity144 and other countries who all benefited from my fight against drugs
" @entity1 's @entity149 contributed to this report .
