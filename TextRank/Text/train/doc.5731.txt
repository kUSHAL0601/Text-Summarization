-- i know just what a lot of those so - called @entity3 deserve to get for @entity5 : a scolding
there are good and bad actors in every movement , and the bad ones -- if not kept in check -- can drag the good ones down with them
the term @entity3 refers to the estimated 1.4 million to 2 million young illegal immigrants who might have gotten some relief if the @entity3 , which offered legal status in return for attending college or joining the military , had n't been torpedoed in the @entity20 in december 2010
having declared their intention to better themselves , some in the @entity3 movement now insist that they 're entitled to better treatment than run - of - the - mill illegal immigrants
you know , like the hardworking and humble folks who cut your lawn , clean your house or care for your kids
in fact , the @entity3 seem to suggest they 're due a reward for good behavior
at times , these young people act like spoiled brats
they don caps and gowns and disrupt committee hearings and occupy the offices of members of @entity45
they dare police to arrest them , and then act surprised when it happens
they 're not realistic , or respectful
as we learned recently , the @entity3 have a whole wish list of what they want from @entity45 next year after what is expected to be a humdinger of an immigration debate
a few weeks ago , more than 500 of these young people -- and their supporters -- were brought together in @entity59 , @entity60
by a well - funded organization called " @entity62 , " which bills itself as the largest immigrant youth - led network in the country
at the @entity68 , attendees voted for a national platform that demands the following : -- " fair treatment for @entity3 and our families and communities , including a road map to citizenship for 11 million @entity75 without papers and an end to senseless deportations and abuses " ; -- " the ability to travel without fear , ensuring all immigrants have access to driver 's licenses and the ability to visit family in other countries " ; -- " the elimination of barriers to higher education for immigrant youth by extending state and federal financial aid opportunities , as well as in - state tuition rates to @entity3 available to our peers " ; -- " an end to excessive and costly immigration enforcement policies which separate families and divide communities , such as ' @entity102 , ' e-verify , @entity104 , and roadside checkpoints " ; -- " access to health care and safe , fair working conditions and equal protection under the law for all " ; and -- " growth and diversity of our movement for change , intensifying efforts to become more inclusive of non-latinos , lgbtq communities , differently abled people , people of faith , and other groups
" @entity124 , kids , can we get you anything else ? maybe free massages the next time you stage a sit - in ? these kids want it all
faces of hope line up for two more years in the @entity75 they demand more than just the ability to live in the @entity75 legally and not have to worry about being deported as many others have been
this is no small thing
the @entity137 administration removed more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants over the last four years , and there 's every indication it plans to remove just as many in a second term
some of those who have been deported were @entity3 , despite president @entity137 's claim that @entity144 is removing only hardened criminals
if you believe that , you 're probably also expecting a portly fellow in a red suit to come down the chimney on @entity150
last summer , @entity137 announced a deferred action program and offered to stop deporting @entity3
under the program , undocumented youth who are eligible apply for a two - year work permit
what happens after that , no one knows
the @entity3 chalked up a victory
but what some seem to really want is the golden ticket : @entity75 citizenship
and they want it yesterday
they 're convinced that they deserve it , and they 'll settle for nothing less
many of them reject , even ridicule , proposals by @entity175 in @entity45 to give them legal status without citizenship -- and the voting privileges that come with it
while they probably do n't realize it , their public tantrums are turning people against them and hurting the chances for a broader immigration reform package
and if they set back that cause , heaven help them
they 'll sink the progress for a group of people who have given more , worked harder and made greater sacrifices -- people like their undocumented parents
you know , the people who brought them to this country in the first place for a better life , and then fed them , clothed them and sheltered them
these are the folks who told the @entity3 they were special , long before that became the official position of the immigration reform movement
that does n't sit well with a lot of @entity75 -- especially @entity75 - born @entity207 who were raised to believe that , in this life , you get what you earn
according to polls , some 80 % of them support the @entity3
but , for a while now , i 've detected some discomfort with the @entity3 , particularly their tone and tactics
it comes from people like @entity218 , a @entity219 - @entity75 political strategist in @entity220 ( disclosure : he 's a friend and business partner ) who supports comprehensive immigration reform and has the credentials to prove it
more than 25 years ago , @entity218 was executive director of the @entity226 and helped shape the 1986 @entity227
today , a lot of folks on the left talk about creating a pathway to legal status for millions of the undocumented
this guy actually helped do it
@entity3 : deferred deportation for almost a year , i 've been listening to him grumble about the @entity3 and their goals
" it appears that the agenda was all about getting attention , believing that this would solve their issue " he said
" they seem to be saying , ' if you pay attention to me , i become powerful
so we may be undocumented , but we are powerful now
you 're denying us our dream
now we demand that you do this for us
' @entity252 is necessary , but demands are not
we want solutions , but not only for one segment of a much larger community in need
" @entity218 worries that the @entity3 could , through their hubris , alienate supporters and make it harder to win the backing of @entity175 for a larger immigration reform plan
a lot of @entity3 are drunk on entitlement
but why should this surprise us ? feeling entitled is the @entity75 way
and these kids are as @entity75 as they come
they may have been born in another country , but -- unlike their parents -- they were raised in this one
they bleed red , white and blue , use @entity271 as their primary language and tweet up a storm before breakfast
and in a country whose motto has gone from " @entity279 " to " gim me , gim me
where 's mine ? , " they 're not about to be left behind
dream'ers were n't born ; they were created
not long ago , the conventional wisdom in @entity285 was that immigration reform was n't going to happen soon
so forget women and children
no wonder these kids think they 're special
undocumented students in their own words there 's only one problem
these people are still in the @entity75 illegally
they do n't like being reminded of this , but it 's true
so they 'd be wise to tread lightly -- especially since they do n't have the leverage they once did
these kids are just not that special anymore
that is , except to themselves
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity309 .
