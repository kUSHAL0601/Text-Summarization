-- running a country ? there 's an app for that
when @entity8 's prime minister found himself stuck in @entity9 as a volcanic cloud grounded flights to @entity12 , he fired up his new @entity13 and did the job remotely
in what could be a first for the new gadget , @entity15 told @entity0 he used the @entity13 to manage the situation at home as @entity8 closed its airspace under threat from the ash
a photograph of @entity15 using the device was posted on the internet by @entity8 officials under the title " the prime minister is working at the airport
" there are good means of communication , i have close contacts with my office all the times , and there are a lot of activities in @entity8 where we try to reduce the consequences of the volcano in @entity8 , " @entity15 told @entity0
" it 's very normal for a pm to travel abroad so this is not different from the other travels , it 's just lasts some days more than expected
we have the internet , the mobile phone
" i also use an @entity13 , which is excellent
" like many other travelers grounded by the volcanic ash cloud , @entity15 has sought alternative routes to reach home , catching a flight to @entity55 , @entity56 before completing the journey overland
" i am afraid we wo n't be back before saturday because i think most of our travel is going to be by car because the most of the airports in the @entity64 part of @entity12 are now closed , " he said .
