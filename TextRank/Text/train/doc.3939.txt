-- the adoptive mother of a @entity4 girl found dead in a plastic bag in her husband 's truck has been charged with first - degree murder , police said saturday
@entity10 also faces seven counts of aggravated child abuse and seven counts of child neglect , the @entity9 said in a press release
authorities have said @entity10 -- the 10 - year - old girl 's adoptive father and @entity10 's husband -- parked his pest control truck alongside @entity20 on february 14
a roadside ranger said he found @entity10 beside the truck and his adopted son ill inside the vehicle , which was filled with toxic chemicals
the boy was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe burns
the body of his adopted daughter , @entity30 -- who is the boy 's twin sister -- was later discovered in the back of the truck in a plastic bag
four days later , @entity10 pleaded not guilty on charges of attempted first - degree murder with a weapon and aggravated child abuse with a weapon in the case
at least two people tried to warn authorities about alleged abuse of the twins
in one instance , a caller told @entity4 authorities that he knew @entity10 and @entity10 , and he was worried about the couple 's twins
the contents of that phone call , which was made two days before the twins were found , was released this week by the @entity52
the caller said he was worried that something sinister had happened to the 10 - year - old girl because @entity10 and @entity10 could not explain where the girl was
" ( @entity10 ) does n't come out with a straight answer which is worrying me so much that something might have happened to that little girl , " said the caller , who was not named
four days before the twins were found , a therapist told authorities that the children are " taped up ... and put in a bathtub , " according to another abuse hotline call also released this week
" they are in there , all day and all night , " said the therapist , who was not named
an independent panel has been asked to investigate the actions of @entity4 's child protection system in the case
the @entity9 said saturday that " this continues to be active investigation , " adding that a press briefing is scheduled for monday .
