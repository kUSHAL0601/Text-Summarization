-- in response to @entity4 's invasion and annexation of parts of @entity7 , president @entity1 this week announced new sanctions against 11 @entity4 and @entity7 officials
these sanctions , issued in concert with similar announcements by the @entity13 , are wildly disproportionate
disproportionately small , that is
we are ignoring the lessons of history that demonstrate how unusual and unacceptable invasion and annexation are in the @entity21 era
@entity4 has unleashed a process of domination and annexation that will lead to territorial acquisition by force
although this has been roundly condemned rhetorically by many world leaders , including our own , the paltry international response thus far indicates that this aggression is not being taken seriously enough
we do not live in a @entity32 age when force of arms determines boarders
the @entity36 has codified the modern view of the international community -- a view that utterly rejects ancient practices of conquest by force
further , forceful international reaction to banditry like that of @entity4 president @entity45 provides the opportunity to reinforce the new norm and the strength of feeling followed by the commitment to enforce it
the sanctions announced by the @entity1 administration and our @entity54 allies not only fail to measure up to those new standards , but this rap on a few knuckles will surely encourage the @entity4 aggressors and alarm its neighbors
there are no more than 20 instances of attempted aggression , invasion and annexation since the end of @entity69 's conquest of @entity70 in 1975 followed two decades of war attempting to resist it
@entity73 was annexed by @entity74 in 1975 , leading to two decades of guerrilla war and eventual independence
the international community never recognized the annexation , and vigorous @entity36 peacekeeping and engagement was critical to solution
@entity83 's annexation of the @entity84 has led to almost 40 years of war and continuous international efforts at negotiation
the invasion and annexation of @entity90 in 1990 led to a massive international effort to reverse that move , involving a half million @entity94 troops
@entity96 's invasion of the @entity97 in 1982 was met with full - fledged naval warfare by the forces of the @entity100
@entity4 's invasion of @entity7 and imminent territorial annexation must be viewed in this historical context
the bogus referendum this past weekend fools no one
the international response so far is to deny visas to a small group of @entity4 officials and deny them access to whatever property they have stashed abroad
this simply is not enough
sen. @entity114 , @entity115 , and i introduced a resolution earlier this month outlining specific steps we believe the administration should take to sanction and isolate @entity4
the full @entity121 unanimously supported that resolution , yet the administration has chosen to take none of these steps
last week i asked secretary of state @entity124 if the @entity125 is considering any of the recommendations we put forward , ideas backed by all 100 @entity94 senators
his reply was dismissive and nonresponsive
sanctioning a handful of @entity4 most responsible for this aggression is a good first step , but too little to influence a change in the @entity4 position
much more needs to be done
there is strong bipartisan support for more forceful economic sanctions than what the administration announced on monday
we must take more meaningful -- and more properly proportionate -- steps to respond to this outrage of aggression
join us on @entity146 / @entity145
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity149 .
