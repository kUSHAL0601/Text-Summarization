@entity0 -- @entity5 host @entity4 offered a " heartfelt " apology before a live studio audience monday to his wife and female staffers over last week 's " sextortion " revelations , fans at the taping said
@entity4 has mined private events in his life for very public jokes on his show
" he really handled it head on , but it was funny too , " audience member @entity15 of @entity16 , @entity0 , told @entity1 after the taping
" you could tell he 'd been though a difficult situation and that he was sorry that he hurt other people , but he was also able to keep it funny , throw humor into it too , " @entity15 said
@entity4 revealed on his show thursday night he had sex with members of his staff and that he testified about those liaisons before a @entity0 grand jury for a case involving an alleged attempted extortion
a @entity33 producer is accused of threatening to go public with allegedly embarrassing information about @entity4 's private life , unless the 62 - year - old funnyman paid $ 2 million
monday 's mea culpa marked his first public remarks since last week 's admission
" the staff here has been wonderfully supportive to me , not just through this furor , but through all the years that we 've been on television
... so , again , my thanks to the staff for , once again , putting up with something stupid i 've gotten myself involved in , " @entity4 said , according to excerpts released monday by production company @entity48
" now the other thing is my wife , @entity51
she has been horribly hurt by my behavior , and when something happens like that , if you hurt a person and it 's your responsibility , you try to fix it
and at that point , there 's only two things that can happen : either you 're going to make some progress and get it fixed , or you 're going to fall short and perhaps not get it fixed , so let me tell you folks , i got my work cut out for me
" another audience member said @entity4 's apology to his wife appeared to evoke sympathy from some in the crowd
" when he made the apology to his wife he was very serious , not looking for any laughs , when he said he had a lot of work -- a lot of work to do on the homefront , " said a man who identified himself as @entity73
" that was very heartfelt , a lot of women in the crowd -- i could hear them literally saying , ' awww , ' that they felt for @entity4 and the dilemma he 's probably going through
" although @entity4 first admitted the plot and sexual relationships very publicly on his show , most videos of the segment were taken down from @entity92 this weekend at the request of @entity33
the @entity94 reported an unnamed source said @entity33 made the copyright infringement claim at the request of @entity48 , the production company owned by @entity4 which produces his show
@entity33 and @entity99 , which owns @entity92 , both had no comment about the videos being taken down
at least some fans appear willing to forgive @entity4 for his admitted dalliances
" i still think he 's the king of late night comedy , " @entity15 said
