my parents , @entity2 and @entity3 , met only twice before their wedding 30 years ago in southern @entity6
" @entity8 " is a stretch
my mother was 21 and had no say in the pairing
it was a shock to her when the man who came to see her was my father
she did n't understand why her brothers and her father would set her up with a man 11 years older , from a family that was so different from hers
he was a city boy , had traveled to and lived in various parts of @entity6
he enjoyed cheese puffs , knew how to eat with chopsticks and the names of different types of alcohol
she had never ventured too far out of her town of @entity32 , had never heard of these foods and alcohol was an unspeakable word
whether it was a desperate match to stop a few town boys from pursuing her , or whether their horoscopes were perfectly aligned , she does n't know
but her brother had a great feeling about it , and the match was made
they had no choice but to trust that their parents knew what they were doing , and they went with it
they were thrown into a relationship , their first and only one , and slowly learned everything about that person -- raw and true -- from the beginning
they grew together because it was new and awkward and special for both of them
and no matter what came their way -- scraping for dowries , moving countries , a heart attack , the death of a child -- they stayed together and they dealt with it
they did n't even know that it could be any other way
i think there 's a beauty to that
@entity6 parents are n't the best at expressing love , in my experience
they do n't think the words are necessary when you support each other for ... well , forever
but over the past few years , my parents have individually divulged their fondness for one another to me
and maybe because i 'm older now , i catch them looking adoringly at each other in the temple
stealing smiles in the kitchen
one discreetly stroking the other 's head
my father does n't like talking about his feelings , but a year ago , he told me my mother is his favorite person
when we tease him about their age difference , he says he likes taking care of her
he thinks she 's innocent , has a good heart and deserves to be taken care of
my mother says she and my father are 99 % made for each other
they are on the same page for all the things that matter
they are opposites in many ways
she does n't share his love for cricket or @entity115 , and he does n't engage in her discussions of @entity118 literature
but they are perfectly complementary
often my mother jokes and tells me even if she searches the heavens and @entity122 , she ca n't find a husband as great as hers for me
if that is n't love , i do n't know what is .
