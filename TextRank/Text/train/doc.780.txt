-- at @entity3 's home in the @entity5 capital , the television is more often switched to " @entity6 " and " @entity7 " than the news
not that the 22 - year - old college student wants anyone to think her superficial , but it 's her way of coping with the ominous -- the heated rhetoric of war with @entity14 and the @entity15
" my friends and i do n't talk about politics or the thought of a war , " she says , laughing
" i stopped watching the news all together
" @entity3 is not unlike millions of @entity5 who , like their neighboring @entity22 did in early 2003 , fear war is looming
@entity14 would face challenge in bombing @entity5 nuclear sites , experts say some are less worried than others -- a @entity31 fast food worker says @entity14 has been threatening @entity5 for years and this time is more of the same bluster
still , all the bellicose talk from national leaders and punishing international sanctions trickling down to average @entity5 who are paying higher prices for food and basic commodities , has cast an uneasy pall over life 's routine
@entity14 has threatened to bomb @entity5 to end or at least set back @entity5 's nuclear ambitions
@entity5 insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy purposes and has said it will not hesitate to strike back at its enemies
@entity15 president @entity47 has stated @entity5 developing nuclear weapons is not acceptable and that @entity50 " will always have @entity14 's back
" that sort of talk is unsettling to @entity3 , who like others in this story did not want their full names used for fear of repercussion
she tries to go about life focusing on her education and hanging out with friends in tony @entity31 coffee shops
she buys @entity62 at the local bazaar and swoons over @entity64
in many ways she is not unlike her @entity15 counterparts except that @entity3 lives in the @entity67 and her government is considered an enemy of @entity50
she thinks longingly about moving to @entity15 one day
in her country , she feels , she will never be able to freely express herself or her passion for art , music , films
she can not fathom why the @entity15 would consider an attack @entity5
opinion : @entity14 's ' @entity78 ' system is n't enough protection " i understand why @entity15 does n't like our government
they do n't agree that they should impose @entity86 on our society but that should not give them a reason for war , " she says
her parents worry that the bombing of @entity5 would create another situation like @entity22 in 2003
they are especially concerned because @entity3 's brother is 17 and because of @entity5 's mandatory conscription , he will have to serve in the military after high school
" if there were a war , no doubt my brother would be in danger , " she says
the family has applied for visas through @entity3 's aunt in @entity106
@entity3 prays every night that they will be granted
" i have faith in ( @entity47 ) @entity47 's policies , " she says
" i think he is a smart man who in the end will make the right decision to not start a war with @entity5
" nevertheless , a sense of panic is on the rise in cities and towns across @entity5 over the prospect of guns and no butter
tighter sanctions drove down the @entity5 currency , the rial , and @entity5 gobbled up gold , @entity15 dollars and even real estate in order to protect their savings
food prices have soared , too , prompting some to stockpile basic items in case an even darker day looms over the horizon
this week the strangling of @entity5 's finances got tighter
@entity135 , the world 's largest electronic banking system , agreed to cut off @entity5 banks and individuals on the @entity141 's sanctions list
starting at noon saturday , @entity5 will be severed from the main vehicle for monetary transactions
@entity5 's business partners , including vital crude oil customers who account for half of the government 's revenues , will have to find an alternative way to pay
beyond staggering inflation and a plunging national currency , analysts fear @entity5 now could face shortages of essential goods like food and medicine
retired elementary school teacher @entity158 , 67 , lives in the city of @entity160 , just south of @entity161 , an uranium enrichment facility for power plants or potentially for bombs
in her modest two - bedroom apartment , she cares for her two grandchildren because her daughter was forced to go back to work to make ends meet
she takes the children for walks in a nearby park and wonders what would happen if @entity14 conducted military strikes against @entity5 's nuclear plants and military installations
" @entity5 are educated , fun - loving people , " she says
" we are against war and against aggression
" she wishes @entity15 knew more about the rich history of her country -- art , music , poetry -- and about the turmoil @entity5 have survived
" i honestly think they look at us as terrorists , like the ones that are portrayed in the movies , ' she says
" they think we wear burkas like they do in @entity194 , and do n't allow women to drive like in @entity196
@entity5 is different , we are different
we want peace like anyone else in this world
" @entity158 's anxiety is heightened on sundays when she heads to the fruit and vegetable market
last week , the price of tomatoes went up so much that she could not justify buying them
the butcher told her he had n't seen profit in two months -- who can afford to buy meat anymore ? she tried to buy @entity15 dollars recently but the bank informed her of limits on how much she could exchange
" i always like to save some dollars in my house , just in case , " she says
@entity215 , the @entity216 new year , is coming up march 20 , but @entity158 says this year , the traditional meals and large get togethers will be a lot simpler
" i 'm worried that our beautiful country will become similar to what the @entity15 did to @entity22 , " she says
" i pray to @entity223 they do n't
i love @entity15 and love @entity15
but i do n't understand the need to meddle in our country 's issues
" she says she is willing to live with @entity5 's problems , if only she could have a guarantee of no war
" that would be the end to our livelihoods and the little freedom we have now , " she says
back in @entity31 , @entity238 , 39 , says he is more concerned about facing economic hardship than dodging missiles and rockets
" it 's all bluffing and political nonsense , " says the university @entity243 instructor about threats from @entity14 and the @entity246
" this happens every few years between @entity5 , @entity14 and the @entity249 is normal , " he says
" in a month it will quiet down again and in two years it will flare up again
this is the political wheel , always spinning
@entity47 has said he does n't want a war with @entity5 , and we all know @entity14 can not proceed with a war alone
" @entity238 sees money as his number one problem
he resents having to rely on his parents for support but he , his wife and child are forced to stay in an extra apartment at his parents ' home
even though he has a degree and good job , his salary is no match for the prices at the market
" my advice to my country is to open our doors to the world , " he says
" let 's show them that we have a right to nuclear technology , and that we are not making nuclear weapons
the @entity281 nations always want to have their hands in other countries
i 'm pretty sure unemployment and crime is high in @entity15
should n't they be focusing on that ? " the tension within @entity5 is affecting people outside its borders , too
@entity291 , 36 , and @entity292 , 34 , fled @entity5 with their mother after the 1979 revolution and have not been back since
they have not seen their grandparents since they were babies
@entity291 says her grandmother weeps on the phone every week when they speak over the continents and oceans
to see her granddaughters again would help her die a " blessed old woman
" the sisters , who live in @entity306 , planned to return to their homeland for the very first time for the @entity216 new year
they booked their tickets and arranged their trip to @entity311 , the city where her family used to live
" i was most excited about seeing all the places my mom talks about , " @entity291 says
that included the house where her mother was born
but a few weeks ago , once news broke of @entity14 possibly planning a spring strike , @entity291 's mother canceled the trip for her daughters
" i understand its for our safety , but i am really disappointed , " @entity291 says
" i hope one day this political mess will clear up and we can go
i 'm not giving up , but when i turn on the news , it does n't seem like things are getting better
" for now all that @entity291 and her sister will have to wait to see what the future bodes
as will all of @entity5 .
