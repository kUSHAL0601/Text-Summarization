@entity0 , @entity1 -- leaders of more than 30 @entity5 and @entity6 nations are meeting in @entity1 from monday to launch a group that will serve as an alternative to the @entity9
the main difference between the @entity9 and the yet - to - be - named organization will be that the @entity12 and @entity13 will not be members
leaders of @entity5 countries have been meeting almost every year since 1986 when the @entity17 was created by countries including @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity1 , @entity21 and @entity22
this year 's summit is intended to take the @entity17 to a new level by creating the organization
among the main topics to be discussed at the summit is whether to recognize @entity27 as the legitimate president of @entity29
@entity27 , who took office in late january , was elected under a de facto government that resulted from a coup in june against then - president @entity33
the ousted leader was then forced out of the country
other topics on the agenda include the creation of a long - term plan to help @entity40 recover from the devastating effects of the earthquake and @entity20 's conflict with @entity44 over oil drilling offshore from the @entity46
the @entity47 and the @entity6 will be held in @entity48 .
