players and match officials taking part in those games will wear black armbands , it said
@entity3 also has taken out large ads in newspapers with the message , " without respect , no football
" the ads say that respect is " more than a word " and calls on people to show that they are against violence
the cancellation affects 33,000 amateur games that would have been played over the weekend , according to @entity29 public media
two 15 - year - olds and a 16 - year - old -- all @entity34 club @entity32 players -- have been charged by @entity29 police following the death of 41 - year - old linesman @entity38
@entity38 's son was playing in the match for his club , @entity41 , when the incident occurred in the city of @entity44 on sunday
the linesman reportedly fell into a coma after he was beaten
he died the next day
the @entity29 football association said it was encouraging clubs to open their doors and talk to each other about the tragedy
a facebook page has been set up to allow players and fans to share their ideas , it said in a statement , and many amateur clubs are gathering people together this weekend to pay tribute to @entity38
" it is unbelievable that something like this can happen on a football field , " said @entity60 , the association 's director of professional football
" these are the volunteers our sport is built on , who we ca n't do without
" without respect , there is no football
this is also why we want to pay attention to this terrible situation
our thoughts go out to @entity38 's relatives
" the football association said it had decided to go ahead with the weekend 's professional matches so that fans and players would join together in a moment of remembrance and think about how to prevent such a tragedy recurring
" the association can not solve this problem alone
it can not be solved only on the football field ; there is no easy solution
a broad effort is needed , from government , schools , clubs , but certainly also from parents , " said @entity91 , director of amateur football
@entity38 's death resonated across the globe , with @entity100 president @entity99 among those extending condolences
" football is a mirror of society , and sadly the same ills that afflict society -- in this case violence -- also manifest themselves in our game , " said @entity99 , according to a statement on fifa.com
" nevertheless , i remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like mr. @entity38 -- is a force for good , and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs
" on its website @entity32 said it was " deeply shocked " by @entity38 's death , adding that it would ban for life the players found to be responsible , pull its team from the league and temporarily suspend all operations as a club
" violence should not be on the football fields , " said a statement on the @entity32 website
" and certainly not against referees , linesmen and all those others who volunteer each year to help over a million amateur footballers
we must do everything possible to eliminate these excesses
" despite a population of 17.5 million , @entity140 has built an outstanding reputation for developing young footballers over the years , with its amateur youth clubs providing a strong breeding ground for the country 's professional clubs
