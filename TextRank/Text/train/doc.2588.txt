@entity4 foreign minister @entity3 meets thursday with @entity1 president @entity5 in @entity0
the session follows the end of a tenuous 6 - month - long cease - fire between the @entity4 military and @entity7 militants in @entity13
@entity1 mediated the first truce and is trying to negotiate an extension despite what @entity4 says are dozens of rockets fired by @entity7 into the jewish state this week
@entity3 criticized @entity7 after her meeting with @entity5
" @entity7 needs to understand that @entity4 's basic desire to live in a tranquil region does n't mean that @entity4 is willing to accept ongoing shooting at its population , " she said , according to the @entity4 @entity20
we can not accept this situation , and the situation will change
" @entity1 expressed concern about a deteriorating humanitarian situation in @entity13 , an @entity4 @entity20 statement said
the @entity31 said this week that it would help countries and organizations deliver aid through @entity1 territory to @entity36 in @entity13
@entity3 also met with the head of @entity1 intelligence thursday and is scheduled to talk with the @entity1 foreign minister
@entity4 military officials said @entity7 militants fired more than 65 rockets into southern @entity4 on wednesday
meanwhile , the @entity4 air force said it killed a @entity7 militant who was part of a group launching the rockets into @entity4
an @entity4 police spokesman said no one had been injured in the latest barrage of rocket attacks
but emergency workers with @entity55 , @entity4 's @entity56 agency , treated 57 people suffering from shock , half of them children , an agency official said , adding that 200 ambulances were standing by in the area
" i think the circumstances are extremely tragic , that @entity65 zealots of @entity7 have decided to shatter and ruin the @entity67 celebrations of the christian brothers in the @entity69 , both in the @entity70 and of course in @entity13 itself , " @entity4 welfare minister @entity62 said
" if things deteriorate further , then of course we 'll have to take necessary action , which will be very painful , " @entity62 said , adding that civilians had gathered in shelters in southern @entity4 to try to stay safe amid the rocket attacks
asked about the possibility of @entity4 coming up with a new strategy , @entity62 responded , " the new strategy could be , of course , an all - out conflict against @entity7 , which is a possibility that voices in @entity4 are calling for
we are trying to show restraint
" @entity7 is a @entity36 islamic fundamentalist organization whose military wing , @entity85 , has admitted responsibility for terrorist attacks against @entity4 civilians as well as attacks against the @entity4 military
@entity4 and the @entity91 consider @entity7 a terrorist organization , though it also operates an extensive social services network in the territories
@entity95 , spokesman for @entity4 prime minister @entity96 , said , " our position is clear : we will answer quiet with quiet , and we will answer attacks with measures designed to protect our people
" @entity96 has threatened to respond to the ongoing attacks
the truce between the @entity7 government in @entity13 and @entity4 expired friday
under the @entity1 - brokered deal , @entity7 agreed to end militant attacks on @entity4 from @entity13 , and @entity4 agreed to halt raids inside the territory and ease its blockade on humanitarian goods
in reality , the truce had started breaking down two months ago
rocket attacks by militants became more frequent , and @entity4 resumed airstrikes inside @entity13
" we really appreciate the @entity1 efforts
... , " @entity62 said
" the @entity1 have tried endlessly and tirelessly in the past few weeks to bring @entity7 back to cease - fire mode
" @entity96 said sunday that @entity4 will " take the necessary measures " to respond to the rocket attacks and " will know when to respond correctly and with the necessary responsibility
" " a responsible government is neither eager for battle , nor does it shy away from it , " he said .
