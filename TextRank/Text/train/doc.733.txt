@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a country where 20 % of people live on less than a dollar a day , @entity3 is doing his level best to help the impoverished people of @entity1
@entity3 runs an @entity10 charity here called @entity12 , which arranges medical procedures done by @entity10 doctors and provides stoves to the poorest of the poor
so when he heard that 15 small @entity10 charities that have nothing to do with foreign aid claimed to have sent $ 40 million worth of medicines to @entity1 in a single year , he was surprised , to say the least
@entity3 said his charity runs 15,000 clinics throughout @entity1 at a cost of about $ 300,000 a year
" any charity that spends even a million dollars a year would be huge , " he said
documents obtained by @entity2 show that @entity26 , a private @entity27 company , claimed to have shipped nearly $ 40 million in medicines and other donations on behalf of 15 small charities to @entity1 in 2010
those same charities also reported sending another $ 10 million to @entity1 the next year
according to its tax filings , one of those @entity10 charities , @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity34 , claimed to have shipped $ 22 million of donations by itself in 2010
but a joint investigation by @entity2 , the @entity40 and the @entity41 could find no trace of even a fraction of those donations
@entity2 traveled across @entity1 to find these medicines , starting with the @entity46 , which was listed as the biggest recipient of @entity26 's alleged donations
all the @entity10 charity donations were funneled through the downtown @entity0 office of the @entity46 , a centuries - old charity with links to the @entity52 that is accorded diplomatic status by some countries
at the downtown building listed as the @entity46 's headquarters , a building manager said it had been five years since the @entity46 had offices there
inside another office building with an impressive sign saying it was the " embassy " of the @entity46 , an assistant said no one was inside
about an hour 's drive outside the capital , a guard stood outside a gated iron fence with a sign for the @entity46
the guard said the fence surrounded a warehouse with donated medicines , but he refused to allow @entity2 access
a spokesman for the @entity46 , @entity77 , later told @entity2 that it received two or three shipments a month in 2010 and 2011 from @entity10 charities , " depending on the season
" he would not respond to other questions
@entity82 , who signed for some of those donations in 2010 and 2011 , said he never saw any dollar amounts listed for the goods he received
he also told @entity2 that the @entity46 closed a clinic that had offered free mammograms for @entity1 women in 2011 because there were no funds to continue its operation
@entity82 , who said he left the @entity46 two years ago , now operates his own charity
what 's this all about ? charity watchdog groups said some @entity10 charities want to impress potential donors and therefore claim huge amounts of dollar values in medicines and other goods shipped abroad to poor countries
in reality , these charities send small amounts of goods and state regulators say they inflate the values time and time again
@entity110 , ceo of @entity26 , declined to say what precisely comprised the millions of dollars of goods sent to @entity1 , citing confidentiality for his clients
but he said in an e-mail that all the donations were valued by the charities and not by his shipping office
that 's not so , according to a spokeswoman for the @entity32 , one of the 15 small charities that donated items to @entity1 through @entity26
spokeswoman @entity124 said it was @entity26 that provided all the valuations
@entity127 also said @entity32 had " amended " some of its @entity129 filings to eliminate $ 12 million worth of claimed donations to @entity1
in addition , she said the @entity32 had given " $ 36 million of medicines and supplies to those in desperate need " to other @entity137 countries and to @entity139 nations
@entity40 ' charity checker back in the @entity1 countryside , @entity3 said he has never even heard of the @entity46 nor any of the @entity10 charities that claimed to have donated millions and millions of dollars ' worth of supplies
people in rural parts of the country , he said , are so impoverished that even a few dollars a day more and free medicine would mean the world
the huge donations claimed by these @entity10 charities , he said , just do n't happen in his world
