-- a @entity2 woman pleaded guilty tuesday to collecting a fraudulent $ 480,000 claim from @entity4 , a nonprofit that benefits victims of the @entity7 bombings , according to the @entity9 attorney general 's office
@entity10 , 27 , pleaded guilty to a charge of larceny over $ 250 and was sentenced by a @entity14 judge to two and a half to three years in prison , according to a statement from state attorney general @entity18
" it is disturbing that this defendant would attempt to steal from the real victims of the marathon bombing through fraud and deceit , " @entity18 said in a statement
@entity10 was awarded the $ 480,000 after submitting forged medical records in june 2013 indicating she had suffered a traumatic brain injury in the 2013 @entity29 that resulted in long - term memory loss , impaired speech and the loss of some motor function that would require future surgery , the attorney general 's office said
an investigation into @entity10 began after the @entity9 attorney general received a tip that she was not in @entity38 at the time of the bombing , @entity18 told a news conference in july
the attorney general 's office said that the investigation determined that @entity10 was not a patient at @entity44 on the day of the bombing nor @entity46 at the times she had indicated on her notarized claim form
investigators were later able to secure the nearly half a million dollars that @entity10 stole and will return it to one fund @entity38 , according to the attorney general 's office
the attorney general 's office said it has charged two other individuals with attempted fraud of one fund @entity38 and that both are awaiting trial
the one fund @entity38 began distributing nearly $ 61 million to more than 200 claimants starting last june , according to the fund 's website .
