-- @entity1 -- battered by a strong yen , slowing global demand and increased oil and gas imports due to last year 's @entity6 nuclear disaster -- posted a record trade deficit of $ 18.7 billion in january , according to official figures released monday
the record fall was stoked by greater energy imports of gas and oil following the @entity13 , tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster at the @entity17 power plant , which forced the closure of most of @entity1 's atomic power plants
" the sharp increase of oil price could be the main reason of the sharp deterioration of trade balance , " said @entity20 , chief economist for @entity21 in @entity22
currently , only five reactors out of 54 in the country are in operation after officials allowed most to fall idle in the wake of the @entity6 disaster
by april , if more reactors are not brought online the country will have no nuclear plants in operation , placing more pressure on its energy suppliers
liquid natural gas imports alone climbed 28.2 % year on year , according to the ministry 's preliminary report
last month , @entity44 nuclear experts gave a thumbs - up to @entity1 's planned " stress tests " for its remaining nuclear power plants to test whether they could withstand another emergency
the team from the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) recommended @entity1 regulators improve communication with the residents around the plants and address plans for dealing with severe accidents more comprehensively in the wake of the worst nuclear accident since @entity59 in 1986
monday 's record deficit comes after @entity1 posted in 2011 its first annual trade deficit in 31 years , and underlines the difficulties facing the export - driven nation as it looks to rebuild
but the world 's third largest economy faces difficult headwinds with a currency that reached record - high levels in the past year , cutting profits returning home from multinational companies and slowing demand from major trading partners such as the @entity75 and @entity76
exports fell 9.3 % year - on - year , according to figures released by the country 's @entity79 monday
the biggest drop was with @entity76 , which fell 20.1 %
exports to @entity83 fell 7.7 % , while trade with the @entity85 was up 0.6 %
january was the fourth straight month where imports outpaced exports
