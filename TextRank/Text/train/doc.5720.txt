-- @entity2 screens are about to get a lot bigger , if a new report is to be believed
suppliers in @entity6 are about to start work on two new iphones , according to an article from @entity9
the phones will have display screens that are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches across , when measured diagonally -- a major leap from the 4 - inch displays on the @entity14 and @entity15
such a move would appear to be an effort to keep up with the competition
rival smartphones , most notably those from @entity21 , have been packing ever - larger displays in recent years
if these rumors are true , the bigger @entity2 would nearly match the screen size of @entity21 's massive @entity25 , with its pocket - busting , 5.7 - inch " phablet " display
the @entity31 company 's flagship @entity28 has a 5.1 - inch display , the new @entity33 has a 5 - inch screen and the recently announced @entity36 phone checks in at 4.7 inches
the @entity9 report says the new @entity2 will ship to retailers " around september " and be more rounded and thinner than previous models
that would be consistent with launch patterns from @entity42 , which for the past several years has announced new iphones in early fall
if the report is true , this would mark the second consecutive year @entity42 has released two phones
last year , @entity42 borrowed from the playbook of @entity21 and other competitors by releasing the high - end @entity14 and the cheaper , more colorful @entity15 model
almost a year later , the plastic @entity15 sells for as low as $ 99 with a wireless contract
for the previous six years , @entity42 had offered only a single , iconic phone even as competitors rolled out phones with many sizes , shapes and prices
the new @entity2 may also be part of a one - two punch from @entity42 , which has been under pressure to innovate and which has promised new products in 2014
reports have said a long - awaited @entity42 smartwatch is also coming this fall
a @entity65 report says the watch will have a 2.5 - inch screen and be " slightly rectangular
