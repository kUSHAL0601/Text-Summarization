-- @entity1 defied the conditions to record the fastest lap on the final day of @entity5 testing at @entity6 friday -- but the @entity7 refused to entertain any title talk
@entity1 , who quit @entity9 to join @entity10 at the end of last season , beat former teammate @entity13 into second place with @entity16 's @entity15 in third
@entity1 clocked a time of 1 minute 23.282 seconds , despite the constant rain and adverse weather at the @entity21 circuit
@entity22 : @entity23 better than last year but the 2008 world champion insists his team is not ready to compete with the likes of @entity23 's triple world champion @entity22 and @entity28 's @entity27 when the new season starts in @entity30 on march 17
" i think people are talking us up at the moment , " @entity1 told reporters
" @entity22 , and maybe @entity27 , were saying i 'm maybe going to be competing for the world championship , but i really do n't see that happening at the moment
" of course that 's our goal , but you have to remember the car was over a second off , sometimes two seconds off , last year and we 've not caught up a second
" other teams will also have put a second on over the winter , so we 've not gained three seconds , that 's a fact
" hopefully by the end of the year , that 's our goal , but definitely not at the beginning
" @entity27 demands @entity28 improvement elsewhere , @entity9 's @entity13 recorded the day 's second fastest time , coming home in 1 minute 23.633 seconds with @entity15 recording a time of 1 minute 24.071 seconds
the best time of the week belonged to @entity1 's replacement at @entity9 , @entity54 's @entity53 , who completed his fastest lap in 1 minute 21.848 seconds .
