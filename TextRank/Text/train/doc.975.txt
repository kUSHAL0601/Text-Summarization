harvesting papayas is @entity3 's livelihood
he 's determined to get the best out of his trees , which grow in the farming community of @entity7 , west of the @entity9 capital of @entity10
to get the juiciest fruit , careful planning and preparation is vital
" if you want to kill the weeds , you put on your knapsack sprayer , put in water and chemicals , take your protective clothes and then spray , " @entity3 explains
" you kill all the weeds , that 's the practice
" @entity9 may not produce as many papayas ( also known as pawpaw ) as @entity25 , but the country was formerly a big exporter of the brightly colored commodity
these days , it is pineapple which is key for @entity9 growers , who exported close to 46,000 tonnes in 2011
business survival with labor and input costs increasing for those in the agricultural sector , farmers in the country face enormous pressure to sustain their business
as over 53 % of @entity9 's total workforce was employed in agriculture in 2013 , surviving these harsh conditions is essential for the @entity45 nation
and survival means thinking smart and being business savvy
" agribusiness for me denotes the collective business activities that are performed from farm to the dining table , " explains @entity48 , regional director of @entity49
" these involve input supply , the production of food and the actual delivery of food to the end user
" the group @entity62 runs is devoted to helping farmers and other agricultural workers grow their operations by offering training in good business practices
" most agribusiness entrepreneurs are not running their companies as businesses , but rather as lifestyle companies , " @entity48 says
" without much vision , without enough corporate governance structures , without proper record keeping systems
" creative collaboration the biggest problem @entity48 sees with agribusinesses is that key decisions are made by the owners without involving their workers
he considers this management structure as a threat to both the growth and the survival of some agribusinesses
through its three - month training workshop , @entity49 seeks to improve the skills of @entity88 , who in turn will have " better access to appropriate resources for growth
" the benefits of working in a collaborative way are stressed to the participants who at the end of the program form clubs to share ideas and support each other
" most [ participants ] are well experienced and have a lot of skills and experience that would be useful for their colleagues , " @entity48 says
" these clubs form a repository of skills , knowledge and experience that young entrepreneurs , especially in the agribusiness sector , can rely on to start their businesses and turn it around
" another potential benefit that could emerge from this collaborative approach is diversifying output
" farmers are not looking for hand - outs , " says @entity117 , agribusiness executive for @entity118
" [ we can ] really raise the contribution of agriculture to the gdp , and in fact , diversify the kind of crops that we depend on and also make the economy more robust
" expanding operations as well as gaining knowledge from the workshop , some farmers also come away with increased confidence
" it 's very expensive raising chickens in @entity9 , " explains @entity133 , who runs an egg business with his wife in @entity7
" chicks are very expensive , then the feed is also very expensive , and then
at times , diseases also disturb us -- especially if you do n't give them the right vaccinations
" having recently completed the training , @entity133 is now beginning to think big
his plans include expanding beyond @entity7 , and to possibly even @entity10
such a move would require external capital investment
" there is enough funding available for agribusiness entrepreneurs but most investors would want to see some structures in the businesses in order to have enough confidence to put their money in , " argues @entity48
" if there are no corporate governance structures , the investor would not be interested
" pig farmer @entity161 , who also produces chicken and papaya , has seen the benefits of learning business skills
" i have acquired a lot of insight into my marketing strategy and administration , " @entity161 explains
" now i can be able to prepare my own accounts
i have also gotten [ to know ] that i have to involve the workers , the attendants in my vision , my program
because i have to let them know the program we have for the farm -- they should also be part of it
" part of this collaborative approach is involving his neighbor , cattle man @entity183
now , when @entity161 has a problem @entity183 is ready to help and he too has changed his way of thinking
with a solid business foundation , and the help of some good neighbors , these farmers are confident they will reap the rewards
" if you ca n't get inspired by these guys , you wo n't be inspired by anything in your entire life , " says @entity48
" we need ... to make sure that they grow their businesses , make a few dollars , but contribute a lot to the food security , not just in @entity9 , but in @entity200
