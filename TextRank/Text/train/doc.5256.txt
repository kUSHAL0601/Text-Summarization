@entity0 -- the sign language interpreter widely ridiculed for his performance at the @entity6 memorial stands by his work
@entity9 said thursday that he is a fully qualified interpreter and has been trusted in the past with other big events
" it has been many years i have been doing this job " he told @entity1
" my portfolio shows that i have been a champion of what i have been doing
" not so , says the head of the @entity17
there were complaints last year after @entity9 interpreted the proceedings at the ruling @entity24 elective conference , the institute 's chairman , @entity18 , told the @entity25
but @entity9 stands by his work
" i have never in my life had anything that said i have interpreted wrong , " he said
" for the deaf association , if they think that i have done a wrong interpretation , i ask forgiveness
for @entity38 , if they are telling me that i was doing a wrong interpretation , then they should answer me why they were silent all the time , all these years , " he said , referring to the @entity32 of @entity33 , which has criticized his work at the service
@entity9 declined to provide details about his hire for the four - hour memorial , watched by millions around the world , as a government inquiry looks into the matter
he said he had been drawn to the job of interpreting because he was disabled
" i am suffering from schizophrenia , which is controllable
i am under treatment , " @entity9 said
at a news conference thursday , @entity50 , @entity33 's deputy minister of women , children and people with disabilities , admitted that mistakes had happened at the memorial service but added that @entity9 was not a " fake
" she said there was no sign language standard in @entity33 and deaf people spoke different dialects
she added that the government was looking into the vetting of @entity9 's security clearance at the memorial
" but normally when you do provide a service at a particular level , you will be vetted
and as you could see , he had his accreditation , so he did n't just walk through , " she said
sign educators on @entity6 interpreter questions grow @entity50 also said the government tracked down the company @entity9 worked for , but the owners " seemed to have vanished
" " we managed to get hold of them and then we spoke to them , wanting some answers , and they vanished into thin air , " she said
" they have been providing substandard service for years
" @entity9 named his employer as a company called @entity87
he did not give details about his training , saying his qualifications are filed with the company
" you can look at my portfolio , it speaks for itself from the events that i have done in my country , " he said
as outrage over his interpretation skills have grown , so have questions about who hired him
the @entity24 said it did not hire @entity9 for the service , as it was the state that had organized the memorial
" the processes that were followed to procure mr. @entity9 's services were thus government processes and not @entity24 processes , " the ruling party said in a prepared statement , adding that it had used his services before
" it is important to make the point that , up until yesterday , the @entity24 had not been aware of any of complaints regarding the quality of services , qualifications or reported illnesses of mr @entity9
" interpreter at @entity6 memorial a fake , group says ' a dream come true ' @entity9 said he was proud to receive a call saying he would be interpreting at the memorial for the revered statesman , who died last week at age 95
asked who had called him to tell him he would be interpreting , he just said : " it is a lady that i am serving under
" he said the atmosphere on the day was " wonderful
" " it was a dream come true , " he said , adding that he felt as if he had reached " the standard of the champion of the whole world
" at the service , at which world leaders from president @entity137 to @entity139 's @entity138 spoke , he said he was doing @entity33 sign language
' fake interpreter ' but the national director of the @entity32 of @entity33 sees it differently
he said @entity9 had been dubbed a " fake interpreter
" " the deaf community is in outrage , " said @entity146
" he is not known by the @entity149 in @entity33 nor by the @entity151 interpreters working in the field
" the man showed no facial expressions , which are key in @entity33 sign language , and his hand signals were meaningless , @entity146 said
" it is a total mockery of the language , " he added
while dignitaries addressed the crowd at @entity0 's @entity161 , @entity9 produced a series of hand signals that experts said meant nothing
" it was almost like he was doing baseball signs , " deaf actress @entity166 told @entity1 on wednesday , through a sign language interpreter
" though each country has its own sign language , all of them entail facial expressions , she said
she called his lack of facial expression " a giveaway
" " i knew exactly right then and there that he was n't authentic at all , and it was offensive ; it was offensive to me
" @entity166 : i knew interpreter was fake @entity1 's @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .
