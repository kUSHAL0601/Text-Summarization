the scope and legality of the government 's warrantless electronic surveillance programs was discussed tuesday as a federal appeals court reviewed a lower @entity7 court 's injunction that would block collection of data from two plaintiffs who are suing activist @entity11 , an attorney who heads the group " @entity13 , " filed suit last year based on published reports of wrongdoing from whistleblower @entity17
the former contractor with the @entity19 accused authorities of misusing some of the capabilities he observed , and acting without a judicial or statutory basis
@entity11 , using himself as an aggrieved party from the surveillance , used the lawsuit to accuse the government of conducting " a secret and illegal government scheme to intercept and analyze vast quantities of domestic telephonic communications , " along with communications " from the internet and electronic service providers
" tuesday he said he has the standing to bring the suit as a customer of @entity37 , one of the companies known to be cooperating with warrantless surveillance
but when the appeals panel asked him for documented proof he had been targeted , @entity11 said only that the broad scope of the surveillance made it likely
the other plaintiff is @entity46 , whose son @entity47 was an @entity19 cryptologist and @entity48 in @entity49 in 2011 when he was killed in the downing of his helicopter by insurgents
the father told reporters he has been the target of secret intelligence gathering because he 's been asking questions about the circumstances surrounding his son 's death
both men late last year won a preliminary injunction that would have barred the government from collecting data on them , and it ordered authorities to destroy any data already gathered
but the @entity69 judge immediately stayed his order pending the appeal that was heard tuesday , because of " significant national security interests " that could be affected
@entity76 attorney @entity74 , defending the government , asked the appeals court judges to reverse the injunction , saying a phone company 's business records are not protected by the @entity81 against unreasonable searches
@entity83 said there was no documentation that any records gathered were " intrusively acquired
" he said @entity87 passes laws to protect privacy , such as for hospital records and banking , and that the government 's surveillance is constrained by the provisions of the @entity95 , with activities judged by the secret @entity97
@entity11 responded by pointing out the government 's admission of as many as 2,000 errors in how @entity19 conducted warrantless surveillance
" it 's false to say ' we do n't get into peoples ' underwear , ' " @entity11 said , asserting the indiscriminate collection alone is an intrusion he considers unconstitutional
after the hearing , @entity11 told reporters on the courthouse steps that he expects a ruling early next year , and that he expects the case to go the @entity113
he called warrantless surveillance by the government a case of monumental importance
" just the inception of acquiring that information -- they 're not entitled to it -- without any showing of probable cause , or reasonable suspicion of contact with terrorists , that 's the problem
and that 's a constitutional violation under our @entity81 and our @entity129
" @entity11 acknowledged in court he 's been a controversial figure over the years
a judge asked him if he feels he is being personally targeted
" i 'd be surprised if i 'm not , " he replied
among his recent lawsuits is one filed in october accusing the @entity136 administration of supporting terrorism because of what he considers " reckless and grossly negligent " handling of the @entity141 crisis
@entity11 , in that lawsuit , said the lack of travel restrictions from areas affected by the @entity141 crisis provides an opportunity for terrorists to use the disease for germ warfare .
