-- you 're engaged ! congratulations ! here 's how not to go broke , and still show your guests a fantastic time
rank your priorities what facets of your wedding are most important to you ? focus on areas that make your heart go pitter - patter , and you 'll feel ok about skimping on the rest
as for what guests tend to remember , according to a survey conducted by @entity17 and @entity19 magazine , 81 % of guests say the entertainment is the most memorable part of a wedding
recruit friends think of it as cost - free outsourcing
gather your inner circle , play to their strengths ( e.g. , assign lettering to the friend with the most beautiful handwriting ) , and turn the prep into a party
@entity36 : the @entity37 ( @entity38 and @entity39 ! ) be ruthless with the head count quick tips for whittling your guest list : omit children and coworkers ( making cuts categorically is less likely to cause rifts ) ; and when it comes to couples , invite spouses , fiances , and live - ins only
keep the numbers down for your wedding party as well : fewer attendants means less money spent on bouquets , boutonnieres , presents and transportation
think out - of - the - banquet - hall " pick a venue that already has a chic ambience , " suggests @entity62 of wedding blog @entity64
" restaurants are usually the best option
they have gorgeous tables and chairs , and the decor is often easy to fall in love with
you 'll save an absolute bundle
" @entity77 you can break seek free fonts finding the perfect typeface that 's also free is a bit like searching for the @entity81
here 's reason to rejoice : four decidedly un-tacky fonts that do n't cost a hard - earned dime
top row from left in slide five : customize place cards , coasters , menus , or thank - you notes with simple @entity92 serif or @entity93 , from @entity94
bottom row : use the more stylized @entity99 kk and hoedown fonts from @entity100 to stand in for a calligrapher or give a " just married " sign a retro @entity103 kick
forgo a program " a lot of my clients are opting for no printed program , " says @entity106 wedding planner @entity105 , owner of @entity107
" it 's an extra cost and extra stress , and it 's unnecessary
the most important words are the vows , and those are never in there
" @entity36 : @entity117 and @entity118 you 've never heard before think monochromatic from your invites ( using one shade of ink means big savings on letterpress ) to your flowers , choosing a single overall hue creates an instantly chic party at a fraction of the price
notes @entity131 , a caterer and author of " @entity134 ! weddings : how to @entity139 " , " color is cheap , and it can become your theme
" take up hunting bargain hunting , that is
you can find everything from fabric and trim to antique @entity147 jars on @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 or at a local flea market , for half the price and twice the charm
@entity154 of @entity155 buy in - season " my best tip is to stay seasonal and local
i made this bouquet for $ 50 , using anemones , parrot tulips , and ranunculus , all spring flowers , " says @entity158 , of @entity159 in @entity106
pick the right kicks buy shoes that you 'll actually wear again after the wedding -- something you likely wo n't do with white heels
stunners like the ones pictured above in slide 10 by @entity173 , @entity174 , and @entity175 are good for the long run
@entity177 : @entity179 's wedding : behind - the - @entity180 supersize your flowers choosing bigger buds means you 'll need fewer stems , thereby helping your bottom line
in " @entity185 : the @entity194 's @entity195 , " author @entity186 recommends blooms such as @entity189 marigolds , gladiolus , and " @entity193 " lilies , which easily fill a room
make your flowers work overtime one of the simplest ways to save can also be one of the loveliest
let potted flowering plants -- whichever ones are in season -- act as both living centerpieces and favors that guests can tote home
