@entity0 -- references to drugs , comments about hazing and pictures of semi-nude women taken from posts on a closed @entity10 page have prompted the suspension of @entity13 fraternity on @entity15 's @entity0 campus
an e-mail containing 70 screen grabs of posts allegedly found on the @entity10 page for active members of @entity13 , also known as @entity21 , were sent to school officials and members of the media , including @entity1 affiliate @entity25
" anyone have a connect for coke , not me , a friends wants , lol , " says one post , while others mention " study drugs
" there are offers to sell @entity36 and @entity37 , drugs prescribed to people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
several postings allegedly made by members of the fraternity make reference to the " @entity21 pharmacy
" one lets the group know the " @entity46 is on campus all day today again " and leaves a phone number to call
@entity1 called that number and every number contained in the posts and was told " no comment " by three people
one said , " i have no idea what 's going on " before hanging up the phone
although most of the social media chatter in the screen grabs involved talk of drugs and alcohol , there were a few that made reference to hazing , one offering this advice , " @entity69 ( * ! out of @entity70 ...
" the obscenities in the screen grabs are numerous , as are the derogatory comments , especially those in reference to their female coeds
a few semi-naked pictures of women were included
one of the pictures showed a topless female , with the comment : " i think she was 17 at the time of the titi pics ... lol
" @entity15 declined @entity1 's request for an interview but said in a statement that it " took prompt action and placed the fraternity on interim suspension pending the outcome of investigations by appropriate university departments , including the police
" the board of directors of the @entity96 suspended the @entity15 chapter over the " disgraceful , offensive and indefensible " behavior
" the immediate decision to suspend by the @entity103 was made to communicate clearly that this type of behavior is not tolerated , " executive vice president @entity100 said in a statement released friday
" it is clear these individuals never had any concept of what @entity13 stands for
" a conduct history of the @entity13 chapter at @entity15 shows the fraternity is no stranger to discipline investigations
it is currently on probation for an incident in june in which members were accused of interfering with the @entity120 by " inviting new students to the house and serving alcohol , " the university said in an e-mail
ultimately , the fraternity was found " not responsible " for dispensing alcohol but was found " responsible " on the accusations of interfering , the university said
over the past five years , this @entity13 chapter was brought up on discipline charges eight times
in april 2010 , the fraternity was put on probation when members were caught painting obscene words and pictures on a student 's car
most of the incidents involved alcohol , including a 2008 - 2009 probation for providing alcohol to minors
while on probation , the fraternity was disciplined for having a party with alcohol
for this infraction , @entity13 was suspended from august 2011 until april 2013 , but the sanctions were modified on appeal and the suspension ended a year earlier
this time , it may not be just the fraternity that will be disciplined
police are looking into the possibility of criminal charges if people who posted on the page are found to have committed any crimes .
