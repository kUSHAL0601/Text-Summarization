@entity0 -- the @entity2 announced settlements thursday with more than 10,000 plaintiffs who claimed sickness or injuries after the 9/11 terrorist attacks
the settlements could total up to $ 657 million
@entity2 was created with a $ 1 billion @entity10 grant and provides insurance coverage to the @entity0 and its debris - removal contractors
in the aftermath of attacks of september 11 , 2001 , @entity0 was unable to get adequate amounts of liability insurance for the rescue , recovery and debris - removal work done at the @entity20
the settlement would provide a system to pay for the compensation of the injury claims made by people working on the rescue and debris removal for the city and its contractors
this would include construction workers , firefighters , police officers and other workers and volunteers
the settlement would also fund a special insurance policy , which provides additional compensation to any plaintiff contracting certain types of cancer in the future
@entity43 , president of @entity2 , said in a statement : " we have reached a settlement that is fair under difficult and complicated circumstances
this agreement enables workers and volunteers claiming injury from the @entity53 site operations to obtain compensation commensurate with the nature of their injuries and the strength of their claims , while offering added protection against possible future illness
" in order to make a claim , plaintiffs will have to submit proof they were present and participated in the post- 9/11 efforts
they will also have to present specific medical documentation , including a diagnosis confirming their illness or injury
@entity0 mayor @entity73 said of the resolution , " this settlement is a fair and reasonable resolution to a complex set of circumstances
since september 11th , the city has moved aggressively to provide medical treatment to those who were present at @entity20 , and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring
" a spokesman for the mayor declined further comment
after the 9/11 attacks , individuals who worked or volunteered in the rescue , recovery and debris - removal project were entitled to and have received free medical care , which has been funded by the @entity0 and the federal government
participating in the settlement would not deter access to that care
former @entity0 firefighter @entity98 told @entity1 's @entity99 , " you really ca n't put a price on your health , so i hope that this settlement was done the right way and i hope that it was done with people 's health and safety and future in mind
" @entity98 , 37 , was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008 .
