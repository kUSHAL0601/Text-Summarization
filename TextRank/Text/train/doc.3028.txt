-- @entity3 's funeral , if there is one , will wait for several months while a @entity6 judge decides who will permanently control of the former child actor 's estate , a lawyer said wednesday
@entity3 will be cremated and his ashes will be put away until a will dispute between ex-wife @entity11 and former business associate @entity12 is resolved , said @entity13 , an attorney appointed temporary special administrator
@entity3 divorced @entity11 in 2008 , but they were living together in @entity17 , @entity6 , when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage at the @entity21 , @entity6 , hospital
@entity11 , 24 , claimed in a petition that she was still @entity3 's common - law wife
she filed a handwritten document from 2007 that , if validated by the court , would give her @entity3 's estate
a will signed by @entity3 in 2005 named @entity12 as executor and awarded all of his estate to the @entity29 , @entity30 , woman
it is expected to take @entity6 district judge @entity33 several months to hold a trial to decide which document is @entity3 's last legal will
@entity13 , who has control until then , said he would lock the actor 's ashes in a vault
no one is questioning that @entity3 wanted his remains cremated
he called for it in the 2005 will , in which he also asked " that there be no funeral service , wake , or other ceremony memorializing my passing
" an earlier will , dated in 1999 , offered specific instructions on who could not attend any funeral or memorial service
" i direct my personal representative to cause my personal remains to be cremated and to plan a wake for me conducted by those who have had no financial ties to me and can look each other in the eyes and say they really cared personally for @entity3 , " the 1999 will said
he also said he wanted no reporters at the service
@entity3 's remains are at a @entity6 mortuary , awaiting direction about what happens to the body
@entity13 was instructed by the judge to wait until after wednesday to order the cremation , to allow time for @entity12 to view his body
@entity3 was best known as the wisecracking youngster @entity73 on " @entity74 " from the late 1970s to the mid- 1980s
@entity0 's @entity75 contributed to this report .
