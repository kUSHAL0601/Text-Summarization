@entity0 -- six of the nine @entity4 justices attended the annual @entity5 at the @entity6 of @entity7 in @entity0 on sunday
the event 's speakers spoke about using faith in decision - making but largely stayed away from the controversial issues the court will face in the coming months
chief justice @entity14 , justice @entity15 , justice @entity16 , justice @entity17 , justice @entity18 and justice @entity19 all attended the 60th annual @entity5 this was @entity19 's first @entity5 having six justices in attendance ties a record set in 2009
the only justices to not attend this year were @entity25 and @entity26 , both of whom are @entity29 , and @entity30 , who is @entity31
@entity19 and @entity15 , both of whom were in attendance , are also @entity31
election raise stakes for possible court vacancies the annual @entity35 is an event put on by the @entity36 of @entity0 and the @entity37 and aims to bring people together to pray for the members of the judiciary before the court begins hearing cases each year
it 's called the @entity5 because of the color of the garments worn by clergy
in the past , presidents , vice presidents and many members of @entity50 and the judiciary have attended the event
@entity53 , archbishop for members of the @entity56 military , delivered this year 's homily , expressing a commitment to the poor and to education while also strongly emphasizing the idea that people should strive to live their faith and become " instruments of a new evangelization
" " the faith we hold in our hearts must motivate the decisions , the words and the commitment of our everyday existence , " said @entity53
" our society must also rest on stable , clear foundations
otherwise , we run the risk of sinking into the mire of one popular soundbite after another
" possible @entity80 court nominees speaking about the need to shed clearer light on the " joy and renewed enthusiasm " of the church , @entity53 stressed the idea of living one 's faith outside of church and in everyday life
" we are instruments in the hands of the @entity92 , and so we pray to be ever open to his presence , " said @entity53
" the message is filled with hope : not only for eternal life , but also for the graces necessary so that our lives are truly noble of @entity100 and of the vocation he has given us
" while the @entity5 follows the traditional structure of a catholic service , it also includes a few additions
in particular , the congregants sang " @entity109 " and " @entity110 " at the start and end of the @entity5 others attending the event included secretary of transportation @entity113 , @entity115 attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful @entity116 , and @entity56 ambassador to @entity119 @entity118
possible @entity121 court nominees the court 's current religious makeup -- six @entity124 and three @entity31 -- marks the first time there has been no @entity128 justice on the highest court in the land
in 2010 , @entity19 replaced justice @entity131 , who was the lone @entity128 at the time of his retirement
this is unique for a country in which every president has been @entity128 except for @entity137 , a @entity29
the mix of religion and government at the @entity5 has raised some eyebrows in the past
@entity30 no longer attends the @entity35 because she said she grew tired of being lectured by @entity29 officials
" i went one year , and i will never go again , because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion , " @entity30 said in the book " @entity145 : @entity147
" " even the @entity148 - although they 're much of that persuasion --- were embarrassed for me
" @entity4 opens possibly contentious new term critics of the service find the attendance of leading decision - makers to be inappropriate
" there is one purpose to have this
it is to make clear ... just what the church hierarchy feels about some of the very issues that are to come before the court , " said rev. @entity158 , president of @entity159
" that is just wrong
and it is wrong for members to go --- not illegal --- but wrong for the archdiocese to promote and encourage this event
" while previous masses have included political references --- in 2009 , cardinal @entity171 made an unspecified reference to the rights of the unborn --- this year 's @entity35 was largely void of any hot - button political issues that the court might be addressing , like affirmative action , same - sex marriage , voting rights or abortion laws
the origins of the @entity5 date back to early @entity29 times in cities like @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190
in @entity189 , @entity191 was built and designated as a chapel specifically for @entity5 in the @entity56 , the tradition began in @entity194 in 1928 , when a group of @entity29 lawyers gathered in @entity197
@entity1 's @entity198 contributed to this report .
