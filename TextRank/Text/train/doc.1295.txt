-- @entity2 star @entity1 is leading the campaign for @entity4 to stay at @entity6 giants @entity5 beyond his agreed loan spell
former @entity8 captain @entity4 has made an immediate impact with his contribution at @entity5
the @entity8 midfielder is due to return to the @entity12 in march but playmaker @entity1 said @entity4 had already shown his star qualities
the 33 - year - old played 89 minutes of the 2 - 2 draw with @entity16 on sunday following a friendly outing against @entity18
" @entity4 has shown that he is a player ready to run the extra mile , " @entity1 told a news conference in @entity20 ahead of @entity22 's world player of the year gala
" the first matches showed quite clearly what his qualities are and his passing ability and his capacity to play well
" perhaps these first two months will lead to six months or to one year , to more contracts
i certainly would like to play more with him
" @entity4 's advisers have stressed that there are no plans for him to stay at @entity5 beyond march 9
however , former @entity12 general manager @entity34 last week expressed fears that @entity4 could be tempted to bring an early end to his time in the @entity38 @entity5 coach @entity39 revealed @entity4 's attitude and intelligence had won him a place in the starting side in @entity44 where he had been expected to start on the bench
" he did well , " said @entity39
" i chose @entity4 to start because he proved in recent days to be a very intelligent player and serious
" the appearance against @entity16 is a small reward for him because he worked very hard and has adapted well to the team
" this was only his second game with us and he will improve
i believe everyone is happy to have @entity4 here
" @entity56 midfielder @entity55 said : " we have to compliment him
he has done a good job and he grew in the game
he still needs to improve but i think he can be very satisfied with what he has done after two months of not playing
" @entity16 stand - in captain @entity60 suggested @entity5 had made a shrewd move in capturing the 33 - year - old
" from a media standpoint @entity4 is impressive , " @entity60 said
" he is a nice guy , has a beautiful wife , has won so many trophies in his career and perhaps this penalises him as a player although i believe he has the feet and the determination
" @entity4 , meanwhile , forecast that sunday 's double goalscorer @entity72 of @entity2 is destined for greatness
" i have seen him in training and on the pitch
he is only 19 years of age and i think he can become one of the greatest players in the world , " said @entity4
@entity5 are nine points behind @entity82 leaders @entity83 going into saturday 's home game against @entity85 with @entity4 seemingly set to retain his starting slot .
