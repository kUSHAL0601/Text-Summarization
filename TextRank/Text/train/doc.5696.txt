-- for years , @entity1 has told stories of criminal activity -- first as a writer for " @entity5 " and then as the creator of @entity8 's wildly popular " @entity7 , " a dramatized version of an outlaw biker gang in @entity11
now he 's branching out and focusing his lens on real - life criminal organizations
the @entity14 recently premiered " @entity1 's @entity15 , " a six - part series that looks at the micro and macro reasons behind groups that have defined their existence outside the law
episode one tackles famed @entity24 gang the @entity25 , with subsequent shows exploring outlaw bikers , the @entity29 mob , the @entity31 mafia , the @entity32 and the @entity33
" on ' sons , ' we exposed a lot of people to a new world , " @entity1 told @entity0 from @entity24
" it humanized what was a stereotype for a lot of people
yes , our show is highly dramatic , and we take a lot of dramatic licenses
but the reality of it , and details of it are very true , very specific
for me , that 's what i wanted to do with this series
" the show sprang from a different concept @entity1 was pitching that looked at criminal activity from two points of view , the criminals and law enforcement
for the final act , the two sides would be brought together in the same room
" the pitch was to have a high - level crime and get the point of view of the criminal party involved and law enforcement and hear their retelling of the same events , " he said
" people were intrigued by the concept , but ultimately it felt a little too old school
@entity14 was interested in a variation , and they 've wanted to do a high - end documentary series
" " @entity15 " explores case studies of a few people involved in the criminal organization , using their stories and knowledge to make larger connections to the context of the outlaw group
@entity1 pops up from time to time in cutaways to offer insights into the story he 's trying to tell
he 's not interested in getting law enforcement officials , psychologists or other talking heads to weigh in on why these people are " bad
" @entity97 , for @entity1 , is telling a story that does n't pass judgment
the approach that @entity1 and his team took was n't the typical " let 's pick a subject and tell their story " usually associated with documentary storytelling
for him , they started small and worked outward
" we tapped into people that had relationships ; some of these guys have been cleaning up their acts -- there 's networks to get to these people , " @entity1 said
" we talked to people to see who had the most interesting story
it came out of character : who had the most interesting people with the most interesting stories
" it was n't so much like ' let 's go do the @entity25
let 's go do the @entity33
' it was about let 's cast a wide net and be led into the worlds by the characters
" @entity1 is putting the finishing touches on the final episodes of " @entity15 " while also in preproduction for the fifth season of " sons
" and like the way he portrays his fictional characters , he aims to give viewers a new look at a group of people who have been largely portrayed in a certain way
" it 's a challenging thing to do when you 're dealing with guys covered in swastikas , " @entity1 said
" you try to go in and give it some context , so people have some point of view to why people did what they did
it does n't mean you 're going to get behind it
" he added , " the challenge is similar to writing ' sons
' when you write an anti-hero , it 's that balance between ' anti ' and ' hero
' you ca n't make them too righteous and good so they do n't feel dangerous or believable
but you ca n't write them so deplorable that the audience ca n't get behind them
it 's similar with this series
" " @entity1 's @entity15 " airs at 10 p.m. et mondays on @entity14 .
