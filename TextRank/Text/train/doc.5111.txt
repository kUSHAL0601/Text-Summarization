terrorists will stop at nothing to keep @entity3 girls from receiving an education
" people are crazy , " said @entity5 , founder of a girls ' school outside @entity7
" the day we opened the school , ( on ) the other side of town , they threw hand grenades in a girls ' school , and 100 girls were killed
" every day , you hear that somebody 's thrown acid at a girl 's face ... or they poison their water
" there were at least 185 documented attacks on schools and hospitals in @entity3 last year , according to the @entity25
the majority were attributed to armed groups opposed to girls ' education
" it is heartbreaking to see the way these terrorists treat ... women , " said @entity5 , 68
" in their eyes , a women is an object that they can control
they are scared that when these girls get an education , they will become aware of their rights as women and as a human being
" despite the threat of violence , @entity5 continues to open the doors of her @entity45 , a two - story , 14 - room building where 354 area girls are receiving a free education
" most of the ( local ) men and women are illiterate , " @entity5 said
" most of our students are the first generation of girls to get educated
" seven small villages make up @entity57 , where the school is located
though @entity57 is not @entity59 - controlled , @entity5 has still found it difficult to change the deep - rooted stigma against women 's education
on the evening before the school opened in 2008 , four men paid her a visit
" they said , ' this is your last chance ... to change this school into a boys ' school , because the backbone of @entity3 is our boys , ' " @entity5 recalled
" i just turned around and i told them , ' excuse me
the women are the eyesight of @entity3 , and unfortunately you all are blind
and i really want to give you some sight
' " @entity5 has not seen the men since
" you ca n't be afraid of people , " she said
" you have to be able to say ' no. ' maybe because i 'm old , the men are kind of scared of me , and they do n't argue with me
" the @entity45 teaches kindergarten through eighth grade
without her school , @entity5 says , many of the students would not be able to receive an education
" when we opened the school in 2008 and i had these students coming to register , 90 % of them could not write their name
and they were 12 - and 14 - year - old girls , " @entity5 said
" now , they all can read and write
" @entity5 's school teaches math , science , religion and three languages : @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104
it recently added a computer lab with internet access
" they can touch the world just sitting in this house , " @entity5 said
" the knowledge is something that nobody can steal from them
" to shield the students from attacks , @entity5 has built a new stone wall to surround the school
she also employs staff and guards who serve as human guinea pigs of sorts
" the principal and the guard , they test the water every day , " @entity5 said
" they will drink from the well
if it 's ok , they 'll wait
... then they 'll fill ( the ) coolers and bring it to the classroom
" @entity5 says she is so scared of poisoning that school staff members accompany children to the bathroom and make sure the children do n't drink water from the faucet
additionally , the day guard arrives early each morning to check for any gas or poison that might be leaked inside the classrooms
the guard opens doors and windows and checks the air quality before any children are allowed to enter
" people are so much against girls getting educated , " @entity5 said
" so we have to do these precautions
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity155 born in @entity3 in the 1940s , @entity5 traveled to the @entity157 in 1970 to attend college
much of her family was killed or fled @entity3 during the @entity161 invasion
she stayed in the @entity157 , raised a son and opened a small tailoring business
she became an @entity157 citizen in 1990
@entity5 was always involved in various philanthropic efforts and community organizations in @entity167 , @entity168
she worked for many years to forge connections between @entity3 and @entity157
then the events of september 11 shook her to the core
" i was really affected personally by what happened to the innocent in the @entity157 , " she said
" it 's something that you can not imagine for a human being to do to other human beings
" almost overnight , @entity5 turned her small store into a workshop and launched an exhaustive campaign to help victims , first responders , @entity157 soldiers and @entity3 children
@entity5 and community volunteers sent 400 homemade blankets to rescue workers at ground zero and assembled and shipped nearly 200 care packages for @entity157 troops in @entity3
when she heard that @entity157 soldiers needed shoes to distribute to @entity3 children , @entity5 and her volunteers sent them more than 30,000 boxes of shoes
still , in the back of her mind was a bigger dream
on a visit to her homeland in 2002 , she noticed that women and girls were struggling from years of @entity59 control
" i saw that the girls had been the most oppressed , " she said
" the @entity59 regime was very brutal , brutal in the way that the woman had no place in their book
the woman had no right
" @entity5 said that while her life in @entity157 was fulfilling and rich , her dream was " to do something for @entity3 and to educate the girls
" so in 2004 , she began searching for land on which to build a school
in 2005 , she began fundraising through her @entity168 - based nonprofit , @entity5 's @entity219
then , on a visit to @entity3 , @entity5 was able to negotiate with the @entity221 to secure the land where the @entity45 now stands
" after five years now , ( the men ) are shoulder to shoulder with me , which is such a great thing , " @entity5 said
" it 's unbelievable how much they are proud of the girls
" the school is entirely free
@entity5 says it costs $ 300 to teach each girl for an entire year
those fees are covered by donations to her nonprofit
read about the @entity155 of 2012 although she is n't there every day of the week , @entity5 spends as much time at the school as possible
she meets with her students ' fathers and grandfathers two or three times a year to address any issues and make sure she still has their buy - in
she also deals with community elders and locals to ensure that the school has local support
@entity5 , who takes no money for her work with the school , believes the education her students receive will benefit not only future generations of @entity3 women but the country as a whole
" my school is very small
but for this to start here , i think it 's like a fire
and i think it will grow , " she said
" i hope that one day these girls ... will come back and teach , because i 'm not going to be there all my life
i want to make this school something that will last 100 years from now
