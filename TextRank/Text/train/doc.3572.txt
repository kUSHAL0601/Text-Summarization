-- a @entity4 justice of the peace who drew criticism for refusing to marry an interracial couple has resigned , the secretary of state 's office said tuesday
@entity9 resigned in person at the @entity4 secretary of state 's office , said spokesman @entity12
the @entity13 will appoint an interim justice of the peace to fill @entity17 's position , @entity12 said , and a special election will be held next year to fill the position permanently
@entity17 , a justice of the peace for @entity22 's @entity21 , refused to perform a marriage ceremony for @entity24 , 30 , and her boyfriend @entity25 , 32 , both of @entity26 , @entity4 , and sign their marriage license
the two were married by another justice of the peace
the couple filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against @entity17 and his wife , @entity17 , on october 20 , claiming the two violated the @entity37 of the @entity38
@entity17 , speaking to @entity0 affiliate @entity39 , said he was advised " that i needed to step down because they was going to take me to court , and i was going to lose
" " i would probably do the same thing again , " he said
" i found out i ca n't be a justice of the peace and have a conscience
" sen. @entity46 , @entity4 , who had called for @entity17 's dismissal , said tuesday night that " @entity17 has finally consented to the will of the vast majority of @entity4 citizens and nearly every governmental official in @entity4
@entity17 's refusal to issue marriage licenses to interracial couples was out of step with our @entity4 values and reflected terribly on our state
we are better off without him in public service
" initial reports were that @entity17 refused to issue a marriage license to the couple , but in the lawsuit @entity64 and @entity25 say they obtained the license from the parish court clerk 's office and contacted @entity17 to see if he would perform the ceremony and sign the license to legally validate the marriage
@entity64 wound up speaking by telephone with @entity17 , the lawsuit said , and @entity17 asked @entity64 if they were a " mixed couple
" when told they were an interracial couple , @entity17 said , according to the lawsuit , " we do n't do interracial weddings , " and told her the two would have to go outside the parish to marry
@entity17 did not return repeated phone calls from @entity0 in october , but told @entity0 affiliate @entity84 that he had no regrets about the decision
" it 's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you have n't done wrong , " he said
in addition , he told the @entity94 in an october story that he did not marry the couple because he was concerned for the children that might be born of the relationship and that , in his experience , most interracial marriages do n't last
" i 'm not a racist , " he said
" i do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house
my main concern is for the children
" @entity64 said in october that she wanted @entity17 to resign
" he does n't believe he 's being racist , but it is racist , " she said
according to the lawsuit , @entity17 estimated he refused to marry at least four other interracial couples in the past 2Â½ years
" defendant @entity17 ... aided , abetted and conspired with defendant @entity9 to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected civil rights , " according to the suit
no response to the suit has been filed , and it was unclear whether the @entity121 had retained an attorney
the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages , claiming that @entity64 and @entity25 suffered emotional distress as a result of the incident
@entity4 gov. @entity128 has said he believed @entity17 should lose his license , and the @entity130 called for an investigation into the incident by the @entity134 's @entity133 , saying in a statement that @entity17 's actions were " a huge step backward in social justice
" according to the @entity139 , @entity22 is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black
the @entity141 @entity13 tossed out any racially - based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 ruling in the case loving v. @entity146
in the unanimous decision , the court said that under the @entity154 , " the freedom to marry , or not marry , a person of another race resides with the individual and can not be infringed by the @entity153
" @entity0 's @entity155 contributed to this report .
