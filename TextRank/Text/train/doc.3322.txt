-- on friday afternoon , restaurant owner @entity1 was standing in the local branch of his bank , ready to withdraw his life - savings to buy a house
then his lawyer called to tell him the deal had been postponed
he woke on saturday morning , switched on the news and heard the government had announced plans to raid his nest - egg and take 10 % to pay for the mistakes of the country 's crippled banks
@entity1 's problem ? he lives in @entity16 ( population : less than one million people ) where the banking system is severely overstretched and has been exposed to the debt - ridden @entity21 financial industry which has occupied @entity23 for the past few years
why is @entity16 trying to tax bank deposits ? the fate of the @entity16 economy , which accounts for only 0.2 % of @entity28 gdp , is unlikely to reignite the financial troubles of the single currency area
but @entity1 , a @entity31 expat who has lived in the southwest coastal city of @entity33 for 13 years with his wife , says the " overnight robbery " by the recently - installed government is devastating people in his community
" if they can just get into your account in the middle of the night and take money out , in any other situation that would be theft , " he says
the @entity16 government plans to tap its citizens for 5.8 billion euros [ $ 7.5 billion ] and impose a one - off 9.9 % levy on deposits over â ‚ ¬ 100,000
those with smaller savings would be subject to a 6.75 % levy
watch this : @entity16 business owner lost 10 % of savings the unprecedented tax on bank deposits led to a run on cash machines over the weekend , as customers scrambled to protect their life savings
with banks ordered to stay closed until thursday , and people struggling to get cash , @entity16 lawmakers are dithering on a deal that still needs to be ratified in parliament , while also revising the conditions in an effort to place more of the burden on the rich
but it seems the damage has already been done : a run on the banks now looking increasingly likely
@entity1 says he can no longer trust the @entity16 government or the country 's banks after this " underhanded " and " calculated " move to eat away at the savings of ordinary people
watch this : @entity82 prepare to withdraw from @entity16 lawmakers waited until the end of business on friday for the long public holiday weekend in a " well - orchestrated " plan , according to @entity1
he told @entity0 : " i can tell you 100 % now , whether they take the money off me or not
when i can get into the bank on thursday , i will take all my money out of the bank and put it offshore
" in an address to the nation on sunday night , newly - elected @entity16 president @entity94 said the country must secure a 10 billion euro package or face economic collapse
@entity16 may be the fourth eurozone country to request a bailout from international creditors -- after @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity21 -- but it is the first nation where politicians have attempted to force taxpayers into handing over their personal savings to rescue the banks

@entity111 returned to @entity16 in 1996 and is now retired
" it feels similar , back then we woke up one day and all hell had broken loose , " she recalls
" but today we just feel absolutely helpless
" she worries that banks will collapse as savers who feel betrayed seek to withdraw their deposits
" if the banks collapse , people will go hungry because @entity16 is a very small community and there 's no backup ... i thought these bailouts and committees were there to help people not take their money away
" @entity111 and @entity1 both fear that policymakers are setting a dangerous precedent for future crises
" if they did it with @entity16 , what 's to stop them doing it in other troubled euro countries ? " @entity1 demands .
