@entity0 -- @entity2 told @entity3 in september he had no " aspirations " to be married with children
that was a month before he was seen with @entity7 in october
could @entity2 finally have met his match in @entity9 , a 36 - year - old @entity12 - educated @entity11 lawyer who reportedly shares the actor 's passion for crusading for international human rights ? there is plenty of speculation that @entity7 may be the woman who converts @entity2 -- with two @entity19 and a firm hold near the top of @entity25 's a-list -- from confirmed bachelor to family man
the latest gossip started saturday with reports from @entity28 and the @entity30 's " @entity33 " column quoting unnamed sources saying the couple are engaged to be married
people source : ' this is real ' the @entity30 headline read : " @entity2 , eternal bachelor , is engaged
" its source said the couple had " hoped keep the engagement quiet , but they ca n't hide the fact that they are very happy
" people quotes a " source with knowledge of the situation " saying " @entity2 and @entity50 are trying to keep things very low - key but they also are n't really trying to hide this , it does n't seem
i think it 's like they want the people they love to know that this is real , that they plan on being together forever
" @entity7 appeared to be " showing off " an engagement ring while dining with @entity2 at a @entity63 , @entity64 , restaurant thursday night , the @entity30 report said
people reported that @entity7 " had a conspicuous ring on her left ring finger
" @entity2 's representative @entity69 responded to @entity1 's request for confirmation with a very short nondenial saturday : " i do not comment on his personal life
" clooney watchers may be surprised by an engagement , but the clues were out there
@entity3 's @entity78 interviewed @entity2 sometime in late september , just before " gravity " was released in theaters
the article appeared in the magazine 's december issue , which hit newsstands in november
why is n't he married with kids , @entity78 asked
" i have n't had aspirations in that way , ever , " @entity2 answered
he was married from 1989 until 1993 to " @entity88 " actress @entity87
@entity2 points to that brief period of matrimony as evidence he " was n't very good at it
" " i was quoted as saying i 'll never get married again pretty much right after i√Ç got divorced and then i 've never talked about it since , " he told @entity3
he said in september that he realized being 52 , unmarried and childless might not look good to the public , but that he should n't " rush out and impregnate someone
" but @entity2 said he has no " dislike or distrust " of being married with children
@entity7 enters @entity2 's life while it 's not confirmed when @entity2 met @entity50 , the two were photographed together in @entity104 in october
@entity2 made an unusual public denial that he was dating @entity7 , telling people in late october that the girlfriend reports were " all made up
" there 's good reason to believe the relationship did not start earlier , since @entity2 had just split with @entity112 in july
although @entity112 denied it was because she saw no hopes of a marriage to @entity2 after two years , the tv host wasted no time finding a husband
she married entrepreneur @entity118 in march
if @entity2 's relationship with @entity7 did begin in october , it quickly accelerated
she was his date for a @entity123 screening of his film " @entity124 " in february
" they were holding hands , " according to one of the @entity129 vets who attended the screening
@entity131 , 88 , called her " a beautiful lady
" people quoted another unnamed " observer " who said the two were " stuck like glue
" people source : ' she 's on his level ' there was no doubt remaining about their closeness in march when @entity2 took @entity7 on an @entity147 safari
photographers caught the cuddling couple watching the wildlife in @entity151 and later vacationing in the @entity152
if @entity2 's match is to be a lawyer , he 's apparently picked an a-list attorney
a @entity11 website ranked " the 21 @entity157 in @entity104 " last july
@entity7 was at the top
she " achieves the seemingly unattainable ideal of contemporary femininity : she is both breathtakingly beautiful and formidably successful , " the rankers said
a " source who has worked with @entity2 " was quoted by people earlier this year suggesting why @entity7 might be different from the long list of @entity2 's ex-girlfriends who 've lasted for a few months or a year or two since his divorce in 1993
" she is n't someone who is pursuing a career in acting or entertainment , " the source said
" she 's on his level
" @entity1 's @entity173 contributed to this report .
