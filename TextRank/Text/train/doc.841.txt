" there 's definitely a ' to be continued ' feeling
if @entity34 and @entity35 have gotten to the place we 've always promised and are heading toward a wedding potentially , what 's in store for @entity37 ? it 's a nice moment to end on
it sort of feels like a mini season finale even though it 's just a midseason finale
it feels like , ' alright now , let 's see what the next — and possibly last — chapter is for @entity37
' how does he move into his future if we are watching @entity34 and @entity35 move into theirs ? in the way that @entity1 is sort of great and a little bit sad and nostalgic and wistful — that 's definitely how i feel at the end of the episode
and hopefully people will feel a feeling of resolution , in terms of waiting for @entity34 and @entity35 to reunite , but also a question left unanswered
stay tuned for what either will be the final 10 episodes ever of the show or possibly that plus one more final season
