editor 's note : actor @entity2 plays paper salesman @entity3 in the television comedy " @entity5
" @entity2 says fellow members of his @entity8 faith are being persecuted in @entity9
( @entity10 ) -- why is @entity2 , " @entity3 " on " @entity5 , " writing a news commentary for @entity10 ? good question
it 's a bit strange for me , to say the least ; a comic character actor best known for playing weirdos with bad haircuts getting all serious to talk about the persecution of the fellow members of his religious faith
dear readers of @entity10 , i assure you that what i 'm writing about is no joking matter or some hoax perpetrated by a paper - sellin ' , bear - fearin ' , battlestar - @entity23 obsessed beet farmer
i am a member of the @entity8 faith
what is that , you ask ? well , long story short , it 's an independent world religion that began in the mid- 1800s in @entity9
@entity8 believe that there is only one @entity38 and therefore only one religion
all of the world 's divine teachers ( @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , etc. ) bring essentially the same message -- one of unity , love and knowledge of @entity38 or the divine
this constantly updated faith of @entity38 , @entity8 believe , has been refreshed for this day and age by our founder , @entity56
now , as i mentioned , this all happened in @entity9 , and needless to say the @entity63 authorities did not like the @entity8 very much , accusing them of heresy and apostasy
tens of thousands were killed in the early years of the faith , and the persecutions have continued off and on for the past 150 years
why write about all this now ? well , i 'm glad you asked
you see there 's a ' trial ' going on very soon for seven @entity8 national leaders in @entity9
they 've been accused of all manner of things including being " spies for @entity80 , " " insulting religious sanctities " and " propaganda against the @entity83
" they 've been held for a year in @entity85 in @entity86 without any access to their lawyer ( the @entity90 laureate @entity88 ) and with zero evidence of any of these charges
when a similar thing happened in 1980 , the national leadership of the @entity9 @entity8 community disappeared
and this was repeated again in 1981
in fact , since 1979 , more than 200 @entity8 have been killed , holy places and cemeteries desecrated , homes burned , civil rights taken away and secret lists compiled of @entity8 ( and even @entity63 who associate with them ) by government agencies
it 's bad right now for all the peace - loving @entity8 in @entity9 who want only to practice their religion and follow their beliefs
it 's especially bad for these seven
here 's a link to their bios
they 're teachers , and engineers , and optometrists and social workers just like us
this thought has become kind of a clich√© ' , but we take our rights for granted here in @entity121
imagine if a group of people were rounded up and imprisoned and then disappeared not for anything they 'd done , but because they wanted to worship differently than the majority
there is a resolution on the situation of the @entity8 in @entity9 being sent to @entity130
please ask your representatives to support it
and ask them to speak out about this terrible situation
now back to bears , paper and beets ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
