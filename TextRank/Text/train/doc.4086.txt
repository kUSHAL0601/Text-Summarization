-- as @entity2 manages a tectonic shift in its business , thrifty consumers can expect to shake down more deals on gadgets
@entity2 is set to replenish the supply of @entity10 tablets this week , spokeswoman @entity7 said in a statement on sunday
the company began selling @entity13 for $ 99 and $ 149 last week in order to quickly shed inventory
@entity2 will also drop the price on the @entity19 smartphone to $ 75 , which will not be sold in @entity21 stores , a second spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail
while the electronics giant has ceased production on the products , the " next batch " of @entity13 is being retrieved from a warehouse , @entity23 wrote
@entity2 is seeing high demand for the bargain - priced tablets , which first retailed for $ 500 last month , and has struggled to keep its inventory alert system online
@entity23 described the sudden demand for the @entity10 as " kind of bittersweet
" in a statement , @entity2 offered the following explanation for discontinuing the products : " webos devices have not gained enough traction with consumers
" while @entity2 intends to stop making devices that run the company 's downtrodden mobile operating system , @entity43 , an @entity2 vice president , wrote in a message to developers on friday saying his team plans to continue developing the software
@entity2 ceo @entity48 has said the company has explored licensing deals for webos with other electronics manufacturers
bargain hunters are scheming on blogs and social media websites to share tips on how to score discounted @entity13
the two touchpad models have shot to the top spots on @entity60 's list of best - selling electronics
the fire sale has spread to @entity63
the @entity19 , which debuted in the @entity64 and @entity65 less than a week ago , is now priced at $ 75 , € 59 or £ 49 , the spokeswoman wrote in e-mails
it previously cost about $ 500 in @entity63
the device will be unlocked , allowing people in the @entity21 to connect to @entity72 's or @entity73 's networks
@entity2 will not allow customers to return the device , the spokeswoman wrote
the news was reported earlier by @entity78
the @entity19 smartphone , with its slide - out keyboard , is the flagship in @entity83 's handset product line that @entity2 acquired last year , and runs webos , the same software used in the @entity10 .
