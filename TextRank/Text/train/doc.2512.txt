-- @entity1 admitted in an interview with a @entity4 newspaper that he extorted money from the family of @entity7 , but his attorney in a @entity10 murder case suggested monday that his client 's comments may have been mistranslated
attorney @entity13 said he is not involved in the case of @entity15 , the @entity16 teenager who disappeared in @entity17 after going out on the town with van der @entity19 , and was reluctant to comment on van der @entity1 's interview with @entity23
" maybe there were some mistakes in the translation , " he said
@entity13 said van der sloot was not paid for the interview
" i wanted to get back at @entity32 's family , " van der @entity1 said from prison in the @entity4 interview
" her parents have been making my life tough for five years
" " when they offered to pay for the girl 's location , i thought : ' why not ? ' " he said
@entity1 faces a count of wire fraud and a count of extortion in the @entity43 for allegedly trying to extort more than $ 250,000 from @entity15 's family in return for the location of her body
he has denied responsibility for her disappearance
he was arrested twice in @entity17 in connection with the @entity15 case but has never been charged
the 22 - year - old @entity4 citizen is awaiting trial in @entity56 , @entity10 , where he stands accused of killing @entity57 in a hotel room
also monday , a @entity10 court voted 2 - 1 to reject van der @entity1 's contention that he is being held unlawfully , but the court requires three votes to secure a decision
@entity13 said that a fourth jurist will hear the case and cast a vote at a public hearing next week
if that judge votes in favor of @entity1 , a fifth judge will hear the case to break the tie
@entity13 said that @entity1 's constitutional rights have been violated and he " could be released because of the mistakes made by the police during the investigation
" " it does n't matter if he is innocent or guilty , " he said
in @entity80 's @entity79 contributed to this report .
