@entity0 -- a series of explosions tore through an open - air market in the capital of the volatile western @entity8 region of @entity9 on thursday , killing dozens of people and wounding many more , state media reported
@entity8 's @entity11 said the attack in the heavily policed city of @entity14 was " a serious violent terrorist incident " and vowed to crack down on its perpetrators
president @entity17 called for the terrorists behind it to be " severely " punished
two suvs slammed into shoppers gathered at the market in @entity14 at 7:50 a.m. thursday , and explosives were flung out of the vehicles , @entity8 's official news agency @entity20 said
the vehicles then exploded , according to @entity20 , which said at least 31 people were killed and more than 90 wounded
some of the photos circulating on social media suggested a hellish scene , with bodies strewn on the ground amid burning wreckage
others showed flames and smoke billowing out of the end of a tree - lined street guarded by police officers
' an enormous sound ' " i heard an enormous sound , then i looked out from my balcony , " said a resident of a building near the explosion who would only give his surname , @entity47
he told @entity1 that trees obscured much of his view of the scene , but that he " could see there was chaos , with people injured
" many of the victims caught in the blasts were elderly people who regularly visited the morning market , @entity20 reported
" it 's mainly people coming to trade vegetables , especially the elderly who get up early and buy vegetables to cook , " @entity47 said
the @entity66 government condemned the attack
" this is a despicable and outrageous act of violence against innocent civilians , and the @entity66 resolutely opposes all forms of terrorism , " @entity69 press secretary @entity68 said in a statement
string of recent attacks @entity8 authorities have stepped up security measures in @entity9 in recent months amid a series of attacks within the region and in major @entity8 cities outside it
on wednesday , the day before the blasts , @entity20 reported that 39 people had been sentenced to prison in the past two months for " inciting violence " in @entity9
but the devastating blasts thursday suggest the government is facing a foe determined to wreak havoc
thursday 's attack at the market comes less than a month after an explosion hit a train station in @entity14 , killing three people and wounding 79 others
that blast took place on april 30 , just after @entity17 had wrapped up a visit to the region
ethnic tensions @entity8 officials have linked a mass knife attack in march that killed 29 people at a train station in the southwestern city of @entity109 to @entity111 separatists from @entity9
they have also blamed separatists for an attack in @entity114 's @entity113 in october in which a car rammed into a pedestrian bridge and burst into flames , killing two tourists and the three occupants of the vehicle
the knife - wielding assailants in the @entity109 attack and the people in the car that hit @entity113 were identified as @entity126 , a @entity129 - speaking , predominantly @entity128 ethnic group from @entity9
ethnic tensions between @entity126 and @entity133 people , millions of whom have migrated to resource - rich @entity9 in recent decades , have repeatedly boiled over into deadly riots and clashes with authorities in recent years
some @entity126 have expressed resentment over harsh treatment from @entity8 security forces and @entity133 people taking the lion 's share of economic opportunities in @entity9
the @entity133 are the predominant ethnic group in @entity8 , making up more than 90 % of the overall population
shift in target the pattern of ethnic violence in the region goes back decades , according to @entity150 , an expert in ethnic relations in @entity8 at @entity152 in @entity153
" but what 's new , and what i think is significant , is that we have a shift in target , " @entity150 said
" we have a targeting of innocent civilians , places where innocent civilians gather -- an attempt to maim innocent civilians in large numbers
" the other change is that the violence has " seeped outside " the borders of @entity9 into other parts of @entity8 , he said
it remains unclear who exactly is behind the high - profile attacks in recent months
@entity8 officials have pointed to a murky separatist group , the @entity175 ( @entity175 ) , which they have blamed for violent acts in the past
@entity178 is the name used by many @entity126 groups to refer to @entity9
but analysts are divided about the extent of the @entity175 's activities and its links to global terrorist networks like @entity186
" generally , the government response is to blame terrorists without providing many details , " @entity150 said
" so i suspect it 's going to be very difficult to get to the bottom of this incident like previous ones
" @entity194 : @entity9 and tensions in @entity8 's restive far west
