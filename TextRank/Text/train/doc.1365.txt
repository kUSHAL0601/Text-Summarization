-- i 'm typing this in bed , lying next to my dog , @entity5
we 're best buds , and it 's sort of a thing we do
there 's also the occasional tongue kiss
but we 're definitely pretty tight , and he trusts me with most anything
save for dressing him up
i once tried to put special doggy hiking shoes on him and that was the closest he ever came to formulating human words
he definitely tried to call me , " @entity26 boy
" so , the other day , i was completely amazed when i stumbled on a trending @entity28 blog dedicated to dressing up cats
but , as we all know , cats are evil and sinister , and will disfigure you on a whim , particularly when you are making a spirited attempt to make them look pretty
" sorry to hear about @entity38
what happened ? " " she put a ribbon on @entity42
" but maybe dressing up your cat is n't actually such a bad idea
the popular blog is called @entity47 , and it was recently started by a fun couple in @entity49 , @entity50 , who , one day , decided to accessorize their 16 - year - old @entity53 cat , @entity55 , with a pair of women 's leggings
@entity59 explained to me , " we often dress our cats in little outfits and one day we just tried leggings with @entity55
she did n't mind , and she looked so funny in the tights
so , we started the @entity47 blog
" two weeks later , after it was featured on the website sad and @entity69 , @entity47 became an international viral smash hit
so , if productivity is suddenly down in your office , blame @entity50
of course , that 's my excuse for everything
" sir , this restaurant requires pants
" " yeah , but you know ... @entity50
" as the blog became more popular , @entity59 , along with her graphic designer boyfriend , @entity81 , started a @entity83 page where they also post fan submissions
apparently , cats in tights has now sort of become a thing
@entity59 says her secret to doing it right is stuffing the leggings with " other tights , panties , and some of @entity81 's boxers i do n't like
he does n't know that
" so , if you have a recently - updated will , ski goggles , and a full set of medieval chainmail , and want to try this at home , by all means do it
what could possibly go wrong ? " @entity107 , how do you get human blood off the ceiling ? " of course , because this is the @entity112 -- a place where horrible , boring people come to complain about everything -- a few visitors to the @entity47 blog thought this was all rather cruel
but @entity59 does n't mind the ( very ) limited criticism
she says , " @entity55 likes it when we give her this attention
it 's impossible to force a cat to pose like she does
so , i do n't care
" besides , @entity59 is actually used to angry comments from her other blog
and as i inquired about her other presence on the @entity112 , i soon discovered i was e-mailing with somebody remarkably creative and unique , and completely worth writing about
so , the cat blog discussion is over
but , now i want you to really get to know @entity59 , who is officially my new favorite person on the planet
( sorry , mr. @entity135 it 's been a good , long run , but you 've been replaced
) the other blog @entity59 was talking about is something called @entity140 , which sounds like you accidentally inhaled a @entity141 , but loosely translates to " @entity142
" it 's all about making food in a coffee maker
" i 've been doing it for almost five years now , " @entity59 says
" it started when i did n't have a kitchen , and now it 's a hobby
" it seems that a coffee maker can be used in many different ways beyond just its intended purpose
which , of course , is to take up space on your counter next to the @entity158
( confession : i recently made the switch
it 's completely wasteful and unnecessary , and i love it
up yours , planet earth ! ) but according to @entity59 's blog -- where you can find an excellent @entity169 - language primer on the subject -- the plate can by used for frying , the pot for cooking , and the " filter thingy " for steaming
and , although i ca n't understand the text , her blog is actually quite beautiful -- it 's even won the @entity50 food blog of the year
which , apparently , exists
@entity59 and @entity81 also turned their coffee pot hobby into an actual cookbook , and it includes lots of great photo cameos by @entity55 and their other two cats , @entity187 and @entity188
of course , running two blogs is great and all , but the real kicker is this : @entity59 's actual day job is as a professional balloon artist ! she says , " the balloon thing is not that big in @entity50 , so i 'm not as crazy good as your @entity196 balloon artists
but when i do work at events , parties , festival and stuff , people ( especially children and drunk adults ) always love it
" seriously , @entity59 is an international treasure , and she needs to be cloned
besides , if our future world goes to hell , at least we 'll know who to blame
follow @ @entity211 on @entity212 .
