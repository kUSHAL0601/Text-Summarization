@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 celebrated late into the evening saturday the reported capture of @entity5 's son , @entity4 , nabbed in a desert gunbattle after an 18 - day stakeout
senior @entity1 military officials said they believe the potential @entity5 successor was trying to make his way to neighboring @entity11 , where a brother , @entity12 , was granted asylum
revolutionary fighters caught the man wanted by the @entity17 between the southwestern oasis town of @entity19 and southern town of @entity21 , military commanders in @entity0 told @entity2
the 39 - year - old , the last @entity5 fugitive , was taken to the city of @entity25 in the western mountains
top officials in the town rejoiced over the development
@entity4 had been on the run since shortly after the fall of his father 's @entity32 in the capital in august
" i hope that this is the beginning of a state of freedom , transparency and lawfulness , " acting prime minister @entity35 told reporters in @entity25
" in the name of the great nation , we would like to allay your fears and tell you that @entity4 and those who were with him will be tried fairly
they are ensured all their rights under the law
these are the same rights that our nation did n't have for 42 years
" the @entity17 in the @entity52 wants @entity4 for alleged crimes against humanity , including murder , committed during the uprising this year
but officials in @entity1 also indicated they would like to put @entity4 on trial
although he held no high - level government office , @entity4 was considered by @entity17 prosecutors to be @entity5 's " unspoken successor and the most influential person with his inner circle , " according to an arrest warrant issued in june
the @entity5 regime formulated a state policy that included quelling demonstrations by lethal force , attacking civilians and imprisoning hundreds , according to the warrant
@entity4 " exercised control over crucial parts of the state apparatus , including finances and logistics and had the powers of a de facto prime minister
" @entity17 chief prosecutor @entity78 said the arrest was " good news
" " that is very important because we consider him -- the judges consider him -- the principal , with his father @entity86 , of the crimes committed in @entity1 after february 13 , " he said
" he 's arrested , he 's alive , and now he will face justice and that is the most important news
" @entity78 will travel to @entity1 next week to coordinate efforts to bring @entity4 to justice , an @entity17 spokeswoman said saturday
who is @entity4 ? " the @entity17 has had indirect contact with @entity4 through intermediaries during which they discussed what would happen if he surrendered
the last contact was 25 days ago , " spokeswoman @entity98 told @entity2
@entity17 spokesman @entity100 told @entity2 that @entity1 has an obligation to surrender @entity4 to the @entity17
if @entity1 wants to conduct a trial , it needs to submit a request to judges and show its legal system is capable of properly handling such a proceeding
@entity35 emphasized that " we will deal with this under our legal system , " but he said the country intends to communicate and work with the @entity17
" we 'll get to a point where we can take care of this issue easily , " @entity112 said
" we definitely are interested in respecting the will of our people and also the national interests that we trust that the world will also appreciate
" justice minister @entity121 said he doubts @entity1 courts would want to try @entity4 for crimes against humanity
" we will weigh out the accusations against @entity126
afterward , we will know what crimes to try him with
he 's charged with killing and taking the nation 's money and ... hiring mercenaries
those are crimes the @entity1 nation will currently try him for
we ca n't move ahead of ourselves with inaccurate accusations
we will move forward with this investigation
" military commanders told @entity2 they want the @entity138 to ensure @entity4 is tried in their country
outbursts of celebratory gunfire , the honking of horns and cries of joy could be heard in @entity0 as reports of his capture spread
@entity148 , commander of the @entity150 brigades , said he had been told that @entity4 was slightly injured in the clashes that took place when the fighters attempted to capture him but is in good health
a picture released by @entity1 's @entity138 purportedly of @entity4 appeared to show him half - lying on a low bed with bandages wrapped around the fingers of his right hand
a military commander from @entity25 , @entity161 , told @entity2 that the injuries had been sustained in previous clashes rather than the firefight that led to his capture in the early hours of saturday
@entity161 , who was in @entity19 at the time , said fighters from the @entity168 had been following a vehicle convoy
as they approached , the convoy tried to flee , firing on the fighters , who returned fire
when the convoy was eventually stopped , @entity4 was arrested , along with up to six others
they were taken to @entity25
@entity148 said those with @entity4 when he was caught did not include his father 's former intelligence chief @entity178 , also wanted by the @entity17
@entity181 and @entity182 officials , part of the @entity185 mission that supported the rebels since february , welcomed the capture
" @entity4 no longer poses a threat to peace and security in @entity1 , " said @entity182 foreign secretary @entity188
" his arrest will allow the @entity1 people to move on to the challenge of rebuilding their country
" time.com : the reformer who refused to reform the suspect 's father , who ruled the country for more than 40 years , was killed last month near @entity201 after his capture by forces loyal to the @entity138
asked about guarantees of @entity4 's safety , @entity148 said he would be treated in the same way as any other detainee
@entity138 military liaison @entity208 told @entity2 that any injuries @entity4 had sustained would be treated
there was still some secrecy over his movements , @entity208 said , but he could guarantee @entity4 's human rights would be respected if he is handed over to authorities in @entity0
giving his reaction to the news of the arrest , @entity208 said : " i think the @entity1 people can finally actually breathe a big sigh , finally relax to some extent , because he has been threatening to come back with revenge for some time now
so , it 's a close for many , many people
" a glimpse into the @entity5 family once seen as a possible successor to his father and an advocate of reform , @entity4 became a vocal defender of his father 's brutal regime
his whereabouts had been unknown for months
at the end of august he made a call to @entity238 's @entity237 , in which he said he was speaking from a suburb of the capital , @entity0 , and urged @entity1 to rise up against the rebels
@entity4 , whose mother is @entity5 's second wife , @entity242 , is the second - oldest son of the late strongman
he was educated at the @entity244 and speaks fluent @entity245
@entity2 's @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .
