ask a @entity1 what happened on june 10 , 1886 , and they 'll tell you the planet lost its " eighth wonder
" the @entity6 and @entity7 of @entity8 were the world 's largest silica towers and the @entity12 's biggest 19th - century attraction until a massive eruption at @entity14 that momentous day blasted these natural wonders into oblivion
out of that same eruption , however , a new wonder of the world was born
@entity20 roared into existence hurling black mud and sand some 1,500 feet ( 460 meters ) into the sky , making it the most powerful geyser the world has ever seen
this new attraction ignited a whirlwind of global interest in @entity31 's volcanic @entity30 until it , too , vanished off the face of the earth in 1904 after a landslide changed the water table
the @entity7 and @entity20 may be lost forever , but their impression on tourists of the time is well documented
they are but two of many attractions of yesteryear that can now only be appreciated in the pages of a history book
here 's a look at 10 others
the current @entity48 may be a charmless catacomb of labyrinthine low - ceiling hallways , but @entity51 's first @entity48 was a lavish masterpiece of the @entity54 style
the original facility 's domed ceilings , soaring archways and handsome columns welcomed more than 100 million passengers each year during the station 's golden era in the mid- 1940s
but by the end of the 1950s , the dawn of the @entity63 and the birth of the @entity65 took a heavy toll on visitor numbers
plans for the new @entity70 and @entity71 were announced in 1962 , and a year later , the original @entity48 was knocked to the ground to make room for a smaller facility underground
the demolition of @entity48 in 1963 was not without controversy
the @entity77 questioned at the time how the city would " permit this monumental act of vandalism against one of the largest and finest landmarks of its age of @entity86 elegance
" the whole affair is regularly cited as the catalyst for the modern historical preservation movement in the @entity91
within a decade of @entity48 's demolition , @entity92 was protected under @entity51 's new @entity94
@entity95 was easily the most powerful cataract in the world in terms of total volume with 1,750,000 cubic feet of water passing through each second
that 's more than double the flow of @entity104 and more than 12 times that of @entity105
but good luck finding any trace of @entity95 underneath the @entity108
more than three decades have now passed since one of the world 's greatest waterfalls was drowned to pave the way for a massive hydroelectric project
this natural wonder , lost to the world in 1982 , once lured hordes of local and international tourists to the @entity119 at the @entity122 - @entity121 border
it contained 18 falls in total with a drop of about 375 feet , and its deafening roar could be heard from up to 20 miles away
at least three @entity129 theaters have graced the shores of the @entity131 over the past five centuries
first there was the original @entity129 , built in 1599 by @entity135 's playing company , the @entity136
a fire destroyed it during a performance of @entity140 on june 29 , 1613 , but a second @entity141 opened on the same site exactly one year later
it , too , closed in 1642 amid an outcry by @entity145 who were opposed to theatrical performances
the legacy of the first @entity141 and the iconic plays it debuted to the world lives on at the modern reconstruction , known as @entity152 , which opened its doors in 1997 approximately 750 feet from the original theater
when @entity156 first opened to the public in 1894 , the three - acre complex housed a staggering seven pools ( at varying temperatures ) under a massive glass enclosure with springboards , high dives , slides and trapezes
the facility could hold as many as 10,000 people at one time and also had several non-aquatic attractions such as a natural history museum with @entity171 mummies and a sculpture gallery with artifacts from @entity174 and @entity175
the oceanfront property ensconced in the rocky @entity178 coast was considered a playground unlike any other the world had ever seen
its achilles ' heel , however , was an outsized price tag to match its ostentatious offerings
with exceedingly high operational costs , the @entity185 were never a commercially successful business -- even after owners turned the pools into ice skating rinks during the @entity191
the facility shut down for good in 1964 and was destroyed in a fire two years later
its remains are now protected as part of the @entity197
in an 1839 fairy tale called " @entity200 , " @entity198 describes a teenager named @entity202 who flies home from the @entity204 and tells his mother , " i came back from @entity175 , where i danced for a while around a tower of porcelain and rang all the bells
" the @entity212 author 's fable may be a fantasy , but the tower of porcelain bricks was no figment of his vivid imagination
considered one of the @entity221 of the @entity222 , the @entity218 of @entity219 was built by the third emperor of the @entity224 in the early 15th century and rose from a 97 - foot octagonal base to a height of 260 feet
this glossy nine - story pagoda soared above the south bank of the @entity229 in @entity219 for more than four centuries before it was destroyed under the @entity231 of the 1850s
its rubble remained relatively untouched until 2010 when a businessman donated $ 156 million ( the largest single donation in @entity175 history ) to rebuild the medieval icon
the @entity239 was billed as the largest theater in the world when it opened to the public in @entity243 in 1905 , featuring a 100 - foot - by - 200 - foot stage and the capacity to seat up to 5,300 spectators
this mammoth attraction lured the biggest acts of the day such as @entity249 and the " @entity251 " musical , but , like @entity178 's @entity156 , it racked up a hefty upkeep bill
just 17 years after the @entity239 opened , its owners refashioned the @entity256 - style building into a vaudeville theater
five years later it became a movie theater , then an opera house and finally a sports arena
the doldrums of the @entity191 dealt one final blow to the facility and it was torn down in 1939 to make way for an office building and parking garage
the @entity268 lies 17,400 feet up in the @entity269 and was once one of @entity272 's top tourist attractions , luring skiers the world over with the promise of tackling earth 's highest ski run
thanks to global warming , however , the 18,000 - year - old wonder has been reduced to a few lumps of unskiable ice that no visitor would go out of their way to see
in its prime it had the first rope tow in @entity289 ( built in 1939 ) and the highest ski lodge in the world , at an elevation greater than @entity293
@entity294 was the closest ski area to the equator before it indefinitely closed in 2012
known as the " bridge of ice " in the local @entity301 language , @entity294 is but one of many glaciers currently retreating toward almost certain oblivion
@entity305 's very first water park , @entity306 , is looking anything but jolly these days after lying abandoned on the shores of @entity309 , @entity310 , for more than a decade
the " old - fashioned swimming hole , " replete with swings , slides and whitewater rafting , closed for annual maintenance in 2001 never to open again
park officials cited declining business after 9/11 and the success of @entity305 's two newer water parks , @entity320 and @entity321 , as reasons for their decision
@entity309 is also home to the only other @entity325 park to close permanently : @entity326
this abandoned ( but not demolished ) zoological park was yet another 1970s - era attraction that lost favor with visitors and eventually closed to the public in 1999
all animals were relocated to new homes at @entity325 's @entity334 , a much larger zoo that opened in 1998
a warning to any urban explorers out there : @entity325 employees still monitor both @entity306 and @entity326 for trespassers
like the operas that brought its audiences to tears , the story of the @entity342 of @entity343 is fittingly tragic
designed by @entity351 in the 1860s , architect of the @entity342 in @entity350 's @entity349 , it was the crowning jewel of @entity355 's capital city for just six years before a fire gutted the interior
it was resurrected from the flames four years later , but tragedy struck again during @entity361 when the @entity342 received a direct hit from an aerial bomb
a few columns remain in place on the corner of @entity367 , forming a backdrop for the open - air royal @entity369 , launched within the ruins of the @entity342 in 2013
@entity373 's tomb in @entity374 , @entity375 , is the newest addition to this list and one of a series of attractions lost to war
militants with the @entity383 , or @entity384 , planted explosives in july 2014 around @entity374 's oldest mosque , which is traditionally held to be the burial place of @entity373
@entity373 is a key figure in both @entity389 and @entity390 who , according to @entity383 and judeo - christian traditions , was swallowed by a whale
his tomb was a popular place of pilgrimage and joins a growing list of holy sites deemed idolatrous under the puritanical strain of @entity390 practiced by @entity384
@entity400 is an @entity91 travel and culture writer based in @entity403 , @entity404 .
