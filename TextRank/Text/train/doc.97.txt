-- the residents of @entity2 and @entity3 have voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana , and all hell is about to break loose -- at least ideologically
the problem is that pot is still very much illegal under federal law , and the @entity11 administration must decide whether to enforce federal law in a state that has rejected the substance of that law
what makes this development fascinating is that it brings into conflict two important strains of political thought in @entity22 : federalism and moralism
federalists , who seek to limit the power of the federal government relative to the states and individuals , will urge a hands - off approach
moralists , on the other hand , strongly believe in the maintenance of an established social order and will argue for continuing enforcement of federal narcotics laws
the new laws will pit those who want a small federal government that leaves businesses and individuals alone against those who want the government to actively enforce a traditional sense of public morality in areas such as narcotics , abortion and limitations on gay marriage
one aspect of this conundrum is the near - total overlap between federal and state narcotics laws
simple possession of marijuana is made into a federal criminal case under 21 @entity57 , and federal law oddly categorizes marijuana as a schedule i narcotic , along with heroin and mescaline -- even as cocaine and opium remain on the less - serious @entity66 while federal law typically wo n't provide jurisdiction over a street robbery or even a murder , it does allow federal courts to imprison someone for carrying a small bag of marijuana , even when state law says otherwise
opinion : the end of the war on marijuana federal and state efforts to curb marijuana use through prosecution simply have n't worked
in 2010 , four out of five of the 1.64 million people arrested for drug violations were accused of possession , and half of those arrests were for carrying what were often very small amounts of marijuana
those hundreds of thousands of drug cases corresponded with an increase in marijuana use
if federal policy were about problem - solving , @entity2 would not pose a dilemma , because prosecuting marijuana cases has n't solved the problem of marijuana use
federal drug policy , though , is very much driven by moralism rather than problem - solving
after all , we have spent billions of dollars -- about $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion a year during the past decade -- and incarcerated tens of thousands of people to punish drug possession and trafficking without ever successfully restricting the flow of marijuana or cocaine
if we think tough drug laws solve the problem of drug use , we are deluding ourselves
rather , what sustains the effort is the bedrock belief that drugs are bad , and we must punish those who sell them or use them
mass incarceration is justified by the belief that those we lock up simply deserve it
that sense of retributive morality does not stop at state borders
@entity124 , though , demands that individual and state rights be honored above all but the most important federal imperatives
should marijuana be legal ? readers debate pot laws we are not a unitary state like many @entity133 nations , and part of the genius of the @entity22 experience is the delicate balance between federal and state powers desired by those wise men who crafted the mechanics of our government
the difference between federalism and the kind of moralism driving national narcotics policy is simply this : federalism is a central principle built into the structure of our government through the @entity151
@entity152 of marijuana use is not such a defining principle
to be true to our best values , federalism should win out
no doubt , the moralists will consider the regulations on marijuana " too important " to bow to federalism concerns , but their sway is limited
our recent elections show the moralists to be in decline , as those who fought limits on gay marriage won across the board at the same time that marijuana was legalized
as a federal prosecutor , i had the privilege of representing the @entity22 and a role in employing the singular power of prosecutorial discretion
the @entity11 administration should employ that discretionary power in line with our oldest and best principles and step back from continuing marijuana prosecutions in @entity2 and @entity3
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .
