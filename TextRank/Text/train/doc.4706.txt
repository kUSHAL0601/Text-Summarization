-- if this is an indication of what @entity4 will do at @entity6 , his opponents had better watch out
@entity4 recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard @entity9 6 - 0 6 - 0 on friday to reach the semifinals of a @entity6 warm - up in @entity12 , @entity13
the only other time @entity4 did n't drop a game in a match was at the year - end championships in 2005 against clay - court specialist @entity18
" you never go to court aiming for such a score , " @entity4 , who turns 32 in august , told reporters
" i 'm surprised to have managed it today
" at @entity6 , which begins on june 24 , @entity4 will be bidding to advance to a first grand slam final since claiming a seventh title on the @entity6 grass a year ago
he lost to @entity28 in the @entity30 quarterfinals last september , @entity31 in january 's @entity33 semifinals and @entity34 in this month 's @entity36 quarterfinals
@entity4 knows the chances of registering a second consecutive double bagel are slim
he meets local favorite and the man who beat him in last year 's final in @entity12 , @entity42 , in the last four
" i expect a completely different opponent tomorrow , " @entity4 said
@entity42 and @entity4 , good friends , played doubles together this week in @entity12
" he is one of the greatest of all time , perhaps the greatest , " said @entity42
@entity42 , the 35 - year - old third seed , rallied from a set down to oust @entity48 6 - 7 ( 4 ) 6 - 3 6 - 3
but he was the only @entity49 winner on the day
besides @entity9 , sixth - seed @entity50 and eighth - seed @entity51 were also sent packing
@entity54 second - seed @entity53 topped @entity51 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 4 ) and @entity56 @entity55 beat @entity50 , the 2011 champion , 6 - 3 6 - 2
at @entity57 in @entity58 , the other men 's warm - up taking place this week , top - seed @entity31 progressed to the semifinals with a 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 3 ) victory over @entity13 's @entity64
the @entity65 returned from a back injury at @entity67 and has n't lost a set in his three matches , despite several stops and starts due to rain
he has shared the spotlight at @entity67 's with veteran and four - time winner @entity75
" i thought the first set was good , and then he started playing much better in the second , " @entity31 said in a televised interview
" i just managed to hang tough and get the win
the conditions were tough , again , but it 's only my first week on grass
" while @entity4 tries for an eighth success at @entity6 , @entity31 will attempt to end a 77 - year @entity85 men 's singles drought at the @entity86
his next foe is fourth - seed @entity34 , who suffered a painful semifinal defeat to @entity89 on home soil at the @entity36
@entity34 eased past young @entity92 @entity91 6 - 3 6 - 2
@entity75 , who has endured multiple hip operations , toppled @entity94 6 - 2 , 2 - 6 , 6 - 2
@entity94 , still learning the finer points of playing on grass , missed the @entity36 due to illness
" i 'm still hanging in there , " the 32 - year - old @entity75 said
" the last four or five years have been tough with surgeries , but mentally i feel fresh
" as in @entity12 a back - to - back winner remains a possibility because @entity103 @entity102 , the fifth seed , edged @entity28 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 4 )
@entity102 almost exited in the third round , trailing @entity106 5 - 2 in the third set before staging a comeback .
