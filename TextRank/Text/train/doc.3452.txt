-- maybe it was just a case of delaying the inevitable during monday 's 66th @entity4 ceremony
having showered an array of major nominations on cable , @entity8 and movie stars while seeming to further diminish the so - called " @entity11 " broadcast networks , emmy voters in a sense recanted on the big night
eleven of the 25 trophies -- an unusually high percentage these days -- went to traditional over-the - air networks , while @entity8 and the marquee movie stars got shut out
as they 've tended to do in the past , voters instead rinsed and repeated by rewarding previous winners
the six main categories are instructive
@entity27 's " @entity26 " defended last year 's championship in the @entity22 as it knocked off @entity24 's much - heralded " true detective , " which won just one @entity25 all night
in the @entity28 , @entity34 's " @entity33 " prevailed for the fifth year in a row , tying the record set by @entity32 's " @entity31
" @entity8 's drama - fueled " @entity36 is the @entity37 , " which entered itself in this category , did go to jail but did not collect any emmys
@entity41 added to the broadcast network glow by winning a second lead actress in a @entity44 , this time for her role in @entity47 ' " @entity46
" for the first time at any of this year 's major awards ceremonies , @entity48 came away empty - handed in the lead actor in a @entity22 for his showy role in @entity24 's " true detective
" @entity54 out dueled him and won his fourth emmy for " @entity26
" it was @entity57 ' night once more in winning @entity43 in a @entity58
she won her third @entity25 for @entity24 's " @entity59 , " and now is the only actress to take home the lead prize in three comedy series -- including @entity32 's " @entity64 " and @entity47 ' " @entity65
" @entity47 and @entity66 combined again in the lead actor in a @entity58 category
@entity69 has now won four emmys for " @entity71 , " which is still television 's runaway most popular comedy series on all " platforms
" for those of you keeping score , half of these marquee @entity70 went to the traditional broadcast networks and each winner was a repeater
in what seem like prehistoric times , @entity34 , @entity47 , @entity32 and @entity82 used to dominate " television 's biggest night " before flaunting their @entity44 wins as promotional springboards for the new fall season
@entity32 famously inserted commercials within the 1981 primetime ceremony touting the mounting number of @entity44 wins for its then ratings - starved first - year series , " @entity94
" the classic cop drama ended up winning six of @entity32 's eight emmys on that night
and in its second season , " @entity104 " vaulted from nearly dead last to a top 30 finish in the yearly primetime @entity103
cable networks , led by @entity24 , began flexing muscles in the 1990s , though
series such as " @entity108 " and " @entity109 " became @entity44 darlings while @entity24 's movies were perennial winners
at last year 's major @entity44 ceremony , @entity24 led all networks with seven wins , as other cable networks and @entity8 combined for another 12 statues
that left the broadcast networks with just six wins out of the 25 major emmys awarded
whether it carries over or not -- and chances are it wo n't -- monday night 's 11 broadcast network wins are an overall morale boost compared with recent outcomes
also left at @entity44 's altar monday night was movie star @entity129 , an early favorite for his villainous lead role in @entity133 's " @entity132
" but the " lead actor in a @entity25 went to @entity134 for his title role in @entity137 ' " @entity136 : his last vow
" emmy host @entity140 had measured the traditional broadcast networks for a coffin early in his opening monologue
" @entity145 still has an award for music videos even though they no longer show music videos , " he joked
" that 's like network tv holding an awards show and giving all the trophies to cable and @entity8
why would they do that ? " @entity157 could have been speaking for host network @entity32 , which was shut out monday night along with @entity82
but old - liner @entity47 ended up in a three - way tie for the most emmys , at five , with cable 's @entity27 and @entity133
@entity24 , accustomed to walking away as @entity44 's top dog , won just three @entity70 to tie it with broadcasters @entity34 and @entity137
the @entity8 shutout , following nominations in five of the six marquee categories , may be a message that @entity70 voters are not yet ready to swoon over the " world 's leading television internet provider , " as it bills itself
@entity8 still keeps its audience numbers secret for its streaming original series and also may have riled some voters by submitting " @entity36 is the @entity37 " as a comedy in what looked like a craven grab for @entity44 gold
indeed , @entity140 basked in sustained applause and cheers when he cracked , " we had comedies that made you laugh and comedies that made you cry because they were dramas submitted as comedies
" in this emmy year at least , the broadcast network contingent has something to cheer about , too
it might well be a last stand , with an increasing number of cable networks making original and praiseworthy drama or comedy series
but for one shining night , broadcasters @entity47 , @entity34 and @entity137 can all say they matched or exceeded @entity24
these days that 's no small feat.
