@entity0 -- in an environment of declining retail sales in the @entity5 , one premium brand is bucking the trend as consumers vote with their consciences
sales of ethically produced , fair trade products in the @entity5 increased by 12 % from 2010 to 2011 , accounting for Â £ 1.3 billion ( $ 2.07 billion )
while just 0.01 % of food and drink sales worldwide are certified fair trade , in the @entity5 , the world 's biggest fair trade market , ethically sourced produce is big business
supermarket shelves teem with fair trade products from all corners of the globe , as the @entity5 consume 9.7 million cups of fair trade tea , 6.4 millions cups fair trade coffee and 3.2 million fair trade bananas every day
fair trade involves retailers paying a premium to suppliers in developing countries
" it 's about investment to be fair to everyone in the supply chain , " says @entity31 , fair trade director for the co-operative , whose supermarket wing has recently moved to stock exclusively fair trade bananas
while consumers in the @entity5 pay a marginal premium , if any , for ethically sourced produce , the practice can make a real difference at the source of production
@entity46 , a banana grower from @entity48 , says his community was barely covering the costs of production before the introduction of fair trade
" through fair trade , we have been able to develop our community with investments in our water supply , and ways to improve our living conditions , " he said
@entity5 consumers ' rush to embrace fair trade products seems tied to widespread public awareness of fair trade principles
according to @entity31 , 96 % of @entity5 consumers were aware of fair trade , compared to just 47 % in other parts of @entity69
" there is potential for @entity69 to catch up with the @entity5 in fair trade , " he said
" it 's all about increasing awareness
" and , to a growing extent , popular consumer brands are taking the lead themselves
popular chocolate goods such as @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 are now fair trade , while ice cream producers @entity84 's will switch to exclusively fair trade ingredients this year .
