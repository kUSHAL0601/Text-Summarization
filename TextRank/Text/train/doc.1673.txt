-- as @entity2 wrestles with legislation aimed at easing the southern border crisis , the @entity1 is considering steps president @entity6 can take on his own to address an immigration system widely viewed as broken and in need of reform
one potential option for executive action includes expanding a program allowing those brought to the @entity14 illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation , if they meet certain criteria , sources familiar with the matter told @entity0
other possible steps include granting some kind of legal status to the parents of @entity14 citizens as well as allowing certain undocumented immigrants to apply for temporary work permits , the sources said
@entity29 leaders to @entity6 : we 're working on it " there are so many ways they could cut this pie and define and protect a class " of undocumented immigrants , one source said
" i think only now are they really trying to get into the details of what 's possible from a legal perspective , a policy perspective and also what 's possible from a political perspective
" more pressing , however , is how to respond to the current border troubles
tens of thousands of migrant youth from @entity29 have streamed across the southern border this year , overwhelming related services and creating what most agree is a humanitarian crisis
children at the border : why now and what happens next ? in the @entity1 , speaker @entity55 told reporters on tuesday that he believed " there is sufficient support " for the a $ 659 million measure aimed at bringing conservatives on board to pass a funding bill to address the matter
the new @entity65 plan is smaller than a roughly $ 1 billion package discussed last week , and significantly less than the $ 3.7 billion request sought by @entity6
@entity2 is set to leave town at the end of the week for its august recess and some @entity1 @entity65 are concerned about potential political fallout if they leave @entity72 without addressing the issue
but a group of conservatives remain dug in over cost
senate majority leader @entity77 acknowledged tuesday that @entity78 could use the @entity65 border bill as a vehicle to add the @entity82 's comprehensive immigration reform legislation from last summer , which would negate any need for @entity6 to act on immigration more broadly
@entity6 weighs sending @entity85 to border but @entity1 and @entity82 @entity65 aides argued it would be almost impossible procedurally to marry the two bills
@entity55 has made it clear the @entity1 will not take up the @entity82 measure
due to congressional inaction on immigration reform in general , @entity6 had asked attorney general @entity93 and @entity94 to look at steps he could take to " fix as much of our immigration system as i can on my own
" in march , the administration announced @entity94 would conduct a thorough review of the deportation process to find a more commonsense , humane approach to the practice
that review is now part of the discussions on what executive action the president may take
@entity1 officials have indicated those actions could be significant and sweeping
" the only question is what 's the political blowback going to be ? " said a one source
immigrants or refugees ? a difference with political consequences
