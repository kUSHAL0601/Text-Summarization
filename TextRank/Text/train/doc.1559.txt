it 's a tied race between two unpopular men
three weeks before @entity4 , @entity3 incumbent gov. @entity2 finds himself in a neck - and - neck sprint to the finish line against @entity8 challenger and former gov. @entity9
according to a new @entity13 / @entity12 poll , each candidate has the support of 44 % of likely voters , while libertarian @entity16 pulls a significant share ( 9 % ) of the vote
with the race so close , @entity16 's support sets the stage for a potential @entity23 spoiler
" and with one in five likely voters saying that they could change their minds between now and @entity4 , it 's really anyone 's ballgame , " said @entity13 polling director @entity24
the survey was done october 9 - 13 with 610 likely voters and has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points
college @entity35 : ' @entity36 ' to @entity2 's dress @entity2 and @entity9 are familiar faces in @entity3
@entity9 was governor in the term immediately preceding @entity2 's
@entity9 , however , was a @entity35 at the time
he became an independent during an unsuccessful bid for the @entity42 in 2010 , then became a @entity43 in 2012
his party switch has become a major line of attack against @entity9
but the former governor and his new @entity8 allies say the @entity35 has taken a different ideological track in recent years
" hell , he did n't leave the ( @entity35 )
it left him , " vice president @entity50 said monday in @entity3 , while campaigning for @entity9
@entity3 to vote on legalizing medical marijuana @entity2 was elected in the @entity54 wave of 2010 with campaign promises to make big cuts and take on public unions
despite holding true to his pledges and his state seeing a steady rise in economic growth , @entity2 's approval ratings have slipped dramatically
while both candidates are widely known in the state , it appears voters are split on who they like less
a majority of likely voters , 53 % , have an unfavorable view of @entity9 , and a majority , 52 % , also have an unfavorable view of @entity2
" one thing is certain : this year 's race is not a popularity contest , " @entity24 said
" that may explain why a third - party candidate is in the high single digits
" with two prominent names in the mix , the contest has been one of the most closely watched races of 2014
@entity85 's midterm malaise @entity9 threw his hat in the ring with much fanfare late last year , and early polls indicated he has a sizable advantage over @entity2
but the race tightened this year , and the high - profile appeal of the race and its swing - state dynamics have attracted big - name surrogates on both sides
in addition to @entity50 , former secretary of state @entity97 campaigned for @entity9 this month , and first lady @entity85 will do a fundraiser for @entity9 on friday in @entity100
on thursday , @entity102 gov. @entity101 will turn out for @entity2
as chairman of the @entity105 , it will mark @entity101 's fourth trip to the state this year
fellow gov. @entity108 of @entity109 has also shown up for @entity2
@entity13 will air a debate between @entity9 and @entity2 on october 21
the hourlong debate will air exclusively at 7 p.m. et on @entity13 and @entity112 and take place in @entity112 's studios in @entity115 , @entity3
@entity13 's @entity116 , chief @entity117 correspondent and anchor of @entity13 's " the lead , " will moderate with @entity112 anchor @entity120 joining in the questioning.â € ‹
