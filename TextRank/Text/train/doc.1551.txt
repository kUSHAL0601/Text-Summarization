when police found the unconscious man in a @entity4 , the ids on him said he was @entity5 from @entity6
but when the man awoke at @entity8 a few days later , he said he 'd never heard of @entity5
he did n't recall serving in the @entity9
or of being born in @entity6
when doctors told him he had five tennis rackets in his hotel room , he could n't say why
when they showed him photos of himself with others , he did n't recognize them , or himself
and he did n't speak a word of @entity17
the man said his name was @entity20
and he said it in @entity22
that was back in february
today , the 61 - year - old man says he has come to terms with the name " @entity27 , " but only because doctors told him he should
he still feels like @entity20 from @entity29
and he ca n't explain why
the case was first reported by the @entity31 car crash leaves @entity34 woman with @entity36 accent digging in the past before she became a social worker at @entity8 , @entity37 was an archeologist
those digging skills came in handy the day she met @entity20 / @entity27
her mission : help @entity5 figure out who he is
she first contacted the military
among the @entity43 police discovered on him was one from the @entity47
he 'd served from 1971 to 1973 in the @entity9 as an aviation mechanic
the @entity50 connection she found a website for the @entity52 @entity17 school in @entity53
turns out @entity5 taught @entity17 there for four years , until may
in an essay he wrote for the site , he mentioned he worked as an @entity17 instructor in @entity58 for 10 years , and that he was married to a @entity58 woman
they have a 12 - year - old son together , he wrote
but there was one hitch
photos found with @entity5 in the motel room showed a young man living in what looked like a @entity70 city , not @entity50
she came across several websites dedicated to graphic designs
@entity5 often used the screen name ' korstemplar ' and listed himself as a @entity29 living and teaching in @entity53
the pieces were falling into place
a roadblock he had lived in @entity58 , married , became a father
he then moved to @entity53
the school in @entity53 told her he was divorced
he lived there until may , when his visa expired and he flew to @entity85
but when she contacted the @entity58 and @entity53 consulates , neither had next - of - kin information for him , according to the @entity31 staffers called all the numbers on the phone @entity5 had with him
they either went to voice mail or no one picked up , the newspaper said
she had hit a dead end
his life so far @entity99 knows about his life before february 28 he knows because his social worker told him or because he read it on websites
he told @entity103 he learned that in 1987 he operated a consulting company called @entity105
that is somewhat of a @entity22 connection
he does n't have any independent knowledge of his life before he woke up in the hospital
he does n't even know exactly what his consulting company did
@entity5 told @entity103 he 'd been a good tennis player , and the @entity112 had interviewed him years ago
perhaps , he said , he 'd come to southern @entity85 for the tennis tournament season
that would certainly explain the five rackets in his hotel room
a ' fugue state ' according to the @entity118 , @entity5 is in a " fugue state
" people in this condition lose their sense of personal identity , according to the @entity124
they become confused about past events and often wander far from home
fugue states , such as dissociative fugue , are often triggered by trauma , such as the death of a loved one or a serious accident , according to dr. @entity132 , a neurologist at @entity133
patients sometimes assume different personalities , @entity132 added
the relatively rare disorder often goes away on its own , but it can take several months
what the future holds now that @entity5 's story has spread to the @entity22 media , several @entity29 have come forth to say they knew him in the 1980s
late monday night , the @entity118 reported it found @entity5 's sister in @entity143
" i have n't talked to him in years
he just disappeared , " @entity145 told the paper
learning about his life has n't helped him much psychologically
he still feels isolated in the hospital , so @entity37 encouraged him to reach out to members of the local @entity22 - @entity152 community
" they said he was getting depressed because he was n't able to communicate , " said @entity153 , chairman of the @entity155 chapter in @entity156 , @entity85
" we 've been trying to provide him support and make him feel more comfortable
" members visit him in the hospital , bringing him @entity22 foods
the hospital would like to discharge @entity5 , but they have no place to send him , said @entity165 , a spokesman for @entity166
they ca n't send him home until they know where home is .
