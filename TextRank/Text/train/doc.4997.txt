gunmen on friday shot dead a @entity4 @entity3 traditional leader in the northeastern state of @entity6 as he and other @entity8 royals were heading to a funeral , the state government said
@entity11 , emir of the town of @entity13 , was killed as he and two other emirs were traveling to the funeral of an emir in neighboring @entity18 state , @entity6 government representative @entity10 said
@entity10 said the attackers are suspected to be members of the @entity22 militant group @entity21
the country 's defense ministry , which also reported the attack , called the gunmen a " band of terrorists " but did not identify their affiliation
the emir of @entity31 , @entity32 , and the emir of @entity31 , @entity34 , escaped unhurt , according to @entity10
the gunmen specifically targeted the vehicle holding the three emirs and opened fire , @entity10 said
a police escort was shot and injured in the attack , @entity10 said
@entity40 , a member of the @entity13 royalty and a close aide to the slain emir , said the gunmen opened fire from hilltops overlooking the highway
" we came under heavy gunfire from the hills , which forced the convoy to break up in disarray , " said @entity40 , who was in @entity11 's entourage
" we returned to a military checkpoint not far from the scene of the attack and reported the incident to soldiers there , but to our surprise they made no effort to go after the attackers , " @entity40 said
" by the time we returned to the scene , we met the emir dead inside the vehicle with gunshots , " he said
troops were dispatched to the area after the attack and are trying to find the assailants , the defense ministry said
@entity21 has repeatedly targeted @entity4 's @entity3 emirs , accusing them of selling out by submitting to the authority of the secular government
the emirs are from traditional royal families and often serve as liaisons between their communities and the secular government
@entity11 's late father had been a chief in @entity13
in july 2012 , @entity4 's third-most powerful emir , the shehu of @entity6 , @entity80 , survived a suicide bombing as he left a mosque near his palace
the traditional leader survived the attack , but five other people were killed
in august 2012 , a suicide bomber tried to kill the emir of @entity89 in northeastern @entity90 as he left friday prayers near his palace in the town of @entity94
that emir survived the blast , though his police guard was killed
last year , @entity4 's no. 2 @entity3 leader , @entity98 , the emir of @entity99 , survived an attack on his convoy
five people , including three of his bodyguards , died
there have been calls from activists for @entity4 's emirs to play a greater role in curbing @entity21 , which has waged a campaign of violence -- especially in northeastern @entity4 -- with the aim of imposing a stricter enforcement of @entity115 law across @entity4
@entity21 , which means " western education is a sin , " still is holding more than 200 girls it abducted last month from a school in @entity121 , also in @entity6
@entity21 kills 33 security personnel in @entity4 attacks
