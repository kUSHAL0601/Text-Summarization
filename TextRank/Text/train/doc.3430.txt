@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 will back out of plans to produce a movie about the rev. @entity7 unless @entity7 's three surviving children settle their differences over the deal , the studio said wednesday
from left , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity7 and @entity11
the three surviving siblings have had several public rifts
a longtime friend of the three @entity18 predicted peace may be at hand for the squabbling siblings and that all of them want @entity24 's studio to portray their father 's life on the big screen
the latest public rift between @entity29 , the chief executive of the @entity7 estate , and his brother and sister -- @entity34 and @entity35 -- erupted tuesday after it was made public that @entity29 , 48 , had finalized the deal with @entity4
@entity7 , 51 , and @entity35 , 46 , learned that a deal had been struck when @entity12 sent them an e-mail tuesday morning , just as the news media was being told by the studio , a source close to the family told @entity2
@entity11 , the eldest of the @entity18 ' four children , died two years ago at age 51
@entity7 and @entity35 , who live in @entity48 , @entity49 , had known that @entity29 , who lives in @entity1 , was negotiating with @entity24 on a possible movie deal , the source said
@entity35 and @entity7 said they knew nothing about the @entity4 project
they said they embraced the idea of a film about their father but told @entity2 's " @entity62 " they were concerned about the deal
" i think mr. @entity24 is a great producer and we look forward to hearing from him about the scope of this agreement , " @entity35 said
" we know nothing about the scope of this agreement
we have no details to say whether or not this particular one is a good idea
" @entity4 issued a statement wednesday that suggested @entity7 family unity was essential for the movie to be made
" the purpose of making a movie about the life of dr. @entity7 is to tell a great story which could bridge distances and bring people together , " the statement said
" we remain committed to pursuing a film chronicling @entity7 's life provided that there is unity in the family so we can make a film about unity in our nation
" @entity4 executives appeared caught by surprise by the @entity85 's infighting , although such squabbles are not new -- @entity7 and @entity35 filed a lawsuit against @entity29 last year over publication of their mother 's recently discovered love letters
@entity7 and @entity35 have complained in court filings that @entity29 has acted independently for years on estate business matters , refusing to call a family meeting
over the past year , angered over @entity29 's move to publish their mother 's love letters , neither @entity7 nor @entity35 has spoken to @entity29 , the source close to the family said
@entity29 , in a written statement wednesday evening , said he has " always upheld my duty " as ceo of the @entity7 estate to communicate with the others
" although my communication with family members has been somewhat stymied by the current litigation , i have continued to reach out and i remain committed to working together with my siblings on projects to educate people about the life , leadership and teachings of our father , @entity7 , " @entity29 said
@entity4 is " a company with unrivaled resources for making epic films of the highest quality , offers an unprecedented opportunity for educating the largest possible audience about our father 's legacy as the leader of @entity129 's greatest nonviolent movement , " he said
" just as sir @entity132 's film , ' @entity130 , ' educated many millions of people all over the world about the @entity135 's teachings , i believe this project can do the same regarding the life , work and teachings of @entity7 , and i sincerely hope my brother and sister will join us in supporting this urgently needed project , " @entity29 said
@entity144 , an @entity48 public relations agent who has known all three children since the 1960s , when he was their father 's driver , suggested the dispute could be resolved
" i do n't think that either @entity7 or @entity13 are opposed to having a megafilm done on the big screen by @entity4 , but i think it 's the mechanism and the way it was done that 's got them upset , " @entity144 said
" they 're feeling that , until they resolve some problems with @entity12 , that they 're not going to be very forthcoming in letting this project go forward , " he said
@entity144 suggested someone such as the rev. @entity160 , a close aide to the patriarch during the civil - rights movement , might be able to help the siblings reconcile
@entity160 is a former @entity48 mayor and former @entity165 ambassador
" @entity7 and @entity13 want to have some reconciliation with @entity12 before they sign off on it , " @entity144 said .
