-- formal trial proceedings against the alleged planners of the 9/11 atrocities have finally begun
@entity4 and four co-defendants were arraigned on capital charges before a military judge in @entity8 , @entity9 , on saturday
the @entity11 administration claims that its improved military commission rules ensure a fair and credible trial
but outside the @entity15 , who will view a @entity15 military trial and potential execution of our enemies as credible ? doubters will have ample reason for skepticism : if there is indeed sufficient evidence of the defendants ' guilt , why not try them before the same civilian courts that try homegrown terrorists like @entity30 bomber @entity29 ? resorting to trial by military commission amounts to an admission that the government is unwilling to take the risk of proving the 9/11 defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , under the same rules that apply to trials of heinous criminals
if we want to hand @entity43 a re-energizing martyrdom , this may be a good way to do it
doubts will be magnified by the fact that the @entity11 administration initially planned to try the defendants in federal court in @entity49
it backed down only under intense political pressure
so the decision to try one of the most important crimes in @entity15 history before a military commission was made for reasons of politics , not justice
the @entity62 's military commissions web site is headlined , " @entity63
" all three are dubious
the rules overlook forests of unfairness for trees of trivia
for example , after the government held the 9/11 defendants incommunicado in @entity74 " black sites " for years , without access to lawyers , family or the @entity78 , and then imprisoned them without trial for five more years at @entity8 , it seems ludicrous that it had to arraign them in an unusual saturday session , in order to comply with a rule requiring their arraignment within 30 days of being charged
@entity86 also took a hit on saturday
during their long imprisonment , the 9/11 defendants say , they were repeatedly tortured or otherwise abused
@entity4 , for example , was subjected to " water board " torture 183 times , according to a former @entity74 official
yet none of this could be mentioned at the arraignment
one defendant refused to enter the courtroom voluntarily and so was brought in shackled to a chair
when his military defense counsel , capt. @entity102 , explained that his client was reacting to longstanding abuse , the audio feed to press observers in the @entity15 was cut
apparently @entity102 had dared to say the word " torture
" the military judge admonished him not to cross over the line of what could be said in open court
finally , and above all , justice will be cheated at this trial
for example , although the rules now prohibit admission of statements obtained by torture or by cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , the rules still allow admission of evidence derived from statements made under torture , so long as a military judge concludes that admission is " consistent with the interests of justice
" it did not have to be this way
there are better ways to reconcile the competing demands of justice for 9/11 victims and their families , versus justice for defendants who have been detained and allegedly brutalized for years in violation of standards recognized by international law
one way might have been to let the defendants pursue their torture claims through separate lawsuits against the @entity146 administration officials who authorized their alleged mistreatment
but @entity15 courts have blocked these lawsuits on the ground that the officials enjoy immunity from such suits
another way might have been to refer the 9/11 prosecutions to an international criminal court whose judgments would have more credibility in the world in general , and in the @entity161 world in particular
@entity15 officials have raised objections to the @entity164
but the @entity164 is not the only such court
the @entity15 has supported the @entity166 , where former @entity168 tyrant @entity167 was recently convicted , and the @entity169 , which has indicted individuals for the assassination in 2005 of former @entity173 prime minister @entity172
granted , every approach has its drawbacks
but the @entity15 has settled on the worst alternative of all : military trials
as a former lawyer in the @entity180 , i know that military trials -- of @entity15 service personnel -- can be scrupulously fair
however , as the common law maxim states , justice must not only be done , it must be seen to be done
in the long view of history , and around the world , justice will not be seen to be done if convictions and death sentences are imposed on our alleged enemies by a @entity15 military court
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .
