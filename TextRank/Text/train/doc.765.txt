it 's the same height as a four - story building
or three @entity5 double - decker buses
or , if your imagination will stretch that far , two @entity6 standing on each other 's shoulders
for @entity14 big wave hunter @entity12 , it 's also the size of a very different beast -- and one which she conquered with record - breaking skill and bravery in 2009
four years ago , the fearless surfer rode a monster 14 - meter wave in @entity22 , @entity23 -- the biggest swell ever surfed by a woman
it 's a feat that would make even the most experienced surfer quake in their boots
but in the notoriously male - dominated world of big wave surfing , this ballsy 26 - year - old is n't just keeping up with the men -- she 's giving them a run for their money
" the adrenalin is a huge part of it , " said @entity12
" it 's the ocean at its strongest
" " it 's really unique to be able to be in harmony with that , to be part of that crazy moment out there riding the waves , when most harbors shut down and everyone goes to shore
" a wild ride as the name suggests , big wave surfing is n't your average family - friendly pastime
instead , it is a dangerous extreme sport , requiring hefty equipment , specialized training in underwater breathing , and nerves of steel
riders are towed out to sea on jet skis , coming face - to - face with waves ranging from six - meters to 30 - meters , with the possibility of plunging up to 15 - meters below the surface if they come off their board
as 11 - time world champion surfer @entity74 recently admitted , big wave surfing " is a whole different ball game " to normal surfing , which had claimed the lives of many of his friends
but for daring @entity12 , it 's an obsession worth taking the risk for : " it 's such a rare process to get really big waves , for them to hit perfectly , " she said
" it 's such a special moment that you live for
whereas small waves you can surf everyday , they 're always out there
" young gun @entity12 grew up in @entity88 , the daughter of radical @entity91 politician @entity90 , who took part in the kidnap of @entity95 ambassador @entity94 in the 1960s
she started surfing at 14 , before moving to @entity97 and @entity98 in her late teens
at 18 @entity12 rode her first big wave in @entity98 , and admits that from that moment she was hooked
" it was pretty nerve wracking , " she said
" i knew already that i wanted to do that , but when i actually did it for the first time , and felt like i had gotten in that level of big waves , i felt really addicted
" with her famous father , striking looks , and record - breaking rides , @entity12 has since become one of the best known female surfers in the world , winning the prestigious @entity113 for @entity114 in 2009
science of surf for @entity117 , finding big waves has nothing to do with luck
it 's a fine science , involving reading complex weather maps -- and being prepared to fly across the world with just a day 's notice
" twenty years ago you had to be in @entity98 and spend six months of the year there , and when the swell came , the swell came , and you rode it , " said @entity117
" nowadays we have the internet and the forecasting and you get to choose where to go , when to go , and you get more opportunities to be in the right place at the right time
" as the technology behind predicting waves advances , so too does the equipment used to conquer them
@entity117 wears life jackets filled with oxygen cartridges , in case of emergencies
" in case something happens , i can pull a cord which breaks open the tube of @entity148 , " explained @entity12
" it inflates on my back and i get lifted up -- hopefully
" deep breaths one of the biggest dangers @entity117 faces is being held under water for two or more consecutive waves
the gutsy surfer must be prepared to hold her breath for minutes at a time , doing free diving training exercises in preparation
" i have a few great trainers who have taught me a lot about my breathing and how to exchange the @entity162 and not blackout , " said @entity12
but ultimately for @entity12 , surfing is more than a sport -- it 's art. " it 's self expression , everyone surfs differently , no wave is the same , " she said
" it takes me out of the real world and gives me a different perspective
