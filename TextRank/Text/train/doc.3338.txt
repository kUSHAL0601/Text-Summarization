-- with over 250 of the world 's leading galleries on show and in excess of 50,000 attendees , @entity1 can make a legitimate claim to being @entity9 's leading art fair
set against the city 's neon buzz , the annual four - day event -- which comes to a wrap on sunday -- is not just a big draw for the nation 's art - lovers , but a stampede of fashionistas , style spotters and unrepentant party - lovers alike
no surprise then that here , the blurred line between art and fashion fades into obscurity , with this year 's @entity1 taking their ever - incestuous mingling to new heights
for instance , @entity30 star @entity29 has designed a limited edition range of t - shirts and sandals to run alongside her exhibition and , in his @entity38 boutique , @entity36 exhibited five leather sculptures by @entity41 artist @entity40
meanwhile , @entity42 hosted a brunch to celebrate a limited edition collection of 45 t - shirts designed by artists like @entity47
and @entity48 hired @entity41 artisans to construct " @entity50 " — a beach house , originally designed by @entity53 architect @entity52 in 1934
they then shipped it to a beach in @entity38
" everyone in fashion is seeing @entity60 as an opportunity , " says @entity56 , the editor of @entity57 : @entity62 , the trends network at forecasting agency @entity64
" fashion brands are collaborating with artists more than ever
by being present at major international art fairs like @entity1 , brands get face time with a high concentration of high net - worths who are all here to buy art. " and shoes , sunglasses and handbags
@entity38 - based shoe brand @entity78 has launched a pop - up store in collaboration with @entity82
likewise @entity83 , the makers of eye wear for the jet - set , have released a range of sunglasses in @entity88 blue inspired by the artist 's archives
" it really is a brand fest here — all the major events are branded and there are tie - ups and collaborations for everything , " says @entity91 , who has been scouting art and design in @entity38 for several days
" it has become such a hotspot for luxury brands and the art crowd , " she added
handbags and history @entity60 is the most timely example of where art meets fashion , but the mingling of artists and designers is by no means a new phenomenon
back in the early 20th century , for instance , the @entity53 couturier @entity116 employed graphic artists such as @entity119 and @entity120 to create textile prints for his creations
between 1927 and 1954 , the @entity41 fashion designer @entity123 initiated the modern practice of collaborating with contemporary artists via her informal partnerships with @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129
@entity123 placed far less emphasis on the concept of ' collaboration ' -- a 21st - century label — and she did not prominently credit her artists as is common practice now
but the publicity this work received , particularly the ' lobster ' dress designed with @entity128 and later worn by @entity140 , set the trend for future collaborations between contemporary artists and fashion houses
the level of collaboration has always varied , and it still does today
at a basic level , a house may employ an artist for the purpose of decorating its staple products , such as leather goods , accessories and fabrics
in more involved collaborations , they may invite an artist to alter a product 's physical proportions , construction and style , or indeed imagine an entirely new product
but most collaborations merely involve a print that is sold or licensed for a negotiated price based on the status of the house and the size of the production , and then applied to the brand 's existing products
whatever the level of creative involvement on the part of the artist , such collaborations between art and fashion represent an important meeting of the two worlds
museums around the world have celebrated this and other important collaborations
in 2012 the @entity184 in @entity185 staged " impossible conversations , " an exhibition that featured @entity123 's work alongside that of contemporary @entity41 designer @entity189 , also known for her collaborations with visual artists
in 2010 , @entity193 in @entity185 recognized the modern - day proliferation of fashion -- art collaborations with " move ! " , a series of performances and installations by fourteen pairs of designers and artists , including @entity204 and @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 , and @entity208 and @entity209
mutual benefit the modern fashion industry is intensely profit driven
the fact that so many collaborative projects come to market indicates that luxury brands regard these initiatives as commercially viable
collaboration with an artist almost always takes the form of a one - off capsule collection
from @entity224 's 2012 illustrations for @entity226 t - shirts and bags to @entity229 's recent collection of scarfs for @entity231 , limited edition collections have an aura of authenticity normally associated with works of art. fashion consumers also equate exclusivity with luxury , and nothing is so desired as that which has sold out
the reception of @entity244 's 2003 collection for @entity48 -- one of the house 's most commercially successful special projects to date -- indicates this desire from consumers for something ' extra '
this sense of added value makes them more collectable
" you 're not just buying @entity48 , " says @entity254
" you 're buying a collectable piece which is connected to a specific year and will go up in value when sold as vintage
" the incorporation of visual art into a fashion item also adds an of - the - moment relevance that is especially important for historic luxury brands
it can bring an additional gravitas to functional product lines such as leather goods
just as there is mutual benefit , there is also mutual risk
fashion houses must invest money in an experimental collection that may not resonate with consumers
and the artists who collaborate with them risk being branded ' sellouts ' by their colleagues in the art world
however , the potential for wider exposure is often worth the risk
there are also benefits for society at large
for many consumers , a collaborative fashion project is the their first introduction to a particular artist 's work
it comes in a digestible form that -- unlike contemporary art -- does not require a strictly defined body of knowledge
it is open to anyone with the means to buy the products or the willingness to explore them via the media
in this way fashion collaborations widen public access to contemporary art and give them a cultural education via the cash register
@entity312 at @entity60 or a @entity314 catwalk , long may it continue
