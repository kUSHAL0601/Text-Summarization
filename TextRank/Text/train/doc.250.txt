@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 fired back at @entity3 on wednesday after it said three shots from the @entity3 hit waters close to the maritime border
there were no casualties reported , the @entity1 defense ministry said
tensions between the neighbors heightened last year after 50 @entity1 were killed in two separate incidents
in november , the @entity1 accused @entity3 of shelling @entity13 , near the border between the two sides
the incident killed two @entity1 marines and two civilians
@entity3 said the shelling was in retaliation for the @entity1 's navy firing into @entity23 waters
and in march 2010 , @entity1 accused the @entity3 of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships , killing 46 sailors
@entity3 denies attacking the warship @entity29 , though a @entity0 - led international investigation found that a @entity3 mini-submarine responsible
tensions remained high after talks between @entity3 and @entity1 collapsed in february when the two sides failed to reach an agreement on securing high - level military discussions .
