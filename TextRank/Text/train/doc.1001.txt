@entity0 , @entity1 -- dark - haired and swaddled in a white blanket , baby @entity3 is just 24 hours old , the picture of innocence in her grandmother 's arms
but the world she has been born into is anything but innocent
her mother gave birth to her in a makeshift shelter in the besieged @entity1 city of @entity0 , the heart of the uprising against president @entity18 's regime
her mother , 19 , has no painkillers and could not sleep after giving birth , she said , still in excruciating pain
@entity3 's father does not know his child has been born -- a month ago , he left the wood - cutting factory that has been turned into a makeshift bunker
he was going for supplies and has not been able to return , his wife says
@entity3 's father may live to see her , but two great - uncles will not , her grandmother says
both men were detained and returned as mutilated corpses
as she describes what happened to one of her brothers , her voice trembling , the grandmother grabs her head , wrapped in a black headscarf , and twists it to suggest a neck being broken
she shows a photograph of the battered body of her other brother , the state of the corpse horrific
@entity45 is one of at least two dozen children holed up with mothers , grandmothers and other relatives in this makeshift shelter in the @entity0 neighborhood of @entity0
government forces have been shelling @entity0 since early february
the families in the shelter have found relative safety but little comfort
" we 're not sleeping at night , we 're not sleeping during the day , " one mother howls , clad head to toe in black with her face covered by a niqab , an @entity65 veil showing only her eyes
" the children are always crying ; the bombs are coming down like this , " she laments , waving her arms for emphasis
they huddle in near darkness , some covering their faces as they speak to me , afraid of losing more than they already have if the government learns who they are
the room is filled with endless stories of death and despair
one woman says her son has been detained since the end of august
another says her son also has been held a month and a half
a woman named @entity89 says her brother and husband were killed when a round hit their home 10 days ago , but she can hardly pause to grieve
" i have to keep going , " she says
" i have to live for my children
" the families in the shelter survive on rice and lentils taken from a nearby government warehouse , but supplies are running low
activists gather about two dozen children for the camera and lead a song against the regime
but the little ones are hard to comfort
" my husband died on the first day of the bombing
they did n't let me see his body ; it was shredded to pieces
his blood is still in the streets , " says @entity112 , one of the mothers
but her focus now is on her son
she says he is sick with a fever , and there 's no medicine
" he keeps crying and saying , ' i want daddy , i want daddy
' i ca n't bring his daddy back , " she says , demanding to know why the world is not coming to their aid
" what is the world waiting for ? for us to die of hunger and fear ? "
