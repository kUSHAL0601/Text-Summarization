@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 has accepted a draft agreement that calls for some uranium produced in @entity4 to be sent abroad for further enrichment , an @entity4 diplomat said wednesday
@entity8 says the agreement is a " balanced " approach to the problem
" in principle we have in fact accepted this offer for this @entity17 ... reactor in spite of the fact that we are capable of producing the fuel , " @entity12 told @entity2 's @entity13 in @entity0
" but we decided to welcome this offer in order not only to show our transparency and cooperation but prove that all activities are for exclusively peaceful purposes
" @entity12 is @entity4 's ambassador to the @entity29 ' nuclear watchdog , the @entity30
he spoke shortly after concluding three days of discussions at the @entity30 's headquarters here with representatives from the @entity29 , @entity34 , @entity35 , and the @entity36
the draft agreement is " the summary of the discussions that we have had " since monday , which @entity12 described as " elaborating on all aspects of this project for fuel for @entity17 's reactor , " @entity12 said
he and the other representatives from @entity34 , @entity35 , and the @entity36 are taking the draft agreement to their respective governments for approval
@entity30 chief @entity8 has given all the representatives until friday to say whether they will sign the agreement , which @entity8 described as " a balanced approach to the problem
" @entity12 would not elaborate on the draft agreement until it is finalized , but he told @entity2 that @entity4 plans to continue its uranium enrichment program at its @entity58 nuclear power plant
the delegates hammered out the details of a tentative deal reached in early october which calls for low - enriched uranium produced in @entity4 to be sent abroad for further enrichment and then returned for use in medical research and treatment
@entity17 says its nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes
but many in the @entity71 believe @entity4 is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities
the @entity75 administration is working on a substantial sanctions package against @entity4 in case current diplomatic efforts to curb its nuclear program fail , top officials told @entity79 earlier this month
from @entity2 's @entity13 in @entity0 , @entity1
