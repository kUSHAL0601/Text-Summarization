-- @entity1 has clearly kicked up a hornet 's nest with its downright insulting cover headlined " @entity5 , " and coupled with the blurb , " it 's nearly impossible to fire a bad teacher
some tech millionaires may have found a way to change that
" the cover is a slap in the face to every teacher who has dedicated his or her life to bettering the lives of children
right now , we should be lifting up and championing educators
the last thing we should be doing is discouraging or dampening the enthusiasm of a new generation
worse , the @entity1 story gives sloppy credence to the well - funded , well - orchestrated attacks from a small cadre of wealthy business interests , many of whom have never even set foot in a classroom
these attacks on public education , educators and neighborhood schools have unfortunately become the norm
it 's gone too far
due process policies such as tenure are put in place to protect good teachers from being fired without cause
they are n't there to protect " bad " teachers
in fact , research from economist @entity50 suggests removing tenure might worsen educational outcomes because it would eliminate one of the major attractions to the profession
and since one of the biggest challenges in public education these days is teacher retention and recruitment , abolishing tenure could be incredibly harmful
recently , democrats for @entity64 was formed to show that @entity63 remain united around a core set of principles
as a co-chair , i 've seen how in just two months after officially launching , scores of elected officials , activists and party leaders in all 50 states have signed up to join our organization as supporters
they understand it 's time we collectively push back against efforts to undermine our schools , our teachers and the children themselves
@entity83 conducted a poll with @entity85 , a @entity86 - based firm that worked on president @entity88 's historic 2008 election and 2012 re-election
the poll shows voters support public education in resoundingly large numbers
roughly two thirds of @entity95 agree with traditionally @entity63 positions when it comes to education
i 've seen an awful lot of polling through the years
and there is n't a profession out there that would n't love to have the kind of favorability numbers enjoyed by local public schools and teachers in this survey
moreover , any campaign manager would give his or her eye teeth for their candidate to have these results and engender these warm feelings among the masses
contrary to what some naysayers -- and magazine covers -- continue to hawk , the @entity95 people are proud of their public schools
and they 're proud of their teachers , too
overall , 82 % of voters able to rate their local teachers believe them to be excellent , very good or good
so , even though we 've seen lawsuits from @entity131 to @entity134 scapegoating " bad teachers , " the divisive views espoused by @entity127 and @entity128 simply are n't rooted in public opinion
when presented with four broad reasons as to why public schools are n't performing better , almost no one puts the blame on " bad teachers
" instead , 40 % cite a lack of parental involvement / support
another 29 % name inadequate funding and resources for public schools
and 18 % peg it on the effects of poverty , hardships and problems kids bring to school
only a mere 3 % uttered the words " bad teachers " -- including 4 % of @entity154 and 3 % of conservatives
the truth is that voters support their teachers , who are the furthest thing from " rotten apples
" rock - solid majorities ( 61 % ) back additional funding for public schools , including 79 % of @entity63 and 57 % of independents
in fact , even 45 % of @entity154 hold this belief
it 's no surprise that voters of all stripes are fed up with @entity154 cuts to education across the country hurting children and neighborhood schools
in 2010 , a slew of obstructionist governors swept into statehouses on the @entity179 wave
over the past four years , in @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and other states , we 've seen -- and felt -- drastic cuts in funding for public education
unfortunately , this year , far too many @entity63 have largely avoided this issue out of a mistaken fear that running on a pro-public education platform would be a far too risky topic for their campaigns
turns out these @entity63 are just plain wrong
they 're missing a golden opportunity to highlight this important issue
the good news is that there is still time over this final week of the campaign season
throughout the country , there are opportunities to shine a lantern on these dramatic cuts , ehether it 's gov. @entity208 slicing education funding by $ 1 billion in @entity183 or gov. @entity210 , who made the biggest cuts to education in @entity181 's history
in @entity184 , gov. @entity214 cut education by more than $ 1 billion
in @entity186 , gov. @entity216 proposed cuts to public school funding by 4 % , or about $ 470 per student
there is no doubt that @entity95 are feeling this sting in their public schools
in @entity227 , sen. @entity225 , a @entity226 , has impressively and smartly utilized education as a main issue in her campaign
she 's hammered her @entity154 challenger for gutting education when he was the @entity154 ringleader in the @entity233
in fact , @entity225 used the exact term " gutting education " four times as a cudgel in a recent debate
and that 's because she knows this is an issue that resonates with voters and is keenly felt on the ground in a tangible way
over the years , i 've worked for and alongside the @entity247 and @entity248
that 's because i am proud of our public school teachers -- including my niece who teaches down in @entity253 -- just as i am proud of our nation 's education system
those who slam public education and educators are simply out - of - touch
and the numbers bear this out
the information from this new @entity83 survey could and should be used as a roadmap for those who want to speak out loud and clear in support of neighborhood schools and public education
not only for the stretch run of the 2014 campaign trail , but beyond .
