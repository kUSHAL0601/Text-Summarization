@entity0 -- the new @entity2 is still a month and a half away from being seated , but the battle for the next @entity2 is already heating up
and the fight for the 2014 @entity5 may end up being the most compelling storyline as the dawn of the midterm campaign approaches
after failing to take advantage of a golden opportunity to win back control of the chamber this year , the @entity9 gets another chance in 2014
the democrats , with big victories in the 2008 election , will be defending 20 of the 33 @entity5 seats up for grabs in 2014
if it sounds familiar , it is
thanks to their success in the 2006 midterms , the @entity15 defended 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs last week
in fact , they expanded their majority by at least one seat and probably two -- depending on which party @entity27 , the senator - elect from @entity29 , caucuses with -- from their current 53 - 47 majority
analysis : it 's never too early to talk about 2016 " it would be easy for someone to say the @entity15 ' were on the defensive in 2012 and they did just fine , ' but i do n't think any two election cycles are exactly the same
we have to see what the political environment looks like ; we have to see what candidates and nominees emerge ; we have to see what kind of retirements we have
those are the factors that play into how successful a party will ultimately be in the upcoming election , " says @entity48 , deputy editor of the non-partisan @entity49
and the current lame - duck session between now and the end of the year could also impact the next election
difficult votes on avoiding the fiscal cliff in 2012 could come back to haunt some senators facing difficult primary or general election challenges in 2014
among the most vulnerable @entity62 senators up for re-election in 2014 are ( in alphabetical order ) : @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 of @entity68 , @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 of @entity72 , @entity73 of @entity74 and @entity75 of @entity76
democrats may also have some open seats to defend
sen. @entity79 of @entity80 is an obvious candidate to retire
he 'll be 90 by november 2014
and @entity81 of @entity82 will be 77 by the midterms
republicans and @entity15 proclaim optimism on fiscal cliff deal " there are some vulnerabilities on the @entity62 side , but a lot of it depends on how popular the president is in the midterms and the quality of the @entity9 challengers against these @entity62 senators , " adds @entity48
a senior @entity9 strategist argues that president @entity98 's victory last week makes it tougher for some of those @entity15 facing challenging re-elections
" the irony of this past election is that if you 're @entity73 , @entity75 , @entity71 or other targeted @entity15 , it would have been easier for each of them politically if president @entity98 had not been re-elected
because the president 's liberal , big government agenda , and their longtime support for it , will undoubtedly play an even greater role in each of their races next cycle , " says the strategist , who spoke to @entity1 on the condition of anonymity
but the @entity119 , the group that focuses on getting @entity15 elected to the @entity5 , disagrees
" last week 's results proved that conventional wisdom is often wrong , especially two years out from @entity122
we 've proven we can win in red states , we can overcome steep spending deficits , and we can defy the odds even when the map is tilted against us
remember only two @entity62 incumbents have lost reelection in eight years , " @entity119 communications director @entity128 tells @entity1
opinion : conservatives , do n't despair the 2014 geography seems friendlier to the @entity9
of the 13 @entity9 seats up for grabs next november , only @entity134 of @entity29 comes from a state that 's not solidly red
the moderate @entity9 senator has n't said if she 'll retire or run for another term in 2014
some of the @entity9 up for re-election , including minority leader @entity141 , could face potential primary challenges
regardless , just holding onto their seats wo n't be enough for the @entity145
a big problem , of course , is that the last @entity9 primaries resulted in some extreme , combustible or un-electable @entity5 candidates , who have arguably cost the @entity9 five @entity5 seats over the past two cycles
that includes controversial comments about rape by rep. @entity155 of @entity156 and @entity158 treasurer @entity157 , who both lost their contests last week
" republicans openly acknowledge that they have a lot of soul searching to do right now
the party is at war with itself
even in more conservative areas of the country , voters reject the extremism and tea party ideology that has taken over the @entity9 , " suggests @entity128
the key for the @entity9 is if stronger , less controversial and more generally acceptable nominees emerge from their 2014 primary process
@entity175 on @entity176 " i think you can find common - sense conservative candidates who can appeal to primary and general election voters , " says another @entity9 strategist , adding this needs to come without the downside of those candidates saying some stupid things
for the @entity9 , the simple math of the next @entity5 means winning back the majority will be a tougher proposition in 2014 than it was this year
but @entity9 do have one thing in their favor : a midterm electorate
" if 2014 is similar to past midterm elections , the demographics of the people who turn out to vote will be very different from the electorate in the presidential elections of 2008 or 2012 , " says @entity1 polling director @entity192
" in midterms dating back to the 1990s , voters under the age of 30 represented 11 % -13 % of all voters , compared to 19 % this year
african - americans in past midterms have represented 9 % -11 % of all voters , compared to 13 % in 2012
so if history is any guide , the 2014 midterm electorate will be older and a bit whiter than this year , which could easily benefit @entity9 candidates , " adds @entity192
just like last cycle , we may not have to wait until @entity122 for the first @entity5 contest of 2014 and if that 's the case , we 'll have @entity213 to thank
the 2009 death of @entity62 sen. @entity215 forced a january 2010 special election , which @entity9 state sen. @entity217 won , in an upset
if @entity213 ' senior senator , @entity221 chairman @entity220 , is nominated as @entity98 's defense secretary or secretary of state for his second term , there would be another special election in that state
and that could provide an opening for @entity217 , who was just defeated last week , to make a comeback
moderate @entity15 eye midterms warily
