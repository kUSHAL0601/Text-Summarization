-- despite a miracle shot to join a four - man playoff , @entity1 ultimately was left to rue his failure to negotiate the notorious @entity5 at @entity6 as @entity7 claimed the @entity9 title sunday
looking to lead from start to finish , @entity1 endured a wayward final round 74 but after brilliantly scrambling a par three on the 15th still held the lead at 10 - under - par. an ugly double bogey at the 16th after he found the water and a bogey four on the par - 3 17th then all but ended his chances
the former world number one appeared to need an eagle three on the par - 5 to rekindle his victory hopes and from 245 yards hit an approach of laser - like accuracy over the water and to within 10 feet of the flag
playing partner @entity7 fluffed his chance to make a birdie four to get to nine under and @entity1 saw his eagle putt slide agonizingly wide
it left the pair tied at eight - under 272 with earlier finishers @entity29 of @entity30 and @entity32 @entity31 , who had missed a short par putt on the 18th , which would have given him outright victory
four - man playoff playing the 18th again as the first extra hole , @entity1 attempted to repeat his earlier approach shot but his effort went long and into the back bunker
he failed to get down in two shots and with @entity29 and @entity31 also having to settle for par fives , it left @entity7 a short putt to seal his second @entity46 victory with a birdie four
@entity1 , searching for his first win of the year after near misses in @entity49 and @entity50 , held a two - shot lead over @entity7 after starting the day on 12 - under
wayward play saw shots dribble away before he hit the three - hole @entity5 from 15th to the 17th , designed by golf legend @entity55
@entity7 , who had chipped in to join @entity1 at 10 - under on the 14th , made a hash of the short 15th himself , finding the water with his tee shot to make a double bogey
but he kept his nerve the better in the final analysis to land the $ 6 million @entity46 event
" i was fortunate that i was in the playoff , " @entity1 said
" i did n't play well enough at all down the stretch to win this tournament
" " it 's going to take a long time for this to sink in , " admitted @entity7
@entity70 injury scare earlier , world number one @entity70 was forced to withdraw during the final round with a back injury
woods , who has endured a difficult start to the year , shot a third round 65 , but was five - over through 13 holes when he left the course
@entity70 is scheduled to begin his defense of the @entity81 and it is only six weeks to the first major of the season at @entity85
a statement released by @entity70 said that his back had spasmed while warming up sunday , similar to the problem he suffered at @entity90 last year , but was still able to finish runner - up .
