@entity0 , @entity1 -- the helicopter is on the chase
at first , you can only hear it
then , from behind the hillside , you see a herd of wild horses running for their freedom , with the helicopter close behind
one escapes the trap , barely
this is the scene at the @entity19 wild horse roundup in @entity0 , @entity1
the helicopter pilot works for the federal government
the crowd is composed mainly of activists opposed to the roundups
more and more , the roundups are becoming showdowns between protesters and the @entity28
" they are by law supposed to protect these horses , and in fact they are doing the exact opposite -- they are exterminating them , " says @entity29 , founder of the advocacy group @entity30
" they are managing them to extinction
" @entity28 says this charge is not true , insisting there are more wild horses and burros today than there were in 1971 , when it started the roundup program
that year , fearing that the wild horses and small donkeys roaming the open ranges of the western @entity53 were disappearing , @entity49 decided to try to save them
a rare unanimous vote in 1971 directed the secretary of the interior to protect and manage these horses and burros , as much a part of the @entity59 as the cowboy
but as the number of animals began to grow , the program began to shift to population control
and that has triggered an outcry from wild - horse advocates , which really began to resonate in 2010
members of @entity49 and other wildlife organizations paid closer attention to the issue last year , because the bureau removed more horses and burros in 2010 than in nearly any other year
the bureau says there are about 33,700 wild horses and 4,700 burros roaming on @entity28 ranges in 10 western states
if they were left on their own , the population would explode , according to the bureau
the government 's plan is to reduce the number of animals by 12,000
that would leave about 26,600 horses and burros on the 26 million acres set aside for these animals to live , according to the @entity28
much of the public land on which the bureau manages the wild mustangs is also home to other wildlife and livestock
some of the land is used for recreational and mining interests
" we have to manage for all users , " says @entity101 , the head of @entity28 's @entity1 office
" we ca n't let one , say the horse , impact everybody else by taking all the feed , all the water
" after they are rounded up , some of the wild horses are trained by prisoners at nearby correctional facilities
once the horses are broken , the prison can auction them off for about $ 1,500 per animal
read more about the prisoner program the problem is n't the horses , says @entity119 , but the cattle that are allowed to graze on the same land
the @entity28 is charged with deciding how many wild horses should reside on each herd management area
at the @entity19 roundup , authorities decided that the 11,000 acres could support between seven and 10 horses
there were 117 horses on the property , so the @entity28 rounded up all the mustangs and then selected seven to release back into the wild
but how do they determine the ratio of horses to land ? activists insist that number of horses the government finds appropriate for the land -- which is based on water and food -- is not scientific
the study determining the number of horses that will remain in the @entity19 management area was done in the mid- 1990s
in addition , there is no water on the @entity19 land
the horses drink from water sources on adjacent state park land
when asked how @entity19 ever became a herd management area to begin with , @entity101 did not know
in @entity1 , there are just seven people handling 85 herd management areas covering millions of acres
" so , we are pretty thin , " admits @entity101
" it takes a lot of work to collect that data , a lot of time and effort , so we 're not as effective as we possibly could be
we hope to be better
" what is effective , according to @entity101 , is the use of helicopters in rounding up the horses and burros
" we can do our management in a quicker , shorter period of time that reduces that level of impact , " he says
the helicopters may reduce the time to round up the mustangs , but it gives activists another argument
" to be rounded up in the way that it is done with helicopters , being run for miles and miles and miles -- it 's brutal , " says @entity119
" it 's barbaric and it does not need to be done this way
" her group has proposed a method where a water source would be fenced off and once the horses enter , the gate would be closed behind them
many activists opposed to the use of helicopters point to a roundup earlier this year known as " @entity199 , " in which more than 100 horses died
activists attribute the deaths to the running of the horses in the cold over hard ground
the @entity28 insists most of the deaths were mares that could not adapt to the hay they were fed after they were captured
the roundups are open to the public and those attending are usually members of a wild horse advocacy group
armed with cameras , they try to document what they call " inhumane " treatment of the wild horses
there is no disputing the incidents that are caught on tape when a helicopter skid bumps a horse or knocks a burro off its feet
" this is not a risk - free operation and yes , horses do get killed , " says @entity228 , spokesman for @entity28
but , he adds , " we have a very low mortality rate of less than 1 % from gather - related deaths
" @entity228 says the activists would oppose the roundups even if there were n't any injuries , because they just want the management of the horses to stop
ever since the problems during the @entity244 , the fight between the two groups has intensified
when pressed about horses being injured by helicopter skids , @entity228 goes on the defensive
" it sounds like you bought into their point of view , " he says
an objective view was hard to obtain during the @entity19 roundup , since the media were kept about a quarter of a mile away from where the horses were being corralled
@entity101 says the safety of the horses and the men rounding them up is his first priority
the reason we were kept so far away , says @entity101 , is because if we were any closer , our cameras might spook the horses
" they do not want the issue on camera
period , " says @entity268 , the founder of @entity269 , pointing out how the horses are already spooked by the helicopter
the question of access is currently an issue in a court case bought by a wild - horse advocate
many of the activists ' issues pertaining to the roundups have been brought into the courts , most unsuccessfully
they also hold protests , some as far away as @entity284
there have also been calls for president @entity287 to impose a moratorium on the roundup
the only real progress thus far for the activists came from a group of members of @entity49 , who encouraged the bureau to ask for an independent study of its @entity297 and @entity296
it will take the @entity299 two years to complete its assessment
in the meantime , the wild mustangs of the @entity59 will continue to be rounded up
the activists say they will continue to be on hand , cheering for the ones that get away -- even if , like the one who dodged the trap at @entity19 , their freedom lasts only a few more minutes
