most of us can clearly recall where we were on december 26 , 2004 , when a massive earthquake off the northern coast of @entity6 , @entity3 triggered a deadly tsunami that swept across the @entity8 , killing more than 226,000 people and causing massive destruction along coastal areas of 14 countries
the tsunami caused one of the worst natural disasters in recent memory , as its full horror unfolded on tv screens around the world
ten years on , it is important to reflect on what the tsunami has taught us and whether these communities are any safer from such disasters
one clear lesson reinforced by the tsunami has been the importance of investing in disaster risk reduction ( @entity27 ) at both global and local levels
in january 2005 , @entity29 ( @entity30 ) -- a global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts with a ten - year plan -- was adopted by 168 governments
its goal was to substantially reduce disaster losses by 2015 by building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters
in june 2006 , the @entity41 became active , consisting of 25 seismographic stations -- used to detect earthquakes early -- relaying information to 26 national tsunami information centers
this has resulted in timely evacuations of mass populations when alerts are sounded
removing red tape the tsunami also highlighted how weak legislation led to blockages and major coordination challenges in the delivery of international assistance
the @entity29 calls for improved legislation to facilitate international disaster response , an area where the @entity60 and @entity60 ( @entity60 ) has been working closely with governments through its disaster laws program
twelve countries in @entity64 have made , or are progressing towards , legislative or regulatory changes
these include @entity3 , where the @entity67 has revised its regulations relating to the participation of the international community in national emergencies
another example is the @entity73 , where , following @entity76 in 2013 , the government relaxed immigration requirements and established one - stop - shops to streamline the clearance process for incoming goods and equipment
but global and national initiatives need to go hand - in - hand with investment in locally driven approaches towards reducing risk
working with communities to help them be better prepared to face future disasters was the thread that ran through the @entity60 's recovery efforts after the tsunami
supporting the rebuilding of physical infrastructure , including 57,000 new homes , was one step , but establishing community based disaster risk management programs was equally important
@entity100 teams were set up in @entity101 , training was given to thousands of first - responders in @entity103 , and early warning systems -- using @entity105 -- were established across @entity3 alongside mangrove planting projects to reduce the impact of coastal flooding
the legacy of those initiatives lives on today
improving communication community participation and engagement in risk reduction is vital and the tsunami cast a spotlight on the need to improve accountability and two - way communication with crisis affected communities
in @entity123 , @entity3 , traditional and hi - tech approaches were used to enable people to raise questions or air concerns about the aid effort via community meetings , live radio and @entity130
such approaches have since become integral aspects of major operations and have proved essential in health promotion and social mobilization campaigns
next year , the @entity136 on @entity137 takes place in @entity139 where @entity30 will take shape
this represents a unique opportunity to re-focus attention on the need for greater investment in community level disaster risk reduction
this means recognizing that local people and organizations are first responders in emergencies ; understanding that they must be the drivers of change in their communities as they have the best understanding of the risks they face
it also means investing in strengthening the risk reduction capacities of local , city and regional authorities
while we ca n't prevent another tsunami , we do know that many people in harms way today are now more aware and better prepared to face future disasters
the challenge ahead remains how we align global and local action to safeguard future generations .
