@entity0 , @entity1 -- leaders of oil - rich eastern @entity1 declared it tuesday to be a semi-autonomous region and voted for a 79 - year - old former military man to lead it
" we 're talking about the whole eastern region of the country , " said @entity9 , a member of the ruling @entity10 , in a telephone interview with @entity2 from @entity12
speaking through an interpreter , he said he wanted the central government in @entity0 to continue to run such matters as defense and the treasury , but to leave health , education and " social things " to be managed by local governance in the region , once called @entity25
" we are not looking to split the country , " said @entity9 , 79 , who said he was jailed for 31 years during the regime of former @entity1 leader @entity27 for leading a failed coup d'etat in 1970
" we are not looking for division at all
our target is to keep @entity1 united
we are hoping to run our region
... we have the federal government , and we have the local government
" @entity35 said he was elected by 4,000 to 5,000 tribal leaders , politicians , activists and academics who met tuesday in @entity12
" all of them agreed on my leadership to lead the region for the time being , " he said
but a video posted monday on @entity45 indicated his support was less than unanimous
in it , scores of demonstrators chant , " @entity47 is the path to divisions , " " oh , great , @entity1 , do not accept divisions ! " and " @entity0 is the capital ! " @entity35 added that he had no interest in grabbing the oil wealth for the region 's residents at the expense of the rest of the country
" the oil is for all @entity1 people , " he said
" it would be written into the constitution
" he added that his first priority would be to stabilize the region
" security is a priority now , " he said
@entity35 said he had no immediate plan to resign from the @entity10
" i was thinking of resigning , but i got advice from some people that i should take some time to see the reactions of the @entity10 first
" that reaction came quickly
in a news conference tuesday in @entity0 , @entity10 chairman @entity72 denounced the declaration as a move to divide @entity1 , " a danger that threatens national unity
" he called on all @entity1 " to rally around the @entity10 that has international legitimacy
" he said the government and @entity10 are working to establish a decentralized state with more than 50 local councils
tuesday 's move in @entity12 " puts the country in danger because the international community will not allow @entity1 to be divided , unsafe and undemocratic , " he said
@entity2 's @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 contributed to this report .
