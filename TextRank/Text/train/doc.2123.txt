-- @entity2 's @entity1 has told @entity4 's @entity3 that @entity5 is still the fastest driver on the @entity7 grid
speaking ahead of the opening grand prix of the season in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity1 -- himself a double world champion -- believes that seven - time world champion @entity5 remains a cut above his rivals
" if @entity7 was 24 cars exactly the same , then @entity5 would be the driver i would fear most , " revealed @entity1
" if you look down the list of drivers on the grid for 2011 , then one name stands out above the rest , @entity5
" @entity5 is a seven - times world champion and is a legend in @entity7
we have to respect him because he has the ability and talent to do well this season
" despite not winning the drivers ' title since 2006 , @entity1 confirmed that should he retire without another championship to his name , he would still be more than happy with his career
" not many drivers have had the opportunity to win one world title , let alone two
i have already had nine years in @entity7 and hopefully have another six or seven to come , " added the @entity36
" i could spend nearly a quarter of my life in this wonderful sport , doing what i love to do , so i consider myself lucky and am very happy
" despite this , @entity1 confirmed that coming so close to his third world title last year , left him sad and frustrated
" the first three or four days after the end of the season were not the best for me , " @entity1 confirmed
" but i feel that @entity45 and @entity46 won the title rather than @entity2 losing it
" coming so close last year makes the team determined to go one better this time around , " he added
" everybody at @entity2 was devastated by the result at @entity51 last year but we are all very motivated now for 2011
